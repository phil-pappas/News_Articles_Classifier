Carmakers benefited from a drop in the euro on the prospect of more monetary stimulus, since a weaker euro typically makes European cars more affordable for overseas buyers. \nGermany's DAX was set to close its strongest week since end 2011 with a gain of more than 3 percent, helped by a rise in carmakers such as Daimler (Xetra: 710000 - news ) and BMW (Swiss: BMW.SW - news ) . \n\"The DAX is a big runner today, as it typically performs well on euro weakness,\" said Hance Markets analyst Richard Perry. \nEuropean stocks were also propped up by some solid earnings updates. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Norwegian insurer Gjensidige surged 13 percent after reporting third-quarter profits ahead of market expectations. \nFrench luxury goods group Kerning also rose 9.5 percent after reporting a dip in sales that was not as bad as some analysts had feared. \nHowever, Ericsson (Xetra: ERCA.DE - news ) fell 5.9 percent after its third-quarter revenue and profits missed market expectations, while shares in British broadband supplier TalkTalk slumped 2.2 percent after a cyber attack on its website. \nA.P. Moller-Maersk sank 5.6 percent after the shipping and oil giant cut its full-year outlook for underlying profit by 15 percent, citing deterioration in the container shipping market. \nNevertheless, according to data from Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) StarMine, 64 percent of companies on the European STOXX 600 index have so far have beaten or met market forecasts for the third quarter. \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:50:34.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
