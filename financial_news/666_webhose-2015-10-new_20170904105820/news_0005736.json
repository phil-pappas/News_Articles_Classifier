To not provide the basis for a well-informed choice could lead to the next major pensions misselling scandal. \nIt predicts that \"insufficient\" guidance will mean that millions of savers will suffer unexpected financial losses or run out of money too quickly if they use new the bank account-style pensions to access their cash. The freedoms, introduced in April, were designed to prevent savers feeling forced into buying annuities when they retire, instead giving them the option to take their entire savings, if they wish, as cash. \nWhile the Government has already promised to address rip-off fees on withdrawals, the MPs said it was ignoring some of the biggest threats that the new freedoms pose to savers. \nFrank Field, the chairman of the committee, said: \"These reforms have been in operation for six months now: it is evident that that has been long enough for the scammers to get going, working on defrauding people out of their life savings.\" \nHe added that the Treasury had failed to track whether people were being ripped off. \nExplained in one minute: how to boost your tax-free pension cash \n\"Reluctance to provide information about how a reform or service is working is rarely a good sign,\" he said. \"It is very difficult for the Government to support its claims that all is well, or for us to make any assessment of progress, when no data is forthcoming.\" \nThe report adds: \"To not provide the basis for a well-informed choice could lead to the next major pensions misselling scandal.\" \nSince April, a surge of older savers have cashed in their retirement money, with more than 200,000 people accessing their pension pots during the first three months of the scheme, more than double the number of the same period in 2013. \nBut because around 70 per cent of those retiring cannot afford or are unwilling to pay for financial advice, the committee is concerned that many will make bad choices and end up losing out. \nIt has asked the City watchdog to crack down on pension scams, which typically invite unsuspecting investors to buy assets such as fine wine or overseas property. \nEvidence suggests that even savvy savers have become more susceptible to con men and need protecting. \nThe report also recommended that PensionWise, the Government's free retirement guidance service for over-50s, should be redesigned as it is too \"narrow\". \nMPs said that it should take into account a full picture of people's wealth in the same way that a financial adviser would. \nThis would mean people discussing the details of their mortgages, other savings and investments, as well as their family arrangements. \nHuw Evans, director-general of the Association of British Insurers, the trade body that represents British pension firms, said: \"We agree with the committee that savers need much greater access to information, guidance and advice and look to the new Treasury/Financial Conduct Authority review to achieve this.\" \nA Treasury spokesman said: \"The Government has been absolutely clear that any attempt to exploit people who have worked hard and saved for their retirement is unacceptable, which is why we are working with police, regulators and other bodies to raise awareness and take action to protect consumers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:26:06.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
