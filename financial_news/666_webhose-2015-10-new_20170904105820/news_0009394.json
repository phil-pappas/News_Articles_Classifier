Click here for a real-time look at his insights and musings. \nCashing Out of Wells Fargo \nOriginally published at 11:16 AM EDT on October 8, 2015 I've previously sold the trading portions of my money-center-bank positions while maintaining my core investment holdings in the group. Well, in light of my negative market view and recent sale of select financials ( Oaktree Capital , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , etc.), I'm making a sacrifice to the bank gods and selling my entire Wells Fargo stake.\nWFC's valuation is high relative to the group, and I believe its earnings are exposed to disappointment relative to consensus over the next year if the U.S. housing market contracts (as I expect.)\nMoreover, persistent low rates disfavor any real recovery in net interest and net income at banks like Wells Fargo, which have large imbalances of rate-sensitive assets vs. rate-sensitive liabilities.\nAs a result, I expect WFC's year-over-year earnings-per-share growth for 2016 vs. 2015 to hit the low single digits in percentage terms, below the +7% to +8% consensus .\nThat said, I expect to continue to hold onto my other core money-center and regional-bank stocks. Indeed, I'll buy more Bank of America , Citigroup or JPMorgan Chase on any drops of 5% or so.\nPosition: Long BAC, FITB, FMER, RF, C, MSL, SONA, EFSC, STL, MBFI, JPM, BBT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:19:55.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
