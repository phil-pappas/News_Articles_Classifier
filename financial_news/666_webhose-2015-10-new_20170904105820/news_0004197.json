Banks would be required to search the database and notify the state of any names belonging to account holders. \nSome are worried the system would violate privacy or become vulnerable to access by other creditors. \nState Tax Commission Chairman John Valentine says the current process is expensive and many times does not succeed. \nCommittee approval last week puts the bill up for consideration by the full Legislature in January. \nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com \nThink your friends should see this?
