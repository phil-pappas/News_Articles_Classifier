The company’s CEO highlighted in the announcement the importance of the deal by saying, “This acquisition is a strategic fit as it broadens Deutsche Börse’s asset class spectrum.” \nGerman financial regulatory bodies and the antitrust watchdog have issued their approval to Deutsche Börse for the acquisition of 360T. The platform will remain regulated by BaFin and its existing management team will continue managing the subsidiary. In addition the CEO of 360T Carlo Kölzer will join Deutsche Börse’s Group Management Committee. \nBack in July, Deutsche Börse announced that it is buying the Frankfurt-based foreign exchange and OTC instruments trading platform for 725 million euros ($796 million). \nDeutsche Börse has decided to build its FX business around its new acquisition with the management of the subsidiary mandated to continue the development of the platform and lead an expansive effort into this new area for Deutsche Börse. \nThe management of Deutsche Börse has pointed out that the new ECN-type trading venue for FX spot which can also be used for derivatives instruments is one of the key synergies of the deal. \nDeutsche Börse’s CEO Carsten Kengeter elaborated, “360T’s impressive growth trajectory since its inception and its dynamically evolving position in the FX market makes it a substantial addition to broaden our asset class spectrum. It is a great strategic fit. The deal underpins part of our ambition to become the global market infrastructure provider of choice.” \nCommenting on the announcement the CEO of 360T, Carlo Kölzer, stated, “In a market where participants increasingly look for transparency, reduced capital costs, cutting edge trading and clearing solutions, our offering will be the most trustworthy and holistic one. The acquisition follows the trending FX industry logic towards global integrated infrastructure providers, adhering to the highest regulatory standards.” \nExisting legal agreements with and obligations of 360T will remain intact by its integration into Deutsche Börse.
