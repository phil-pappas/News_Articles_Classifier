Vince Caligiuri Share on twitter by Perry Williams Tabcorp has refuted Sportsbet's claim that it has pipped the 50-year old company to become Australia's biggest online wagering operator with Tabcorp saying it remains comfortably in pole position.\nSportsbet, owned by Irish giant Paddy Power, had turnover of €1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) in Australia for the six months to June 30, compared with Tabcorp's digital business turnover of $1.65 billion in the same period.\nThat led to Sportsbet claiming to be the largest of its type in Australia , passing Tabcorp's digital wagering business for the first time.\nBut Tabcorp's head of wagering, Craig Nugent, said the company was the leader on both a retail and digital basis despite Sportsbet's gains in the market.\n\"We are the number one digital operator and anyone who is telling you otherwise is wrong,\" Mr Nugent said in an interview. \"The last time we looked at the data we still had over 50 per cent of the Australian wagering market by revenue and digital is still growing by 20 per cent [a year]. The quantum of our digital sales are, as we understand it, higher than theirs [Sportsbet].\"\nMobile betting Sportsbet said its strong focus on mobile betting has won new customers along with its broadcasting of Victorian horse racing via its website. Mobile phone betting now accounts for 50 per cent of the business, compared with about 20 per cent five years ago.\nMore than half of all bets placed with Tabcorp are lodged via its retail network with digital accounting for an additional 25 per cent of bets, mostly via the TAB mobile phone app. Tabcorp said it will be promoting its mobile app over the spring period in a bid to reel in new customers.\nMr Nugent said the real strength of its offering is the combination of retail and digital to suit all customers.\n \"We have over 3000 individual retail points of sale in agencies and licensed venues. We're by far and away the largest operator in Australia and in fact we're one of the largest operators in the world,\" he said. \"We're focused on getting every customer we can any way we can and we think this is a really strong time for racing.\"\nTabcorp expects to generate more than $650 million in revenue over the seven main racing events during the spring carnival period in October and November. The firm predicts 10 million bets will be placed on the Melbourne Cup on November 3, peaking at 3000 transactions a second.\nSuspicious transactions Separately, Tabcorp on Tuesday said it is working with the government's counter-terrorism financing regulator as it battles a potential Federal Court trial and $17 million fine over suspicious transactions.\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) – a government body that seeks to keep \"dirty money\" out of Australia's financial system – in July alleged more than 100 separate breaches of the law by Tabcorp , including an incident of a betting plunge on an NRL Cowboys versus Bulldogs game in 2010 that caused bookmakers to suspend betting.\nTabcorp said it had filed its defence in line with an October 13 deadline and noted the court hearing is scheduled for September 2016.\n\"Tabcorp has been actively managing these matters in consultation with Austrac,\" Tabcorp said in a statement to the ASX. \"Tabcorp remains committed to achieving the highest levels of regulatory compliance and is well advanced on a program of works that will deliver this.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:02:17.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
