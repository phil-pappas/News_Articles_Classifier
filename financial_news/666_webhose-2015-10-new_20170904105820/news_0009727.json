They're much more dangerous when they're illegal.\"\nThe current legislation, which expires June 30, regulates lenders that offer short-term credit to people who typically borrow smaller sums.\nIn Alberta, the companies can charge up to $23 of interest for every $100 borrowed, and if people don't pay back the full amount on time, interest charges can mount substantially. Alberta's rate is the second highest in Canada, only behind Prince Edward Island which allows $25.\nManitoba is the lowest at $17 per $100.\nIn tough economic times some Alberta families turn to payday loan services to help them deal with financial challenges, said Bilous, who added that the review will ensure \"vulnerable families aren't being taken advantage of.\"\nThe minister said there is a need for payday loan companies, but he wouldn't say whether there are lenders who take advantage of the less fortunate.\n\"There are Albertans who get a short-term loan which turns out to be an ongoing cycle, and a revolving door and we want to look at ensuring Albertans have the tools to find short-term loans when they need it to fill that stop-gap â€” but not to put them onto a perpetual (debt) cycle.\"\nThe review is to begin with an online survey and then move to meetings with payday loan users, industry members and community organizations that provide support to low-income Albertans.\nJeff Loomis, executive director of Momentum, a community development organization that works with low-income Albertans, said not all providers are the same.\n\"I would say that some of the payday loan companies are a little bit better than others and the business model definitely can create a debt trap.\"\nAlberta Liberal Leader David Swann, who was at the announcement, said a review is necessary.\n\"I think we're all concerned there is gouging going on and unnecessary profit-taking,\" said Swann. \"It's what we used to call usury and that is why we need to look at this, especially when we're among the highest in the country.\"\nOnce the review is complete, any draft amendments are to be introduced in the Alberta legislature next spring.\nFollow @BillGraveland on Twitter\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:24:59.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
