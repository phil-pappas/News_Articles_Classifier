The union made a similar threat in recent discussions with Fiat Chrysler before agreeing to a new four-year contract.\nGM said Saturday it is working with the UAW and remains committed to reaching \"an agreement that is good for employees and the business.\"\nThe UAW has already reached a contract agreement with Fiat Chrysler.\nUAW President Dennis Williams said after that deal that General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. make more money and should be able to pay more. That conflicts with company goals of cutting labor costs, bringing them closer to foreign automakers with U.S. factories.\nAutomotive Industry General Motors United Auto Workers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:17:43.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
