Glencore announced late last week it would suspend 500,000 tons of annual zinc output, triggering a 12-percent rally on Friday, the biggest ever one-day gain.\nWhile Naica represents a much smaller loss, the move illustrates the deepening pain for producers as they battle weak prices.\nPenoles said it had reached the decision after nine months of trying to clear enough water from the mine to reopen it, and that it was now in talks with the local miners' union to put an end to the collective work contract at the site.\nThe Naica move follows a series of other big mine closures earlier this year including MMG's huge Century zinc mine in Australia, and Ireland's Lisheen, owned by India's Vedanta.
