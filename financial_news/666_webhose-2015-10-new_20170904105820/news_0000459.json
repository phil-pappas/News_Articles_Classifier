The U.S. currency was still poised to lose 0.9 percent this week.\nThe New Zealand and Australian dollars lost some lift as they ran into profit taking after two days of large gains.\nThe kiwi inched down 0.2 percent to $0.6835 after flying to a 3-month high of $0.6897 earlier this week on expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand might pause in cutting rates.\nThe Aussie was down 0.5 percent at $0.7292. It was still on track to gain 0.5 percent on the week, having drawn support from firmer commodity prices and growing doubts the Fed will raise rates this year.
