On October 5th, as part of its routine disclosure of upcoming cases, the Court declined to take up a petition related to insider trading. The Justice Department had wanted it to overturn an appeals court’s decision in December to throw out the conviction of two hedge-fund managers. That means the decision will now stand, setting an important legal precedent.\nThis is not only a blow to Preet Bharara, the federal prosecutor with jurisdiction over Wall Street who had brought the original case, but also an attack on an aggressive and—up to that point—successful approach to insider trading. Since his appointment in 2009 as the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mr Bharara’s office has had a remarkable record in insider-trading cases: 87 findings of guilt, and only one acquittal.\nIn this section Weighing anchor No TEE, thank you Grey days Friends without benefits Oily food The pause before fast-forward Two’s a crowd Journalist wanted Quantitative frightening Business Financial markets Investment funds Hedge funds\nThis record is all the more impressive given the stature, connections and legal resources of the defendants. Among the most prominent were Rajat Gupta, who sat on the boards of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, and once led McKinsey, a consultancy; Raj Rajaratnam, head of Galleon, once among America’s largest hedge funds; and eight employees of SAC Capital, another top-tier hedge fund. All were sentenced to jail.\nNow the courts have done what defendants failed to do—put Mr Bharara on the defensive. The two hedge-fund managers whose case was thrown out—Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson—were accused of being members of a circle that involved analysts at fund managers, employees at Dell and NVIDIA, two technology firms, and others. Information about upcoming quarterly earnings was passed through the network. That proved to be extremely valuable, resulting in $4m in profits for Mr Newman and $68m for Mr Chiasson. As damaging as this may have appeared, it was diluted by testimony, cited in the appeals-court opinion, indicating that, to at least a limited extent, the sharing of special information between large funds and investor-relations departments is common.\nUnder the standard imposed by the appeals court, prosecutors must henceforth show that the person providing the inside information received a “direct personal benefit”. That is a shift from what Mr Bharara’s team had claimed was sufficient: showing that the recipient could profit from the information, and was a friend or family member of the person providing it. The “benefit”, in short, came from merely providing something of value to someone the provider valued.\nMr Bharara has said he believes that 90% of the prior convictions will stand under the new rules. But that still raises questions about not only past cases but also those yet to come. Thirteen are pending and others surely in development.\nA second component of the appeals-court decision was that prosecutors must show that the recipient of the information was both aware that the information came from someone who had an obligation not to provide it, and that the recipient was aware that the provider received a benefit. That was not challenged in the government’s appeal, but has nonetheless rattled prosecutors: if confidential information is passed along a chain of people, the chances grow that this test will not be met.\n“There’s a category of conduct that arguably will go unpunished going forward,” said Mr Bharara in response to the Supreme Court’s decision. “This creates an obvious road map for unscrupulous behaviour.” Under the new standards, he added, a chief executive with access to material, non-published information could pass it along, knowing it could be worth millions of dollars to the recipient, yet possibly avoid prosecution because he was not explicitly compensated.\nMr Bharara predicts that the consequences could harm the “integrity” of the markets. Perhaps. Investing has always been, to at least some degree, about finding and using information that others do not have. Insider-trading cases are typically full of grey areas. But one thing in this legal back-and-forth could not be clearer: by sitting on their hands, the justices of the Supreme Court have taken the shine off the hitherto glittering record of Wall Street’s prosecutor-in-chief.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20151010_FND002_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:10:52.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
