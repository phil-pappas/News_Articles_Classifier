REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann ZURICH (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) unit Sandoz's regulatory submission for approval of a biosimilar to Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) blockbuster Enbrel drug, the Swiss drugmaker said on Friday.\nEtanercept, the drug's generic name, is a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor. \nSandoz is seeking approval for all indications included in the label of the reference product, which is used to treat a range of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, it said in a statement.\nNovartis last month launched the first biosimilar drug in the United States after a U.S. appeals court declined to stop the sale of the company's copycat version of Amgen's blockbuster cancer drug Neupogen.\nWhile biosimilars aim to copy biologic products, which are made inside living cells, they are not considered exact duplicates, such as generic versions of more traditional pills.\nInsurers hope biosimilars will cost the public 40 percent to 50 percent less than the original brands.\n\"Sandoz believes that the totality of evidence in its submission, including two pivotal clinical studies, will demonstrate that the proposed biosimilar is essentially the same as the reference product,\" Novartis said on Friday. \nIt said it believed it was the first company to receive FDA file acceptance of a biosimilar version of etanercept.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Anand Basu and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\nHealth Care Industry Novartis AG Amgen Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:31:41.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
