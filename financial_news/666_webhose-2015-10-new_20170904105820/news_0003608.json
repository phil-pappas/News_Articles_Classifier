During a playing career of 19 years, he won 15 England caps, is the second-highest goal scorer in Premier League history, and played for Arsenal, Manchester United (NYSE: MANU - news ) , and Blackburn Rovers among other clubs. He is married to Shirley, and has a son, Devante, who is a professional football player for Bradford City AFC, and a daughter, Faith, 14. He lives in Cheshire. \n= How did your childhood influence your work ethic and attitude to money? = \nHugely. My mother and father are first-generation migrants from the Caribbean, and lived in Lenton, Nottingham, where my dad was a miner. I am one of eight children. Money was very tight when I was young, but we got through. I was always keen on sport and played football when I was growing up. I remember trying to do a paper round once, for pocket money, but getting up so early didn’t suit me at all. \nI managed to get a place at the FA’s Lilleshall School of Excellence when I was 14. Leaving home at that age was tough, but it helped me hugely in terms of my development. I was lucky enough to be signed to Arsenal as a schoolboy. From then on, that was all I was ever going to do. \nI’m the only one from my family who is a professional sportsperson. I was taught to work hard and to make something of myself, and that work ethic has been with me all my life. \n= Have you ever worried about how to pay the bills? = \nYes. I bought an apartment in my early 20s when I was living in London and had signed with Arsenal. I didn’t realise how much an apartment would cost to run in terms of maintenance fees, and things were tight for a while. I had a high mortgage to pay too. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was an eye-opening experience. \n= Did you have a sports agent then? = \nNo. Back then, the situation with agents was different. They were only interested in established players. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) everyone gets an agent from a young age. I had to negotiate my own contract with Arsenal. Obviously I didn’t get the best deal at the time, as I wouldn’t have been struggling to pay my bills. \n• David Gower: 'Losing £50k on a golf course was an investment lesson' \n• Phil Vickery: 'I earned £12,000 a year while I played for England' \n= Were you aware of your earning potential as a player? = \nTo be honest, I never played professional football to make loads of money. I wanted to play because I loved playing. Scoring goals, winning matches and playing for the best teams were my aims. I didn’t really realise how much money you could make. The money is a nice add-on to doing something that you love. \n= After you got an agent, did things improve in terms of wages? = \nYes. It is a lot easier when someone else is negotiating on your behalf. You can feel a little embarrassed doing it yourself, thinking you might be asking for too much or too little. An agent has no scruples. He can get you what he wants. I did very well when I was at Man United and I did very well when I left to go to Blackburn. I was fortunate. I was at the peak of my earning powers. If you leave a certain club, you can demand a bit extra. I won’t say what I was earning, but it was a decent amount of money. \n= Most lucrative work? = \nPlaying at the highest level. But you have the endorsements as well, for say, a boot company. The game was getting more commercial in the Nineties, but it has changed hugely since my early days of playing. \n= What was your best business decision? = \nInvesting in property. I have a couple in London, a couple overseas and one in Nottingham. Two of those are buy-to-lets. I don’t think you can go wrong with investing in bricks and mortar. \n= And what has been your worst financial decision? = \nI can’t think of a decision, but I’ve certainly been advised badly at times with my finances. I have trusted people who have said they are acting in my best interests. It is only later I discovered that they haven’t done what they said they were going to. \n= You recorded a single, 'Outstanding' (see below), in 2008? Did that make money? = \nI didn’t do that to make money; it was just a bit of fun. It didn’t make any difference to me financially. I didn’t put anything in. It was just a case of enjoying it and having a laugh. \n= Are you more of a spender or a saver? = \nI’m a bit of both. I’m at the stage now where I save as much as possible for the children. I’ve never been one for splashing the cash. I think when you are young you want a nice car and that but I never went overboard in being flash or anything. You have to plan for your future, as it is a very short career. Whatever it says in the media that footballers do this or footballers do that, not every footballer is exactly the same. \n= Are you naturally good with money or do you have to work at it? = \nI am average, I think. My wife is more tuned into looking after money than I am. I check what is in my personal bank account from time to time. \n= What’s been the most difficult lesson you’ve learnt about money or business? = \nGetting the right advice at the right time seems to be the thing that has come up a few times in life. \n= = \n= What kind of work do you do now? = \nI’m the major shareholder in a restaurant called M. The first branch opened in the City last year; the second branch opens in Victoria later this year. I’m pretty excited about it. It is the first business of this kind I’ve put money into, which I did via the Enterprise Investment Scheme. I’m also working with Manchester United as an ambassador, plus I have media work too. \n= Do you prefer to pay by debit, credit or cash? = \nI carry about £200 on me, and will use cash when I can. Debit is easy and convenient. If I use a credit card, I always pay off the balance straight away. I bank with HSBC. \n= Do you have a personal pension or long-term financial strategy? = \nBoth. I was advised to take out a pension as a football player early on. My financial strategy is to earn and keep on working to leave as much money as possible to my children eventually. My daughter is still at school and I pay for her fees. \n• Reader service: Find out more about Telegraph Investor \n= What are your financial priorities for the next five to 10 years? = \nKeep going with my interests, working within football. I doubt I will buy more properties. \n= Do you meet regularly with or use a financial adviser? = \nI am in the process of changing my adviser. I am optimistic that I’ve now found a good one. \n= Are you a good tipper? = \nYes, of course. I tip very well for good service, but only the minimum tip if the service isn’t so good. Nine times out of 10 in a restaurant, the service is included in the bill, which I believe is wrong. \n= Do you invest in stocks and shares? = \nNo. I don’t really know a lot about it to be honest. \n= If there was one thing you could change about the financial world, what would that be? = \nBanks have to be accountable for what they do. They have to give the right information to customers, that is their job. \n= Do you give regularly to charity? = \nI started my own charity a long time ago, but I dissolved it because I found out the money I was making for the charity wasn’t going to where I thought it was. \nManchester United has its own charity, which I get involved with every season. They raise money for Unicef and the Manchester United Foundation, which I am very happy to be a part of. \n= Is there anything you don’t like about handling money? = \nYes. To me, it is a headache, it is a drama. Money is a man-made problem that causes problems. \n= Do you bank online? = \nYes, of course. The internet makes things very easy. \n== \n= Does money make you happy in your opinion? = \nNo. Far from it. Does it make you any happier? No. Does it bring you health? No. Money is what you want to make it to be. \n• Andy Cole’s restaurant group, M, will open its second site in Victoria this autumn.
