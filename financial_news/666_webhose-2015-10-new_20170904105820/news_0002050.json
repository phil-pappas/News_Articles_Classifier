They showed rates for a sweetened proposed contract of 55% to unanimous approval, which compared to 65% that turned down the first proposal. \nResults of the voting could come later Thursday. Once the agreement was ratified, the union would begin negotiations with Ford   ( F - Get Report )  or  General Motors ( GM - Get Report ) . \n\nNewer workers were dissatisfied with the first proposal , insisting on further narrowing of the gap between their wages and those of veteran workers. In 2007, the UAW agreed to a lower tier of wages for new hires in order to relieve financial pressure on the Detroit-based automakers. The latest proposal omits the idea of a health-care trust to lower medical costs. \n\"I think the second version of the tentative agreement addressed many of the workers' concerns and that's evident in their strong ratification,\" Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry and labor group at the Center for Automotive Research,  told the Detroit News . \"There was a clearer path to top-tier wages for the current second-tier workers.\" \nThe conclusion of a contract without a strike and with little rancor would be a victory of sorts for both parties. The UAW is eager to convey an image as a reasonable partner with automotive management, which might help it achieve the goal of organizing non-union plants in the southern U.S. FCA wanted to avoid a costly work stoppage at a moment when demand for vehicles in the U.S. is strong. \nAccording to terms of the second agreement, younger workers hired after 2007 would be boosted gradually to about $29 an hour or more over the next eight years, like veteran workers. That rate is a boost from a $25.35 ceiling under the rejected contract and $10 an hour more than the current ceiling. \nHow the new labor rate will affect FCA's total labor costs wasn't immediately clear, since the contract may contain other provisions that save the automaker money, such as expanded flexibility to employ contract labor, which FCA has been seeking. \nA recent study by the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., showed that labor costs for Detroit-based union automakers had dropped dramatically in the past decade, while automotive profits have risen.\nYet the labor cost to foreign-based automakers is still half that of the Detroit-based automakers  on a per-vehicle basis. Consequently, the UAW faces a difficult task achieving its stated goal of organizing so-called \"transplant\" auto factories in the southern U.S.\nThe CAR study showed that last year the foreign automakers building cars in the U.S. paid $1,042 per vehicle in labor costs, compared with an average of $2,215 per vehicle for Fiat Chrysler, Ford and GM. But the Detroit Three's hourly average has nearly been halved since the financial crisis of 2008-2009 that resulted in bankruptcy for GM and Chrysler, which Fiat acquired.\n \nDoron Levin is the host of \"In the Driver Seat\" broadcast on SiriusXM Insight 121, Saturday at noon, encore 9 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe writer has no financial interest in the aforementioned companies. \nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:23:48.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
