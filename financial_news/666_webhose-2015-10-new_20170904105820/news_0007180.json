He added that investors could be seeing the relatively cheap mining stocks as a bargain-hunting opportunity. \nBurberry was the biggest loser on the FTSE, falling 2.4 percent to extend the previous session's slide, as a profit warning late on Thursday from German peer Hugo Boss (Xetra: BOSA.DE - news ) hit Burberry and other luxury goods companies. \nHugo Boss cut its 2015 sales and profit outlook, while price target cuts from brokers on Burberry's shares added further pressure to the British company on Friday, whose shares had already slumped 8.3 percent on Thursday on weak sales growth.
