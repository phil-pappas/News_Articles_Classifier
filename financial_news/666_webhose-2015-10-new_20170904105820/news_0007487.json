That said, its ubiquity isn't much of a comfort to those â€‹20-somethings receiving their very first student loan bill. In many ways, taking out student loans can feel like a huge gamble : For those who struggle to find work right out of college, it can begin to look like a bet they lost.However, a firm understanding of student debt can make it much easier to handle.

[tweet_Quote: display=\"Here's a quick intro into student debt that will help you plan your steps going forward\"]Here's a quick intro into student debt that will help you plan your steps going forward[/tweet_Quote: ] :\nChoosing Types of Debt There are, generally speaking, two kinds of student loans -- federal and private. A federal loan is money lent to you by the government, where private loans are made by some sort of lender (banks, credit unions, etc.). When taking out loans, you should always go to federal loans first, and only turn to private loans when you absolutely must.The reason for this is that federal loans are, in many ways, designed to empower students. Private loans, on the other hand, are designed to make money. This doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't take out a private loan if you need to, only that you should prioritize federal loans whenever you can. In School What you have to do for your student loans while you're in school depends on what kind of loans you have. If you have any private loans, you may need to begin repaying them while you're still taking classes. Many private loans require this, and failing to do so can land you with huge penalties and damage your credit score.If you have federal loans, you won't need to make any payments while you're still enrolled in classes full- or part-time. However, if you're able to get a leg up on your loans , you can begin repayments at any time. One strategy some students take is to only tackle interest while they're in school. Subsidized federal loans won't build interest while you're enrolled, but unsubsidized will: If you can pay off interest as it accrues, you'll end up paying less in the long run.However, if you can't afford to make any payments while enrolled, that's OK for federal loans. You won't receive any penalties or charges until the repayment period begins. After Graduation - Perfect World It's important to understand what the ideal image of student debt repayment looks like, if only to use as a point of comparison to your own situation. Theoretically speaking, this is how your post-college experience will go:You finish up school in a blaze of glory, and land a well-paying job within the first six months of no longer attending classes. When your first student loan bill appears, you're able to pay it off with no problem. You pay your bill on time each and every month until, oh, about 10 years later, you pay your very last bill. You are debt-free and it was all totally worth it. After Graduation - Real World Unfortunately, there are plenty of little details along the way that can make this perfect vision impossible. If you're finding yourself unable to fall into the \"perfect world\" version of debt repayment, don't freak out: You're not alone, and there are resources out there for you.Let's say your job search takes more than six months: If you have federal loans, you may be able to temporarily postpone your payments depending on your situation. Private loans may also have the option to postpone, but it really hinges on the lender.If you get a job, but you don't make enough to comfortably repay your loans, look at your repayment options. Generally speaking, you should be dedicating 10-20% of your income to student loans. Federal loans are typically repaid at a steady rate: If 20% of your income is still less than your monthly rate, you can choose plans where your payments increase over time or are linked to your income. The disadvantage of paying less early on is that you may pay more overall. Still, if you simply can't afford the steady rate plan, the option is there.Private loans can also have many options for the repayment plan, but again it depends on the lender. If you're having trouble repaying, it's worth it to reach out and see if you can get a rate deduction. Whatever your situation, it's important to be proactive about your debt. Make sure you're paying attention to your repayment so nothing catches you off guard , and reach out to your lender or the Federal Student Aid Department if you're ever unsure about anything.
