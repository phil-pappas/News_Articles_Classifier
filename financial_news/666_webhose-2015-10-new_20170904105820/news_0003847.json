You can't lose them, no one can take them away. \nExcept the federal government. \n\"It used to be against the law to garnish Social Security benefits to pay debts,\" said Maggie Thompson, campaign manager for the Higher Ed, Not Debt initiative at theCenter of American Progress. \"That’s because Social Security is an earned benefit and a backstop against poverty.” More Headlines \nBut Thompson points to a 1996 law that changed all that. “ Hundreds of thousands of seniors are having huge chunks taken out of their checks to pay their students loans from the Department of Education (ED) ,\" she says. Those loans run the gamut from co-signed obligations used to fund the education of children and grandchildren or--increasingly--to pay for their own forays into higher ed. \nBorrowers run the gamut also , from seniors who took a swing at second careers through vocational courses at for-profit colleges to grad school lifers stuck in the all-but-dissertation straightjacket. Taken together, they compromise a significant number of Social Security recipients—and people with student loans. \n\"Today, over 700,000 people relying on Social Security are still paying their student loans,\" said Thompson. \"Over 160,000 Social Security beneficiaries have their monthly checks garnished to pay off federal student loans. Until 1996 it was against the law to garnish Social Security benefits to pay debts, but that protection was stripped for debts owed to the Federal government.\" \nHigher Ed, Not Debt says that the same law, the Debt Collection Improvement Act, gives the Department of Education (ED) the option to remove or withhold a garnishment order. \n”It doesn’t even require an act of Congress,” Thompson stated. “The Department of Education can declare a moratorium on garnishing Social Security benefits for student debt. We can make this happen—and bring relief to the many Social Security recipients still struggling to repay their student loans.” \nSocial Security says on the FAQ page of its website that Sec 207 of the Social Security Act protects benefits from Federal garnishment but with some exceptions--and one of them gives Uncle Sam the right to \"withhold and pay another federal agency for a non-tax debt you owe to that agency\" according to 1996 Debt Collection Improvement Act. ED would be one of those federal agencies. \nHowever, Chapter 10 of the Debt Collection Improvement Act, Sec. 31001 states, \"Payments (including student loans) certified by the Department of Education under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 shall not be subject to administrative off-set under this subsection.\" \nThere seems to be several shades of gray here. But the punch-line is that if the power to exercise an “administrative set-off”--which is where they grab your money--lies with the Treasury Department, then ED’s hands are tied. That's the status quo according to an ED source. \n\"That law generally requires agencies, including ED, to refer delinquent or defaulted debt to the Department of the Treasury offset program,” said the ED source who asked not to be identified. \"Treasury may then collect that debt by offsetting from most government payments, including tax refunds and Social Security benefits from the Social Security Administration.\" People on Supplemental Security Income who are disabled, blind or elderly are totally protected without exception. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:48:02.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
