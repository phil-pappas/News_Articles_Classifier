Cross-town rival Roche, the biggest cancer-drug maker, is also pursuing therapies that seek to turbocharge the immune system to fight tumours.\n\"The first wave of immuno-oncology therapies has demonstrated the impact this approach can have in treating certain types of tumors,\" said Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research.\nAdmune and Xoma are based in Massachusetts and California.\nSpain's Palobiofarma said its licensing pact with Novartis will give the Swiss company exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and market the company's adenosine-based cancer immunotherapies.\nThe agreement also includes additional payments for reaching short-term clinical objectives, cash for development and marketing of projects and royalty payments linked to sales of Palobiofarma's product, called PBF-509, due to begin Phase 1 clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer.\nPBF-509 is being tested for whether it can help the immune system better identify and fight tumours by using adenosine to block the interaction of so-called A2a receptors.\nPalobiofarma said its molecule could be used in combination cancer therapy with other drugs, including anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1, designed to help switch on the immune system to fight tumors that seek to evade the body's natural defenses.\n(Reporting by Emma Pinedo Gonzalez in Madrid and John Miller in Zurich)\nNovartis cancer immunotherapy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:51:04.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
