I didn´t earn anything for it´ explains Léocadie Voho. ´We do all the work, but it´s the men who sell the cocoa. We have never sold cocoa. We, the women, work but we don´t earn anything.´ Léocadie Voho is one of the 25 women cocoa farmers who have documented and dramatized their experiences, challenges and aspirations as woman in cocoa growing communities in Côte d´Ivoire in the film ´growing our Cocoa, Raising our Voices.´ On the International Day of Rural Women, Fairtrade is delighted to present this new film highlighting the experiences of these women farmers. As Fairtrade develops its programme work in gender, we know that we need to understand more about the lives and experiences of the women who work in Fairtrade supply chains. 'Growing our Cocoa, Raising our Voices' was made by women living near Daloa, in western Côte d'Ivoire. The 25 women are all linked to two Cooperative societies, ECOOJAD and CAPEDIG which form part of the Fairtrade certified ECOOKIM cooperative union. Some of the women were cooperative members in their own right, while others are married to cooperative members. ECOOKIM's vision to help their members increase their share of the cocoa value chain led them to participate in this initiative to strengthen the position of their female members. Participatory video specialists from KIT, a research institute in the Netherlands, trained the women in how to use the cameras and microphones. The women practised interviewing each other and speaking on camera. They discussed and debated which topics and issues to showcase in the film, and developed the storyboards together. After four intensive days of training, the women returned to their villages to shoot their films on location. The final film, a mixture of theatre and documentary, captures the challenges faced by women who work hard to produce cocoa, but see little of the direct benefit from sales. The women express their practical needs for higher prices and for better access to pesticides and transport for their crop. They talk about their hopes to become a more active part of their cooperatives, and interview the cooperative president and director to raise their concerns with them. Beyond cocoa production, the women speak passionately about the challenges for women to get a good education, the need for better employment possibilities for women, and their vision for a more equal society. As Awa Ouedraogo explains in the film ´What I want is for women to be working in an office... because women and men, we all have the same potential. There is no job today that a man can do that a woman cannot do.´ The women edited their films together and premiered them to representatives from their cooperatives and from Fairtrade. At the end of the project they spoke about what they had learned, and the difference that being part of the project had made for them. In particular, the women appreciated the opportunity to learn new skills and work with technology. They really enjoyed the rare chance to meet and exchange ideas with women from other villages. And they were able to use the project as a platform to explore their experiences of cocoa production and the cocoa cooperatives - and to present their views and concerns to the managers of those cooperatives. Aïssata Rado explains what being part of the project has meant for her: 'I've learned such a lot: how to use a camera and a microphone, how to interview people and how to film.' She spoke about how the women bonded through the project: 'We came from different places, we didn't know each other. Now we eat, sleep, take bath together, and laugh together.' And she talked about what she would do differently after the project: 'The workshop has given me greater strength. I am going to contribute, make more of an effort to be part of the cooperative. That will help my cocoa production to be more successful.' The true value of the film, as Tsitsi Choruma, Senior advisor for Gender at Fairtrade International explains is that \"giving women a voice, enables confidence building and strengthens their self-esteem and their ability to negotiate their rightful space in communities and Producer Organisations. And as Ahou Héléne N´guessan, one of the cocoa farmers involved say´ Before, women here were in the dark. Our film brings us into the light.\" The final film will be used as a tool for training and to spark discussion and debate on gender issues with other cooperatives across Africa and beyond. Nyagoy Nyong´o, Executive Director of Fairtrade Africa explained ´The film has provided a valuable insight into the realities women cocoa farmers face on a day to day basis in Côte d´Ivoire. We plan to use the film to facilitate discussions on gender issues with Cocoa cooperatives through our Cocoa network and also to identify other ways it can be shared with cooperatives across Africa to generate learning.´ Fairtrade is very grateful to all the women who participated, and to ECOOKIM and its member cooperatives ECOJAD and CAPEDIG for their support to make the project happen. This project was commissioned by Fairtrade Africa, Fairtrade International and Fairtrade Foundation as part of a bigger field study of Fairtrade´s impact in Cocoa growing in West Africa which is due to be published later in the year.
