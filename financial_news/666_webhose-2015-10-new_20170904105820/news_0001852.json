The effect is a depressing one. \"A higher housing-cost burden in a county is associated with a lower marriage rate,\" according to a paper from the Eastern Economic Journal titled \" Bricks, Mortar, and Wedding Bells: Does the Cost of Housing Affect the Marriage Rate in the U.S.? \" \"When the costs of being married (that include the burden of housing costs) increase relative to being single, individuals are less likely to marry,\" the report continues. The housing cost burden includes the price of homes, the cost of borrowing and per-capita income. Or put more simply, if you can't afford a nest for your intended family, then it's less likely that you'll get hitched. The results, which the authors say are statistically significant, come from a study of almost 86,000 data points from 1970 to 1999, covering 2,450 counties in 42 states. More recent data seems to play out as the study predicts, with housing prices vastly outpacing wages, and marriage rates dropping precipitously. A March-dated research study from the U.S. Census Bureau found that almost two-thirds of young men had never been married, based on an analysis of data from 2008 through 2012. For men aged 25 to 29 \"the proportion never married grew about 14 percentage points, from 49% in 1996 to 63%,\" in the period studied, the report states. \"For women aged 25 to 29, those never married increased from 35% to 52%.\" \nSo basically, millennials -- the biggest generation in U.S. history, with a population of about 92 million -- are shying away from the altar.
