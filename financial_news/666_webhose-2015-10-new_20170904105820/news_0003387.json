Argentina sits on resources that may surpass 128 million tonnes of lithium carbonate, which is a vital component in manufacturing lithium batteries.\" \nAt the foot of the Andes (Taiwan OTC: 6533.TWO - news ) mountains, in the windswept region of Puna, the \"salares,\" or salt flats, hold vast deposits of lithium. \nIn 2014, the world consumed 170,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. American, Japanese and South Korean companies are already mining Argentina's deposits. \n\"When we started promoting lithium in 2005, we never imagined we would have such success in attracting investment to Argentina... All the big auto makers have been present in Argentina trying to get a foot in lithium development,\" said Mayoral. \n- 'Golden triangle' - \nJapan's Toyota and Mitsubishi and South Korea's Posco (KSE: 005490.KS - news ) have already begun production in the province of Jujuy, on the border with Chile and Bolivia -- the so-called \"golden triangle\" of lithium. \nIn 2013, French group Eramet (Paris: FR0000131757 - news ) also got in the game with two deposits in Salta province covering 500 square kilometers (nearly 200 square miles). \n\"It's a beautiful deposit. We discovered a significant level of resources -- more than seven million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent,\" said Eramet's Hughes-Marie Aulanier. \nEramet has not yet entered the production phase -- expected to last more than 40 years -- but its geologists are busy assessing how much of the deposit is commercially viable. \nAulanier said the firm would use an innovative, \"world-first\" procedure to avoid harming the environment, developed by Eramet's research department with the French Institute for Oil and New Energies (IFP Energies Nouvelles). \nThirty to 40 French and Argentine employees are at work on the site, with just llamas and vicunas for company in an unpopulated desert region at an altitude of 4,000 meters (more than 13,000 feet). \nThe nearest village, Santa Rosa Grandes, is 60 kilometers (more than 35 miles) away. \nEramet, which has partnered with the province's public mining company on the project, plans to invest $260 million once the feasibility study gives the green light. \nIt expects output of 20,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent a year through 2019. \nThe mined lithium carbonate yields 20 percent lithium after processing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:41:13.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
