Getty Images Share on twitter by Dominic White Lachlan and James Murdoch say that their father Rupert is \"still the boss\" of the family media empire and joke that he's \"never retiring\" in their first interview since he anointed them executive chairman and chief executive respectively of his 21st Century Fox.\nIn a revealing, at times light-hearted, interview with Hollywood Reporter in which they spell out their \"equal partnership\" approach to running the business, the brothers say they are unlikely to \"bet the whole company\" as their father once did but that they will take \"aggressive, creative and strategic risks\".\nLachlan spoke about his 2005 decision to leave his father's media business for a decade, which he called \"one of the very best decisions\" of his life.\nInvestors are watching closely to see how the unusual working relationship progresses between the younger James and the older Lachlan, who is also co-chairman of News Corp, whose assets include The Wall Street Journal, The Australian and half of Foxtel.\nObservers have said the brothers had some tense discussions during board meetings in Lachlan's earlier incarnation at News Corp (which later de-merged its entertainment and cable business 21st Century Fox).\nBut asked by Hollywood Reporter journalist Matthew Belloni whether they bicker during board meetings today, they said no.\nJames: \"From a strategy point of view, on the board-level stuff, I don't think Lachlan and I have ever had any major — or really any minor — disagreements with respect to where the direction of the business needs to be and how we prosecute that.\n\"But we're brothers, we used to fight like cats in a bag. But you know, we were young then. (Laughs.)\"\n Lachlan: \"I always won, which was good\".\nJames: \"I'm not so sure\".\nLachlan: \"I was bigger back then\".\nJames: \"Yeah, exactly. Not anymore\".\nA younger Lachlan stormed out of News Corp's New York HQ in 2005 humiliated, having been outmanoeuvred by his father's lieutenants Roger Ailes and Peter Chernin.\nHe returned to Sydney and founded private investment firm Illyria Pty Ltd, building its Nova Entertainment into a successful radio network. But he also made a disastrous bet on free-to-air network Ten Network Holdings, in which Foxtel is now seeking to buy a 15 per cent stake.\nIn March 2014, Lachlan returned as co-chairman at both News Corp and 21st Century Fox. I n June this year he returned to Los Angeles to become executive chairman of 21st Century Fox while James was made chief executive , and continued to operate primarily out of New York.\n\"I wouldn't say I resisted the company. I wanted to go do my own thing,\" says Lachlan of his time in exile. \"I went back to Australia for 10 years, built a very successful business that was terrific, [but] the whole time I remained on the board of News Corp — and after they split, News Corp and Fox.\"\nThe interview continues, with Mr Belloni asking about comments made by Rupert Murdoch in 2008 where he said Lachlan \"did not like, or have a happy experience in, Hollywood\".\nLachlan: \"I don't think that's true. Honestly, it was a point in my life where it was important to go and do [my] own thing and take a big risk — which I think is important sometimes — and I did, and it worked out really well. It's one of the very best decisions I ever made in my life, leaving the company, and I'd do it again.\"\nJames: \"Well, hopefully you won't do it again!\" (Laughs.)\nLachlan: \"It's actually led me to be an even better executive for that experience\".\nThe Hollywood Reporter interview can be read in full here .", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/prodigal-son-lachlan-returns-to-murdoch-heartland--as-his-own-man-20140328-35ok6.html", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/james-lachlan-murdoch-first-interview-833194", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/james-murdoch-to-succeed-father-rupert-murdoch-as-ceo-of-21st-century-fox-reports-20150611-ghm2b3.html", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:05:35.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
