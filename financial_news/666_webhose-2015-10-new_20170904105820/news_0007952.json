So I think any response we have in terms of the type of project and its positioning needs to be determined in the backdrop of what else is in the market. It's more on the luxury end.\"\nThe pitch to target the luxury end of the market echoes comments made by Alon's recently hired entertainment tsar, Jesse Waits, who said the resort will target an intimate entertainment offering as punters begin to tire of the mass-market club scene.\nCrown hopes to break ground on the new project in the first half of 2016 although Mr Nisbet said a funding deal to finance the facility would need to be agreed first.\nDeutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are arranging financing for the Alon joint venture, with Crown expected to sell down some of its 74 per cent stake in the project. A US debt deal could also be announced within the next few months.\n\"We're proceeding with a detailed design and we're currently working through our financing and the balance of our detailed construction permits. Its part of the normal pre construction process,\" said Mr Nisbet. \"With a little bit of luck we hope to break ground on the project in the first half of next year. And that means we will be working through although we won't start construction until we have a fully financed project.\"\nAfter stepping down as Crown chairman in August for a new executive director role, Mr Packer said he would focus on developing the Vegas project along with its planned Sydney casino at Barangaroo.\nNewly installed Crown chairman Rob Rankin admitted in August that Crown had a bulging pipeline but said all of its developments including Las Vegas, Sydney and potentially Japan must meet strict investment criteria.\n \"We're not running around trying to develop dozens of projects,\" said Mr Rankin at the time. \"I think our main focus is Sydney, Vegas and Melbourne, but in the right circumstances we would stretch for Japan as well in partnership with Melco Crown. As a longer-term proposition, Japan excites us.\"\nCrown on Monday also revealed details of a new $1.5 billion six-star Melbourne hotel, connected to its existing Melbourne casino complex, which it hopes to open by late 2019 .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:35.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
