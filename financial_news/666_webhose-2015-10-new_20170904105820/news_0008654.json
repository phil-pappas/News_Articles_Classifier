China alone acccounts for 10 percent of Germany's auto exports.\nA sharp drop in German exports in August, which fell at their fastest pace since the 2009 financial crisis, is likely to be related to the fall in trade in Asia, Barclays said. Industrial production and factory orders also declined.\n\"Because of China's weight in global production and trade, and because of the high commodity intensity of its production and demand, China's recession is the one that matters most for the global economy,\" Willem Buiter, Citi's chief economist has warned.\nLEVERAGE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS\nOne of the few reports at the IMF's meetings in Peru to sound the alarm over China was a report on lending. The IMF Global Financial Stability report said that overborrowing by Chinese companies was equivalent to a quarter of gross domestic product.\nWhile China's August stock market crash and sudden devaluation rattled global markets, it may have just been a foretaste of things to come if China does not address its huge debt problems.\n\"Direct financial spillovers include a possibly adverse impact on the asset quality of at least $800 billion of cross-border bank exposures,\" the Fund report said.\nIt calculates that if a tightly wound credit cycle in emerging economies, including China, unwinds with rising corporate default rates, aggregate global output could be as much as 2.4 percent lower by 2017 relative to the IMF's baseline forecast.\n\"China still has policy buffers to absorb financial shocks, including a relatively strong public sector balance sheet, but overreliance on these buffers could exacerbate existing vulnerabilities,\" the Fund said.
