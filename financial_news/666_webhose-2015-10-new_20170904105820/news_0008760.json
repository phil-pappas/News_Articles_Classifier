Now, he’s taking a turn as chief executive of his own startup, Lyra Health, based in Burlingame, Calif.\nLyra provides companies and health plans with technology and other resources designed to improve the effectiveness of employees’ mental-health care. It has $3.1 million in strategic funding from Castlight Health Inc., CSLT 1.51 % a San Francisco provider of health-care management technology.\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Ebersman describes what it’s like to make the move from CFO at a legendary company to CEO at a tiny startup, where he walks to work and assembles the conference tables himself. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.\nFew resources WSJ: What is it like to go from working at one of the most recognizable places in the world to a small company no one has heard of yet?\nMR. EBERSMAN: Facebook was a fantastic place to work and it was really fun being a part of a company and a product that is important to so many people around the world. It is a notable change when you start something new. You have to build the momentum and direction and interest yourself.\nOne of the things about Facebook that was so impressive, about what Mark [Zuckerberg] accomplished, is that they made Facebook a household name by building a product people wanted to use. It wasn’t marketing, it wasn’t PR—the product was useful and people wanted to use it and tell their friends about it.\nWe want to build something that is useful so that people want to interact with it and use it, but we have a narrower audience.\nFacebook benefited from virality in obvious ways. People liked the product and told people about that. Health-care technology, in general, struggles with that, because people are less likely to talk to their friends and colleagues about health care, so we will likely need a different approach.\nWSJ: Tell me about making the switch from chief financial officer to chief executive. What are the major changes?\nMR. EBERSMAN: For me, the biggest difference is going from a bigger company to a smaller one—all of a sudden finding yourself in a place where you have very few resources. In the first week that I worked here, I had to drive to IKEA and assemble the conference-room furniture.\nENLARGE Embracing optimism WSJ: Do you see a change in your attitude?\nMR. EBERSMAN: I do find myself taking on a different persona in this chair.\nAs CFO at a larger company, one of the things I felt responsible for doing was to be a bit of a pessimist: to think about what could go wrong with the investments we were making, and to make sure someone was challenging every dollar we were spending in the business.\nI think the CEO needs to think about those things, but also needs to be relentlessly optimistic. You really want an optimism and confidence to flow from the CEO and to infect the organization in a positive way.\nWSJ: As a CFO at Genentech and at Facebook you had a unique opportunity to observe CEOs up close and personal. What lessons do you take from that at your own company?\nMR. EBERSMAN: I got to learn from some great ones and I really draw on that experience every day—at Genentech working for Art Levinson, and Facebook working for Mark Zuckerberg.\nThey are very different, but they both cared deeply about the culture at their companies and were both willing to spend a lot of time making sure that their companies were building a working environment that could attract and retain great people.\nThey both had an infectious enthusiasm and passion for the company and what it was doing. It was impossible to walk away from a meeting with either of them without feeling more inspired to work on trying to make the company more successful.\nWSJ: How did you decide on this startup?\nMR. EBERSMAN: I knew I wanted to work in health care for sure. The more I learned about behavioral health, the more I wanted to work in it.\nThe behavioral-health system in this country that takes care of people with depression and anxiety and substance abuse and other conditions isn’t really working well for patients. We have this set of diseases that affect 50 million people in this country each year and we do a really terrible job of getting effective care to most of them. I think the opportunity to bring the best of technology to make health care better is a really interesting problem set to work on.\nWSJ: Why did you think now was the right time for this startup?\nMR. EBERSMAN: Behavioral-health conditions are the primary drag on productivity. Whether people are absent, or people aren’t absent but aren’t contributing as much as they could otherwise, better behavioral-health care can help unleash productivity from the workforce you’ve already assembled.\nThe availability of technology, our ability to use data, do analytics on large messy data sets, and to easily build software tools for patients and physicians, I think is really enabling us to make the system work better for patients. The system is also more amenable to change than anytime I have seen it before and I think that comes in the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act.\nRelying more on instinct WSJ: How do you see a small company differently from a large company?\nMR. EBERSMAN: At a startup you have to focus relentlessly. You just don’t have the resources to do that many things at once.\nAnother difference is that if you work at an established company you have some knowledge about your products and your customers and some momentum you can build from. At a bigger company you can have a lot of information to analyze and at a startup you really have to go more with vision and instinct and less with data, because you don’t have very much.\nYou know very little about how the company’s going to evolve and how your products and technology and customers will interface. You have to get comfortable managing that ambiguity. It’s more of a roller coaster in a startup.\nMs. Chasan is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
