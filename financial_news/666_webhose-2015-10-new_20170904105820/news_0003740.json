Share on twitter by John McDuling We are living in the age of the unicorn, but what happens when one of these beautiful beasts runs into trouble?\nUnicorn, of course, is the term used for venture capital backed startups with valuations in the private markets above $US1 billion. They're not as rare as they used to be, but the media is still obsessed with them, and justifiably so, since they often have exciting, revolutionary (disruptive, if you must) business models.\nThink Uber or Airbnb. Atlassian is Australia's only certified unicorn, but our policymakers would dearly love more.\nAnother one is Theranos, which claims to have the technology to carry out comprehensive testing for hundreds of conditions more cheaply, using a few drops of blood from a finger prick (rather than drawing a whole vial from a needle).\nThe Palo Alto based company has raised $US400 million from investors at a reported valuation of $US9 billion. Its board of directors includes former two former US senators and three retired cabinet secretaries, including no less than Henry Kissinger. It has benefited from a steady flow of gushing praise from the media.\nBut last week damaging reports in the Wall Street Journal emerged calling the company's business model into question. The Journal report said the company has \"struggled\" to develop its technology and, citing former employees, claimed that the \"vast majority\" of tests the company carries out actually use traditional machines made by companies like Siemens.\nA subsequent report also showed that Theranos had subtly amended its marketing materials.\n Theranos deleted the highlighted parts on its website for \"marketing accuracy.\" http://t.co/yn2OVCfXZ0 pic.twitter.com/aRrfXTb2zj\nâ€” Gerard Baker (@gerardtbaker) October 16, 2015\nFor its part, Theranos has strongly rejected the Journal report as \"scientifically erroneous\" and \"grounded in baseless assertions.\"\nHow this all plays out remains to be seen. But what is arguably more interesting is the nervousness the episode seems to have triggered across the venture capital landscape, suggesting worries about frothy valuations, amid a flood of money into startups. Globally, startups have raised $98.4 billion in venture funding this year, according to CB Insights.. That's already eclipsed the $88.7 billion they raised in all of 2014, which was itself a multi-year record.\nWriting in the Financial Times, venture capitalist Mike Moritz warned about rising complacency in the private markets, and financial chicanery, which he said is creating some \"subprime unicorns\" (subprime being a reference to the low quality mortgage debt which triggered the global financial crisis).\nWhether this ends up applying to Theranos remains to be seen, but perhaps we shouldn't be that surprised about the latest controversy. After all, the CEO of one of Australia's biggest pathology companies aired his own concerns about its technology just a few months ago.\n\"There has been much hype about Theranos, but the industry response is much more sanguine,\" Dr Goldschmidt, the CEO of ASX-listed Sonic Healthcare said in March. \"There is some scepticism about the nature of its technology. Normally the technology would be open to scrutiny,\" but this has not been the case with Theranos since \"its technology has not been peer-reviewed\".\nSo maybe Theranos travails are a timely reminder to be sceptical about the Silicon Valley hype machine. Unicorns might be mythical creatures, but they're not invincible.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gerardtbaker/status/654862580058558464", "https://www.theranos.com/news", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901", "http://t.co/yn2OVCfXZ0", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/91063628-73f5-11e5-bdb1-e6e4767162cc.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3om1C2JjJ", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "http://t.co/aRrfXTb2zj"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:02:06.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
