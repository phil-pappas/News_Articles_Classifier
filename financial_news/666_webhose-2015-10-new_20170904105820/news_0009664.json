While this was still above the 50 level that divides growth from contraction, output was at its lowest since April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2013 and well below economists' forecast for a pick-up in activity to 56. \nChris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, warned that activity was sliding towards territory that would usually prompt the Bank of England to cut rates or launch more quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. The data pushed down the pound against the dollar and euro. \nSeptember's reading also means the sector expanded at the weakest pace since the second quarter of 2013. \nDavid Tinsley, an economist at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , said the slowdown in services growth was \"getting serious\". He said: \"If this is an accurate reading of the trajectory of the economy, it increasingly appears that UK growth has taken a marked step down.\" \nMonday's survey follows similar gauges of the manufacturing and construction sectors, which showed factory output remained close to stagnation in September while housebuilders drove a renewed surge in the construction sector . \nMarkit said the PMI data for the whole economy suggested growth was slowing to a level that would historically demand more stimulus from the Bank of England \nIn brighter news, Markit said the rate of job creation was the strongest since June, taking the run of jobs growth to 33 straight months. \nMichael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citi, was more sanguine about the data. He said said the soft patch suggested by the PMIs was consistent with growth of between 0.5pc and 0.6pc, or around 2.1pc on an annual basis. \"These surveys suggest that growth remains comfortably positive, but is no better than average. \n\"Given all this, the [Bank of England minutes and interest rate decision] on Thursday is likely to show a further drift to a softer outlook for both growth and inflation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:15:23.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
