RBC Capital Markets is a division of Royal Bank of Canada . More Headlines \nThe large-cap pharmaceutical stocks covered by RBC are down a collective 24% since the end of July, following second quarter earnings results compared to the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF , down 19%, and the S&P 500 down 4%, Stanicky wrote. \n\"While initial concerns arose from the introduction of a drug plan by Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , it has been exacerbated by negative headlines around the overall specialty pharmaceutical business model which has come from multiple media outlets with follow through from Valeant's earnings,\" he wrote. \nThere are three important points that investors should pay attention to, he added. \n\"We think the sell-off is overdone and fundamental concerns misunderstood; valuation at these levels is only 10% away from the lowest month in 2008, with a similar -31% valuation re-rating to the downside; we believe companies should be pivoting to share repurchases at these levels, which combined with more M&A will ultimately help reverse weakness,\" according to the note. \nHere are five pharmaceutical (three large cap and two small cap) stocks to buy now, according to RBC Capital Markets, with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n1. Endo International Plc Year-to-date return: -24.5% \nEndo International plc, a specialty healthcare company, focuses on branded and generic pharmaceuticals and devices worldwide. It operates through four segments: U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, Devices, and International Pharmaceutical. \nRBC Capital Markets Rating: Top Pick - Outperform RBC Capital Markets Said: Reaffirmed 2016-17E guidance 9/28 \nPer our outreach to ENDP and its intra-day 10/21 release, it utilizes specialty pharmacy services primarily for certain physician-administered brand products including XIAFLEX, AVEED, TESTOPEL, Supprelin LA, Vantas and Valstar (<10% of brand revenue and ~3% of 2015E revenue). ><less than 10% of brand revenue and ~3% of 2015E revenue). \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates ENDO INTERNATIONAL PLC as a Hold with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate ENDO INTERNATIONAL PLC (ENDP) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including unimpressive growth in net income and weak operating cash flow. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 7.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues rose by 24.0%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. The debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.88, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.27, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems. Compared to where it was a year ago today, the stock is now trading at a higher level, regardless of the company's weak earnings results. Despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year, there is currently no conclusive evidence that warrants the purchase or sale of this stock. The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Pharmaceuticals industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 1283.5% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $21.16 million to -$250.42 million. Net operating cash flow has significantly decreased to $12.32 million or 93.65% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower.
