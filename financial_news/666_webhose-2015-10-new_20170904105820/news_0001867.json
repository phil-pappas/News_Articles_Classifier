Bud Fox, and Gordon Gekko for that matter, couldn’t do it without them either. Forecasting is impossible without evidence, robust or not—and the visual representation of numbers is as important as the trends they indicate. \nFidelity’s StockCity too is a boon for investors of all stripes, but especially those with a short retirement horizon, which spatializes your stocks as buildings in a cityscape. There’s a free version that lets you tool around your investment empire as if you were browsing a Google Earth map of a city and a virtual reality view (powered by Oculus Rift) that requires a headset. In either case, it empowers the investor to identify opportunities that may be hard to see on a spreadsheet. \nBy leveraging some of the core principles behind data visualization, StockCity won’t make you a smarter investor, but it will make you a more nimble one and allow you to ask the right questions about your portfolio before making your next move.

On October 12, Deloitte Consulting, which has used Tableau for a while as its front-end visualization tool, announced an alliance with Tableau to beef-up its offerings for enterprise customers. \nWonky tools are one thing, but investing is a big tent that has its own media culture. Sometimes you need to broaden your view of investing to see how political or cultural trends could impact your portfolio.
