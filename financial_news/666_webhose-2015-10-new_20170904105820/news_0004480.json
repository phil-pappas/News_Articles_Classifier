posting of a revenue collector to the Yapei Market, re-allocating dormant market stores to interested persons and renovating some Area Councils to make them functional to support the Assembly in revenue generation. \nOther strategies include the constant sensitisation of the Assembly members to offer support in revenue mobilisation in their respective electoral areas to boost the district's economy. \nMr Yacin announced this at the weekend at Mpaha, the capital of the Debre Traditional Area, during a public forum aimed at explaining the development agenda of the Assembly to the people, which also enabled the local people to interact with members of the Assembly on issues concerning their development. \nThe DCE has adopted such measures as moving the structures of the Assembly occasionally to the various Area Councils to enable the people participate in the governance system by asking all questions concerning the decentralization and offer advice that would help in the development of the district. \nA miniature office is often setup in such areas to enable the people to visit the DCE and other departmental heads to make their complaints and seek explanations on matters that concerned them and their areas. \nThe occasion also accorded the DCE the opportunity to inspect ongoing and completed projects in Kpasera, Lampor, Bethlehem and Tamaklam communities, while a completed CHPS compound was also commissioned at Domeabre, near Mpaha. \nMr Yacin said he instituted such measures of moving the assembly to the Traditional Councils because many people could not afford to visit the district capital in Buipe because of distance. \nHe expressed the hope that many rural people would now understand the decentralisation process. \nHe mentioned the construction of a-three-unit Classroom -blocks, each at Domeabra, Buipe SDA, Buipe Higher Heights, Amedzrovi, Zowu a two six-unit classroom block at Buipe Vocational Technical School, while a six-unit dormitory block was allocated to the Buipe Senior High School. \nThese form part of measures put in place to improve educational infrastructure in the District. \nOthers include the single storey eight-unit dormitory block at Buipe Vocational & Technical School, eight-unit classroom block for Jankura, Administration block for the Buipe Vocational & Technical School, a two- bedroom Teachers' Accommodation at Jankura and one bedroom semi - detached Teachers' Accommodation at Jankura. \nHe said other ongoing projects in the District included a three-unit classroom block at Boachipe, a three-unit classroom block at Buipe Ansurudeen JHS, a three-unit classroom block, library and staff Common room at the Buipe Vocational School, a six-unit classroom block, office/Store, Staff Common Room, Library Unit, KVIP toilet & urinal at Mankpan. \nOthers are a three-unit classroom block, office/store, staff common room, library, KVIP toilet & urinal at Kusawgu, a six-Unit Classroom block, office/store, staff common room, library unit, KVIP toilet & urinal at Kpabuso and the construction of a six-unit classroom block office/store, staff common room, library, KVIP toilet and urinal at Buipe E/A. \nHe said similar projects were ongoing at various schools and communities in the district and gave the assurance that all the projects would be completed on time to enhance academic work. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:53:09.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
