Corporates stand to gain as winning in such competitions would create brand value within the university.\nThe panel is also in favour of a percentage of corporate profit to be used for creation of corporate venture capital funds, subsequent investment in start-ups or incubators and tax credits against this.\nAll contracts worth above USD 5 billion with foreign defence companies should include a clause for 5 per cent of the value to be used for setting up research-centric universities, it suggested.\nThe panel is of the view that these measures will allow India to develop a number of top-class research institutes with high-quality faculty within a few years and kickstart the process of industry-university collaboration in a meaningful way.\nThe panel also pitched for an increase in investment in business incubators with up to Rs 200 crore public spending per year and roping in private sector for the purpose.\nHalf of the Rs 1,000 crore under the SETU fund be spent in upgrading the system of incubators already in place in the country, it added.\nTo improve ease of doing business, the panel recommended that AIM set up a committee to chart a 1-year road map for all enterprise numbers to converge on a central identity. At present, the firms use many numbers, including TAN, PAN and ESIC.\nOn AIM composition, the committee favours NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman at the helm with seven secretaries of the central government and four independent members on its board.\nEstablishing a ‘fund-of-funds (FOF)’ to seed other early stage venture funds with a corpus of Rs 5,000 crore is another key recommendation.\nThe panel was set up in April this year after Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget speech announced the governmentâ€™s intention to establish AIM at NITI and made a provision of Rs 150 crore.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 2:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:07:39.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
