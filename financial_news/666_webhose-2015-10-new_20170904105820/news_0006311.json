Small movements in demand and prices can have a big impact on the profits because the costs of running paper mills is relatively fixed. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Mondi (LSE: MNDI.L - news ) have drifted down from record highs of £16.11 reached in August on fears that Europe is slowing down. The company generates the majority of its revenue and profits from the Continent, despite its dual-listing in London and Johannesburg. \nThe company built its European manufacturing base through buying state-owned paper mills and packaging factories in ex-Soviet Bloc countries in the 1990s. Maintenance at sites in the Czech Republic and Poland are estimated to come at a cost of about €35m in lost production during the period, and a total of €90m for the full-year. \nAnd yet, while the world economy may be slowing, Mondi is still on track. Prices were generally stable or higher than last year during the three-month period to October 8, with Mondi selling more packaging to blue-chip companies such as Procter & Gamble, Nestle (VTX: NESN.VX - news ) and Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) , and helping send like-for-like sales of packaging up in the third quarter. \n= Global slowdown = \nThe outlook for Mondi is clearly more uncertain in a slowing global economy. The shares have proven to be exposed to the ups and downs of the business cycle in the past because of the company’s fixed cost-base. That said, it should be able to negotiate a tougher trading environment when it arrives. \nThe balance sheet is not overly strained with net debts of €1.7bn, against shareholders equity of €2.9bn at the end of June. The borrowing is agreed for an average of four years, which also provides time before any impending debt renegotiations. \nMondi has proven to be good at generating cash, and in the first half the spare cash increased by 23pc when compared to the same period last year, and covered the dividend payments more than three times. Management confidence was underlined by a 9pc increase in the interim dividend. \nIn the past four years Mondi has more than doubled its profits and dividend. The problem now is that the shares are looking expensive. In the year to date the shares have gained 38pc compared to the FTSE 100 down 3pc, and are now trading on 15 times forecast earnings per share. \nTaking a more prudent view of the average earnings during the past five years which smooths out the ups and downs of economic cycles puts the shares on 26 times earnings. \nMondi is a solid company but that rating feels too high for a cyclical industry play. We downgraded to a hold back in August and, after excellent gains despite the uncertain European economy, we maintain that stance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:28:04.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
