Glen Hunt by Christopher Niesche Sharemarkets have given investors a wild ride over the past couple of months.\nThe third quarter from July to September was the worst quarter for global markets in four years, as investors became worried about patchy growth in developing markets, the prospect of a Greek default and the possibility that the US Federal Reserve would start raising interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis.\nThe UK's FTSE 100 dropped 7 per cent, the Dow Jones Industrial Index fell nearly 8 per cent, Japan's Nikkei lost more than 14 per cent, Germany's DAX lost almost 12 per cent, and China's Shanghai Composite tumbled just under of 25 per cent.\nAustralian stocks fared no better, with the S&P/ASX200 falling tumbling 9 per cent over the same period. The index is now down 12 per cent from its peak in July.\nSharemarket rises during the first few days of October have brought some relief for investors, but it is still too early to say that the bear market has passed.\nBut, even as markets have fallen, some sectors and stocks have proved resilient and bucked the trend. By looking offshore, where bourses are home to a wider range of large companies, investors might be able to find stocks that will help them ride out the volatility.\nChief investment officer at Insync Funds Management Monik Kotecha says concerns about US interest rates were a key factor in the sharemarket rout. Many investors had put money into stocks to access better yields than were available on bonds. Higher interest rates would have narrowed the gap.\nAs it happened, the US Federal Reserve didn't raise rates in September, but investors then became concerned that because rates didn't rise there was a risk that inflation could get out of control, which would require more interest rate rises down the track.\n \"The environment we're operating in at the moment is one of still very difficult growth globally,\" Kotecha says. Indeed, on October 7 the International Monetary Fund downgraded its forecast for global growth for the second time this year, to 3.2 per cent for 2015 and 3.3 per cent for next year.\nKotecha says those sectors which are less sensitive to higher interest rates such as utilities and consumer staples have weathered the market downturn well and are likely to hold up. In the US, Campbell Soup Company shares rose nearly 6 per cent in the last quarter and McDonalds shares were up almost 3 per cent. Shares in PepsiCo were flat, but rose strongly in early October after third-quarter earnings beat expectations.\nAlong with falling share markets, the price of oil has also fallen, which has hit some emerging markets such as Indonesia and Russia harder than developed markets. But it has also created opportunities to invest in stocks which will benefit from lower fuel prices, says Mark Newman, executive director and chief investment officer at K2 Asset Management.\n\"Things that have held up well are beneficiaries of lower fuel prices, like airline stocks,\" says Newman.\nWhile Hong Kong-listed airlines such as Air China, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern Airlines were all sold off during the recent market rout, they have bounced back \"reasonably strongly\" and along with the lower fuel price, Newman expects increasing travel by China's growing middle class to support the stocks in future.\nNewman notes that although Chinese equities have fallen steeply over the past three months, they are still up 30 per cent over the past 12 months and have outperformed US, European and Australian markets.\nFalls in Australian dollar and the euro have given Chinese tourists more spending power compared to the US where the dollar has been rising. Newman says that an increase in the number of Chinese tourists in Europe and more Europeans holidaying at home has helped German-based rental car company Sixt, which is up about 25 per cent over the past three months.\nAnother company that has held up well is Irish construction company Kingspan, which is at about the same level it was at three months ago. Newman says it is being supported by lower interest rates in Europe as well as ongoing support for economic growth from the European Central Bank, which continues to buy bonds.\nStephen Wong, a senior portfolio manager at Mutual Trust that runs family offices for some of Australia's wealthiest individuals and families, says credit card companies have performed reasonably well during the downturn and the trend away from cash and to electronic payments will continue to support them.\n\"We expect that the acceleration of payment technology adoption [launch of Android Pay, rollout of new payment terminals in the US driven by EMV/chip cards being issued] and underlying positive e-commerce trends continue to underpin our investments in US-listed Visa and MasterCard,\" he says.\n\"Since the August downturn, these positions have performed slightly better than the market, with Visa declining 4.9 per cent and MasterCard declining 5.9 per cent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:49:49.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
