Some have given up entirely on the idea of repaying their loans, placing their hopes in a debt revolt that will put pressure on lenders to renegotiate or forgive their debt.Which brings us back to the more mundane topic of debt servicing. Loan servicers, who are contracted by lenders or the government to collect student loan payments, are where the rubber meets the road when it comes to heading off delinquencies and defaults among existing borrowers.There are a number of repayment programs for federal student loans that tie monthly payments to income. It's up to loan servicers to help borrowers who are having trouble making their monthly payments understand what their options are. But as was the case during the mortgage crisis, loan servicers aren't always given the proper incentives to act in a borrower's best interests, or even the lender's best interest. Problems in loan servicing In a recent report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) documented just about everything that can go wrong in student loan servicing with an analysis of public input and recommendations for reform .In releasing its report, the CFPB also issued a joint statement of principles on student loan servicing with the Department of Education and Department of the Treasury calling for greater consistency, accuracy, accountability and transparency in loan servicing. Making loan servicers part of the solution Looking forward, there's reason to think loan servicers can be part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.The Department of Education recently reported that default rates among recent graduates are falling and that loan servicers deserve part of the credit for signing up more than 5,000 borrowers a day for income-driven repayment plans that are intended to prevent defaults.More than 3.9 million federal direct student loan borrowers have been placed into income-driven repayment plans, thanks in part to changes to contracts with the companies that service federal student loans, the department said.Navient, one of the largest student loan services, said it has enrolled nearly one in every five student loan borrowers that the company is responsible for into income-driven repayment plans, promoting awareness of these programs through more than 170 million letters, emails, phone calls, videos and text messages a year.In a public statement , Navient CEO Jack Remondi said the government could also help by streamlining “multiple, sound-alike” repayment options into “easier-to-understand, actionable choices.”In its own report on problems in student lending , the Department of Education said lawmakers can also help address the root of the problem by passing stricter Federal aid rules for career college programs to make sure they provide real, marketable job skills for their students.The report also recommended that lawmakers help loan servicers reach borrowers, by expanding the Department Education's IRS skip tracing power to allow it to furnish the names and addresses of borrowers who are late on their payments. Today, the IRS can only provide that information for borrowers who have already defaulted.Correcting past failures of student loan servicers and preventing future issues should be just the first step in the process. Many student loan servicing providers have already taken steps to improve their services, which can only be expected to continue. Given the scope of their contact with borrowers, servicers are best placed to put forth initiatives to better inform and support borrowers to make successful loan payments.", "external_links": ["http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/cohort-default-rate-continues-drop-across-all-higher-ed-sectors", "https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven", "http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201509_cfpb_student-loan-servicing-report.pdf", "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/09/30/772409/10151201/en/Navient-statement-on-positive-trends-in-the-national-student-loan-Cohort-Default-Rate.html", "http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2015/looney-yannelis-student-loan-defaults", "https://www.credible.com/blog/lending-news/million-student-march-will-spotlight-rising-tuition-student-loan-debt/", "http://www2.ed.gov/documents/press-releases/strengthening-student-loan-system.pdf", "http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201509_cfpb_treasury_education-joint-statement-of-principles-on-student-loan-servicing.pdf", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/mortoutstand/current.htm"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:17:48.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
