PUBLISHED: 15:25, Mon, Oct 19, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:06, Mon, Oct 19, 2015 GETTY Britain's steel industry is under large pressure \nThe firm is owned by Labour peer Lord Paul and has around 20 sites in the country, including the West Midlands, and is the latest company to fall amid the pressure on the sector. Tata Steel is tomorrow expected to also announce the loss of 1,200 jobs in Scunthorpe and Scotland. It comes less than a week after 2,200 people were put out of work as a result of the closure of the Redcar steel and Iron plant in Teeside. The sector has been struggling amid a fall in metal prices, in part thanks to a drop in demand from China and developing economies.Higher energy prices and a strong pound have also factored into the industry's decline in the UK.
