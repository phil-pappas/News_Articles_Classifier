Kimberly-Clark regularly focuses on improving its products through innovation in order to remain competitive and drive growth.\nKimberly-Clark’s cost saving measures, regular innovations, growth initiatives and a strong international presence are strong pillars of the company and have been driving earnings for the past many quarters. However, much like the rest of the consumer staple companies, Kimberly-Clark remains exposed to currency headwinds and input cost inflation. Due to this, investors are eagerly awaiting Kimberly-Clark’s earnings report.\nInvestors should also note the recent earnings estimate revisions for KMB, as the consensus estimate has been moving slightly downwards. KMB has a mixed history in earnings season. KMB has delivered three positive and one negative surprise in the last four quarters, making for a positive average surprise of 3.39%.\nCurrently, KMB has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following Kimberly-Clark’s earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:\nEarnings: KMB beats on earnings. Our consensus called for EPS of $1.49, and the company posted adjusted EPS of $1.51 per share instead. Investors should note that these figures take out stock option expenses.\nRevenue: KMB posted revenues of $4.72 billion. This smoothly beats our consensus estimate of $4.65 billion.\nKey Stats to Note: Organic sales grew 5% in the quarter, which includes a 10% increase in developing and emerging markets. KMB has raised the lower end of its previous guidance ranges for full-year organic sales growth and adjusted earnings per share.\nStock Price: In-active in pre-market trading.\nCheck back later for our full write up on this KMB earnings report later!\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
