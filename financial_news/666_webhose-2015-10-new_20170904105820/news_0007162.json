Bills in a Republican-dominated Congress aimed at extending U.S. bankruptcy laws to the U.S. territory and giving it improved healthcare funding have not progressed.\nOther witnesses due to speak at Thursday's Senate hearing include Puerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Javier Garcia Padilla and Puerto Rico's representative in Congress Pedro Pierluisi.
