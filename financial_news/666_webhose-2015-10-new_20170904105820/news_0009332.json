We look forward to working closely with the local communities and government on this project.\"\nSummary Terms of the Agreement \nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Silver Standard will evaluate Chinchillas during the Preliminary Period as a mining operation to supply feed to the Pirquitas plant beginning in the second half of 2017. Silver Standard has committed to spend a minimum of $4 million for pre-development activities. Expenditures may total up to $12.6 million based on the success of the pre-development activities, including exploration, mine planning, metallurgical studies, permitting and engineering studies. The Preliminary Period extends for 18 months from the signing of the Agreement. \nSilver Standard has agreed to pay Golden Arrow up to C$2 million during the Preliminary Period in four C$500,000 cash installments with the first installment paid on signing and the remaining conditional upon completion of project milestones.
