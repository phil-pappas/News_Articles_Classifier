Photo: Supplied\nRunning a small business often feels like a frantic obstacle race.\nYou start a day with set hurdles to clear; last night's emails, stock orders, meetings.\nBy 10am more hurdles appear (customer complaints, staff absenteeism and that constant stream of emails) and, before you know it, your work day has lasted 14 hours.\nIt may seem counter-intuitive but here's why you must slow down if you want to go the distance in business.\nAdvertisement Business is not a speed event\nNobody sane would run the first five kilometres of an ultra-marathon at breakneck speed.\nLikewise, stop thinking of your business as a sprint, says corporate coach Louise D'Allura.\n\"We become less productive when we are exhausted, which is why it is important to think about the practices we put in our businesses to ensure we can pace ourselves for the long-haul,\" D'Allura says.\nFounder of Blue Clay Creatives and Mind Body Business, Laticia Gibson agrees.\nBosses who want to avoid burn-out must make time to warm up, says the former TV journalist.\n\"All small business owners have to slow down, particularly in the first few years,\" Gibson says.\n\"There is so much pressure financially and what you put on yourself but we often put high priorities on areas [of our businesses] that may not really need as much focus.\"\nOverwork makes you sick\nWorking non-stop will eventually kill motivation, no matter how gung-ho you are when you start.\nIt is can also cause insomnia and gastro-intestinal illness, D'Allura says.\nSo if you want to stay in tip-top physical and mental health – essential in any healthy business – make your own body's wellbeing a high commercial priority.\nDean Ramler, founder of Milan Direct , admits he never took breaks in the early days of his business but paid a price with his health.\n\"I literally worked until I fell asleep at my desk,\" Ramler says. \"But I started to get sick often and found my productivity dropping so I knew I had to make a change, not slow down completely but take time off every now and then to recharge.\"\nRamler took up paddle boarding and says his business has benefited.\n\"After getting out in the ocean I come back into the office fully re-charged and much more productive so I highly recommend taking the foot off the pedal every now and then for the best interest of your business.\"\nOnline is tool, not master\n\"This digital distraction has added a whole other level to a small business owner's availability and made it very challenging for some bosses to turn-off and set limits to their social media use,\" D'Allura says.\n\"I have worked in this space for two decades and the message is everyone is stressed about working longer hours and concerned that online is blurring boundaries between our personal and work lives.\n\"I have also seen absenteeism become a big issue when bosses work even if physically unwell because they are anxious about going off-line.\"\nOffline brains are smarter\nLogging off for a work break and doing something creative like drawing or gardening has been proven to benefit the brain by working both its hemispheres, Catriona Pollard, founder of CP Communications, says.\nTaking time out from deadlines also lowers cortisol, the \"stress hormone\", and engaging in relaxing, enjoyable activities heightens levels of oxytocin and serotonin in the brain.\nResearch by King's College London psychologist Dr Glenn Wilson found the average worker's IQ fell by 10 points when distracted by incoming emails and ringing phones.\n\"It's important for us to strengthen the part of our brains that not only engages with logic and problem solving, but also taps into the creative and imaginative side of our minds,\" Pollard says.\n\"Set times for your email responses,\" D'Allura adds. \"Set times for work breaks and take them.\n\"If you know what your priorities are, you must remember that they [the incoming emails] are other people's priorities, not yours.\"\nBusy can be counter-productive\nAre you feeling like a rat in a wheel? Your business is probably suffering.\nWhen people feel too busy they often lose focus, spend too long on dead-end tasks and avoid making decisions.\n\"When people hit overwhelmed they often don't know what to focus on,\" says life coach Deb Drechsler of Diamond Mastery. \"Their goals become fuzzy. They really don't know what to do.\"\nSmelling roses takes time\nWhy did you go into business? It was presumably to create a work-life aligned with your personal priorities including time to enjoy the spoils of your toil.\nMelbourne business coach Maureen Pound smells her own entrepreneurial roses by booking her family commitments, personal appointments including haircuts and massages and holidays into a calendar at the start of every year.\n\"This way they become a priority and you then book all your work commitments around that and try not to change too many,\" Pound says.\n\"It cuts down on the stress of juggling and the more you stick to it, the happier and healthier you will be, the more proactive you will be at work when you are there and it's also good for business and business planning, as everyone knows from early on when the boss is available and can work with that.\"", "external_links": ["https://kn184.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/14903/e85d597568e66ed4/757205/a6497a60da5b722a", "https://kn184.infusionsoft.com/app/linkClick/14901/79a62d13b1d46eb9/757205/a6497a60da5b722a"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:27:34.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
