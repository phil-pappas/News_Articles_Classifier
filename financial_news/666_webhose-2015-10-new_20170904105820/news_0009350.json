Photo: Josh Robenstone\nIncoming ANZ Bank chief Shayne Elliott has signalled a new phase in the bank's overseas expansion, flagging more-judicious use of capital as it faces pressure to lift returns in its Asian businesses.\nMr Elliott, currently chief financial officer, said another top priority would be to lift the \"urgency\" in the bank's response to the threat of new technology-based challengers.\nMike Smith will step down at the end of this year after eight years at the helm of ANZ, which has significantly lifted its presence in countries in the region under his watch.\nShayne Elliott says rising to the threat of new technology-based challengers will be a priority. Photo: ANZ\nDuring Mr Smith's time in charge, ANZ's total annual profits have increased from $3.9 billion to more than $7 billion and the amount of capital it is holding has doubled in response to tougher regulatory demands.\nAdvertisement A former HSBC banker, Mr Smith has been the most outspoken big-four boss, and who also oversaw regional expansion through acquisitions including Asian retail and commercial banking businesses previously owned by RBS.\nWith economic growth slowing and banks facing tougher regulations that crunch returns, Mr Elliott said he would \"tweak\" aspects of its strategy rather than make major change, highlighting \"capital discipline\".\n\"The opportunity remains valid but the way we operate has to change,\" he said of the bank's approach to Asia.\n\"We remain totally committed to the opportunity but we need to redress the way – and our focus on capital discipline, allocation of resources, and rethink.\"\nHe said expanding the Australian business, which still drives the bulk of ANZ's profits, would remain a high priority and there would be little change in how it used capital domestically.\nAlthough ANZ said there would be no wholesale shift in strategy, analysts and fund managers expect Mr Elliott will place a greater emphasis on extracting higher returns from ANZ's Asian businesses, which are less profitable than its domestic arm.\nWith profit margins coming under pressure from a wave of global money targeting Asia, ANZ's return on equity of 14.7 per cent matched National Australia Bank as the equal lowest of the big four in the most recent half.\nCLSA banking analyst Brian Johnson said ANZ might become more \"laser-pointed\" in how it allocated capital within its Asian business, more closely targeting areas that provided the best returns.\n\"What they're trying to say today is that they've built it [the Asian business] and now they've got to optimise it,\" Mr Johnson said.\nSimon Bonouvrie, a portfolio manager at Cadence Asset Management backed the appointment of Mr Elliott, who he said was likely to focus on improving returns from the Asian business.\n\"Mike Smith had a mandate to grow ANZ throughout Asia. Now it's about getting the returns necessary for shareholders on their Asian strategy,\" Mr Bonouvrie said.\nMr Elliott joined ANZ Bank in 2009 as the head of its institutional bank, which plays a central role in its \"super-regional\" strategy.\nBorn in New Zealand, the 51-year old has been chief financial officer since 2012, and previously worked at the investment bank EFG-Hermes, and global giant Citi.\nHe also nominated technology as one of his top priorities for the bank, saying he wanted to increase \"the pace and urgency around digital and innovation\" as lenders faced growing competition from digital sources.\nWith all lenders looking to curb expenses, Watermark Funds Management investment analyst Omkar Joshi said Mr Elliott may also take a tighter approach to costs.\n\"To improve returns and lower risk the bank needs to be really picky about the business it takes and how quickly it grows,\" Mr Joshi said.\nAnalysts also expect Mr Elliott will put a focus on selling minority stakes in banks that ANZ holds in Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.\nCapital rules introduced since the global financial crisis have made it less profitable for banks to hold minority stakes in businesses overseas.\nChairman David Gonski said the board had chosen Mr Elliott for his \"deep knowledge\" of ANZ, strategic vision, alongside an understanding of the challenges facing ANZ and the Australian economy.\nMr Gonski said the bank's strategy of exploiting the growing regional trade and investment flows would \"evolve\" rather than change radically under Mr Elliott, as banks faced a more difficult economic, competitive and regulatory environments.\n\"In my opinion we are entering a period where basically there's not only great opportunities, but there's also great things that if you get wrong, will be difficult for banks,\" Mr Gonski said.\n\"His challenge will be to take what we've got and basically turn to advantage with maybe tougher times ahead generally in the economy, people who are wanting to take the more profitable bits of our business streams and so on.\"\nMr Smith will remain chief executive until the end of this year, then become a non-executive director on the board, which is retaining him for his Asian experience and contacts.\nANZ shares have been hit especially hard by recent volatility because of its Asian exposure, plunging 24 per cent from their peak earlier this year. ANZ shares rose 1.6 per cent, or 44¢, to $27.52 on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:23:27.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
