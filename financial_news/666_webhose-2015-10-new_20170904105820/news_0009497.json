There was the Prime Minister: in a blue button-down shirt with a barrel cuff, not a cufflink in sight. Clearly, he's been reading AFR Weekend ...\nLook: no cufflinks on PM @TurnbullMalcolm after this suggestion by @mrjoeaston http://t.co/tuRrSDx8J6 #auspol #NRLGF pic.twitter.com/3vTqLRe1ij\n— Will Glasgow (@wmdglasgow) October 4, 2015 Aston:\nSir David Tang recently observed in the FT that \"concerning white shirts, the problem is that waiters and salesmen wear them\" and advocated a man smatter his wardrobe judiciously with its blue cousin. But then Sir David is a teetotaller, so what would he know…\nGlasgow:\nThe PM was in good spirits, effusive about his new iPhone 6S (\"Much better for reading\") and the rail service (\"better than being stuck on a congested road\")…\n one of the good things about trains is chance encounters - joining us at Redfern @wmdglasgow from @FinancialReview pic.twitter.com/WR3Mx9Qglq\n— Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) October 4, 2015 Aston:\nBut then there's no chance of running into a marauding journalist on the leather-upholstered German back seat of C1. You can even listen to Mahler…\nGlasgow:\nUpon arrival, the PM set off for NRL chairman John Grant 's nook, joining his Health, Sport and (don't forget) Aged Care Minister Sussan Ley , Defence Minister Marise Payne and NSW Sports Minister Stuart Ayres , his boss, NSW Premier, Mike Baird, (he – according to the Daily Telegraph – of Pyongyang-esque tendencies), Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk , their respective Governors, David Hurley and Paul de Jersey , Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill (kingmaker of Woodside's $11.6 billion tilt for Oil Search), former Prime Minister John Howard, Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove , NSW Labor leader Luke Foley and, despite his company's stated preference for Aussie rules, the Tele 's editor, Paul \"Boris\" Whittaker (who wasn't in Melbourne at Saturday's AFL grand final ).\nWe watched Johnathan Thurston 's heroics from other, less crowded private terraces over the way, first with Telstra and later at NSW Business Chamber boss Stephen Cartwright 's superb spot – where the pies were plentiful and former Treasurer Joe Hockey , Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce and Bronco-turned-senator Glenn Lazarus were helping make those pies less plentiful. The pomp was minimal – just the thing when the game's that good.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm", "https://twitter.com/wmdglasgow/status/650818717467570176", "https://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://t.co/WR3Mx9Qglq", "https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm/status/650570888123813888", "https://twitter.com/FinancialReview", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NRLGF?src=hash", "http://t.co/3vTqLRe1ij", "https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "http://t.co/tuRrSDx8J6", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:11:38.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
