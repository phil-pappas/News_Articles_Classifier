Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Sydney's inner west suburb of Rozelle and Melbourne's Toorak, while more well-known for mansions and terraced houses, have topped the list for the best value in apartment investments.\nInvestors looking for apartments which have capital growth and rising rents include Rozelle, Toorak and Burpengary in Brisbane, according to Domain Group's senior economist Dr Andrew Wilson.\nThose looking for strong rental yields should head to the western suburbs in Sydney, such as Mount Druitt or Auburn, Beenleigh and Kangaroo Point in Brisbane or Broadmeadows and Cranbourne in Melbourne.\n\"Rozelle is not a very apartment suburb. Most apartments are in resort-style complexes with great water views and high strata fees,\" Sydney inner west property agent Cobden & Hayson's Matt Hayson said.\n\"But vacancy in these apartments is low and you can lease out a two-bedroom for $900 a week.\"\nThe list shows suburbs in the major capital cities with rising \"asking rents\" in the six-month period to September 2015.\nSuburbs in Sydney that exceed the average yield of 4 per cent make the list. In Melbourne, the criteria is 4.5 per cent and in Brisbane, 5 per cent.\nIt also compares capital values of rental apartments between the six month period to September in 2014 and 2015.\n \"Rents are growing stronger in outer Sydney particularly in the west because of cheaper housing and higher affordability. There's also a shortage of rental properties out there,\" Dr Wilson said.\n\"The capital growth for these outer areas come from central Sydney tailwinds.\"\nWhile Sydney is the strongest property market nationally - dwelling values in Sydney have increased nearly 20 per cent in the past year - apartment investors will find the best values in Melbourne.\nUnits with growth and rising rents are closer to the CBD and amenities like schools compared to Sydney. Suburbs include Ringwood, Mt Waverley and Boxhill.\nToorak was the surprising entrant on the list for Melbourne.\n\"People forget that Toorak has a lot of older rental stock,\" Dr Wilson said.\nInvestors should buy in Brisbane CBD, West End and Fortitude Valley if they want both good yields and growth in Brisbane.\nBut while Brisbane and Melbourne are more affordable, there is a fear of an oversupply of apartments in the two cities, which could drag apartment values down in the short term.\n\"While the housing market remains a long way from oversupply nationwide, some geographic areas appear to be reaching that point, particularly the inner-city areas of Melbourne and Brisbane,\" the Reserve Bank of Australia said in its latest Financial Stability Review.\n\"Apartment approvals remain at very high levels in these areas, even though these rental markets already look soft; apartment prices have been little changed in the past year, rental vacancy rates are relatively high and growth in rents is subdued.\"\nOversupply could pose a problem for investors with a short or medium term view in the two cities. Long term hold produces results, Dr Wilson said.\nOver a 20-year period, apartments grew over 300 per cent in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. In Brisbane and Adelaide, it was over 200 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-16T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:51.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
