Investors have been giving most IPOs a cold reception since the stock market plunged in August.\nFirst Data, controlled by private equity firm KKR & Co LP , was hoping to raise as much as $3.7 billion. It raised $2.56 billion by selling 160 million shares at $16 per share, below its previously indicated $18 to $20 per share range. This gives the company a market capitalization of $14 billion and a value of $35 billion when debt is included.\nAlbertsons, backed by buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, decided to delay the pricing of its IPO. It was hoping to raise as much as $2 billion, but a disappointing Wal- Mart Stores Inc outlook on Wednesday weighed on investor sentiment and drove Albertsons peer Kroger Co's shares down 3 percent on the day.\nAlbertsons will now attempt to price its IPO tomorrow, though it is ready to delay the offering further if the market sentiment continues to be negative, according to people familiar with the deliberations who would only discuss them on the condition of anonymity.\nNext week, Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari has scheduled to price its IPO in the United States in a range of between $48 and $52 per share, which could value the company at up to $9.8 billion.
