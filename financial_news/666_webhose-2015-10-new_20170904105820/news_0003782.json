Matthew Lloyd \"The global economy is in serious trouble as emerging markets have basically taken a major turn down.\"\n\"We are flying at close to stall speed,\" Dr Summers said in Washington at the Center for American Progress business and economic policy conference.\nFormer treasurer Wayne Swan was among those listening in the audience.\nAcross town at the Peterson Institute for International Economics no more than an hour later, the International Monetary Fund's recently departed chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, was more sanguine.\n The US-based Frenchman said the risks to the global economy were a \"little bit lower\" than six months ago.\n\"I have become convinced that the risk of a major decrease in growth in the short term in China is very, very small,\" Dr Blanchard said.\nThe recent stock market correction and slowing growth in China, combined with a mooted increase in US interest rates before the end of the year, have been two of the top risks identified by skittish investors in recent months.\nTumbling commodity prices have also hurt exporters from Russia to Brazil, and advanced economies including Australia and Canada.\nAppearing alongside Dr Blanchard on Wednesday, IMF financial counsellor José Viñals said global financial stability was \"not yet assured\" because of the rising risks in emerging market economies, including slower growth and high corporate debt levels in China, Turkey, Thailand, Brazil and Indonesia.\nHe said low commodity prices, such as for oil and iron ore, were probably the \"new normal\".\nThe IMF this month downgraded its 2015 global growth forecast to 3.1 per cent, in what would be the weakest expansion since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009.\nThe IMF calculates there is a $US3 trillion credit excess among businesses in developing economies, based on credit-to-GDP compared to long run trends.\nThe fund is conscious that an increase in US interest rates and rising American dollar could render those firms financially distressed as they struggle to repay unhedged US-dollar borrowing.\nFed chair Janet Yellen said last month she expects to raise interest rates before the end of the year. However, an ostensible slowing in the US economy has bond traders betting there is only about a 30 per cent chance of a December rate increase. The odds of a Fed tightening at its meeting next week are virtually zero.\nFormer Fed chair Ben Bernanke was tight-lipped on what the Fed should do when pressed at an event in New York on Wednesday morning.\n\"I don't want to second guess Janet,\" Dr Bernanke reportedly said.\nHe has previously backed the Fed's decision not to raise rates in September.\nMr Summers, who Congress blocked from becoming Fed chairman, said US demand was too brittle, lamenting that growth was unlikely to exceed 2 per cent in annual terms in the second half of this year.\nHe said the government should take advantage of record low borrowing costs to upgrade roads, bridges and airports, to stimulate jobs and economic demand in the short term and add to the economy's long-term growth potential.\n\"The federal infrastructure investment was negative last year,\" Dr Summers said. \"That is crazy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:05:54.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
