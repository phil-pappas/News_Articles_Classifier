Many economists expect a first hike earlier next year. \nVlieghe said the Bank should \"wait and see\" before raising borrowing costs, prompting one lawmaker to brand him a dove for sounding so cautious about the outlook. \nVlieghe said \"one major risk is that global growth continues to disappoint,\" striking a more worried note about the risk of an impact on Britain from the world economy than most other policymakers at the BoE recently. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is one of the things that will prevent the UK economy from accelerating meaningfully\" from its current pace of growth, he said. \nScotiabank economist Alan Clarke said Vlieghe did not look like \"a die-hard dove\" like Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist who has said the BoE's next move could be a rate cut. \nInstead, Vlieghe could prove to be one of the Bank's more proactive members, backing loose policy now but possibly shifting quickly to support tighter policy in future, he said. \nOnly one of the BoE's nine rate setters, Ian McCafferty, has voted to raise rates in recent months. \nMcCafferty, who also spoke to parliament's Treasury Committee on Tuesday, sounded less worried than Vlieghe about the risks to Britain from the global economy and said the pressures pushing down on inflation were transitory. \nHe said there was a greater risk of inflation rising up above the BoE's 2 percent target than undershooting it. \nWhen Vlieghe joined the Bank of England, he was allowed to keep a financial interest in his past employer, hedge fund Brevan Howard, where traders bet on interest rate moves. \nBut after that arrangement was criticised, Vlieghe said he would sever all links with the firm to avoid \"any mistaken impression\" of conflict of interest. \nAsked about the issue on Tuesday, he told lawmakers there was misunderstanding in the reporting of his links to the fund but he could understand why some people had questions. \nVlieghe said the net amount he would receive from selling his interest was a \"couple of hundred thousand pounds\" which was \"an amount of money that I would rather have than not have.\" (Additional reporting by David Milliken and Sarah Young; Writing by William Schomberg; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:55:56.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
