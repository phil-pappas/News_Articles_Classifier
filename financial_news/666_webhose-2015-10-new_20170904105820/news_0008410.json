Last year, Santander and Halifax (who both offer rewards) performed best in terms of enticing switching customers. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and Natwest sat at the bottom of the pile, and it’s no coincidence that this year, they've introduced new reward schemes to persuade customers to stay. \nThese cashback reward accounts are great for customers who are on top of their finances and remain in credit. However, for those who are likely to be overdrawn, the rewards can be wiped out completely. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \n= Best (LSE: 0M1A.L - news ) cashback reward accounts = \nSantander’s 123 account offers 1pc cashback on water and council tax bills. If you’ve got a mortgage with Santander, you’ll also get 1pc cashback on the first £1,000. The account pays back 2pc on gas and electricity bills and 3pc on phone bills (mobile and landline), broadband and TV packages. \nCustomers also get a generous 3pc interest on balances between £3,000 and £20,000, making this the top cashback paying account. \nThere is a charge of £2 a month, but this should be covered by the cashback. The fee will be upped to £5 from 11 January, so customers need to work out if they are spending enough each month to benefit from the rewards. \nCustomers also need to pay in £500 each month and set up two direct debits. \nNatwest/RBS are the latest providers to offer a cashback reward scheme. It’s available from 12 October and is similar to the Santander account, paying 3pc cashback on household bills. Plus, it only costs £3 a month. \nThe bank said that customers can earn up to £90 cashback a year, minus the fee. \nTSB’s Classic Plus account pays 5pc on the first £100 of contactless payments spent each month until December 2016. Plus, customers can earn 5pc on balances up to £2,000 if they register for internet banking and paperless statements. If you had a balance of £3,000 you would earn £80 in a year after tax. \nThe Blue Rewards account from Barclays costs £3 a month, but pays £7 back . Customers must set up two direct debits and pay in £800 each month. You can earn £5 a month if you have a Barclays mortgage and a further £3 a month if you take out its contents insurance. Barclays also pay an average of 4pc cashback if you shop online with its partners and 7pc cashback on Expedia (Swiss: EXPE.SW - news ) bookings. \nTo get the monthly £5 cashback from Halifax , customers must pay in £750 a month and set up two direct debits. Halifax’s Reward Cashback account pays £60 a year in total, but it’s not a great option for those who have problems staying in credit, as by being overdrawn by just one day a month will cancel out the reward. \nWhile it doesn't technically offer cashback, Tesco’s current account rewards customers in clubcard points when you spend in and out of Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) . You get one point for every £4 you spend in store and one point for every £8 you spend anywhere else. The account also pays 3pc on balances up to £3,000. \nHave a question for our experts?
