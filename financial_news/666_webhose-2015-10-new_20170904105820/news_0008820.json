Airport management attributed the increase to a 12% YOY growth in travel of Hong Kong residents and a “significant” rise in arrivals and departures from Japan and Southeast Asia.\nAircraft movements increased 3.3% to 33,085 compared to September 2014, and transfer traffic also saw a solid 7% YOY rise.\nIn the first nine months of 2015, HKIA saw an overall passenger growth of 8.4% with 51.2 million using the airport, and flight movement growth of 4% with a recorded 301,790 aircraft using the facility.\nCompared to the previous 12 months, passenger volume grew 8% to 67.3 million overall, and flight movements increased 4.2% to 402,635.\nBucking recent cargo trends, HKIA also saw modest growth in freight figures. September cargo volumes were up 1.1% year-on-year to 368,000 tonnes after several months of slumping figures.\nHKIA management said the rebound in air cargo was primarily due to a 3% YOY growth in exports from the region, despite negligible growth in imports and a drop in trans-shipment volume of 3% YOY.\nOn a rolling 12-month basis, cargo handled grew 1.3% to 4.4 million tonnes overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:18:23.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
