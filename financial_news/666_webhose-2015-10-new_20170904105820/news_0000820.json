Electra's board of directors said it unanimously recommended shareholders vote against both resolutions. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Electra, which owns restaurant chain TGI Fridays in Britain, were up almost 2 percent by 0912 GMT, outperforming a 0.2 percent fall in the FTSE 250. \nElectra Chairman Roger Yates told Reuters that three shareholder advisory firms - PIRC, ISS and Glass Lewis - had told him they recommended shareholders vote against activist Bramson's election to the board. Yates said the firms informed him of this in a phone call about a week ago. \n\"If someone wants to change what we're doing, they'd better be pretty explicit about how they can add value to a greater extent than we are doing. Sherborne and Bramson have signally failed to do that,\" Yates told Reuters in a telephone interview. \nSherborne declined to comment. London-based PIRC, and U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . firms ISS and Glass Lewis, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nElectra had previously said the meeting would take place on Nov. 5 - or Bonfire Night in Britain, when firework celebrations commemorate the day around four hundred years ago that a plot to blow up Parliament was foiled. \nElectra has faced its own upheaval with an increasingly bitter dispute with Bramson that has lasted for well over a year. In October 2014 shareholders voted against a string of proposals from Bramson which promised to more than double Electra's market value, in a London meeting that lasted less than an hour. \nSince Sherborne first revealed a holding in February last year it has become Electra's largest shareholder with a 29.75 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data. \nUnder British law, a shareholder must launch a mandatory takeover offer once a holding reaches 30 percent. However in a prospectus document for a share issue this year, Sherborne said it could only acquire up to 29.9 percent of shares in the target company. \nLast year Electra said it would conduct a review of the fees, capital structure and distribution policy that had been criticised by Bramson. It has since introduced changes including slashing management fees and said it will return 3 percent of NAV per year to shareholders via dividend or buybacks. \nElectra said it would pay a final dividend of 78 pence per share, taking the total dividend to 116 pence for the year ending Sept. 2015. \nDiluted NAV rose 25 percent to an all-time high of 3,914 pence a share, which Electra said was helped by a series of portfolio realisations. The company said it had invested 188 million pounds ($288 mln) and sold 259 million pounds' worth of assets. \nLast year it posted a 15 percent rise in diluted NAV. \nYates and the full board of Electra last met with Edward Bramson on July 9. Bramson subsequently met with Senior Independent Director Kate Barker and board member Geoffrey Cullinan on Aug. 5. \nBramson requested last year that Cullinan be removed from the board as part of his planned shake-up.
