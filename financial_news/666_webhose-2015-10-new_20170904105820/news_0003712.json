The enhancement incorporates an array of new content including FX Instruments, FX Transaction & Translation Risk, Intercompany Lending, Market Regulations, Emerging Market Risk, and Trading & Information Platforms. \n“The integration of CitiFX Corporate Risk Management survey content into Citi Treasury Diagnostics is a significant advancement,” said Erik Johnson, Senior Strategist for CitiFX Risk Management Solutions. “With many leading multinationals reassessing their risk management programs, this enhancement helps us better serve Citi clients as they evaluate current treasury practices and refine their strategies.” \nThe new unified offering will provide clients with a comprehensive view into treasury practices and processes, deliver deeper insights on their performance, and ultimately facilitate speedier progress toward achieving a world-class treasury function. \n“Many companies have already leveraged CTD in their process of treasury transformation,” said Ron Chakravarti, Global Head of Citi’s Treasury Advisory Group in Treasury and Trade Solutions. “Adding this depth in risk management to established CTD areas - from liquidity to working capital management - allows us to put an even more valuable discovery tool in the hands of our clients”. \nCiti Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) enables our clients' success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe.
