Photo: Peter Rae\nIOOF says it will \"vigorously defend\" any claim brought against the company, including a planned class action being run by Maurice Blackburn that could burn a $100 million hole in the company's bottom line.\nOn Thursday, Fairfax Media revealed Maurice Blackburn was preparing a class action against the financial services giant\nThe planned action follows an investigation by Fairfax Media that exposed insider trading, faulty research reports and misrepresentation of performance figures to customers .\nIn a brief statement to the Australian Securities Exchange on Thursday afternoon, IOOF said it rejected the allegation that it breached its continuous disclosure obligations or engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct.\nAdvertisement \"IOOF is confident that the proposed action described by Maurice Blackburn is misconceived both factually and at law,\" the company statement says.\nThe company described the action as purely speculative and \"not in IOOF shareholders' interests\". It did not comment on whether it would be in the interest of the investors that fled the company after the airing of the allegations.\nThe statement said IOOF complies with the law in regards to continuous disclosure obligations and \"rejects any suggestion that its approach is inadequate\".\nThe Fairfax Media investigation showed IOOF had investigated a senior executive at least three times between 2008 and December 2014 over front running and forcing his direct reports to cheat on his compliance exams on his behalf.\nThat executive was never sacked but given first and final warnings.\nThe investigation also revealed allegations IOOF's compliance and control mechanisms within its research department were poor and many staff in its research department were allegedly not compliant with regulatory guidelines on research report providers.\nIOOF's shares plunged as much as 21 per cent when the story broke on June 23 . The shares clawed back slightly on that day to close down 13.3 per cent at $9.24, representing a $426 million hit to IOOF shareholders.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/ioof-racks-up-breaches-and-errors-20150622-ghuou9.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:26:48.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
