Countries have proven the IMF wrong. It is up to us to say that we cannot continue borrowing for commercial projects, give it to SOEs (State Owned Enterprises) and they don't pay back, that is how you end up at 70 percent, that is how you end up at 75 percent and that is how you end up being HIPC.' \nHe said the country's debt increased because of new loans and disbursement of existing loans. \nThe paradox of borrowing vis-a-vis assurances \nGovernment is also preparing to borrow more to service and re-service debts. \nRecently, it issued a 3-year fixed rate bond to the general public to mobilize GH¢1.5 billion for the restructuring of government debt and also for maturity settlement after it floated a $1 billion (approximately GH¢3.8 billion) Eurobond on the international market which has already hit Bank of Ghana account. \nMore loans Per its Issuance Calendar of Securities, government has planned to receive GH¢2.4 billion from its 91-day T-bills, GH¢800 million from 182-day T-bills, GH¢120 million from 1-year note, GH¢300 million from 2-year note and GH¢1 billion from 3-year fixed rate bond, all totaling GH¢4.62 billion this month. \nIn November, Government planned to collect GH¢2.4 billion from investors through its 91-day T-bills, GH¢1 billion from the 182-day T-bills, GH¢180 million through its 1-year note and GH¢300 million through the 2-year note. \nFor December, an amount of GH¢4.16 billion is expected from investors made up of GH¢3 billion in 91-day T-bills, GH¢800 million from 182-day T-bills, GH¢60 million in 1-year note and GH¢300 million in 2-year note. \nBy Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:26:35.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
