Selecting consumer action cameras should start with what the camera is being used for, says owner of Camzilla, Barry Jacobs. \"Mountain-bikers will be concerned with image stabilisation, while people who do water sports are focused on a good case,\" Jacobs says.\nJacobs' Sydney-based company sells action cameras and custom mounts, and he says action cameras are predominantly marketed by video specifications.\nWhile the camera has to stay dry and be mounted on the person or the equipment, the cameras must also capture images at both high resolution (for good playback on television) and at high frames-per-second (fps) to allow for slow-motion.\nBut the highest, 4K resolution (4000 pixels) should not be the sole criteria for an action cam, says owner of Sports Camera, Petra Keranen. She says 4K is limited by the lack of screens to play it on, and it has editing limitations. \"The built-in editing software on personal computers can't digest the 4K files.\"\nSony 4K Action Cam. 4K filming quickly maxes SD cards, and the cameras only manage 30fps when used in 4K mode. She says a camera that shoots at 1080 high definition, and at 60fps, is \"plenty good enough\".\n\"The Hero+ LCD shoots at 1080 resolution and fast enough so you can make slow-mo videos,\" Keranen says. \"It's easy to use and it's mid-range.\"\nAction cams are also ranked by size and weight. All of the bestsellers weigh under 90 grams. This should be remembered when looking at a Drift, which is about180g, or the Garmin VIRB at 200g; GoPros and Sonys require waterproof cases, increasing their weight, while the JVC Adixxion (waterproof to 5m), the Replay XD (3m) and Contour (3m) are waterproof as is.\nUsability factor HERO4 Silver; Standard Housing \"Action Cam\" Carter Dow Photography The 'usability' factor is also important. Snow sports people don't want to be in and out of their gloves to fiddle with settings, hence the 'loop' feature. With loop the camera shoots continuously and when you want to record, you hit the loop button and the last 20 to 120 seconds is captured and filed. Most action cams don't have screens so users can be unaware if the camera is recording. Such cameras – e.g. Sonys and most GoPros – tether to your smartphone allowing you to record, playback and adjust settings. But overdoing the smartphone playback drains battery life from the camera. Many users carry extra batteries, but some action cams (such as the Replay XD) have built-in batteries, reducing effective use.\nYou'll also need mounts that match your activity. The major brands have patented mounting systems, meaning after-market accessories bought on the internet don't always interoperate. All mounts are not created equal: the 'tube' action cams – such as Replay and Contour – have more positions than the GoPro because they rotate to any angle.\nBe aware that audio quality varies wildly among the cameras, and most perform badly once in their waterproof cases. There are also different definitions of wide angle lens, and if you want to be in your own movie then you need a lens that sees wide enough to get some of your body in the frame.\nAnd just like a real movie, you can never discount the value of the editing. \"Those GoPro marketing videos playing in the camera store are not raw footage,\" says Barry Jacobs, with a chuckle. \"It's all post-processed. You have to learn the software to get the best from these cameras.\"\nHero 4 Go Pro \"Action Cam story\". Top Shelf\nGoPro Hero4 Black: at about$750 the Hero4 Black is the most expensive GoPro. It shoots 4K at 30fps and 1080 at 120fps. Waterproof to 40m with inbuilt WiFi and Bluetooth and neat stuff like GoPro editing apps and Highlight Tags. Sony X1000V: costs $699, the Sony uses an image processor similar to the GoPro and shoots 4K at 30fps/1080 at 120. Weighs 86g, easy to use and has WiFi, NFC and GPS. GoPro Hero4 Session: shoots 1080 at 60fps, is half the size of a Hero, and 40 per cent of its weight, while retaining most features of the Hero4 Black. $550. Mid-level\nGoPro Hero4 Silver: second-billing to the Black because it only shoots 1080 resolution at 60fps. But the 'Silver' has a touch-screen making it easy to use. Under $500. GoPro Hero+ LCD: at $439, great value for money. Shoots 1080 at 60fps (720 at 120 fps); WiFi and Bluetooth and waterproof to 40m. LCD screen is a winner. Drift Ghost-S: uses the Sony CMOS image processor and has up to 160º field of vision; waterproof to 3m, shoots 1080 at 60fps and 12mp stills, and has a screen. It's relatively heavy, but the 3.5-hour battery is industry-best. Sony AS200V GPS: the 170º field of vision includes you in your own film. WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth connects it to smartphone, Steady Shot makes all the HD footage clear, and it geo-tags. Sony audio is the best. Under $400. Replay XD 1080 Mini: lightest action cam in Australia. HD shooting with 30fps, very simple to use and easy to find record button. Millions of positions thanks to mounting system. Under $300. Budget cams\nContour Roam3: shoots 1080 at 30fps; built-in battery, 10m waterproof. Loads of features, incredible value at under $200. Navig8r HD Wi-Fi: 1080 recording at 60fps, with loop function and screen. $193 3SIXT Sport Action Camera: 720 HD at 30fps. Touch screen, waterproof. $39 (at Dick Smith online) Target Full HD 1080P Action Camera: waterproof, 1080 action camera with a bag full of mounts and a micro SD card. $49.
