It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) now offers all this material online and digitally through a service called Lexis Nexis. \nLaw firms and accountancies pay subscription fees so that their staff can access the latest information. \nIn the medical world the company owns well known reference brands such as Grey’s Anatomy and medical journal The Lancet. \nRELX (LSE: REL.L - news ) has a small army of specialists collecting data and then creating easily-searchable databases. \nThe business has been a steady performer this year. Group revenue has increased 3pc in the nine months to the end of September. \nThe company’s risk and business information division showed the fastest growth, with revenue up 7pc, while the legal division was slower with 1pc revenue growth, and the science, technical and medical division increased revenue by 2pc. \nRELX is forecast to generate £1.7bn in pre-tax profits, giving 61p in earnings per share, from £6.1bn of revenue in the year to the end of December. \nThe profit margin of about 30pc should be defendable as it is difficult for competitors to replicate the army of researchers who have the technical knowledge required. \nThe company also generates plenty of cash, which covers the dividend payments more than twice. The shares are expected to pay a 28.9p dividend this year, offering a prospective yield of 2.5pc. The payout is set to increase by 6pc a year. \nThe company isn’t risk-free as the accounting and law industries are always exposed to economic downturns, when layoffs will reduce the number of subscriptions required for the LexisNexis service. The shares suffered a five-year slump after the 2008 credit crisis, when profits halved. \nThe shares also command a premium to the wider market, trading on 19 times forecast earnings, falling to 17 times next year. However, this remains one to hold for the long term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:20:14.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
