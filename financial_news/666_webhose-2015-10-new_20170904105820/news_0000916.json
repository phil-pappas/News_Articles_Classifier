Share on twitter by Kate Cowling The true level of debt within self-managed super funds is difficult to ascertain as the data is \"very, very confusing\", says Challenger's Jeremy Cooper.\nIn the wake of the government's rejection of a blanket ban on SMSF borrowing , Mr Cooper stressed the industry did not have a decent read on leverage.\n\"In this area the data is very, very confusing,\" the chairman of retirement income at Challenger told a panel session at the Citi Investment Conference in Sydney.\nAustralian Taxation Office records for June 2015 show the figure stands at $15.6 billion, which voices from the industry, including the Grattan Institute's Jim Minifie, have defended as a very small proportion of the sector's $572 billion in assets.\nJeremy Cooper said while he doesn't like leverage in SMSFs, \"the genie got well and truly out of the bottle around a decade ago\". Rob Homer But Mr Cooper said he was \"befuddled\" by the data and questioned if the information was an accurate representation, partly due to discrepancies with funds incorrectly filling out their paperwork.\n\"I have a bit of difficulty making sense of how much debt is there, how many assets are affected, the data does seem to be quite out of date. It does seem to be going up dramatically,\" he added. In March 2013 the SMSFs' collective debt level stood at $2.3 billion.\n'Out of the bottle' Mr Cooper said while he did not like leverage in SMSFs, \"the genie got well and truly out of the bottle around a decade ago\" and those reforming the system would face challenges reversing it, if they were to go down the path of grandfathering existing loans and trying to stop new loans.\nAndrea Slattery supports a crackdown on those encouraging others to set up SMSFs for reasons other than retirement. David Mariuz He said he broadly supported the Murray inquiry's \"watch this space\" and \"be alert but not alarmed\" recommendation for SMSFs borrowing for investment in property.\nThe SMSF Association's chief executive Andrea Slattery said while her organisation took an agnostic view on leverage, she supported a continued crackdown on parties encouraging people to set up SMSFs for reasons other than retirement income.\nShe said it was important regulators such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission received proper funding to investigate property spruikers, which she said the SMSF Association was currently providing information to the regulator on.\nMs Slattery stressed anybody providing advice on SMSFs, particularly when it came to limited recourse borrowing arrangements, needed to be licensed, given the potential risks from the arrangements.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:52:46.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
