Slow is healthy,\" he said. \nBut weak economic data from September has put stock markets on edge. \nImports sank 20.4 percent year-on-year to $145.2 billion last month, the government said Tuesday, in part due to weak commodity prices. \nConsumer inflation fell to 1.6 percent and the producer price index -- which measures the cost of goods at the factory gate -- dropped 5.9 percent, matching a six-year low in August. \nBut Industrial Bank chief economist Lu Zhengwei predicted the outlook to pick up later this year: \"Investment will be better than the third quarter and the loose monetary policy will start to take effect. \n\"At least the economy will not get worse.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:08:48.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
