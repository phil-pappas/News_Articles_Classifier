These facilities give parents who might not otherwise have the means to stay close by when their children need them most.\nReports from Ronald McDonald show that keeping families together during periods of critical care enhance the healing and recovery time of children receiving treatment. Last year alone, more than 5 million families around the world were able to stay close to their hospitalized child thanks to the efforts of the Ronald McDonald House.\n“The Ronald McDonald House not only improves outcomes for children, but helps keep families together during times of crisis, and that’s something we should all support,” says Misty Everette, owner and principal of the Misty Everette Agency. “We’re honored to work with the Ronald McDonald House, and we’ve been working day and night to explain to our community why this charity is so important.”\nEmploying a large network of contacts, the Everette Agency team contacted families, clients, and fellow community members throughout the Phoenix area in an effort to draw in support from nearby families. The team also used social media to reach communities across the state.\nOverall, Everette and her team are confident that the charity drive for the Phoenix chapter of the Ronald McDonald House charity was successful both in terms of donations generated and goodwill spread throughout the community. The team has renewed their commitment to working with at least one new charity in the Scottsdale area every two months.\nThose who wish to assist the Misty Everette Agency as they continue to raise donations and advocate for the Phoenix Ronald McDonald House are invited to visit their website and make a direct donation to the cause here: http://www.mistyeveretteagency.com/A-Home-Away-From-Home-for-Families-in-Need_19_community_cause .
