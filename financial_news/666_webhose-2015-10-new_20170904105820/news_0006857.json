In marketing speak you get all-new, which is a brand new platform, and you get new, which is not quite new, but rather a facelift. The Ranger is new. But it is not new in the way that some of the car makers have been introducing these life cycle improvements in recent years.\nGenerally those might be a headlight or additional interior trims. We often joke about one manufacturer which launched a new model that basically just had a different door handle. The Ranger has a great deal more than that, although the door handle is still the same.\nIt is also proudly South African. It continues to be built at the company’s plant in Silverton outside of Pretoria with the engines coming from the Ford engine plant in Struandale, Port Elizabeth. Silverton has now built more than 250,000 Rangers, with one coming off the line every two minutes. The company exports from SA to 148 countries and at the end of this year will also start exporting kits for assembly in Lagos, Nigeria.\nThe timing of the new Ranger is perfect. Toyota will launch its all-new Hilux early in 2016 and the Blue Oval is hoping to head that off and continue the success of its Ranger that has seen it trump the Hilux in the sales charts lately. Should Toyota be nervous? We have not seen the new Hilux in the metal yet so at the moment the answer is yes. The Ranger has always been good. The new one is better.\nThe major styling change up front is that new truck-like grille which takes it more into the realm of the Stateside pick-up and is available in either matt or chrome finishes. There are none of those lifestyle curves that have crept into bakkies in recent years. This thing looks like a truck. It has attitude, even more than the pre-facelift one. It will be interesting to see what the aftermarket industry will come up with for it. Apparently the bonnet is also new, but that is it for exterior changes. The exterior designer team did not have to work too hard this time.\nThe hard work was left to the interior designers and the engineers, because beneath the barely altered exterior things are different, particularly if you opt for the high specification models.\nThe refinement is most evident in the interior. The base model retains the old layout but as you move up the range you encounter a new level of fusion. Fusion? Yes, because you get many items from Ford’s executive sedan, particularly in the range topping Wildtrak.\nThis is possibly the most tech-rich bakkie in the world. It features a full digital dash which displays all your trip info, entertainment options and drive information. It also shows which driver assistance systems are available. These include lane keeping assist, forward alert with collision mitigation, driver fatigue alert, trailer sway control, trailer parking assistance and adaptive load control. You also get adaptive cruise control which allows you to set the speed and distance to the vehicle in front of you and let the computers manage everything while you are stuck in traffic. We should remind you this is a bakkie, not a German sedan.\nSome models also get Sync or the later generation Sync 2 infotainment system which allows you to manage all your audio, telephony and other requirements through a eight-inch touchscreen, through the multifunction steering wheel or by talking to it.\nThe engineers have also made the engines quieter, something that was evident while driving around the Western Cape. The suspension has apparently been tuned but the rear leaf springs were still prone to a bit of bouncing on some roads. The engine and body mounts are also new.\nThe 2.2l turbodiesel has been upgraded with power up to 118kW from the previous 110 and torque up to 385Nm from 375Nm. Power remains the same on the base 2.2 TDCI model. Power also remains the same on the 2.5 petrol and the 3.2 turbodiesel models.\nOur experience with the partly new Ranger took us into the mountains above Ceres. It was nothing too taxing but the bakkie handled it all with ease. Both manual and automatic variants provided good response and the 2.2 showed it is up to taking most adventurous types anywhere they want to go. Diehards will want the manual but the auto also did a great job. As is often the case, expect to put a few dents in the side steps though, which could get in the way of ground clearance.\nRear-wheel drive handled the early parts of the course but when things got a little trickier, four-wheel drive did its bit before the more serious climbs and rocks required going low. Still nothing too strenuous for the bakkie, it pulled itself up gradients with no problem. On the downhill, the hill descent control worked perfectly. There were a few nervous or inexperienced hacks ahead of me who kept touching the brakes but, quite honestly, the descent control could easily have taken us down the hill without a single sharp intake of breath.\nThe new Ranger is a benchmark in the one-tonne bakkie segment that accounts for about 20% of all passenger vehicle sales in SA. It starts at R212,900 for the 2.5 Base single cab 4x2 Low Rider, rising to R596,900 for the 3.2 TDCi Wildtrak 4x4 auto.\nWith the new Hilux waiting in the wings, the prospect of a new Nissan NP300 Navara next year and offerings from Mercedes, Hyundai and possibly Renault in future, it will be watched closely by rivals when it arrives in showrooms at the end of this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:45:54.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
