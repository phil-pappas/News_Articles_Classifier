With student loan debt exceeding $1 trillion in the U.S., equally as important as finding a school that's affordable is finding one where the earnings associated with the school's degree are significant enough to outweigh the costs of going there. \nPayScale , an online salary, benefits and compensation company, culled its 2015-2016 College Salary Report , released in August, for TheStreet, to find the college in each of the 50 states where the \"return on investment\" after 20 years was the highest. \nSo what does it really mean? Some schools are \"simply doing a better job of setting their alumni up for success in the job market ,\" PayScale said. \"Whether you're planning to study computer science or psychology, earning potential in your chosen field, along with the cost of attendance for the schools you're considering, should be part of the equation when whittling down your list of best return on investment colleges.\" More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:59:40.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
