Sanni \nThe Executive Chairman of Samara Company Limited, producers of Sasso Insecticide Spray and Coil, Mr. Samson Effah Apraku, last Saturday October 17, won the ‘Overall Achiever’ of the year award at the just ended 4th West African Regional Magazine Achievers Awards. \nThe award ceremony was held in Lagos, Nigeria, on the theme \"Agriculture in Poverty Alleviation and Economic Development\". \nThe Publisher of the West African Regional Magazine, Rossette Aliu, in an interview said the Award scheme was instituted four years ago to celebrate African Achievers, and also to encourage other West African businessmen and leaders to attain higher heights. \nShe said the selection of winners was done based on many factors; which includes the general performance of the company, the market leader, the product that everyone is talking about, and the economy aspect - the job opportunities offered by the organization. \n\"Therefore, the overall Achiever was chosen based on the factors mentioned, Mr. Apraku deserves it. His company is doing so well in Ghana and has already won many awards,\" Ms Aliu stated. \nIn a brief remark after receiving the award, the Executive Chairman of Sasso said he was convinced that his hard work over the many years has not been in vain. \nHe said the award is going to motivate him to even work harder to create various employment opportunities for more Ghanaian youth and also the youth of Nigerian, as Samara Company Limited is finding its way to Nigeria in the next few months. \nMr. Effah Apraku expressed gratitude to the Almighty God for the honour; and also thanked his wife, Mrs. Vida Apraku for her support and efforts in ensuring that Sasso remains the number one brand. \nIn all, Sasso won three awards: The Best Insecticide Brand of the year; The Emerging Group of the year and the Overall Achiever of the year won specifically by the Sasso Executive Chairman. \nThe Alase Orisa Agbaye II (Supreme Head if Deities Worldwide), Savedero I. The Baale of Gberefu Island, His Spiritual Eminence Nojeem A. M. Sanni, who was the Guest of Honour of the occasion, lauded the Sasso Executive Chairman and others who received various awards. \nHe said \"This is an opportunity to celebrate and honour the achievements of some West Africa's brightest luminaries, who have distinguished themselves in service to the continent and the world through their talent and ingenuity.\" \nSpeaking on agriculture, the Alase Orisa said the agriculture sector plays a significant role in the sustenance of Africa's growing population of about one billion. \nHe said though the majority of the total labour force of many African countries is employed in the agriculture sector, the sub-Saharan African region is still unable to feed its growing population. \nThe Alase Orisa lamented that the situation has left many African countries with no other option than to import over fifty percent of their nutritional needs of its population. \nHe described the situation as “an unsustainable state of affairs” and cautioned that there was an urgent need for African leaders to act quickly in salvaging a likely future of food insecurity in Africa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:21:50.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
