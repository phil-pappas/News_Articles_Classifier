Further, there would also be some demand from other interested parties,\" said George Boubouras, Contago chief investment officer.\nAnother institutional investor who asked not to be named said the IOOF bid, \"grossly underestimates the long-term value of the business\".\nIt is understood there was an institutional bidder represented by a brokerage firm with a bid in the market for shares at $2.75 before the offer was revealed.\n Funds management firms Acorn Capital, Contango Asset Management and Thorney Holdings, along with company insiders, hold the bulk of the HUB24 shares.\nHUB24 uses its own proprietary technology to provide portfolio management, transaction and reporting solutions for licensees, financial advisers, accountants, stockbrokers and institutions.\nA potential acquisition of HUB24 is in line with the IOOF's moves to provide wealth management solutions for independent financial advisers and self-directed investors.\nEarly stage IOOF said in a statement its discussions with HUB24 remained at an \"early stage\" and highlighted its history for taking a disciplined approach to transactions.\nIn September 2013, IOOF walked away from competitive bidding process with rival investment firm, Perpetual, for The Trust Company.\nIn May last year the company paid $670 million to buy independent adviser group, Shadforth Financial Group, in a friendly takeover.\nThe Shadforth acquisition helped boost the company's underlying profits at its recent full-year earnings announcement by 43 per cent compared with the previous year.\nHUB24 is one of the latest crop of listed financial services technology firms to target the self-directed and independent adviser market, alongside the likes of platform services company, Onevue Holdings, dealer group, Praemium and technology and information provider, Iress.\nIOOF shares dropped 2.14 per cent to $8.68 at the end of trading on Tuesday following the announcement of its interest in HUB24.
