Today, I write this tirade on their behalf. \nFirst, there is the issue of landing the contract in the first place. In Kenya, as we know, the process is not the thing - it's whom you know that counts. \nThese contracts are routinely dished out to relatives or to companies fronting for a senior manager. Any honest businessperson offering good quality is often forced to give in and offer kickbacks, just to stay afloat in business. \nNext, there is the problem of collecting payment. The large company that breathes fire down your neck when the supply deadline looms suddenly becomes extremely relaxed about paying you once supply is completed. \nPayment terms are officially rarely any better than 60 days; in practice suppliers are often stretched to 90 or 120 or even 150 days. For small businesses with fragile cashflows, the difference can be critical. \nTREATMENT OF SUPPLIERS \nEven worse are the tortures that small businesses are put through when trying to collect payment: \"It's still in Finance -- come back next week.\" \"The cheque is ready but not signed -- we'll call you.\" \"We have no record of outstanding payments |-- provide a statement.\" Or the worst one: \"Prove that we haven't paid you!\" \nThis stuff is done either because it's simply big-company policy to pay suppliers as late as possible so as to maximise the interest gain of holding their money; or because of the bully-boys and gatekeepers sitting in key seats who simply enjoy throwing their weight around -- or want to receive some envelopes under the table to make the payment accelerate magically. \nEither way, if you're a CEO I suggest you take a very hard look at how your suppliers are treated. \nThe big ones are probably fine; but I'm pretty sure the small ones would have some interesting stories to tell you. Call them in quietly and listen. \nThis stuff matters. A great business is not just about squeezing every dime of profit, legitimate or not, out of every person it deals with. \nA great business is web of mutually beneficial relationships in an ecosystem that protects all its components. Is bullying part of the brand you wish to project to the world? \nFAVOURITE CUSTOMER \nAnd do you not want to build up a cadre of loyal suppliers who are part of your mission and great ambassadors for you? Why not? \nAs I often write here: Big need not mean ugly. No matter what size your business is, this practice is cheap and needless. Fix it. It stains your brand. \nIn my business I make it a rule to pay every small supplier as soon as the invoice is received. \nI learned this early in life from a gentleman I have had the privilege to observe for many decades. This person has an iron rule: Never pay your suppliers late. \nOver many years, I have watched him go in person across town to present his cheque to suppliers big and small. \nAs a result, he has been everyone's favourite customer all his career. He grew his business very substantially by championing everyday virtue. \nMr B. D. Seedhar, if you're reading this, please stand and take a bow.
