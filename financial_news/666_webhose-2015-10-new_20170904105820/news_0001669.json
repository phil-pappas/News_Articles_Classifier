Job growth braked sharply in the past two months.\n\"The softness of September's figures supports our view that the Fed probably isn't going to hike interest rates until early next year,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. \nThe Commerce Department said retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month largely as cheaper gasoline pushed service station receipts down 3.2 percent. Giving the report a weak tone, sales in August were revised down to show them unchanged instead of rising 0.2 percent. \nRetail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services slipped 0.1 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in August. \nThese so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously said to have advanced 0.4 percent in August.\nLast month's weak core sales and the downward revision to August's figure, together with another report from the Commerce Department showing business inventories were again unchanged in August, prompted JPMorgan to cut its third-quarter GDP estimate by half a percentage point to an annual rate of 1 percent.\nThe economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter. Some economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the soft retail sales report, noting discretionary spending remained fairly healthy.\nConsumers boosted their purchases of automobiles and furniture and spent more on hobbies, clothing and eating out. That points to underlying strength in domestic demand which should provide some cushion against softening global growth.\n\nCONSUMER SPENDING STILL STRONG \nView gallery Women make their way though Times Square with bags of purchases from Toys R Us in New York November  … \"The overall message is that consumer spending has remained extremely strong. If sentiment had indeed shifted, it would be hard to explain why sales of cars, certainly among the more expensive items, jumped in September to their highest level since July 2005,\" said Harm Bandholz, chief economist at UniCredit Research in New York.\nSales of electronic goods were soft despite the launch of Apple's (AAPL.O) latest iPhone. Some economists said they expected the boost from the iPhone in October.\nA report from the Fed showed the economy was expanding modestly from mid-August through early October. It described consumer spending as growing \"moderately\" during the same period and noted the strong dollar was hurting manufacturing. \nStocks on Wall Street fell after Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) warned its full-year sales would be flat because of dollar strength. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose, while the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies. \nIn a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index fell 0.5 percent in September, the largest drop since January, after being unchanged in August. \nIn the 12 months through September, the PPI fell 1.1 percent after declining 0.8 percent in August. It was the eighth straight 12-month decrease in the index.\nThe weak inflation environment is one of the obstacles confronting Fed policymakers who are contemplating raising rates for the first time in nearly a decade. The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since late 2008.\n\"It is the uncertain course of inflation that could keep the Fed from hiking rates this year. Unfortunately, the gang that cannot communicate straight is still sending out as many unclear signals as possible,\" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.\nTop Fed officials are divided on whether to tighten monetary policy, with Governor Daniel Tarullo saying on Tuesday the central bank should not hike rates this year. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer have recently said they support raising rates this year.\n\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Meredith Mazzilli)\nBudget, Tax & Economy retail sales", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:24:20.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
