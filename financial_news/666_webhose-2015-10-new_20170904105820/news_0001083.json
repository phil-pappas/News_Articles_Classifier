Prices on September 25, 2015, were ~$1.40 per gallon.\nUS gasoline prices were mirroring crude oil prices as the week started. We’ve provided a detailed summary of movement in crude oil prices in Part One of this series. Crude oil prices fell early in the week on weaker Chinese economic data. Gasoline prices continued to mirror crude oil prices as the week progressed.\n\nPrices started rising mid-week on the threat of a hurricane on the US East Coast, which could potentially lead to refinery shutdown, threatening supplies. Prices continued to increase until they took a plunge at the end of the week as hurricane threats subsided. Additionally, weather forecasters predicted heavy rains, which could lower the demand for fuel for driving purposes.\nRead What Drove the Sharp Rise in US Gasoline Inventories Last Week? to learn more about the latest gasoline demand and production trends.\nWhy gasoline prices matter Lower US gasoline prices may dissuade refiners like Tesoro (TSO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Valero Energy (VLO) from producing more gasoline. However, the price of crude oil is also a consideration when refiners determine their production levels.\nGasoline prices loosely track changes in crude oil prices, usually Brent crude oil prices, the international benchmark. Combined, Tesoro, Valero Energy, and Marathon Petroleum account for ~8.60% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nWhen gasoline prices fall, refiners can choose to decrease production, provided that all else, mainly crude oil prices, doesn’t change. Lower production levels would mean lower volumes for MLPs like Tesoro Logistics (TLLP), MPLX (MPLX), and Valero Energy Partners (VLP) to transport. This could be negative for their revenues.\nUS gasoline price forecasts According to the EIA’s (U.S. Energy Information Administration) STEO (Short-Term Energy Outlook) report released on September 9, 2015, monthly average gasoline retail prices reached $2.64 per gallon in August. This is $0.16 less than the July average. Retail prices differ from futures prices. They include the added costs of taxes, distribution, and marketing.\nThe EIA expects the monthly average to fall throughout the remainder of the year. With the end of the summer driving season, prices are forecast to average $2.11 per gallon in 4Q15. They’re expected to average $2.41 per gallon in 2015 and $2.38 per gallon in 2016. Prices averaged $3.36 per gallon in 2014.\nThe 2016 price forecast is lower than the 2015 forecast. The EIA forecasts that gasoline consumption will remain flat in 2016 compared to the consumption figures in 2015.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Weak Chinese, US Economic Data Weighed on Crude Oil Prices Part 2 - XOP, USO Overperformed WTI in Week Ended October 2 Part 3 - WTI-Brent Spread Converged: Who Loses and Who Gains?
