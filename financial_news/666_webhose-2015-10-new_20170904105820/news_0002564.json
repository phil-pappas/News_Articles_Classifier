The difference is that there has been a shift in the market towards roads and service delivery in poorer areas all over the country.\nAfrimat, which supplies a broad range of construction materials, forecasts that headline earnings per share for the six months ended August will rise between 20% and 25% from the previous comparable period. CEO Andries van Heerden says other smaller construction and materials counters on the JSE, such as Calgro M3 and Iliad, have also been doing well.\nMeanwhile, Anthony Clark, a small and medium cap analyst at Vunani Securities, says ongoing headline earnings per share growth at Afrimat has made the stock a consistent performer among smaller cap shares, and when the details of the recent Cape Lime acquisition start to filter out, the deal should keep Afrimat’s earnings \"purring along\" for quite a while.\nCape Lime supplies products mainly to producers of chemicals, filler materials, glass, paint and food products, but also for water purification, soil and effluent treatment, building and construction. However, Clark says at nearly R23 a share, a lot of the expectations for Afrimat in 2016 are already factored in.\n...\nCEB, a US-based global best practice insight and technology company, says the vast majority of South African workers are going the extra mile for their employer including helping others with their workloads and taking on additional tasks.\nAlmost eight in 10 workers rate their \"discretionary effort\" as high or somewhat high, significantly above the global average.\nBut this does not necessarily correlate with company loyalty, as fewer than half of employees who go \"above and beyond\" intend to stay in their jobs. CEB says this makes South Africans the fifth most active job-seekers globally.\nThe top priorities for South African workers when looking for a new job are long-term stability, compensation and respect. At least half of SA’s workers clearly feel they do not get this from their existing employers, and undermine the quest for stability by moving on.\nNo other country ranked stability first — with the US, UK and China putting it in fourth place, while India ranked it fifth.\nCEB says South Africans cite lack of opportunity as the top driver of dissatisfaction. This is consistent with most other countries in which frustrations over lack of recognition and career progression are the most common causes of staff turnover.\nTo keep the best people, businesses need to provide employe2es with development opportunities.\n• Dave Marrs edits Company Comment ( marrsd@bdfm.co.za )", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=AFT"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:38:34.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
