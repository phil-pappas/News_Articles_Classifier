Industry sources said Boeing would be keen to keep the order on its books, possibly by agreeing to defer delivery. \nThe job cuts include 1,700 ground staff, 900 cabin crew and 300 pilots. The long-haul business would be reduced by 10 percent, with the fleet down by 14 aircraft to 93 and with the closure of five of its most heavily loss-making routes, mainly those serving Asia and the Middle East. \nAir France-KLM faces tough competition. \nLike Europe's other big flag carriers, such as British Airways owner IAG and Germany's Lufthansa, it has been squeezed between low-cost competition inside Europe and fast-expanding long-haul airlines in the Gulf, as well as Turkish Airlines (THY). \nTurkish Airlines is set to become the largest carrier on routes to and from Europe by the end of this year, ahead of British Airways, aircraft financiers gathered in Prague were told on Monday. Dubai's Emirates would be in third place. \nThe data treats Air France and KLM separately. \nLufthansa, which is also battling with union opposition to cost-cutting, has managed to push forward plans for a revamped low-cost unit, Eurowings. \n($1 = 0.8898 euros) (With additional reporting by Jacky Naegelen in Paris, Tim (LSE: 0LZ3.L - news ) Hepher in Prague and Victoria Bryan in Berlin; Writing by James Regan; Editing by Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:23:51.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
