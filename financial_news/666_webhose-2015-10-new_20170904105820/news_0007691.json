Both rely on regulated wholesale access to the network to serve their broadband and telephone customers. \nThey also claim the current structure does not create the right incentives for Openreach to improve its poor record on repairs and line installations. \nHowever, Mr Vaizey disagreed the infrastructure has suffered under BT. \n“If broadband is so terrible, why are we the leading ecommerce nation in the world?” he said. \nWith BT buying EE and Three merging with O2, Mr Vaizey also said that he will be closely watching the effects of consolidation in the sector. \n“There is balance to be struck. Competition is a good thing, but we have seen how a lack of capacity to invest can affect networks. If we felt there was too much consolidation we would look at consumer-friendly regulations.” \nMr Vaizey's views on Openreach clash with those of Chris Bryant, the shadow culture secretary. Writing in The Telegraph in August, Mr Bryant called on Ofcom to approach the issue on the assumption that BT should be broken up. \n“The situation is now so bad Ofcom's review should work on the presumption that Openreach should be split from the rest of BT unless their review produces conclusive evidence to the contrary,\" he said. \nBT declined to comment on Mr Vaizey's views but has previously defended its record on service and investment. Gavin Patterson, its chief executive, has also warned that an attempt to split the company would be met with legal challenges and risk a lost decade for development of Britain’s internet infrastructure as investments would be put on hold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:37:34.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
