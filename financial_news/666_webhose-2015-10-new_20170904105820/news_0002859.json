Michele Mossop by Sue Mitchell Australian companies may soon be offering shares in themselves rather than coupons, tokens and frequent flyer points to strengthen their connection with customers.\nSeveral Australian companies, including Domino's Pizza Enterprises, have been looking at issuing their own shares to customers through share-buying app Loyal3 to generate stronger customer loyalty.\nUS-based retail expert Dianne Inniss says consumers who own shares in a company tend to spend 54 per cent more than non-shareholders, are 83 per cent more likely to engage with the brand and are likely to make twice as many referrals.\n\"The customer gets stock which appreciates over time and they feel a sense of ownership â€“ they will spend more as part of that relationship, \" said Ms Inniss, a customer experience and innovation strategist with US-based consultancy Thoughtworks.\nIssuing shares is just one of the ways retailers, airlines, banks and other consumer-based companies are hoping to strengthen customer loyalty as consumers become increasingly disengaged with discounts, vouchers, coupons and air miles.\nAccording to McKinsey data, North American companies spend $US50 billion ($68 billion) a year on loyalty, but for many the return on investment is negligible. A 2013 McKinsey study found that companies with a strong focus on loyalty programs had weaker sales growth and margins than companies with less focus on loyalty.\nMs Inniss and Thoughtworks colleague Dan McMahon, who will speak at a series of customer loyalty workshops in Sydney and Melbourne this week, say consumer-centric companies need to offer incentives that are more relevant to their customers' lifestyles and spending habits.\n\"What we have seen is that companies have programs that to some extent are not taking into account differences in consumer behaviour, either their shopping behaviour or lifestyles,\" said Ms Inniss.\n \"Seventy per cent of customers say when they do get offers they're not relevant to their needs,\" she said. \"Instead of thinking about transaction-based programs they should be thinking about it in the context of the customer's whole life.\"\nThis could include experience-based incentives such as styling advice, tailoring and make-overs for department store customers and their friends, recipe suggestions and meal solutions for supermarket shoppers, and high-end concierge and baggage collection services for airline customers.\n\"Social experiences may have greater value [for customers] than monetary items,\" said Ms Inniss. \"Research shows that the acquisition of things had less lasting value than the acquisition of experiences.\"\nLoyalty offers also need to be more timely, ideally reaching consumers through their mobile phones while they are shopping rather than through direct mail and email.\n\"Most of these programs need to be mobile-first,\" said Mr McMahon, who was head of e-commerce at Woolworths' BIG W before joining Thoughtworks as head of retail last year.\nWoolworths and David Jones are reviewing their customer loyalty programs and hope to relaunch before the end of this year.\nDomino's Pizza Enterprise chief executive Don Meij said in July he was keen to become a Loyal3 partner when it launched in Australia, saying consumers who bought shares in the company could become loyal brand advocates.\nHowever, Mr Meij said on Tuesday the Australian-based company had no immediate plans to issue shares through a Loyal3's stock rewards program. Loyal3, which has been in talks with Domino's in the US, is seeking regulatory clearance in Australia.\n\"We are always exploring different loyalty options for our customers but our current loyalty program encourages people to create their own pizzas and incentivises them with every sale of those pizzas through Pizza Mogul,\" Mr Meij said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:09:18.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
