The money comes from a tax on slot machine casino gambling that was designed to lower school property tax bills and typically is paid directly to school districts. \nTim Eller of the Keystone Alliance for Public Charter Schools says the payments are legal and that state law allows it. \nSome charter schools have seen school districts cut off their monthly payments amid the stalemate. Eller says some charter schools have gone without payments from school districts since July and the gambling money just became available. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:36:36.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
