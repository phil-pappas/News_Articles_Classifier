The auction offered $20 billion in T-bills, which was $1 billion lower than the previous weekâ€™s auction.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio fell 2.9% from the previous week to 3.8x. In 2015 so far, the bid-to-cover ratio has averaged 4.1x. The ratio depicts the overall demand for the auction.\n\nYield analysis Treasury bills do not pay a coupon. They are offered at a discount to face value, and they are redeemable at par on maturity. The high discount rate for the October 13 auction came in at 0.080%, up from 0.065% in the previous week.\nMarket demand falls Fundamental market demand fell last week. Accepted indirect bids fell to 26.3% week-over-week from 31.3% in the previous week. Indirect bids are bids from the foreign central bank and depict international demand for auction.\nMeanwhile, the percentage of direct bids rose to 7.0% week-over-week from 6.4% a week ago. Direct bids include bids from domestic money managers such as Wells Fargo (WFC) and State Street Corp (STT).\nDue to lower market demand, the share of primary dealer bids rose to 66.7% of the auction from 62.3% in the previous week. Primary dealers are a group of 22 authorized broker-dealers that are obligated to bid at US Treasury auctions and take up excess supply. They include firms like Goldman Sachs (GS) and Citigroup Global Markets (C). A rise in the percentage of primary dealer bids indicates weak fundamental market demand.\nInvestment impact Mutual funds such as the Vanguard GNMA Fund Investor Shares Fund (VFIIX) and the Prudential Government Income Fund (PGVAX) invest in T-bills. VFIIX provided a weekly return of 0.21% while the week-over-week return of PGVAX came in at 0.32%.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Treasury Yields Fell as September US Industrial Production Dipped Part 2 - Auction Amount for 52-Week T-Bills Down for Third Straight Month Part 4 - 13-Week T-Bill High Discount Rate Unchanged for Second Week Budget, Tax & Economy Bonds Treasuries US Department of the Treasury Market demand", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:04:18.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
