It was equivalent to 4.18 percent of GDP, down from 4.34 percent in the previous month.\nA weaker Brazilian real is helping exporters and curbing imports, boosting the country's trade balance after the country recorded its first deficit in 14 years in 2014.\nBrazil's currency dropped more than 30 percent this year to a record low of more than 4 per dollar as investors fret over a steep rise of the country's debt.
