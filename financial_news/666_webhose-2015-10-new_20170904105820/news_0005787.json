In April last year it suspended talks on buying 20 Dreamliners from Boeing because of a delay in receiving U.S. backing for its long-haul plans.\nThe company flies on a license issued by the EU outsider Norway, but has asked the U.S. Department of Transportation for permission to fly to the United States on an Irish license, which it believes will give greater flexibility in managing routes.\nDemand for the company's intercontinental flights has risen strongly, resulting in the new order. Norwegian said its latest order took its total of unfilled orders from Boeing to more than 150, including 100 737 MAXs. It also has on order 100 Airbus A320neos.
