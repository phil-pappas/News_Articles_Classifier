Maputo — Of all sectors of activity in the Mozambican economy, the building industry holds the record in the illegal hiring of foreign labour to the detriment of Mozambican workers, according to the statistics of the Labour Ministry. The list of illegal expatriates is headed by Portuguese, Chinese, Indian and South African citizens. According to the Ministry, in most cases they enter Mozambique on tourist visas, but then take up paid jobs without respecting the legal requirements for the recruitment of foreign workers. Speaking to reporters in Maputo during a seminar on labour migration, the Permanent Secretary of the Labour Ministry, Abiba Tamele, said the Ministry was seriously concerned about legalizing the status of these workers. All companies are entitled to employ a certain percentage of foreigners - ten per cent in small companies (defined as employing ten or fewer people), eight per cent in medium sized companies (between ten and 100 workers), and five per cent in large companies (over 100 workers). Tamele said that for workers on short term jobs (of between 30 and 90 days) the law is “very flexible”, and foreigners are allowed to undertake these jobs, if the employer informs the ministry of the entry of these workers into the country. But Tamele said that there are cases in which employers take advantage of these provisions, and foreign workers stay in the country for a much longer time. They are later discovered working without any approach by their employers to the provincial labour directorates. “When this is found, the General Inspectorate of Labour suspends the workers concerned”, she said. Where Mozambicans with the requisite skills are available, employers must explain why they prefer to hire expatriates, she added. Tamele said that, so far this year, over 1,000 foreign workers have been suspended by labour inspectors due to irregularities detected in their hiring. The seminar on labour migration is intended to identify mechanisms to ensure that Mozambicans have opportunities for employment on an equal footing with foreigners. The challenge, said Tamele, extends to the labour administration which has the role of guaranteeing decent and stable work for Mozambicans, and should intervene in the hiring of foreign workers to ensure that Mozambican labour legislation is respected.
