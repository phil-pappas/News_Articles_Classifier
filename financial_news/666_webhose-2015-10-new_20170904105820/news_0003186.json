While it’s been forced upon on the UK, the feeling is that perhaps the Treasury hasn’t been too terribly robust in its defence. It will slow the finance opportunities for companies and is not helpful,” said Guy Rigby, partner and head of entrepreneurial services at Smith & Williamson. \nHowever, he added business owners are overwhelmingly supportive of the Conservative party and said the Labour party has a major credibility problem following the election of left-leaning Jeremy Corbyn as leader. \nThere are fears his theory of printing more money to fund more spending projects could disrupt the still-stabilising economy, said Mr Rigby. \nThe survey also suggested 90pc of entrepreneurs would consider launching a crowdfunding to raise money. A lack of confidence in banks means crowdfunding is now considered an important way of raising funds, Smith & Williamson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:28:08.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
