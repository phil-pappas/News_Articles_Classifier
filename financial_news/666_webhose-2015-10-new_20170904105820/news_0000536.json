Since independence in 1991, it has launched ambitious projects to process the commodity at home and find new export routes.\nJapan's Abe last week started a tour of the five post-Soviet Central Asian nations where former imperial master Russia and China are vying for clout.\nJapanese companies are already involved in large-scale projects in Turkmenistan, building plants to process natural gas into fertilisers, ethylene, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as into liquid fuel.
