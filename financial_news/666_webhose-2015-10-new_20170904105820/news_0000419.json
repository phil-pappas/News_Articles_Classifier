James Davies by Angela Macdonald-Smith Origin Energy's finance chief Karen Moses has suddenly announced her intention to retire by early 2016, just two weeks after the company announced a $2.5 billion rights issue to help cut debt.\nOrigin said Ms Moses had previously informed the board of her intention to depart from an executive role once th Australia Pacific LNG project in Queensland was completed and the balance sheet secured,\nHowever a resolution for her re-election as a director for another three years was due to be put to the annual shareholder meeting in Sydney on Wednesday. The resolution is now to be withdrawn.\nChairman Gordon Cairns paid tribute to Ms Moses, Origin executive director, finance and strategy, and her contribution to the company over the past 21 years.\nMs Moses intends to pursue a career as a non-executive director.\nThe news of Ms Moses departure comes amid ongoing speculation about the future of long-standing chief executive Grant King, who has headed up Origin since it was spun off from Boral in 2001.\nOrigin, which has an oil and gas production business, has been hit by the slump in the crude oil price. Its debt has meanwhile risen due to funding requirements to complete the $24.7 billion APLNG venture, which is due to begin production this quarter.\nOrigin had expected to be able to \"tough it out\" and weather the oil price downturn, but the high debt was a concern to investors amid the absence of any certainty of a price recovery, leading to the equity raising, Mr Cairns told shareholders at the meeting.\n Debt was set to peak this financial year at about $12 billion before the equity raising, the retail part of which is still ongoing.\nOrigin's share price has dived from $12.56 12 months ago to around $5.40, Mr Cairns noted, while oil prices have dropped from $US85 a barrel to about $US48.\nMr Cairns acknowledged shareholders' frustration with the performance of the share price.\n\"No one is happy with where the Origin share price is today, least of all your board,\" he said at the meeting.\n\"It has been a tumultuous 12 months. None of us at Origin take any satisfaction as to where we've landed,\" he said pointing to the decision to reduce dividends, cut capex and sell assets, which accompanied the announcement of the entitlement offer.\nOrigin also announced that the APLNG venture would defend legal action initiated by Texas-based Tri-Star linked to the 2002 sale of acreage in Queensland to Oil Co of Australia, now part of APLNG.\nTri-Star served a statement of claim on APLNG on Tuesday asserting that \"reversion\" has occurred, meaning that interests in more than 60 CSG licences held by Australia Pacific LNG should be passed back into its ownership.\n\"Australia Pacific LNG is firmly of the view that reversion has not occurred and intends to strongly defend the action,\" Origin said.\nOrigin on Wednesday also announced a new set of climate change commitments, including \"helping our customers to procure electricity from renewable sources and to procure 100 per cent of electricity from renewable sources for our office premises and, where possible, our other operations by 2050.\"\nMr Cairns said Origin supported \"meaningful global action\" to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Centigrade on pre-industrial levels. He said the commitments made Origin the first energy company worldwide to commit to all seven of the \"We Mean Business Coalition\" climate leadership initiatives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:11:13.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
