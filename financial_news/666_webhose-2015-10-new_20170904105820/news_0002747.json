Shareholders and the public markets deserve better than this ... we urge investors not to put our successful formula at risk and to vote against the Sherborne resolutions.\"\nBacking up its claim that performance had been strong, Electra cited a 201 percent outperformance over the last 10 years against the Morningstar Private Equity Index, excluding Electra.\nAs such it was for Bramson to make the case why investors should back his call for a board change that would involve him and Ian Brindle, former UK chairman of consultants PWC, being elected to the board.\nIn October last year, when he went to Sherborne investors to seek their support to do that, just 11 percent backed him.\nFor Electra, the bid for board seats was simply an attempt by an activist to get control of the company without paying a bid premium. Sherborne currently holds a 29.75 percent stake in Electra, it said.\nIn addition, it cited a string of \"inaccuracies\" in Sherborne's Oct. 16 letter to investors, which reinforced the view that Bramson was not a suitable board candidate.\n\"No director has ever joined the board of Electra having made so many inaccurate public statements in support of his or her nomination.\" (Reporting by Simon Jessop; Editing by David Holmes )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:01:03.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
