And they’ve said: ‘Our detention policies are not good enough’,” Mr Broadbent told ABC radio today.\nThe latest Department of Immigration figures show there are 104 children in mainland detention and 93 held on Nauru. A further group of youngsters — possible about 100 — are living in the Nauru community.\nThese children, aged from babies to late teens, have little education, and some are so institutionalised that when asked their names they reply with the three letters and three digits used by officials to record the boat they arrived on.\nThe Government and Labor have vowed they will never get Australian residency, but there is no plan to settle them elsewhere. The Nauru children face the prospect of staying there for the rest of their lives in poor conditions.\nImmigration Minister Peter Dutton has insisted they will remain in camps as taking them in would encourage people smugglers. They, in effect, are being held hostage against the possibility of further boats setting out for Australia.\nMr Broadbent said the Royal Children’s Hospital was “the most revered organisation in Victoria bar none, a conservative group of people who service our community in the most amazing way”.\n“When the people shift the politicians will shift,” he said.\n“They will understand they need to do something in regard to long term detention. I know the Government is going to enormous efforts to resolve this issue in this nation,” he said.\n Aussies have changed their minds, Turnbull warned", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/protests-rising-against-prolonged-detention-of-children-in-nauru-and-the-harm-to-their-health/story-fn5tas5k-1227566129036", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227566/128980-45c7a00c-7080-11e5-99e3-ad32ef3bcdab.jpg", "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227566/128607-0cbd5676-7080-11e5-99e3-ad32ef3bcdab.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:41:18.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
