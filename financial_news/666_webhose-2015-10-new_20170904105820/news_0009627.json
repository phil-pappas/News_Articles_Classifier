That legislation provides federal funding — largely at current levels — until Dec. 11, leaving lawmakers with roughly 10 weeks to find a broader agreement extending funding through at least September of next year. \nThe comments from Reid and Pelosi foreshadow a tough fight ahead, as Republican leaders consider the across-the-board sequester cuts — enacted as part of the 2011 Budget Control Act — to rank among their top legislative victories under President Obama. \nExcepting for defense spending, which many Republicans want raised, GOP leaders want to keep the sequestration cuts intact in the name of smaller government and deficit reduction. They also face additional pressure from some conservatives to cut even deeper in pursuit of a balanced budget, something that would be a non-starter with Obama and the Democrats. \nReid said the Democrats huddling Thursday focused on four areas: A top-line budget number to guide the appropriations process; potential offsets that will be needed to lift the sequester caps; how to stave off poison pill \"riders\" that could sink the package; and their adopted precept that any increase in defense spending has to be matched equally by increases in spending on domestic programs. \nThe Democrats declined to weigh in on a timeline governing the negotiations, but emphasized they want to get moving so as not to bump up on the Dec 11 deadline. \n\"We don't want to wait,\" Reid said. \nReid said he and Pelosi — as well as members of their staffs — have been in close contact with the White House over the party's strategy heading into the high-stakes talks. \nObama has also been in preliminary discussions with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) in search of an agreement that will prevent a government shutdown in December. \nA wild card in those talks has been Boehner's stunning decision to resign from Congress on Oct. 30. The move has not only created a distraction, as ambitious Republicans fight to work their way up the leadership ladder, but has emboldened the conservatives who toppled the Speaker — a dynamic that could make negotiations much tougher for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), his likely replacement. \nAsked if it will be more difficult to secure a budget deal under the new Republican leadership, the Democratic leaders declined to offer predictions. \n\"We'll see,\" Pelosi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:38:46.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
