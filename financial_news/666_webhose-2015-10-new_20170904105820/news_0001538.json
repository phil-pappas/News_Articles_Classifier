Abolishing them could have business implications for European carmakers including Renault, Peugeot and Fiat , as well as Volkswagen.\nFrance said on Wednesday it planned to reduce a tax break on diesel fuel.\nMANDATORY RECALL\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said the country's KBA automotive watchdog had ordered Volkswagen to start a mandatory recall of 2.4 million vehicles at the beginning of next year.\nThe Bild newspaper said the KBA had rejected the idea owners could voluntarily bring in their vehicles.\nThe KBA has given Volkswagen until the end of the month to come up with a plan for a software fix needed for 2.0 litre vehicles affected by the recall, Dobrindt said.\nThe carmaker has until the end of November to come up with a technical solution for 1.6 and 1.2 litre vehicles, he added.\nVolkswagen has said it aims to complete a refit of vehicles affected worldwide by the end of 2016, with some requiring more complex and expensive changes to hardware.\nGermany had previously said 2.8 million Volkswagen vehicles were affected by the scandal in the country. Dobrindt said only 2.4 million needed to be recalled because the other 400,000 were no longer on the roads. He reiterated the affected vehicles were safe and could be driven as normal.\nDobrindt said the German government still did not know who was responsible for creating and installing the cheat software, or when and how the decisions were made.\nNearly four weeks after it publicly admitted to rigging U.S. diesel emissions tests, Volkswagen is under pressure to identify those responsible and fix affected vehicles.\nIt has been criticised by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.\nThe KBA and other European national authorities are due to provide an update to the European Commission in Brussels later on Thursday on investigations of the emissions scandal in their respective markets.\nNew Volkswagen Chief Executive Matthias Mueller is also expected to speak to top management on Thursday about the current state of investigations and its response to the crisis.\nOn Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would cut investment plans at its core VW division by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year through 2019 and step up the development of electric and hybrid vehicles.\nCompany sources told Reuters on Wednesday the premium Audi division, which generates about 40 percent of group profit, was also working on plans to cut spending.\n($1 = 0.8738 euros) (Reporting by Jan Schwartz, Caroline Copley , Michael Nienaber and Andreas Cremer; Writing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter ; Editing by Giles Elgood)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:13:43.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
