Flagging a possible timetable for progress before Christmas the Treasurer wants to move the Harper review 'forward over the next few weeks'.

Australia's retail trading hours could be radically overhauled, and ride-share services such as Uber more readily welcomed into the country, after the Turnbull government said it will launch an \"enthusiastic response\" to the Harper review of Australia's competition laws.\nIt means the long-standing monopoly-power held by existing taxi services could be broken up, and traditional retail hours loosened dramatically, while road transport regulations could be significantly modernised.\nFederal Treasurer Scott Morrison wants to put the Harper review back on the political agenda. Photo: Kate Geraghty\nIt also means laws governing where pharmacies can be located will be reconsidered, as will aggressively competitive behaviour from big businesses looking to expand.\nAdvertisement Treasurer Scott Morrison says the Harper review has the potential to unlock \"enormous opportunities\" for the economy and Australians can expect an enthusiastic response to it from the Turnbull government.\nThe review had originally been released in March and was sidelined by the Abbott government after it was overwhelmed by debate over one of its recommendations. The move is the latest policy snub from Malcom Turnbull's government to that of his predecessor Tony Abbott.\nMr Morrison – who became Treasurer less than four weeks ago – flew to Melbourne last week to meet with the chair of the review, Professor Ian Harper.\nOn Friday, Mr Morrison said the review was an \"outstanding report\" and he would like to put it back on the federal political agenda over the next few weeks.\n\"With cabinet meeting between now and Christmas I will look to a timetable that would see [the government's response to the review] be able to be presented hopefully before Christmas,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"We have today only really, I think, enabled ourselves to reboot that process.\"\nProfessor Harper said he welcomed news his report had been brought in from the cold.\n\"Relative to being sidelined and ignored, it's a very good feeling to think that the government will once again consider prosecuting [those recommendations],\" he said.\n\"My three colleagues on the panel and I devoted nearly a year of our lives to producing them. Nearly 1000 submissions went into producing the report, and we certainly encourage governments at the state and federal level to take those recommendations for the value that we believe they represent to the people.\"\nThe decision to revive the Harper review follows an announcement earlier this month by Education Minister Simon Birmingham that he would shelve the Coalition's controversial higher education deregulation agenda.\nMr Turnbull and Environment Minister Greg Hunt have also signalled the government would adopt a more welcoming approach to renewable energy investment. Mr Turnbull has also abandoned Mr Abbott's opposition to funding public transport.\nWhen the Harper report was released, Professor Harper said his 56 recommendations ought to be adopted as quickly as possible so Australia could reap the benefits from the changes.\nBut the report was sidelined after debate focused on its recommendations regarding Section 46, which refers to the legal definition of harmful competition.\nThe review had said a company should not behave in a way designed to deliberately hurt competition, but the business community argued the definition was not specific enough.\nProfessor Harper said that Australian consumers had been voting with their feet on a range of new personal services, such as the Uber taxi service, and anti-competitive regulations that prohibit such innovative ideas needed to be reviewed and tested.\n\"The review applied a rational preference to competition, which means the onus of proof is on those who want to show that competitive outcomes are not in the public interest,\" Professor Harper said.\n\"It's possible to say that some competitive outcomes are not in the public interest, and that the public is not served by having open-slather on competition ... but you want to keep testing it, because it can become the case that well-intentioned rules end up protecting particular encumbents or business models.\"\n\"We're very much in line with remarks in the Prime Minister's first speech, about 'disruption being our friend and needing to welcome disruption,' because therein lies the source of productivity growth.\"\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:25:01.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
