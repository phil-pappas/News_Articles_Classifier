Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan What transpired at an apartment complex in Wolli Creek, southern Sydney is every would-be home owner's nightmare.\nThirty-seven first-home buyers, young families and new migrants, in search of the Australian dream of owning their own property, bought apartments as cheap as $370,000 between 2009 to 2010 – just before the Sydney housing boom.\nWhile happy to have jumped on the property ladder at cheap prices at the new urban residential village with bonus riverside views, their luck ran out in 2013.\nThe developer, Kaymet Corporation, rescinded their off-the-plan contracts by invoking the \"sunset clawback\" clause. Originally, this was intended to protect buyers in the event a development didn't go ahead, letting them out of their original contracts. But, under the provision, either side can trigger a bail-out and in this case the developer has taken the properties back and could resell them at a higher price.\nA one-bedroom apartment at the residential estate sold for $370,000 in 2009. Now the regenerated flats will go on the market for an estimated $650,000. Two-bedroom units will be around $900,000, up from $500,000.\nIf Kaymet resells the 37 units, it will stand to make up to another $6 million.\nThe residents, however, are left without homes and priced out of the rising market with their refunded original deposits. Thirty-four of the residents seeking recompense took Kaymet to court, but on Thursday the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case.\nThe court said Kaymet was entitled to rescind the contracts. Its failure to honour the contracts through failing to lodge strata documents was justified on the back of delayed construction.\n 'Our lives are ruined' \"Our lives are ruined,\" said one the 34 apartment owners, who did not want to be named. \"We're workers with average salaries who have saved up all that money. To save another three times for a deposit will take a lifetime.\n\"Not only have we suffered, we have to pay legal costs and disbursements of the developer.\"\nAlong with their own legal costs of $600,000, the 34 residents in the court case may have to stump up around $80,000 each – more than their initial deposits of about $50,000 each.\n\"There's no justice,\" one apartment owner said. \"That sunset clawback is old-time law from the 19th century and was used to protect parties against godly acts, like a disaster.\n\"But now developers are using it as a money-making machine. Our Australian dream is dead.\"\nThe Wolli Creek group are not the only people who have lost properties this way since Sydney's property boom began in 2012. Kellyville and Castle Hill land owners, in the city's north-west, lost land lots in May.\nEarlier this year, in the city's inner-east Surry Hills area, developer Ash Samadi rescinded the contracts of seven buyers in his East Central development and then resold the apartments for about 50 per cent more.\nThe spate of failed deals has prompted NSW's Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation, Victor Dominello, to introduce new legislation to fight \"sunset clawbacks\". The NSW government is currently seeking public consultation on the matter.\n\"There is growing concern about the way sunset clauses are being used to rescind off-the-plan contracts,\" a spokesman for Mr Dominello said.\n\"Buying a property is one of the biggest financial decisions a person or couple will make in their lifetime, and we need to ensure they are afforded adequate protection against exploitative practices. The court's decision is evidence of why this issue needs to be more closely examined.\"\nThe decision took the group and their lawyer, Carneys Lawyers' Stephen Titus, by surprise.\n\"The judge took [the developer's] side … it was a major setback,\" one of the owners said. \"It'll take me another three to four years to buy. I'm disappointed … other states have overhauled this section of the law, but not NSW.\"\nMr Titus said the judge was preferential towards the developer. The group of owners is now getting the court judgment reviewed.\nKaymet Corporation is owned by the Kayrouz brothers, Terry and Lichah, as well as William Metlej and the estate of his deceased father, Youssef Metlej.\n\"It was just a case, heard by a judge. Unfortunately for the owners, they lost and we won,\" said the lawyer for Kaymet, Alphonse & Associates' Anthony Panopoulos.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-09T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:16:08.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
