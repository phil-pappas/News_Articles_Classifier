The former minister discussed Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, and how illicit financial flow could impede the post 2015 development agenda, especially in developing countries like Nigeria. Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala said although funds needed for SDGs are huge, blocking illicit financial flow could help free up the needed funds. Eighty per cent of the SDGs are infrastructural goals which require $6 trillion in funding for the next 15 years, Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala said. She said current global funding for infrastructures stood at $1.7 trillion, and 60 per cent of the SDGs and their funding are to be borne by developing countries - justifying why corruption must be confronted. Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala said as minister, she made efforts to improve transparency and fight corruption in the government, but regretted allegations of corruption directed at her after leaving office. She also hinted that her decision to join the Goodluck Jonathan government -- after serving in the Obasanjo government - may have been mistaken. \"When the opportunity came to go for it for the second time, I went, perhaps unwisely, but I went because no one will fight this corruption for us, we have to do it ourselves... .,\" she said. \"But having left government, I have come under attack with people saying she's done this or that, trying to join you in the group of the corrupt.\" Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala commented on Mr. Buhari assigning the petroleum ministry to himself. \"I think the president has the prerogative to do a lot of things, and this is not the first time in our country. President Obasanjo was also the president of Petroleum Resources in his time. I am not saying this is the best way or best practice but I am just saying for our circumstances it is not the first time,\" she said. \"If that will bring more clarity, more openness, more transparency to the way the oil sector is done no problem, it's ok. But if it will not, we have to ask questions.\" She lamented the failure of the Nigerian National Assembly to pass the Petroleum Industry Bill, PIB, a failure she blamed on vested interests. \"This bill has the power to transform the entire petroleum industry where there is a lot of corruption,\" she said. \"And with that we would have commercialized the oil company (NNPC), made it open up its books but the heavy lobbying by both the domestic vested interests and the international vested interests blocked this.\" More on This \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has constituted a seven-member committee to advise him on his plans to tackle corruption, … see more » Previous Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:58:06.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
