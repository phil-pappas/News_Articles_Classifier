Corona shifted to Lion in 2012. Photo: Bloomberg\nThe licensing deal for Australia's No.1 selling imported beer, Corona, will come under close scrutiny by the Australian competition regulator in the wake of an in-principle agreement for a $146 billion global mega-merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SAB Miller .\nLion, owned by Japan's Kirin Corporation, has held the licence to sell Corona in Australia since 2012 when it took over the rights to the brand, which has 5.9 per cent by volume of the total beer market in Australia in its own right.\nSABMiller bought out Foster's in a $12.3 billion takeover and this triggered a change of control clause for Corona's then Mexican owner, Grupo Modelo, allowing for the licensing switch to Lion in early 2012 â€“ even though Foster's had spent 22 years building the Corona brand in Australia.\nBut the Mexican brewer has since been swallowed by Anheuser-Busch InBev. If the merger of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SAB Miller succeeds, then the Australian arm of the merged entity could conceivably want to regain control of the Corona licence in Australia.\nAdvertisement The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said on Monday that it would closely examine the licensing arrangements for the large imported beer brands in Australia as part of its local considerations of the proposed mega-merger between Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller.\n\"In assessing the impact of the transaction on markets in Australia, the ACCC will give consideration to a number of factors including the licensing arrangements for large imported beer brands in Australia,\" the competition regulator said.\nBut the ACCC emphasised \"it has not yet received a submission from the parties regarding the proposed transaction\".\nChange of control Lion, which makes mainstream beer brands Tooheys and XXXX Gold, also holds the Australian licence for Stella Artois, the No.4 imported beer brand in Australia. It is unclear what sort of change of control clauses operate under the Lion arrangements for the licensing of Corona and Stella Artois. Lion won't comment.\nBut it is likely that an enlarged SABMiller would seek to wrest the brands back that are owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev at a global level.\nLion's overall market share in Australia sits at about 48 per cent. Rival Foster's holds around 43 per cent of the beer market, led by Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught. Foster's lost the No.1 position when it surrendered the Corona rights to Lion in Australia's $14 billion beer market.\nA business in Australia with the combined SABMiller portfolio of CUB beers including Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught, together with the imported brands of Corona and Stella Artois which are part of the Anheuser-Busch InBev portfolio, would go close to having a market share of more than 50 per cent in Australia.\nPeta Fielding, the chair of the Australian Craft Beer Industry Association, which has 130 members, says there is a growing consumer trend across a range of industries where people want to know where the products they are consuming are being made, and what goes into them, and that's helping to drive the strong growth of craft beer.\n\"It's not just the beer industry where that's happening,\" Ms Fielding says. She is the chief executive of the Burleigh Brewing Company and predicts craft beer will continue to wrest share away from mainstream beers.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/retail/fmcg/where-to-seal-the-biggest-beer-deal-ever-a-tiny-house-in-london-20151013-gk8foq"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:28:22.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
