The UAW set a one-day strike deadline earlier this month during negotiations with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. A tentative agreement was reached less than 20 minutes before the deadline was set to expire.\nGM is the second of the Detroit Three automakers to negotiate a new deal. The UAW reached its second tentative agreement with FCA on Oct. 7 after a previous pact was voted down by workers. The second deal was ratified and the results made official Thursday.\nThe UAW is not expected to start final negotiations with Ford until the GM agreement is ratified.\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1S2YFCq TOP VIDEOS Don't call this Army Mutt a 'Jeep' 01:56 Apple, WD, and LinkedIn Report This Week | America's Markets 01:36 Martin Shkreli's $750 AIDS drug undercut by $ 00:48 Wild socks launch this start-up's business 02:05 McDonald's breaks two-year sales low at US locations in third quarter 00:42 What to watch Friday: Will Royal Caribbean cruise beat estimates? 01:30 Here's how much a pair of Back to the Future kicks cost 01:07 The ten most profitable companies in the world 02:05 Don't fall victim to these grocery store gimmicks 01:29 Tech Five: Shares of Twitter, Yahoo slammed 00:36 Turn any car into a smart car 02:12 Americans spend HOW much on Halloween candy?!? 00:58 Smaller bonuses for Wall Street 01:47 This DeLorean is in pristine condition 01:01 Ferrari's $9.8B Valuation: How Investors Are Reacting 02:25 Cuba open to \"all type of businesses\" with US oil companies 00:58 Western digital is dropping $19B to acquire SanDisk 01:00 Uber - no plans to file for IPO soon 00:44 EU: Starbucks, Fiat profited from illegal tax breaks 01:47 Subway agrees to start measuring bread to ensure 12-inch footlongs 01:07 MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:16:46.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
