Peter Braig by Jane O'Sullivan Veteran art dealer Anna Schwartz is handing the keys of her Sydney gallery to Carriageworks and teaming up with Carriageworks director Lisa Havilah to mount an ambitious five-year exhibition program in the space.\nSchwartz, who will continue to run her Melbourne gallery, has donated $500,000 to fund the series of exhibitions. There will be a minimum of two shows every year and at least one will be international. The first opens in January and presents five decades of work from the Ghanaian artist El Anatsui, the winner of the major Golden Lion award at this year's Venice Biennale. It's a grand opening statement: they plan to host major artists from all over the world.\n\"We wouldn't be able to do it without Anna's partnership. It's critical because working internationally … always takes a big commitment and a lot of investment and it also takes time,\" Havilah says. She adds Schwartz is not just handing over a cheque but will be heavily involved in selecting artists, and her collaboration will be essential.\nIf it's an unusual public-private partnership, that's because it's taken years to develop. As Schwartz tells it, since Havilah joined Carriageworks in 2011 they have gradually discovered shared perspectives, particularly when it comes to showing international art. They see the project as a chance to expand on what they have been able to achieve individually.\nFor her part, in her 33 years running Anna Schwartz Gallery, Schwartz has exhibited international artists from Joseph Kosuth to Erwin Wurm. Havilah has completely transformed Carriageworks and attendance figures have doubled every year under her watch, in large part due her tenacity securing standout contemporary Asian artists. Her first major international exhibition, Song Dong in 2013, brought in 42,000 visitors.\n\"I think it's important for us to be engaged with the world and for us to do that through contemporary visual arts,\" says Havilah. She wants Carriageworks to play its role by presenting ideas that have \"great contemporary relevance\", not just locally but also nationally and internationally.\nBig ambitions Havilah has not been afraid of ambitious projects to date. Song Dong's exhibition involved installing some 10,000 objects and, at the start of this year, Zhang Huan made a five-metre tall sculpture out of ash. Her focus is on delivering experiences that can't be had anywhere else. In that vein, Havilah and Schwartz plan to bring out international artists whose work has not been seen in Australia, and also give local artists the opportunity to work on projects that would be difficult to mount anywhere else. Schwartz's cavernous gallery space will be used and exhibitions will also extend into other Carriageworks spaces.\n Schwartz says her decision to close her Sydney gallery after eight years is not a scaling back, nor is it financially motivated. \"I have a show on at the moment by Marco Fusinato. There are five very large-scale works – the largest is about seven metres long – and it's sold out, FYI.\"\nRather, she sees the partnership as a way to collapse the border between the private and public art worlds. \"It seemed like a really powerful way forward, to work together and join our forces, and to be very ambitious.\"\nThe Fusinato exhibition closes Saturday, October 24. Anna Schwartz Gallery will stage one last exhibition in the Sydney space, of Shaun Gladwell's work, before shutting its doors at the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:37:23.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
