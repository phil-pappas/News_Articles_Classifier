John Veage Share on twitter by Jamie Freed When the Australian dollar was riding high, there was a boom in travel to Hawaii. The prices for hotels, restaurants and shopping seemed like a bargain compared with equivalent domestic destinations when the dollar was above parity, and so Jetstar, Hawaiian Airlines and Qantas added tens of thousands of seats to Honolulu last year.\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the number of Australian visitors to Hawaii more than doubled, reaching 310,000 last year.\nBut now that a decent hotel in Waikiki costs about $US200 ($277) a night versus $200 when the dollar was last at parity in 2013, Hawaii now feels palpably more expensive and represents a good case study of the effects that currency can have on a tourism market.\nThe higher cost for Australians represents a fresh challenge for the destination, which competes against cheaper and closer beach holiday destinations like Bali, Thailand and Fiji to attract Australian travellers.\n\"There is a little bit of pause in terms of [Australian] outbound growth at the moment associated with the domestic economic situation,\" said Hawaiian Airlines chief executive Mark Dunkerley, dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, in the company's head office last week.\nBetween January and July, the number of Australian visitors heading to Hawaii rose by 12.6 per cent because of the surge in air capacity, and plenty of Aussie accents can still be heard at Waikiki.\nBut the amount Australian travellers spend each day is falling in US dollar terms. Shopping was hit the most dramatically, falling 11 per cent from last year now that American prices no longer seem like such bargains.\n\"I think people are choosing to stay in maybe a lower-priced hotel category than they might have, which will also drop their spend,\" Hawaii Tourism Authority Oceania country manager Ashley Galea said.\n Budget market decline This is the reverse phenomenon of what is occurring in Australia, where the lower dollar has resulted in a jump in spending on hotels, restaurants and shopping by inbound tourists from places like China and the US . It has also led to a resurgence in domestic tourism in places like tropical northern Queensland which also compete against Hawaii.\nAirlines have managed to keep filling seats to Hawaii by offering excellent deals, particularly from Brisbane, where Hawaiian Airlines and Jetstar both added a huge amount of capacity before the dollar's decline. But there seems little doubt that the first hit to demand is coming from the budget end of the market.\n\"While we continue to monitor the impact of the Australian dollar, Qantas services are performing well on this route,\" a Qantas spokesman said. \"Jetstar has seen a moderate dip, but customers are continuing to take advantage of the competitive fares it has to offer.\"\nHawaiian Airlines, which if the US state was a separate nation would be akin to a flag carrier, has aimed its product more at the middle end of the market, where demand is holding relatively steady.\n\"People are still coming but maybe they are a little more value-conscious than they were a year, a year and a half ago,\" Hawaiian Airlines vice-president revenue management and network planning Brent Overbeek said.\nThe airline has taken a big hit to revenue from the fall in the Australian dollar given most of its tickets are sold in Australia to travellers heading for a holiday in Hawaii.\nBut at the same time, its costs have fallen as a result of the much lower fuel price. Mr Dunkerley said the airline was happy with its current capacity in the market, which included a daily Sydney-Honolulu flight and four weekly Brisbane-Honolulu flights, but it might look to make seasonal adjustments..\nMelbourne, where Jetstar has a monopoly on Honolulu flights, has long been on Hawaiian Airlines' list of potential new destinations, but any short-term move into that market is unlikely.\n\"In the context of the current position of the Aussie dollar, we are focused on making Sydney and Brisbane work and being successful there,\" Mr Overbeek said. \"But I think over time, Melbourne certainly fits into our portfolio quite nicely.\"\nHawaii Tourism Authority is hoping the big boom in visits to Hawaii by Australians in the past five years has laid the foundation for many of them to become repeat visitors, perhaps moving beyond the main island of Oahu to places like Maui, Kauai and the Big Island on future visits.\nFlop and drop It is also looking to push some of the advantages that Hawaii has over places like Bali, Thailand and Fiji â€“ namely superior infrastructure, safety, shopping, food and adventure travel options.\n\"Other destinations, you have the beach, the flop and drop,\" Ms Galea said. \"But in Hawaii you can choose to be lying on the beach or you can choose to be really active. It gives the visitor that breadth. The Big Island has everything from red hot lava with volcanoes to a mountain that gets snow to manta ray diving and waterfalls overflowing, and it also has a lot of the ancient Hawaiian cultural aspects still visible.\"\nMs Galea has enjoyed visiting Hawaii so much while representing Hawaii Tourism Authority in Sydney that she is now relocating to the islands.\nHawaiian Airlines senior vice-president global sales and alliances Theo Panagiotoulias, who is originally from Melbourne, has a similar fondness for the location after living in Honolulu for the past 14 months.\nHe said a big focus for the carrier in the Australian market would be on meetings, incentives, conferences and events (MICE). Last week, for the first time Hawaiian Airlines announced plans to create an in-house sales team for the Australian market.\n\"There is a lot of MICE demand for Hawaii out of Australia,\" Mr Panagiotoulias said. \"There is going to be some impact from the fall in the dollar. I think it would be naive to not have that. But at the same token we have also found that the Australian market, whether it is MICE or whether it is leisure, has been extremely resilient. The dollar has dropped quite significantly but we have seen demand from Australia to Hawaii flat.\"\nPerhaps as a result, Hawaiian Airlines has no plans to change how it markets itself or the destination to Australians. Avi Mannis, the airline's senior vice-president of marketing, said as a leisure-based carrier that includes complimentary meals, a generous baggage allowance and inflight entertainment, it had always promoted itself as offering good value.\n\"I think that actually positions us really well in a macroeconomic environment like this one,\" he said. \"A Hawaiian vacation is never going to be the least expensive option for an Australian tourist. As the dollar depreciates, probably less so. But I think it is still great value for money and that is where we always try to position it.\"\nThe reporter travelled to Honolulu as a guest of Hawaiian Airlines.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-10-26T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:04:06.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
