The good news is that it’s not all doom and gloom, so let’s start with the encouraging report. Millennials are budgeting... sort of. And, you are doing better than we Baby Boomers have done. The unfortunate news is that we set the bar so low; we are not the generation to emulate. T. Rowe Price released a study in June 2015 revealing that, “More millennials than baby boomers track expenses carefully (75% vs 64%) and stick to a budget (67% vs. 55%). Okay, that is the good news; now for the scary news. The Scary Mistakes Millennials Make : Mistake #1: Too Much Debt Millennials ran up huge student debt, a major “ball and chain” for this generation. A recent Allstate/National Journal/Heartland poll noted that, “…nearly three-in-10 young people who define themselves as just starting out cited paying off student loans as their biggest financial challenge…\"According to CNN Money , “…40 million Americans now have student loan debt.” And, the U. S. Department of Education reported that, “On average, borrowers are carrying over, “$35,000 on order to obtain their bachelor’s degree.” I know that you have to pay for college. But seriously, put your credit cards away. CreditCards.com noted results from an Experian report as follows, “…Millennials have an average of $23,332 of credit card debt. It is lower than Baby Boomers. Although millennials tended to carry lower card balances and have fewer cards (1.57 compared with Baby Boomers of 2.66), they are ‘over-utilizing bankcards’ and ‘beginning to develop bad credit habits.’”Most experts advise that about 45 percent of your gross income can be your debt. This is including all debt; student loans, housing, credit cards, everything. That means that you would have to be earning close to $100,000 to support that debt; now. But, your salaries are not keeping up with your debt. It should be noted, that according to a new report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers , “Students who graduated from college in the class of 2014 median starting salaries were, $45,478.”The bottom line is that your debt is getting to be unmanageable and above your earning power. [entity display=\"Experian\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"experian\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1525\"]Experian[/entity] also notes that the average Millennial credit score is 628, below the Baby Boomers average of 700. This is scary and will only lead to trouble down the road. Mistake #2: Not Enough Emergency Funds The T. Rowe Price study also showed that, “Millennials are more likely than baby boomers to seek help of family and friends (55% vs. 17%) if faced with a sudden financial emergency.” I know it’s hard to save, but remember that every penny can help when you have an emergency. There are lots of tips to save. Alexandra Talty , Forbes contributor, has spoken to experts who recommend writing down your expected expenses for each day. This will help you to plan to cut down on the more expensive lunch if you are planning to be out at night. Mistake #3: No Health Insurance It seems obvious that Millennials can’t afford health care insurance, but there also seems to be an additional reason. They just don’t understand how it works and the new lingo around the “health insurance word-soup,” as reported by NPR . “Young adults, who generally have little experience managing their own health care expenses, are finding it especially hard signing up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act .”According to a survey published in August 2015 edition of the Journal of Adolescent Health , Millennial participants also indicated they had, “…poor health insurance literacy with 48% incorrectly defining deductible and 78% incorrectly defining coinsurance.”This is disturbing, especially since those surveyed were college-educated and tech-savvy. I’m not sure I understand how this “on-it generation” can use [entity display=\"Google\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"google\" ticker=\"GOOGL\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1821\"]Google[/entity] as their go-to source for finding everything from the best deal to get to the Forest of Knives to shopping for to the only place for Fugu in their neighborhood, yet they still have issues searching for the most affordable healthcare. Mistake #4: No Long Term Disability Insurance As a young adult in your 20s and 30s, you probably feel invincible. It’s also why you probably believe Long Term Disability Insurance is only something to be considered when your temples start to gray. The Wall Street Journal notes that, “…Most midsize and large employers offer short-term disability benefits (for about one week to six months) and/or long-term disability benefits (from six months to our retirement date). That leaves people unable to work for an extended period with a big salary shortfall.” Not to mention that many Millennials are also opting to be entrepreneurs and work for themselves. This really makes Long Term Disability a must, as far as I’m concerned. Private Long Term Disability Insurance is not really expensive; Google it. Mistake #5: No Savings For Retirement Bankrate stresses, “Although you’re (Millennials) just starting out, it’s necessary to keep retirement planning somewhere on your list of priorities.” You are going to get old and it will happen faster than you realize. Remember, “The miracle of compounding?” Make it work for you and have money taken out automatically, from your salary to start to save. Please take advantage of your employer’s 401(k) match. I can keep going, but I’ll stop. This is the perfect time of year to look back on your financial situation and clean the money skeletons out of your closet. With some small steps, you can make some huge strides in improving your life now and for the future. You get to make your own choices to hopefully turn your financial life into that “treat”, so you can avoid the “trick” that awaits you otherwise.", "external_links": ["http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/infographic-generational-differences-debt-1701.php", "https://www.experianplc.com/media/news", "http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/worst-money-mistakes-millennials-5.aspx", "https://www.healthcare.gov/", "http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/06/16/414665468/defeat-by-deductible-millennials-arent-hip-to-health-insurance-lingo", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323893504578555432389116010", "http://www.naceweb.org/about-us/press/average-starting-salaries-class-2014.aspx", "http://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(15)00172-X/abstract", "http://heartlandmonitor.com/", "http://corporate.troweprice.com/ccw/home/pressReleases/pressRelease.do?pressRelease=/html/content/home/pressReleases/pressReleaseContent/06222015.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/11/pf/college/student-debt-crisis/"], "published": "2015-10-24T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:09:02.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
