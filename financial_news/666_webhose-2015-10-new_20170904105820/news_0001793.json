David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Patient capital got a big wrap from leading executives from the media, resources, beverages and banking at a conference in Sydney on Thursday at the same time as Australia's leading general insurer was forced to bow to the short-termism of fund managers.\nThe patient capital argument was well put by Tsuneo Kita, chairman and group CEO of Japan's largest financial news media company, Nikkei Inc, Stuart Irvine, CEO of Lion, the food and beverages group owned by Japanese company Kirin Lion, and by Peter Davis, chief executive of ANZ Banking Group's Japan office.\nThese executives, and another Japanese senior executive, Yasushi Takahashi, who is chairman and CEO of Mitsui & Co (Australia), trumpeted the benefits of investing for the long term.\nHowever, as the conference heard the benefits of an outward-looking attitude by Japanese companies, shareholders in Insurance Australia Group achieved a stunning victory over the board of that company.\nShareholders, led by Perpetual, forced the chairman Brian Schwartz and new chief executive Peter Harmer into an embarrassing reversal of strategy within days of it being articulated.\nIAG issued a brief statement to clarify its position in relation to investment in China . Just days after saying it was willing to invest up to $1 billion in China, IAG said that after receiving shareholder feedback it had \"determined not to pursue further investment in China\".\nIAG's outgoing CEO Mike Wilkins said: \"While we believe in the fundamentals of China, our future focus will be on pursuing growth opportunities in our other Asian markets and our core businesses in Australia and New Zealand.\"\nPreviously ignored warnings A major IAG shareholder told Chanticleer that Schwartz had previously ignored warnings issued to him about expansion in China.\n\"The board and management have not clearly articulated why they have a mandate to invest so much capital in China given their first experience,\" the shareholder said.\nIAG did not help its case by losing $60 million on an investment in a regional Chinese insurance company. But for IAG to turn its back on the world's second biggest economy is short sighted.\nThe audience at the Nikkei conference in Sydney was repeatedly reminded that long-term patient investment in Asia had been rewarded with strong returns over the years. A chart put up on the screen by Mitsui's Takahashi showed the slow growth experienced by the company in its early investments in the Pilbara. But the extraordinary earnings these days have made Australia the company's most successful international investment destination.\nIrvine from Lion said patient capital was needed to underpin the ten year strategy which the beer, dairy and drinks company was embarking on in Asia and the US.\n\"To grow into Asia you really have to put in the direct resources. You can't do it with just an export department. You need to be very patient,\" he told the Nikkei Asia Forum in Sydney on Thursday.\nLion this week signed an agreement with the biggest chilled dairy supplier in southern China – Canton American Flower Lounge – to take Lion brands into southern China.\nMr Irvine said that with demand for dairy products due to increase in China by $25billion over the next four years the agreement was an important step in the company using its backing from the large Japanese food company to expand into the region.\nHe said: \"Most Australian companies have some foreign investment. But we need to reinforce the message about the value of foreign investment.\"\nFree from 'tyranny' Irvine said Kirin's ownership of the company had freed him from the \"tyranny of quarterly reporting\".\nKirin bought 47 per cent of Lion in 1998 and then moved to full ownership in 2004 but clear results from the plan to use the relationship to leverage Australian food products into the broader Asian region have been slower to emerge than some observers expected at the time.\nMr Irvine said the company now had two new divisions with one focussed on taking dairy products into Asia, mainly China, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore.\nIt is interesting that the recalcitrant shareholders in IAG seem to be quite happy for the company to expand in Asian countries outside of China, some of which are regarded as high risk.\nAsia has been the preferred destination for Japanese investment. Japan is the largest foreign investor in Asia\nDavis from ANZ was pointedly asked about the position of ANZ's shareholders who have consistently complained about the bank's Asian strategy.\n\"I will refer to the comments Stuart (Irvine) made earlier on and that was patient investment,\" he said.\n\"Surely what has been lacking from Australian companies and investments in the region, and not just from companies but potentially their shareholders is patient investment.\n\"I have seen a great development of that ANZ business in Asia over the last eight years.\n\"It is very interesting and as I think our chairman commented on the appointment of a new CEO if we wanted to shift the strategy dramatically we would have gone externally not internally.\n\"Personally I am delighted to see Shayne as our new CEO from the first of January and I very much see a continuing investment in the region.\n\"The pressure you have mentioned from shareholders has been there from day one.\n\"I won't comment on whether it has been any greater or less than it has been.\n\"But I think we have to work patiently through our investments in the region.\n\"It's critical to our business, we now have 25 per cent of our revenues based there and I don't see that changing.\" Kita, in an exclusive interview with Chanticleer, said the private ownership of Nikkei afforded it the ability to invest for the long term. He views the $US1.3 billion purchase of the Financial Times as a 50 to 100-year investment horizon.\nConsolidation across industries The Nikkei's purchase of the FT is a classic example of the trends surrounding global brands.\nThere is a consolidation going in across all industries as companies seek to gain the benefits of scale. The Nikkei's ownership of the FT means it has control of one of the best two brands in the English financial media. The other is the Wall Street Journal.\nThe growth from the FT investment is likely to be predicated on subscription revenue. It can rise substantially because of the positive impact of price inelasticity in demand.\nAs the FT grows its information flows increase which in turn drives higher subscriptions. It will become compulsory reading in financial markets and have the financial resources to constantly lift the quality of its journalists.\nMeanwhile in Australia research shows business is not interested in international expansion according to Mukund Narayanamurti, CEO of AsiaLink.\nHe said research by PwC shows only 9 per cent of Australian businesses have a presence in Asia, only 12 per cent of Australian businesses have any experience at all of doing business in Asia.\nEven worse, two-thirds of Australian executives have said they have no intention of changing their stance toward Asia.\n\"Of those large businesses that do have a presence on the ground in Asia – only 23 per cent have a permanent presence so the rest are flying in and flying out,\" he said.\n\"Of those businesses which do have an Asia strategy, Asia accounts for only 12 per cent of the bottom line.\"\nNarayanamurti said: \"Rational managers, particularly at the C level with their short tenures and the long-term orientation that Asia demands, it seems to make sense why they are reluctant to invest and do business in the region, given the top line and bottom line growth.\"\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:06:51.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
