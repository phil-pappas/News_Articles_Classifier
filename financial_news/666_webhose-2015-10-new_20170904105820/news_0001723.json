Weatherford appeared minutes later, with 40,000 Weekly 9.50 puts expiring Oct. 23 bought for $0.48 and an equal number of 10.50s unloaded for $0.95.In both cases, volume was under open interest in the contracts sold. That suggests downside bearish positions were rolled down to the lower strikes as the trader looked for both stocks to remain under pressure. Long puts lock in prices where a stock can be sold, which gives them a bearish inverse correlation. (See our Education section)RIG is up 1.34 percent to $15.90 in afternoon trading while WFT is down 1.36 percent to $9.95. Both are down more than 10 percent since January and hit their lowest levels in more than a decade two months ago. The two names have declined along with the broader sector as weak global demand weighs on crude prices, but the stocks have bounced in recent weeks.WFT reports earnings on Oct. 21, so today's contracts will cover the event. RIG's release is estimated for early November.Puts dominated activity in both names so far today, according to the Depth Charge.
