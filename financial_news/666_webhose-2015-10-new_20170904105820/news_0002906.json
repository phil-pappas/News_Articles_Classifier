Bell is the prime contractor on the V-280 Valor but has teamed up with 11 other companies for parts.\nPentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall has previously said that mergers were increasing the leverage companies have with the U.S. Department of Defense.\nA representative from Bell said the agreement with Lockheed on the demonstrator had been amended to clarify that they would stay on track after the Lockheed-Sikorsky deal.\n\"I mean the point is it's not an insignificant event (Lockheed-Sikorsky deal) but it's not ... sky is falling kind of event either,\" said Keith Flail, Bell's programs director for the demonstrator and vertical lift program.\nA Sikorsky representative declined to comment on the deal and how it might affect the demonstrator program because the team had not been involved in merger discussions.\n\"But we're teams on the JMR medium in support of future vertical lift and we are committed to continue that,\" said Douglas Shidler, the Sikorsky program director for the JMR technology demonstrator program.
