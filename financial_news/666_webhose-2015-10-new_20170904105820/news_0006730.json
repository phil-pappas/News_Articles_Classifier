Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Auction clearance rates in the 60s are starting to feel like the new normal in Sydney, as the biggest housing market nudged 64 per cent on the weekend.\nClearances are well below the 75 per cent rate of this time last year. It was the eastern suburbs that propped up the market with 84 per cent but in the west, some agents witnessed zero bids.\n\"Don't get used to it, Sydney. The next few weeks we will have to start getting comfortable with the 50s,\" Domain Group economist Dr Andrew Wilson said.\n\"Nothing will stop the housing market more than interest rates , particularly given that the interest rate rises were against macroeconomic logic. We need lower not higher interest rates.\"\n\"Nobody is feeling that things are so good that we can absorb higher interest rates. Maybe the market is looking for an excuse to lay down.\"\nAll major banks have now raised their home loan interest rates for owner-occupier and investment loans. Westpac was the first to throw down the gauntlet with interest rate hikes.\nWestern Sydney hit Western Sydney is particularly feeling the heat. As areas like Guildford and Merrylands are already experiencing falling prices, this weekend did not bode well.\n \"Mine all passed in,\" said Ramin Rahimi of Starr Partners Merrylands.\n\"Another agent's listing sold in Bossley Park for $100,000 below the reserve price.\n\"We're seeing more private treaty sales before and after auctions which have cooling-off periods.\"\nLaing & Simmons' Ray Fayad and Lara Issa had some short-lived success and sold a five-bedroom house at 11 Badham Street, Merrylands for $1.16 million, $40,000 below the reserve.\n\"Our properties sold, but every one was below reserve. There were some tough auctions,\" Mr Fayad said.\n\"It's all owner-occupiers buying, investors are putting the brakes on â€¦ there are not many attending auctions.\"\nA four-bedroom house at 122 Railway Parade, Granville had only one bidder. Mr Fayad said he negotiated hard with the solo buyer before the hammer fell.\nMelbourne a winner Melbourne is following Sydney's lead but not with the same ferocity.\nIts volumes on the weekend have been the highest all year, despite its clearance rate of 69.8 per cent, which was the first time it had come below 70 per cent since mid-February.\n\"Melbourne is the winner of the losers. It's having the Bradbury effect,\" Dr Wilson said.\nThere was no \"visible\" lull, buyers agent David Morrell said.\n\"People are paying 5 to 10 per cent over. The banks might be raising rates, but houses are still the cheapest it has ever been.\n\"The only ones getting a pelting are units.\"\nOffshore buyers are not holding back either, Belle Property's Bo Zhang said.\n\"The pulse is still very strong. No changes in behaviour in the last year,\" he said.\n\"The auction rates don't bother offshore buyers, because most of the houses are sub $1 million to $2 million. With offshore buyers they play in the $4 million range.\"\nHe and his colleague Kara Johnson sold a four-bedroom house at 134 Kurraba Rd, Kurraba Point for just over $3 million for a Chinese-Australian family.\nThe local buyer was also Chinese.\n\"It was right on reserve and the bidders, who were all Chinese families, bid confidently,\" Ms Johnson said.\n\"None of them mentioned the banks in the campaign.\"\nBrisbane landed on a weaker 54.8 per cent, and was likely to be affected by the interest rate moves, Dr Wilson added.\n\"Next week will be another super Saturday with a mountain of listings,\" he said.\n\"But for sellers in Sydney, there will be some sleepless nights. Many have already bought houses and they will be pressured to sell.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:07:30.747+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
