Food and Drug Administration notified Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) it will not approve its eye drug Lifitegrast, the company said on Friday, adding that the U.S. health regulator recommended the company conduct additional clinical studies. \nThe news comes over a week before the FDA was supposed to make a decision on Lifitegrast on Oct 25. \nShire said it received a complete response letter, which the FDA sends to let a drug developer know a marketing application will not be approved in its present form. \nThe health regulator in its complete response letter has advised the British drugmaker to conduct additional clinical studies related to the quality of the drug. \nShire said on Friday it expects to report results from this study before the year end and if it is positive the company expects to re-submit the marketing application for Lifitegrast in the first quarter 2016. \nThe company had submitted a marketing application for the drug earlier this year in treating patients with dry eye disease, Shire said. \nChronic dry eye syndrome affects the eye's tear-producing glands where patients suffer from blurred vision and experience itching or a burning sensation in the eyes. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) affects over 19 million people in the United States. \nOther companies which develop drugs for the condition includes Eleven Biotherapeutics Inc (NasdaqGM: EBIO - news ) , Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. \nShire's shares closed at $209.63 on the Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) on Friday.
