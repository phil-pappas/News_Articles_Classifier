At 0850 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.8%, Germany's DAX was down 0.9% and France's CAC 40 was 1.2% weaker. \nData released earlier showed dollar-denominated exports in China dropped 3.7% in September from a year earlier, while imports fell 20.4%, marking their eleventh consecutive month of decline. Exports were better than expected but imports were weaker, raising doubts over domestic demand. \n\"While Chinese exports posted a healthy rebound, weak imports are still indicating that the Chinese economy is continuing to struggle,\" said Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black . \nThe Stoxx Europe 600 basic resources took a hit, slumping 2.4% as worries about China - a major consumer of metals - gathered pace. \n\"Later today focus will shift onto the US where earnings season is shifting up a gear with JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) and Intel (Swiss: INTC.SW - news ) reporting after the close of trading. Overall sentiment remains neutral with markets feeling a tiny bit tired and likely to continue to consolidate after the huge run-up of last week. However lower prices are likely to tempt buyers back into the market especially the ones who have missed out on the initial run-up just over a week ago,\" said Huber. \nOn the corporate front, SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) shares shot higher after an agreement in principle to a possible Â£44 per share takeover offer from Anheuser-Busch InBev . \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in German software company SAP (Amsterdam: AP6.AS - news ) rallied after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales and operating profit. \nOn the downside, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) slipped into the red following press reports that it's set to name US investment banker Jes Staley as its new chief executive. \nLuxury goods group LVMH slid following a mixed set of third-quarter results. \nStill to come on the macroeconomic calendar, the German ZEW survey is at 1000 BST.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:18:30.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
