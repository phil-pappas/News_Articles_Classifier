Supplied The area onstage near an orchestra's conductor is usually reserved for violinists, violists and cellists. But put on a virtual-reality headset, and you are so close to Gustavo Dudamel, the wild-haired conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, that he almost hits you with his baton.\nHe is consumed with conducting Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and you have the sensation of enjoying a private performance. The project, which introduces classical music to people who have never set foot in a concert hall, is touring Los Angeles in a van.\nMost days the appropriately named Van Beethoven is parked outside the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the LA Philharmonic's home. Inside are several concert seats and pairs of virtual-reality headsets, which render a scene in three dimensions. The aim is to use technology to entice a new flock of concertgoers to attend a real-life version, says Amy Seidenwurm, who speaks for the orchestra.\nClassical concertgoers are becoming greyer and rarer. In 2012 around 9 per cent of American adults attended a classical-music event, a quarter less than in 2002, according to the National Endowment for the Arts. A third came from families earning $100,000 or more a year. Moreover, those used to \"on demand\" digital music can be less keen on showing up at a set time, to hear something someone else has chosen to play for them.\nUntil recently virtual reality was a futuristic technology, but it is slowly penetrating real life. In November Oculus, a company owned by Facebook, will join Samsung to sell a virtual-reality device for $99. This should be great for orchestras like the LA Philharmonic. However, some consumers are bound to wonder why it is worth going to a real-life concert when they can have one of their own on their sofa, and never worry about being late.\nThe Economist\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/WiHlVPj6i-o"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:07:35.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
