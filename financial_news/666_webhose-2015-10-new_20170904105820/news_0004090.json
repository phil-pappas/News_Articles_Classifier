Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The rushed transfer capital out of China by investors should not be confused with money laundering, experts warned.\nNot all monies transferred to Australia to fund investments such as Australian property are \"dirty\" even if they were transferred through \"dubious\" channels such as casinos and money conduits like Western Union.\n\"It's important to distinguish between flight of capital and money laundering. Flight [of] capital is not illegal. It is not a domestic offence,\" Thomson Reuters' head regulatory analyst Nathan Lynch said.\n\"Our concern that all the money from China laundered, that's not true.\"\nThe volatility in the Chinese market including sharemarket swings and currency devaluation have resulted in an exodus of cash from China, in search of a \"safe haven\".\nThis has prompted the Chinese government to ramp up the control of capital outflow from Chinese residents including the tightening of restrictions on cash withdrawals from foreign ATMs.\nBut it is difficult to distinguish what funds are legitimate and agencies such as AUSTRAC do not have the \"right mandate\" to support in-depth investigations of funds transferred to Australia.\n\"The law is the problem, not the agencies,\" Mr Lynch said. \"There's a massive money river flowing downstream from China and we have dammed half of it.\"\n The much-anticipated second tranche of the reform to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 is yet to be rolled out.\n\"Politicians have been conspicuously evasive on their bipartisan commitment to follow through with a second tranche,\" Mr Lynch said.\n\"The second tranche of the legislation would rope in accountants, lawyers, jewellers, real estate agents, trust and company service providers and other designated non-financial businesses and professions as reporting entities.\"\nBaker & McKenzie lawyer Emma Hunter agreed the delay of the second tranche is slowing the regulation of Australia's overheated property industry.\nAn AUSTRAC spokesperson said the statutory review of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act is expected to be tabled in Parliament by the end of the year.\nThe other important element in combating money laundering is to work closely with China.\n\"Should Australia be reporting all data on Chinese nationals back to China for example?\" Mr Lynch said.\n\"In the end, the reason for money laundering lies with Australia. If you look at how much capital is invested in property, there's not a lot in it for Australia to crackdown on money laundering.\n\"We support free trade and with huge amounts coming, in politicians are happy to turn a blind eye.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:20:11.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
