The men said they experienced \"stress, humiliation, frustration, sadness and embarrassment\" and were made to \"feel inferior and different because of their beliefs.\"\nThe case is Robinson v. General Motors Co, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, No. 4:15-cv-0158.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Lisa Shumaker)\nCompany Legal & Law Matters class action lawsuit General Motors Chris Scruggs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:56:34.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
