Friday’s disappointing US jobs data also continued to have a positive impact on markets, thwarting hopes of a Federal Reserve rate rise before the end of the year. \nThe FTSE 100 is now trading at its highest level since August 20, although it is still down by 11.3pc since hitting an all time record high of 7,104 in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) . \nDavid Madden, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “Commodity stocks are back in fashion as rumours of a Chinese stimulus package are doing the rounds. The mining industry has been battered and bruised recently, but the possibility of an easing policy from China has seen the buyers flood back in again.” \nHaving dominated the market last week, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) retained its place at the top of the FTSE leaderboard. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) soared 21.1pc to 115p in afternoon trade as the City was rife with takeover speculation. Before the FTSE opened, Hong-Kong listed shares in the international mining and trading group surged by as much as 70pc after a report in The Sunday Telegraph revealed the under-pressure miner would listen to takeover offers. \nOnly last week, chatter surfaced that the FTSE 100 company was close to selling a stake in its agriculture business , having attracted interest from sovereign wealth funds. \nHowever, Mike van Dulken, of Accendo Markets, reckons copper price stability and the bounce in oil prices also helped the miner claim the top spot. Although, as the focus shifts back to Glencore’s restructuring and debt reduction measures, Mr van Dulken warned: “Volatility is likely to stick around a while longer.” \nAntofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) inched 5.5pc higher to 537.5p, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) rose 4.7pc to 579.5p and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) advanced 2.2pc to £10.65p. \nOil stocks were among the risers, after Brent crude hit an intraday high of $49.87 per barrel. The price of oil rose for a second day as the number of rigs drilling in the US slumped to a five-year low. \nMr van Dulken said many will be hoping Brent rises above the $50.4 mark, as prices have been boosted by Friday’s “reversed digestion of US jobs data”. Geopolitical risk, such as rising tension in the Middle East as Russia backs the Syrian president, and a supply disruption has also lifted oil prices. \nRoyal Dutch Shell B shares advanced 5.2pc to £17.06, while rivals BG Group added 4.8pc to £10.35p, BP rose 4.7pc to 368p and mid-cap stock Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) leapt 12.1pc to 79p. Brent crude futures Nov '15 (Source: Bloomberg) \nIrish building materials company CRH (EUREX: 558474.EX - news ) made gains of 57p to £17.68 as the most likely candidate to succeed John Boehner as the US speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, committed to coming up with a multi-year Highway Bill by the end of this month. \nBarry Dixon, of Davy, said: “This would have a very positive impact on the prospects for US highway spending in the US over the next six years and for CRH in particular which is the largest provider of raw materials into this end market.” \nOn a day when many expected shares in ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) to falter following England’s exit from the Rugby World Cup , a bullish broker note from Liberum lifted the stock. \nShares inched 4.4p, or 1.8pc, higher to 252.2p, as analysts insisted England crashing out of the international tournament at the weekend would have a “limited impact” on the television broadcaster. \nAs this month’s advertising slots are booked between four and six weeks in advance, it should have little impact on advertising revenues. Liberum reckons a strong programming line-up this quarter, including the X-factor and Downton Abbey, means ITV should not feel too much pain from England’s early departure. \nElsewhere, shares in Playtech (LSE: PTEC.L - news ) were left shaken after it received a letter from the Central Bank of Ireland (EUREX: 1269463.EX - news ) opposing its proposed acquisitio n of Ava Trades. \nThe stock slipped to a four month low, down 21.5p to 806.5p. While the update from Playtech was shy on specific details relating to the Irish financial regulator’s opposition of the deal, the mid-cap company expressed confidence that it can address the issues it raised and obtain regulatory approval. \nGavin Kelleher, of Goodbody, said: “Stumbling blocks such as this with the AvaTrade deal were not expected so this will come as a surprise.” \nOutsourcing company Xchanging (LSE: XCH.L - news ) enjoyed its sharpest intraday move ever, closing up 49.9pc to 166p, after confirming on Sunday it is in talks over two separate all-cash takeover bids from larger rival Capita (LSE: CPI.L - news ) and US-based private equity investors Apollo Global Management. \nRobin Speakman, of Shore Capital, said Xchanging has “a strong business in insurance” and “the bids clearly seek value in the insurance franchise”. \n“We cannot discount the emergence of a yet higher offer from another party, perhaps a peer in global financial services support seeking additional synergies, or indeed a higher offer from either Capita or Apollo,” Mr Speakman added. \nMeanwhile, FTSE 250 company Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) jumped 3.4pc to 375.5p after raising $33.6m for its subsidiary Precision Biopsy, which is developing a new way to identify and treat prostate cancer. \nAim-listed Aminex (LSE: AEX.L - news ) jumped 7.2pc to 1.9p after the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation said it would acquire a 5pc working interest in the Kiliwani North Development Licence, which contains a well that is expected to produce up to 30m feet per day of gas. \nFinally, Nostra Terra closed flat despite chatter in the City it is set to announce its first acquisition outside the US shortly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:23:38.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
