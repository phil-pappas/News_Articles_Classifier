They were down 1 percent in the second quarter, an improvement from the 1.5 percent decline recorded in the first quarter.\nThat was at the top end of analyst expectations of a fall of between 1 to 1.5 percent and better than Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons' most recent quarterly performances.\nLewis said a typical basket of Tesco shopping was 3 percent cheaper year-on-year. He expects more deflation in the second half. \"We don't see the market condition changing,\" he said.\nInternational sales, which account for more than a fifth of the group total, showed their first like-for-like increase in nearly three years in the first half, boosted by recovery in Poland and Slovakia.\nOne major Tesco institutional shareholder welcomed the results.\n\"The stand out for me was the comment on volume and transaction growth,\" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"That suggests that something is improving on an underlying basis.\"\n\nNO MORE DISPOSALS\nConcerns linger around the strength of Tesco's balance sheet and when it can rid itself of a junk credit rating.\nLewis said no further material disposals were planned following the recent sale of its South Korean unit for $6.1 billion, which cut total indebtedness to 17.7 pounds.\nTesco will now retain its Dunnhumby data unit after a planned sale flopped.\nFurther debt reduction would come from better cash generation from retained businesses, while seeking cash from shareholders was not being considered.\nThough finance chief Alan Stewart said Tesco was not under any debt or liquidity pressure, given 5 billion pounds of undrawn facilities, some analysts remain unconvinced.\n\"We continue to believe that Tesco will need to raise capital and potentially a considerable amount in order to progress without looking over its 'balance sheet shoulder',\" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
