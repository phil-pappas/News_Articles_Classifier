Eagle High pledged some plantations as well as palm oil factories owned by its five subsidiaries as security for the loan, Suhendra said. \nIn June, Malaysia's Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd said it will buy 37 percent of Eagle High from Rajawali for $680 million. \nFelda said last month that it was \"taking additional steps\" to ensure its purchase brings value to shareholders. The statement came after Malaysian newspaper The Star reported, citing unidentified sources, that Felda had not paid a $174.5 million deposit due for the stake purchase. \nTalks with Felda are continuing, Eagle High's Suhendra said on Tuesday, declining to give more details.
