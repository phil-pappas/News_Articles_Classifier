I hope President Obama and Senate Democrats will work with us and do the right thing for our country,” House Speaker John Boehner said.\nArguing that it “is not needed at this time”, the White House has threatened to veto the bill.\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz told a Congressional hearing this week that impact of lifting the ban would be limited.\nThe Congress should instead “be focusing its efforts on supporting our transition to a low-carbon economy”, the White House said.\nHowever, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, “Today, the House took prudent action to lift the crude oil export ban and in turn, pave the way for job creation, lower gasoline prices, and a stronger geo-political standing. This bill will make America and its allies more secure.”\n“We are the only developed country that bans crude oil exports. It makes no sense. Lifting this ban benefits American families by creating jobs and lowering gas prices,” said Congressman Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n“It also improves US national security by giving our allies the option to purchase crude oil from the US instead of being forced to buy from countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela,” he said.\nDebate on the issue now shifts to the Senate, where the measure faces steep hurdles to passage.\n 10, 2015 11:22 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:35:21.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
