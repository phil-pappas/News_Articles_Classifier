It's a fact worth repeating. \nThe sub-Saharan African economy in particular has surged forward, more than quadrupling in the period since 2000. But this is no time for complacency. \nThis week in Lima, Peru on the sidelines of the annual World Bank/IMF meetings - I will attend the annual MEFMI Forum ( Macroeconomic Financial Management Institute of Eastern & Southern Africa ) where I will join the continent's Central Bank Governors and Finance Ministers where we will discuss ways to ensure this growth continues. \nThis meeting comes at an important period, especially as the Sustainable Development Goals now come into view. It is critical for our counterparts around the world to approach this new agenda through facts rather than outdated perceptions. \nWhile other countries have been left deeply scarred by the toxic mix of recession and joblessness caused by the global financial crisis, African economies have proved remarkably resilient, despite the seemingly never-ending bad press that reinforces many of the continent's negative stereotypes. \nRather than persisting with a conversation about grand ambition, the emphasis now should shift to a focus on a few areas that will have the biggest impact. In this context, five themes should be viewed as priorities for action as we move beyond the original goals of the millennium. \nI. Embracing a philosophy of shared value \nThe concept of shared value -- the idea that you can pursue profit with purpose; that you can do business while having a direct positive economic impact on the communities in which you operate -- has increasingly struck a chord with many Africans. \nBusinesses are increasingly realizing there are no short cuts, and, more importantly, they realize that for their business to grow over the longer term, the economies and communities in which they operate need to grow sustainably. The bigger the skills pool, the more jobs and economic opportunities are created, the larger the spending power of consumers and government, on one hand, the greater the number of opportunities for business growth there will be, on the other hand. A philosophy of shared value is fundamental to this win-win growth equation. For us to accelerate Africa's progress it is critical that we all -- across the private, public and social sectors -- actively embrace this philosophy. \nII. Promoting entrepreneurship \nA key element of the growth equation will be the promotion of entrepreneurship across Africa. Today, indigenous African firms like the Mara Group, SEPLAT Petroleum Development Company, Kenya Women's Finance Trust, and OUTsurance, create direct and indirect economic opportunities for hundreds of thousands of Africans. It is entrepreneurial enterprises like these that will be the main drivers of the job creation required to realize inclusive, sustainable growth. For organizations genuinely committed to shared value, the promotion of local content and enterprise development should therefore clearly be a key business priority. \nIII. Accelerating regional integration \nThe challenges of moving goods and people across borders remain a source of significant frustration for many of us who do business in Africa. \nNegotiations are underway for the creation of the so-called Tripartite Free Trade Area, which will constitute an integrated market comprising 26 African countries with a combined population of 600m people (only China and India have larger populations), a total GDP of over US$1 trillion, and a long term GDP growth rate in excess of 5%. However, there remains some way to go to realise this ambition, and there needs to be greater urgency to accelerate the process of regional integration more generally. \nIV. Bridging the infrastructure gap \nUltimately, though, the impact of regional integration will depend on the quality of our infrastructure, both to physically connect markets and to generate enough electricity to support the development of manufacturing and other industrial sectors, and enhance the overall competitiveness of the region. While progress is being made in parts of Africa, things are still moving too slowly. The biggest gap appears to be in developing infrastructure projects from concept to a phase of 'bankability'. \nV. Forging productive partnerships \nPartnerships are going to be critical if we are to realize Africa's possibilities. Although trust between business and governments across many parts of Africa remains low, embracing a win-win philosophy of shared value could provide a platform for dialogue and collaborative action. However, in order for us to successfully drive inclusive, sustainable growth, we are also going to have to be a lot more proactive in forging multi-dimensional partnerships -- across business, government, development finance institutions, donor agencies, and so on -- particularly to address cross-cutting priorities of entrepreneurial development, regional integration and infrastructure development. \nEyes on the horizon \nThe shape of Africa's future will rest on our ability to connect and integrate markets across the continent, and the (related) cooperation between the public and private sector. This collaboration is particularly important in order to encourage and harness inclusive growth, job creation, growing domestic economic opportunities and a higher tax base. These factors will, in turn, enable greater levels of regional integration and more effective government, and underpin and sustain Africa's success story. \nThe building blocks of economic, political and social reform, together with resilient growth rates, mean that the continent as a whole is on track to sustain its forward progress. But this is neither clear cut nor guaranteed; active dialogue and collaborative action are essential to realize Africa's possibilities. \nLet's get to work. \nRohan Malik is EY Global Emerging Markets and Deputy Global Government & Public Sector Leader. @RohanMalik_EY The views reflected in this article are the views of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the global EY organization or its member firms.
