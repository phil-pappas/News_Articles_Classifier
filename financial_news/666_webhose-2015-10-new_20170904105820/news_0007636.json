Tax was due. \nHMRC factored the underpaid tax into his code, and his PAYE income was thus adjusted. So far, so good. \nThis very organised individual, however, then completed and submitted his self-assessment return for the year 2014‑15 in May this year some eight months ahead of the deadline. \nAgain, tax was due. \nThe taxpayer’s efficiency in filing his return was matched by the efficiency of HMRC in contacting his employer: a new code was issued and as a result his pay was further reduced. \nBy filing so early this taxpayer was in effect paying two years’ worth of tax simultaneously. \nUnderpaid tax for the 2014‑15 year was therefore being paid well ahead of the due date. \n“A phone call corrected the matter, with HMRC agreeing to remove the 2014‑15 underpayment so that just one year’s underpayment was being coded out,” said Gary Heynes of Baker Tilly. \nBut he pointed out, as Telegraph Money has frequently reported, how frustrating and difficult it was to contact HMRC about anything let alone the potentially nightmarish complexities posed by tax coding. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) seems if you file too early you risk a double hit on tax,” Mr Heynes said. “HMRC appears to operate on the basis of 'if you shout, we’ll take it out’.” \n- Do you really need to fill in a self-assessment tax return? \nIn theory the coding system is an excellent way for employees to pay additional tax. In order for the tax to be coded, the sum owed needs to be less than £3,000 and your self-assessment form needs to be in by December 31 (electronic filing) or October 31 (for paper returns). \nPresumably by this stage of the year there’s enough landing on HMRC’s doorstep for it to take a few months to inform employers. \nBut paying via your code is only as good as the coding is accurate. \nUnfortunately, HMRC has given taxpayers repeated grounds to mistrust its processes. \nTax codes, being difficult to understand, plant in many minds a suspicion that calculations may have gone awry. \nMeanwhile, our groaning tax system is heaped with layer upon layer of further complexities. \nAn HMRC spokesman told me the default position was to issue new codes when new information is received which includes self-assessment returns filed early. But you can specify over the phone when you would like the coding to apply, he said. \nTo my mind it’s simpler to file closer to the deadline and just pay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:55:10.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
