The first review of Greece's 86-billion-euro bailout is due to start later this month.\nGreek debt was the best performing in the euro zone on Monday, with two-year yields down more than 80 basis points at a 2015 low of 8.24 percent, according to Tradeweb.\nThe gap between Greek and German two-year yields was also at its narrowest this year.\nShort-dated yields remain higher than those on longer-term bonds, however, in a sign that investors still fear the country could be heading towards default. Ten-year yields were down 22 bps to 7.68 percent.\nThere was a more muted reaction in stock markets. Athens' benchmark ATG index was up 0.1 percent, lagging a 0.4 percent rise on the pan-European FTSEurofirst.\nSome Greek bank shares were up as much as 5 percent .\nOther euro zone bond yields were flat to a touch higher after Chinese growth data beat expectations and a top ECB policymaker struck a note of caution about an extension to Europe's quantitative easing scheme.\nChinese output in the third quarter was up 6.9 percent from the same quarter last year, beating forecasts for a 6.8 percent rise. But it was the first time growth has dipped below 7 percent since the financial crisis.\nWeakening Chinese demand is exacerbating a decline in commodity prices and global consumer price growth. In Europe, this has led to another bout of deflation.\nBut ahead of the ECB's policy meeting on Wednesday, governing council member Ewald Nowotny told a Polish newspaper it was too early to talk of an extension of its trillion euro asset purchase scheme. This appeared to contrast with comments last week in which he said bond-buying might be broadened.\nBenchmark German bond yields rose 1 bps to 0.55 percent .
