The funding opportunity is part of Reclamation's activity under the Department of the Interior's WaterSMART initiative, which focuses on improving water conservation, sustainability and helping water resource managers make sound decisions about water use. This year, Reclamation anticipates providing funding for 5-10 projects. The funding opportunity is available at http://www.grants.gov by searching funding opportunity number R16-FOA-DO-003. Proposals must be submitted as indicated in the application packet by 4 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, Dec. 10, 2015. It is anticipated that awards will be made this spring.\nReclamation provides funding through the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program for projects that reclaim and reuse municipal, industrial, domestic or agricultural wastewater and naturally impaired ground or surface waters. Reclaimed water can be used for a variety of purposes, such as environmental restoration, fish and wildlife, groundwater recharge, municipal, domestic, industrial, agricultural, power generation or recreation. Water reuse is a drought resistant water supply and is an essential tool for stretching limited water supplies in the Western United States.\nTitle XVI projects provide communities with a new source of clean water while promoting water and energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. Title XVI also is an important part of the Department of the Interior's implementation of the Presidentâ€™s June 2013 Climate Action Plan and the Nov. 1, 2013 Executive Order, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change.\nSince 1992, approximately $629 million in federal funding through the Title XVI program has been leveraged with non-Federal funding to implement more than $3 billion in water reuse improvements. The president's FY 2016 budget request included a $20 million request for the Title XVI program.\nTo learn more about WaterSMART and the Title XVI program, please visit http://www.usbr.gov/WaterSMART .", "external_links": ["http://www.usbr.gov/WaterSMART", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy51c2JyLmdvdi9XYXRlclNNQVJU", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ncmFudHMuZ292L3dlYi9ncmFudHMvdmlldy1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS5odG1sP29wcElkPTI3OTY4NQ=="], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:32:29.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
