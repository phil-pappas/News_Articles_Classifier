Picture: iStock.\nSophie Elsworth ENTICING low-rate home loan deals in the three per cent range might seem fabulous value but they may not always be the cheapest option.\nMany cheap home loan deals come without the bells and whistles of accounts with higher rates and could end up costing more in the long run.\nFIND the best home loan deal\nData from financial comparison website Finder.com.au shows the lowest variable rate home loan on their database has a rate of 3.95 per cent but comes with some hefty costs.\nThis includes a $300 application fee, $395 legal fee and $250 settlement fee.\nThe site’s spokeswoman Michelle Hutchison says customers need to be aware of what fees and charges apply to the loan they are signing up to and not just focus on the rate alone.\n“Some of the low-rate home loan deals may not come with all the bells and whistles that other lenders offer,’’ she says.\n“For instance some lenders may not have branches which could be a turn-off to some borrowers.\n“Some of these loans might also require a 20 per cent deposit, or more, and this may eliminate some borrowers.’’\nFinder.com.au spokeswoman Michelle Hutchison says customers need to understand what the fees and charges are that apply to their home loan. Source: Supplied\nGET the cheapest variable rate home loan\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia meets again tomorrow (Tues) and it’s strongly expected they will keep the cash rate on hold at two per cent where it has remained since May.\nFinder data shows on a $300,000 30-year home loan the average variable is 5.09 per cent and the average three-year fixed rate is 4.54 per cent.\nBut the mortgage market is fiercely competitive and there are plenty of cheaper deals to be had.\n1300homeloan director John Kolenda says a good way to understand the true cost of a home loan is to look at the comparison rate which includes all the fees and charges that apply to the loan.\n“The most important thing to look at is the total cost of the borrowing which includes the upfront costs and any ongoing fees and charges and the exit costs,’’ he says.\n“Technically you can have a really low rate but if it has a monthly fee attached to it and it has an application fee it will increase the comparison rate.\n“So on the surface a really low rate might be more expensive than a higher-rate advertised product.”\n@sophieelsworth\n Zoom in on best home loan rates ", "external_links": ["http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans#itm_t=story&itm_l=elsworth-get-best-home-loan", "http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans/variable-rate#itm_t=story&itm_l=elsworth-low-rate-loan", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://twitter.com/sophieelsworth", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F05%2F05%2F2015%2F17289%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/454b45082e3e23e59b18ec0bd6c35fc1", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9d36983637a868d8188046ce8ce24aac", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/5706e54c949d3e5d88e54200c8d55e30?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:47:39.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
