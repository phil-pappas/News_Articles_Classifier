Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Gen George knew having a united team was key to her start-up's survival, so when the weekly meeting began crackling with tension, she realised she needed to fix it. Fast.\nGeorge had launched OneShift as an employment site for short-term retail and hospitality workers in 2012. But a deluge of new users forced the team to significantly expand their offering or risk losing a momentum they had barely dared to dream about.\nRapid growth meant workers, who were already flat-out, unexpectedly had to build a range of new functionality into the site, while the customer service team was almost flooded with new clients.\nUsers and revenue was rocketing upwards but the boom was taking its toll. It wasn't until a weekly all-together meeting months after the boom began that anyone realised it was evolving from pressure into a fully blown problem.\nFrustration comes out \"You could hear the frustration in their voices as they talked about why they weren't meeting goals. You could almost feel it,\" George tells Fairfax Media.\n\"We had two key teams clashing. It's easy for teams to fall in love with new ideas and forget about older core ones. We'd worked hard to build a team where it was OK to bring an issue out in the open, and here it was.\"\nAfter a series of heated meetings, George and her teams were able to more equitably share core resources such as the development team's time, but the drama taught George the importance of a more proactive approach to managing an issue.\n \"It's so important to deal with it as quickly as possible. The longer you leave it stewing, the more the business gets affected and it takes longer to fix.\"\nIn rapidly growing start-ups, problems are rarely far away. Founders can easily spend the vast majority of their time hiring, and considering firing, staff.\nAnother staffing challenge emerged that forced George to reconsider, and eventually restructure, how she managed the burgeoning team.\nHiring and firing \"In the early days, you have to hire high performers in areas you have no personal expertise in, and no one on the team knows either,\" George says.\n\"It turns out someone can sound excellent and you don't realise until they're actually in the business that there is a problem.\"\nOne such problem emerged within weeks of a new team member starting.\nGeorge, who still has a one-on-one catch up with every person in her now 50-strong team every quarter, was working hard to build a company where people were friends as well as co-workers, which works well when everyone is pulling their weight.\n\"Goals weren't being met, and that's OK that happens. But then there was a bit of fighting and we hoped it was a personality clash that would sort itself out,\" she says.\n\"But when this person started accusing people of being part of the company for the wrong reasons, it became clear they were panicking that they were being found out.\"\nSmoothing things over A fan of pulling people into the boardroom, raising an issue and emerging with an agreed upon solution within half an hour, George began a series of conversations with the team member that were resolved when they decided to quit.\nThe conversation has informed how she manages her team ever since.\nWhile she is yet to hire a chief operations officer or an HR manager, George established a network of procedures and practices to ensure her team was able to identify and act on emerging issues before they blew up.\n\"We've been fortunate in that over the past 18 months, we've created a mentality where everyone is in the HR team. If we're honest and transparent with each other, frustrations get sorted out before they become an issue,\" George says.\nWith 37,000 businesses using OneShift, and more than 560,000 job candidates seeking work, George says they'll have to hire someone to head up official HR policies sooner or later.\n\"I just want to work out a way to maintain that small business mentality of agility and actually caring about each other as we build in the big-business infrastructure to maintain and grow our reach.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-10-19T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:11:56.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
