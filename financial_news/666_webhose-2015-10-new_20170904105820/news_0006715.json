The workers voted to unionize about one year ago.\nRatification would mark a victory for the world's largest airline, formed by the merger of American Airlines and US Airways in 2013. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier is aiming for a smooth integration of its workforce and has already concluded contracts with its pilots and flight attendants.\nThe company's shares remained unchanged following the news at $38.83 in after-market trade.
