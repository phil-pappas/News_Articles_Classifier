David Rowe Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl The reception in Port Moresby was already buzzing when ANZ chief executive Mike Smith quietly pushed into the back of the room in a rather tight-fitting traditional South Pacific bula shirt.\nIt was a striking sight for a man many Australians might think normally dresses like a character from the Monopoly board, so it's not surprising one guest asked whether he had just been out doing some souvenir shopping.\n\"No way. I've got a wardrobe full of these shirts back home and these are the only times I get to wear them,\" the ANZ chief executive shot back with a grin before wading into a crowd of clients where even a bula shirt was a tad overdressed.\nThe domestic banking version of the Monopoly game lost its most outspoken major executive this week when Smith retired from the ANZ job he has held for eight years, and in doing so triggering the latest round of an old debate.\nMike Smith visiting the booming western Chinese inland city of Chengdu in 3013 Qilai Shen. Can investors and analysts find a way to value investment in Asia, such as that driven by Smith, that reflects the long term-nature of the business but the potential rewards as neighbouring countries grow faster than Australia?\nAustralia already depends on Asia for up to two-thirds of its exports. But as a capital-importing country without broad and deep knowledge of the diverse business cultures in Asia, moving beyond this transactional business to investment is a major national challenge.\nA PwC study underlined this dilemma last year estimating that investment in New Zealand almost doubled that in south-east Asia and only about 9 per cent of Australian businesses were operating in Asia, even though it is forecast to account for half of world output by mid-century.\n\"Companies that are now successful in Asia arrived there up to 15 years ago and they made their business plans and investments work. Along with large local businesses, they are now the competition – and they are world-class competitors,\" PwC partner Andrew Parker says.\nA PNG dance group sponsored by ANZ to promote financial literacy and mobile banking in the under-banked country. But perhaps it takes an outsider to really see the challenge and the opportunity. Smith's departure has raised questions about whether his successor, Shayne Elliott, can meet a target of 25 per cent of profits from Asia by 2017, especially with tougher capital adequacy standards and slower global growth.\nFrankness will be missed But while Smith may have left his successor a tall order – at least in the short term – the outsider has nonetheless also left a benchmark for other companies when the International Monetary Fund is warning Australia faces a long period of slow domestic growth.\nSo while ANZ shareholders will focus on how Elliott will balance sector-wide emerging technology challenges with a still-evolving super-regional Asian strategy, the business world will be the poorer without Smith's frankness about everything from local politicians to Australians' timidity seizing Asian opportunities.\nBeyond his day job, Smith has been a key figure in nurturing national ventures, such as the Asialink business taskforce, on an Asia-capable workforce and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's new Colombo plan to a series of studies on subjects ranging from the PNG alternative electricity to how services could replace resources exports.\nSmith arrived at the ANZ after a 30-year career at HSBC, mostly in Asia, to take over a bank that had only recently exited its regional banking network through the India-based Grindlays group.\nAt a time when many directors were still recovering from getting their fingers burned in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Smith eventually established the 25 per cent of Asian earnings target. Stakes in more than half a dozen Asian banks from Indonesia to China provided the initial ballast for meeting this target but have since become more of a millstone under tough new Australian capital adequacy rules, leaving Elliott with the task of selling the $5 billion in Asian equity investments and making the bank's in-house regional business really fire.\nSmith is, not surprisingly, a major figure in the bilateral business relationship between Australia and China, given about 25 per cent of the bank's Asian exposure is in China, two of its biggest equity stakes are there and how China's rising Asian business role plays to the super-regional strategy.\nBut his appearance at the Port Moresby reception in August after spending the day visiting various PNG government officials says a lot more about his real enthusiasm for the practical business of meeting the 25 per cent earnings target.\nSmith has visited PNG alone every year since he took over the ANZ job, in a time commitment to just one small corner of a diverse region that few other top Australian CEOs can match. And when some of his staff had long since retired for dinner, he was still working the bula shirt overtime – a far cry from the Monopoly board image.\nAnd in the end, that is what may well set Smith apart as a genuine national business figure from other recent controversial foreign CEO imports such as George Trumbull at AMP and Sol Trujillo at Telstra. The soon-to-be former ANZ boss plans to stick around in Australia when the result of that 25 per cent benchmark will be there for all to see.\nGreg Earl was a guest of ANZ in Port Moresby.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl", "http://asialink.unimelb.edu.au/asialink_business/asialink_taskforce"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:04:35.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
