Security of supply has a value,\" he said. \nThe 16 billion pound ($25 billion) project to build two Areva-designed EPR reactors was announced in October 2013, but financial problems at Areva and long delays at two EPR reactors under construction in France and Finland have delayed the British project. \nLevy said nothing about what size stake Chinese investors might take. Originally, China General Nuclear Corporation (CGN) and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) were set to take a combined 30-40 percent. \n\"We expect to put in place a partnership with CGN, which has been our partner in China for more than 30 years,\" Levy said, without mentioning CNNC. \nLevy also said he expected EDF would finalise its agreement to buy 51 percent of Areva's reactor unit Areva NP by the end of next year. \nA source told Reuters this month the French government wants EDF and Areva to keep a combined 66 percent stake in Areva NP -- 51 percent for EDF, 15 percent for Areva -- and that EDF should look for one or more partners for the remaining 34 percent. \nLevy also said French power prices would have to increase in coming years to finance the upgrading of EDF's nuclear fleet, estimated to cost 55 billion euros over the coming decade. \n\"We will regularly ask the government for acceptable increases,\" he said. \nHe declined to specify whether the next power price hike would be in line with the 2.5 percent increase on Aug. 1. \n($1 = 0.6477 pounds) (Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:22:06.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
