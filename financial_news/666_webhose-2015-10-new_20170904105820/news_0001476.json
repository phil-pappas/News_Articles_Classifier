The most recent tranche of shares has been bought for approximately half a billion pounds. \nInvestment bankers at Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) have been selling the shares on behalf of UK Financial investments, the state agency responsible for managing the shareholdings in the bailed out banks for the Treasury. \nThe sell-off to institutions will continue until the end of the year, before ordinary investors buy up to £2bn of discounted shares to conclude the bank’s seven-and-a-half years of Government support. \n\"I am determined to build on this success by making Lloyds shares available to the public next spring, so that we can build a share-owning democracy and continue to reduce our national debt,\" said George Osborne, the Chancellor. \nSeparately, the Treasury has given Royal Bank of Scotland notice that it wants to convert 51 billion 'B' shares that were issued during the bailout into 5.1 billion new ordinary shares, removing another hurdle to the bank’s move into full private ownership. \nThe first batch of the state’s RBS shares was returned to private hands in August when the Treasury sold a 5.4pc holding to take its economic ownership down from 78.3pc to 72.9pc. \nThe newly-announced conversion means that all of the Government’s holding will be through ordinary shares. \nThe B Shares were given to the Treasury as part of the 2008 bailout, to ensure the bank did not breach rules on no investor owning more than 75pc of the firm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:12:42.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
