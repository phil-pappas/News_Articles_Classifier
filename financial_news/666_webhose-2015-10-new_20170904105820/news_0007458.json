The stock began the session with a powerful breakout gap  that lifted shares over 4% higher. This earnings-inspired ramp  is attracting the stock's second heaviest upside volume since February. \n\nWith a very heavy resistance zone  now approaching, a healthy pullback may be needed soon despite the very bullish action today. For GM bulls, a light-volume fade before the summer highs are cleared will offer a low-risk entry opportunity.\nWith today's jump, GM is now up over 25% from its multi-week September low. This powerful move began to lose steam early last week as shares neared its flat lining 200-day moving average . With volume in steady decline over the last two weeks, it appeared that the heavy resistance near the 200-day would cap the October bull run. Ahead of earnings, GM traced out a narrow low-volume consolidation just below $34. The positive news this morning ended the sideways pattern with a powerful breakout. In the aftermath, the stock now has multiple layers of solid support underneath.\nGM will likely extend today's high-momentum breakout  in the near term, but further upside past the $37 area will be very difficult. A pullback after this resistance zone, which includes the May and June highs as well as an ugly breakdown gap from June 24, faces an initial test will provide a low-risk buying opportunity. \n\nGM bulls should focus on the area between the stock's 200-day moving average and the July high. This support zone runs from $34.20 to $33.50 with this morning's breakout gap at $33.90. As the current burst stretches further into overbought territory, a retest of this key support zone will present a very low entry level compared with chasing shares above the $36 level.\n\nClick here to see the below chart in a new window.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nDisclosure: This article is commentary by an independent contributor.
