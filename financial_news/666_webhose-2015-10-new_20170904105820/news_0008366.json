David Mariuz by Sally Rose Advocates for self-managed superannuation fund owners have urged the government to resist mounting pressure to tackle generous tax breaks for the wealthy, disputing Treasury estimates that the cost to the annual budget is $32 billion.\nThursday's three-hour summit between Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, his economic ministers, business, industry, unions and community groups gave the government the green light to target superannuation tax concessions as part of a broader reform package it will take to the next federal election .\n\"Until we get a better measurement to understand the real economic costs and benefits of super tax concessions they should not be targeted as a way of meeting the national deficit,\" SMSF Association chief executive Andrea Slattery said.\n\"It is often Quote: d that the cost to the annual budget of super tax concessions is $32 billion, but the way that expenditure statement is calculated is 100 years old and out of date\".\nCost of concessions In its submission to the tax inquiry the SMSF Association made a preliminary estimate that the real cost of the current tax concessions on super was more likely $15 billion a year at worst, while at best the regime could add $5 billion a year to revenue.\nThe SMSF Association has previously said that if the government was to take future action to better target super tax breaks the most efficient approach would be to introduce a generous annual drawdown threshold above which retirees paid a nominal tax rate on earnings.\nThe lobby group has recently contracted an actuarial consulting firm to produce modelling on what the appropriate threshold and nominal tax rate might be.\n 'Poor policy making' SMSF Owners' Alliance executive director Duncan Fairweather also called on the government not to crackdown on super tax breaks for the rich ahead of the next election.\n\"Hanging an argument for a tax change on the dodgy number $32 billion costing, a number that not even the Treasury will stand by, would be poor policy making,\" he said.\nMr Fairweather also said that claims super tax concessions were unfairly skewed toward the wealthy \"don't bear scrutiny\".\nLast year's financial system inquiry, chaired by former Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, found that the top 20 per cent of income earners receive 58 per cent of the value of super tax concessions.\n\"That sounds like a lot until you consider that particular cohort also paid 64 per cent of all income taxes,\" Mr Fairweather said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:55:13.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
