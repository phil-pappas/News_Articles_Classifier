Preferences will be formed for merchants and financial service providers based on which offers the best experience on mobile. Establishing leadership on mobile will be key to securing market share among millennials as they grow older and their needs evolve.\nMercator Advisory Group’s latest research report Mobile Payment App Support: Review, 2015 builds on a similar Mercator effort completed in 2014 and compares customer support options of leading apps in four categories—retail, general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid, mobile wallet, and mobile banking.\n“The problem is that a lot of companies don’t spend enough time building experiences that are unique to mobile and instead just import solutions built for the desktop Web. This means an app will have FAQs that are not searchable (which is crucial on a small screen), and will require leaving the app to perform basic functions like sending a message to the customer service representative,” comments Nikhil Joseph, Emerging Technologies Analyst at the Mercator Advisory Group and author of the report.\nHighlights of the research report include:\nOverview of key trends driving the primacy of mobile\nReview of the mobile apps offered by 16 providers across 4 categories\nAnalysis of key strengths and weaknesses of mobile support features in various categories\nIdentification of how to frame optimal mobile support strategy in different categories\nThe report contains 27 pages and 19 exhibits.\nCompanies mentioned in this report include: Amazon, American Express, Apple, Bank of America, Capital One, Dunkin’ Donuts, Google, H&R Block, Green Dot, LevelUp, Starbucks, Western Union, Moven, PayPal, Simple, and Walmart.\nMembers of Mercator Advisory Group’s Emerging Technologies Advisory Service have access to these reports as well as the upcoming research for the year ahead, presentations, analyst access, and other membership benefits.\nFor more information and media inquiries, please call Mercator Advisory Group's main line: (781) 419-1700, send email to media(at)mercatoradvisorygroup.com.\nFor free industry news, opinions, research, company information and more visit us at http://www.PaymentsJournal.com .\nFollow us on Twitter @ http://twitter.com/MercatorAdvisor .\nAbout Mercator Advisory Group\nMercator Advisory Group is the leading independent research and advisory services firm exclusively focused on the payments and banking industries.
