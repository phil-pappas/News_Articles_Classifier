Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth Chevron's Australian tax problems are a lot bigger than the headline $269 million hit from the Federal Court on Friday, and may rise as high as $600 million.\nThat's before the real problem begins.\nThe Federal Court ruling enforces assessments by the Tax Office of $180 million for the 2003-08 tax years plus a 25 per cent penalty plus interest that takes the bill to $269 million. Other costs will push the total higher.\nIt's all based on $US2.4 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2002 loans, on which Chevron US was paying 2 per cent and charging Chevron Australia 9 per cent.\nThe profit margin ended up untaxed in a tax haven, which paid dividends back to Chevron Australia. From 2003 to 2008 these dividends (which came entirely from the interest rate margin) totalled $1.1 billion.\nSecond tax case This is what the court has just ruled on. But the scheme didn't stop there. It carried right on until the end of 2010. And during those years the offshore company paid dividend of another $1.57 billion.\nIt's likely that this later money is the subject of another tax case going on in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, under the radar, which is at least as big as Friday's judgment, which Chevron should now lose.\n This was all on $US2.4 billion debt. Chevron Australia now holds $36 billion debt. It paid $1.8 billion in interest last year to Chevron US.\nThe US arm's actual cost of funds was an estimated $350 million, producing an instant profit several magnitudes higher than the scheme before the Federal Court.\nChevron confirmed earlier this year that the Tax Office was auditing this larger scheme.\nChevron's Achilles heel in the court case was the plethora of internal emails explaining how the tax dodge worked.\nIf there is a lesson oil majors will have learned from this case, it's the need to keep the paperwork tidy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:09:52.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
