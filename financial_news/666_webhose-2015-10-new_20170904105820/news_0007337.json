Daniel O'Brien by Sally Patten Superannuation governance experts are gearing up for a strenuous workout this week. Submissions to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's review of fund governance are due on Wednesday and the House of Representatives is expected to debate the issue on Thursday.\nThe Senate review is a response to the government's proposal to require retirement schemes to appoint more independent directors, a move that is designed to \"substantially strengthen governance arrangements for the benefit of fund members:, according to former assistant treasurer, now Minister for Energy and Resources Josh Frydenberg.\nLawyers argue that the revised draft legislation is worded much better than the original version, but that won't stop the industry fund sector from calling (loudly) for its abolition.\nThe Coalition is calling for significant changes to superannuation and corporations law.\nProposed amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act include a requirement for super funds to have at least one-third of directors sitting around the board table be independent. However, it does not require funds to have a set proportion of union and employer representatives dotted around the same table, which is a major sticking point for industry funds.\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, which represents both industry and bank-owned retirement schemes, also objects to the lack of a defined role for employer and employee representatives and will call for an amendment.\nSome argue that the failure to allow for an equal number of employer and employee representatives to sit on a board as trustees could have unintended consequences. In theory, a super fund board could comprise one-third independent trustees and two-thirds union representatives or, in the case of retail funds, two-thirds representatives of the bank or wealth company that operates the fund.\nPotential for a messy problem In practice, if this happened and a blocking group of trustees managed to frustrate the fund's inner workings, presumably the independent directors would express any displeasure to the regulator and all would eventually be fixed. But it is not hard to see that this could give rise to a messy corporate governance problem that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority would somehow need to fix.\nOn the other hand, limiting, rather than extending, the reach of legislation is often sound practice. Perhaps super funds could find some way of requiring equal representation from employer and employee groups into their scheme documentation, if not into the constitution.\nAnother major sticking point is a proposed change to the corporations regulations that would require trustees to disclose in their annual report whether they have a majority of independent directors on an \"if not, why not?\" basis.\nAt first brush, this seems confusing. Are super funds supposed to abide by the law to have one-third independent trustees, or should they take the changes to the corporations regulations as a signal they are expected to have a majority of independents?\nASFA wants this amendment scrapped on the grounds it amounts to \"unnecessary red tape\" and \"regulation by stealth\". It goes without saying that the industry fund groups also want it dropped.\nThis reporter has some sympathy with the argument that the government should make up its mind on what it wants, rather than legislating for one outcome while trying to shift behaviour towards another.\nEither the government should require funds to appoint one-third of independents to their boards or a majority of independents.\nIn the past I have argued that requiring a majority of independent trustees on an \"if not, why not?\" basis would be a good compromise on the grounds that it works in the listed company sector. But it is fair to say that super fund members, many of whom are apathetic, would be unlikely to hold boards accountable to such a guideline, unlike listed company shareholders who are vocal and interventionist.\nGiven that is the case, it is probably not worth including the \"if not, why not?\" clause in the corporations regulations. Having a majority of independent directors should be legislated for or not. The alternative might be to write the desired board structure into the APRA standards on the grounds that APRA's role in life is to be vocal and interventionist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:58:54.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
