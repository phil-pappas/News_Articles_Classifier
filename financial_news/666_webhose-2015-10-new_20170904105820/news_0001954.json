The Danish architect, whose firm 3XN was chosen last year to design the master plan and tower for AMP Capital's $1 billion Quay Quarter redevelopment, says any building should leave a site better than it found it.\nWhen it comes to the northern tip of the Sydney CBD in his remit, it's clear he doesn't think that will be a problem.\n\"Loftus and Young [Streets] and this whole area today is a dead area,\" Nielsen says. \"It's only for buses. You only walk in there if you absolutely have to.\"\nThe redevelopment of AMP's 50 Bridge Street tower sums up the challenge facing Sydney as a whole – to make the city work better, with streets people are keen to walk and spend time on. It's not a new revelation – the planned pedestrianisation of the nearby George Street that kicks off this week aims to achieve the same thing.\n3XN's design for the 50 Bridge Street tower. Louise Kennerley But for Copenhagen-based Nielsen, the keynote speaker at Sydney Architecture Festival, much responsibility for that lies with individual buildings. His design for a redeveloped 50 Bridge Street precinct includes a public garden that starts at ground level on Bridge Street and extends above the retail podium.\n\"The whole purpose behind that building is to make it a better building in every sense, a building that is working better both inside and outside, a building that is more profitable for the owners, but is very much also about activating the whole area,\" Nielsen tells The Australian Financial Review .\n3XN beat five other firms for the redevelopment. It will widen the existing office building and double the floor space to 90,000 square metres. Construction is due to start in 2017.\nNielsen says he loves well-designed staircases in buildings because they promote interaction between people in a way that a corridor or lift never can. He sees a similar role for the garden in Quay Quarter.\nThe existing tower at 50 Bridge Street in Sydney. \"Staircases can be means for interaction,\" he says. \"If you put them in the right place and do them in the right way, then people want to sit on them – if they're big – just to sit and talk.\"\nThe tower will be rebuilt as a series of stacked boxes, permitting a sense of community within individual blocks, and shaped to reduce shadowing.\nNielsen is the second Danish architect after Jorn Utzon to design a major structure in Sydney and his creation will overlook his fellow countryman's Sydney Opera House.\nHe doesn't expect any of the troubles or ill-will that plagued Utzon's project. The city has progressed, Nielsen says. \"I think Sydney has developed to become an extremely welcoming city.\"\nBella Sky hotel in Copenhagen, designed by 3XN.
