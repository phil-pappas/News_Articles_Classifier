Burgess Carter \nMembers of the Senate yesterday unanimously voted to cite three ministers responsible for road and transport systems in the country. \nThe ministers of Public Works, Gyude Moore, Finance and Development Planning Amara Konneh, and Transport, Angela Cassell-Bush, are expected to appear before Senate plenary on Thursday, October 8, to answer questions on the very deplorable condition of the roads in counties in the southeast of the country. \nThe Senate's decision was prompted by a letter from the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Women and Children's Affairs, Dr. Peter Coleman, in which he expressed serious concern about the appalling state of all the roads leading to southeast Liberia. \nThe Grand Kru County Senator informed his colleagues that unless something was done immediately, that region would be completely cut off from the rest of the country. \nDr. Coleman warned that besides food and other household necessities, medical facilities in that part of the country would not be able to attend to the healthcare needs of citizens who are now trying to shake off the impact of the recent Ebola virus nightmare. \nOther Senators including those from Rivercess, Maryland, Sinoe, and Grand Kru joined Senator Coleman in raising the alarm about the consequences of the southeast being severed from the rest of the country. \nSinoe County Senator Joseph Nagbe reminded his colleagues that there was still a need for them to go on retreat during which strategies could be formulated to help find solutions to put an end to the yearly recurrence of the terrible condition of roads in many parts of the country. \nHe contended that in the absence of a national plan of action by the government, the country will continue to suffer from deplorable road conditions and the serious effects inflicted on all aspects of national life. \nFor his part, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Lands, Mines, Energy, Natural Resources and Environment, Grand Kru County Senator Albert Chie, described the situation as a national problem. He asserted that the only solution is to find a road master plan, which will have to do with the national budget, adding, \"Once we have that plan we will make progress.\" \nSenator Chie then moved that the plenary invite the three ministers to address the basic issues pertaining to the bad roads in the Southeast, \"and come with a master plan to move forward on road construction and maintenance.\" \nMeanwhile, it was also agreed by plenary that the Minister of Transport will address the issue of license plates, especially the ones designed for the Legislature.
