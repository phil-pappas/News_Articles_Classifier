The final rule revises the data that financial institutions are required to provide in order to improve the quality of information relating to the mortgage lending industry. \nSpecifically, the final rule requires that mortgage lenders report information about all applications and mortgage loans, including reverse mortgages and open-end lines of credit. In a victory for the industry, pre-approval requests for the same loans will not be covered transactions under the HMDA rule. \nIt is not surprising that the CFPB included reverse mortgages under HMDA, given that companies that provide reverse mortgages have been investigated by the CFPB for predatory practices aimed at seniors. \n“data about all reverse mortgages will be essential in the coming years as the country’s population ages and older consumers, many of whom are cash-poor but own their homes outright, may increasingly use home equity for living expenses and other purposes.” \nthe CFPB final rule. \n© | Attorney Advertising \" Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: Sign up to create your digest using LinkedIn JD Supra's Privacy Policy.
