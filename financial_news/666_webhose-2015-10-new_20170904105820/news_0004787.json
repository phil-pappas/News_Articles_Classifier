(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) >\n\"What's in your head, in your head? Zombie, zombie, zombie,\" the Cranberries once crooned.\n A similar question might be asked of Chinese policy makers.\nBeijing has yet to put together a credible response as to what should be done with zombie companies, the huge swath of unprofitable state-owned enterprises surviving on the good will of the Chinese government. Until it does, private companies in the world's second-largest economy will continue to fight an uphill battle for growth, and China's reform efforts will share a key characteristic with the mythical creature in question: not dead, but not really alive.\nWith China's fifth plenum just around the corner, we might get some details on the subject soon. Early signs suggest that the manner in which China's government plans to deal with what many economists judge to be its overarching economic impediment do not offer much reason to assume that policymakers' resolve for reforms has remained steadfast in the face of financial market volatility.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Barry Diller Says He'll Leave the Country If Donald Trump Wins the White House \nAt the crux of China's reform story—or the lack thereof—is what will be done with the nation's state-owned enterprises, or SOEs.\nThese companies helped facilitate the nation's economic reorganization. They enabled progress under the prevailing political order of the late 1970s, following the Cultural Revolution, with the gradual introduction of additional market forces. China's attachment to this inefficient system is arguably fostering deflationary forces via excess capacity, diverting credit from more productive uses, perpetuating the existing power structure in perverse manners, hampering much-needed competition and innovation, and raising the specter of an unnecessarily painful debt-deleveraging process.\nDuring a speech delivered in September, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for consolidation among state-owned enterprises by way of mergers and acquisitions, fortifying existing companies rather than clamping down on them. His statements imply some backsliding by Beijing. Promoting market structures in which there are fewer but larger players (think monopolies and oligopolies) is antithetical to any drive for increased competition, productivity, and consumer-friendliness.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: In North America's Costliest City, Rich Chinese Take the Blame \n\"The premier's comments imply that China is going to strengthen the SOE system, rather than dismantle it through greater privatization to drive domestic competition,\" said Andrew Barber, chief market strategist at Eagleview Capital.\nThis course of action would effectively result in an increased concentration of power among the ruling class, he added, precisely opposing the professed objective of economic liberalization.\n\"SOEs' corporate governance can only be improved if they are subject to competition and run by professionals,\" wrote Société Générale China economist Wei Yao, echoing those sentiments. \"The guidelines' emphasis on strengthening the communist party's control over SOEs seems to run counter to the idea.\"\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Solar and Wind Just Passed Another Big Turning Point \nYao added that the premier paid lip service to dealing with the so-called zombie companies, those that sustain unprofitable production by amassing more and more debt, but hasn't presented anything resembling a plan to resolve this issue.\nState-owned enterprises enjoy a plethora of advantages, the foremost being favorable access to capital and contracts via government largess. And the ease with which these companies can boost production to help the government meet short-term growth targets and adjust the composition of management—the elite—means that one hand often washes the other.\nTo get a sense of how these factors translate into performance, Barber pointed to the difference between the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (a survey of mid-sized and smaller private companies) and the so-called \"official\" PMI released by the National Bureau of Statistics:\nBarber noted that the Caixin PMI tends to lead on the way down and then go farther into contractionary territory than the NBS PMI does during soft patches.\nWhile SOEs help promote short-term economic expansion, their role in continuing to support production growth is akin to the use of ever-increasing amounts of painkillers to cover up the agony caused by an injury's root cause. They serve as a palliative that hampers China's longer-term prospects, Barber noted, singling out the lack of innovative domestic champions competing on the world stage in such areas as consumer technology and automobiles.\n\"One of the standard slams on Chinese corporate culture is that it's a culture of copycats that adopt, adapt and improve existing technologies—and typically just the first two items on that list,\" he said.\nEconomic theory tells us that innovation is a byproduct of competition, something that is incompatible with the prominent role currently played by state-owned enterprises or any moves to consolidate them.\n\"Along with an orientation towards domestic demand, China also has to compete in the higher-end segment of global trade, and the innovation required to do so appears to be absent,\" said Barber. \"The lack of a competitive stance for critical industries is what threatens to drag on growth in China going forward.\"\n\"To our mind, the SOE reform holds the key to allocative efficiency of capital, productivity gains and debt deleveraging,\" added Societe Generale's Yao.\nA big additional reason why Chinese authorities resist such change is that a brisk move toward privatization would probably be accompanied by a negative effect on employment as excess capacity were shuttered. The prospect of mass revolt in such an event undoubtedly makes Chinese policymakers wary of introducing ambitious reforms.\nEagleview's Barber, however, sees the risk that social unrest would surge as fat is trimmed from SOEs as relatively benign. This is, in part, because the Chinese government has managed to prevent widespread discord by fostering continued generation-on-generation increases in the standard of living. Somewhat perversely, China's horribly negative demographic shift helps in this regard: The aging of the population alleviates competition for jobs.\nWhile most experts believe China has the ability to reorient its economy, albeit at the cost of a marked deceleration in growth, the nation's willingness to do so is another matter.\n\"I have deep skepticism about the current Chinese model,\" said Barber. \"But I hold on to the hope that they'll wake up. I'd like to see China not become a frustrated power and succumb to nationalism.\"\n\"We think China cannot wait much longer,\" wrote Yao. \"Even if a hard landing may be avoided in the short term thanks to pervasive implicit state guarantees enjoyed by debt-laden SOEs, China's productivity growth is suffering and the probability of a lost decade scenario is rising.\"\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nAir France Workers Rip Shirts From Top Managers in Jobs Protest Hillary Clinton Trolls GOP Field, Sending Them Copies of Her Book  Hard Choices Templeton Betting on `Multi-Decade' Emerging-Market Opportunity Read China Has No Good Plan to Deal With Its Achilles Heel on bloomberg.com\nPersonal Investing Ideas & Strategies China", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:15:54.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
