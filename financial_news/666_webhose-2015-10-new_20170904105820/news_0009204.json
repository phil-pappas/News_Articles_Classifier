Put differently, we're struggling to find a smoking gun that explains the market's behavior.\" \nFor example, jobs report on Friday was bad: The economy added 142,000 jobs in September, below expectations for 201,000. Average hourly earnings were flat, while the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.1%. The labor participation rate fell to a 38-year low of 62.4%. \nAs the chart shows, stocks tanked immediately, with Dow futures falling nearly 2% before the market opened on Thursday. However, after one of the ugliest jobs reports of the year, stocks roared back and staged the biggest intraday reversal in four years. \n(RBC Capital Markets) Of course, there's obvious demerit in trying to peg a narrative to the stock market's tick-by-tick moves. \nGolub notes that investor anxiety, not fundamentals, is what's driving the sell off in markets. And as a result, more apparent explanations, like bad data or earnings, are becoming less useful to try and interpret markets. \nLike Business Insider's Myles Udland noted last week, old ways of explaining markets are no longer making sense . \nAnd so as Golub sees it, this lack of coherence means that eventually things will sort themselves out and resolve in stocks moving higher. \nLast week, Golub cut his year-end price target on the S&P 500 to 2,100 from 2,325.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:30:32.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
