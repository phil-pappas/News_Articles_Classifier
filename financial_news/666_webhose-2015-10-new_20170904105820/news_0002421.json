HPQ 2.84 % and ran an underdog candidacy for U.S. Senate in California, Carly Fiorina spent a long stretch in the 1990s as a Jersey girl.\nMs. Fiorina, a Republican presidential candidate who has never held elected office, lived with her husband in Morris County from 1990 to 1999 while she worked her way up the ladder at telecommunications firms concentrated in northern New Jersey.\nDuring her time at AT&T Inc. T 0.34 % ’s Morristown office and Lucent Technologies Inc.’s headquarters in Murray Hill, Ms. Fiorina and her husband, Frank, put down New Jersey roots. The couple often took friends on harbor cruises with a boat they docked at a marina in the Weehawken area.\n“It was hero sandwiches and beer and cruising the beautiful Hudson,” said Kathy Fitzgerald, a Public Service Enterprise Group PEG 2.44 % executive in New Jersey and a former Lucent senior vice president who worked with Ms. Fiorina for years and is still close to her.\nFor the floral arrangements Ms. Fiorina bought for her home, co-workers and her father’s birthdays, she was a loyal patron at Flowers from Hannah in Morristown. Unlike many other executives, Ms. Fiorina picked up the bouquets herself and liked to chat, said Hannah Wallace, the store’s owner.\nMs. Wallace described Ms. Fiorina as warm and personable. Watching Ms. Fiorina’s sharp jabs in last month’s Republican debate , she said, came as shock.\n“You watch her on TV and you say, ‘Oh my God. Go get them, Carly.’ We never knew that side of her,” said Ms. Wallace, a store owner for 32 years.\nMs. Fiorina declined to comment for this article through a spokeswoman. She has trailed the other Republican candidates in fundraising and polls, but she has seen her poll numbers rise nationally after her performance in the last debate. No public polls specific to the presidential contest in New Jersey have been published in recent months.\nMs. Fiorina was the second most frequently searched Republican or Democratic presidential candidate among Google users in the state, according to an analysis of searches from Sept. 17 to 23. Donald Trump ranked first, while New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was sixth.\nPolitical analysts said Ms. Fiorina and Mr. Christie are competing for different slices of the GOP electorate. Fundraising reports for the first part of this year show they share few donors in common.\nOf the $975,777 in contributions above $200 that Ms. Fiorina raised through the end of June, the largest share came from California, an analysis of her donations by state show. New York donors ranked second in the total, with New Jersey ranking 13th at $13,000 in contributions.\nMs. Fiorina’s supporters said more money is slated to move to her now that she has risen in the polls. A Westchester fundraiser co-hosted by former U.S. Rep. Nan Hayworth, a New York Republican, is slated for Oct. 20.\nMs. Fiorina has been criticized during the campaign over her tenure at H-P . She oversaw the company during mass layoffs and she was ousted in 2005 .\nHer time at AT&T and Lucent predated the bursting of the technology bubble and was relatively more sanguine. Ms. Fiorina worked her way up in sales at AT&T, where she would sing karaoke while spending time with clients in Japan to make them feel at ease, Ms. Fitzgerald said.\nBy the age of 42, Ms. Fiorina was overseeing the initial public offering of Lucent when it split from AT&T. Lucent chartered a hot-air balloon to symbolize that the company “had become completely untethered,” Ms. Fiorina wrote in her memoir, “Tough Choices.”\n“And I watched our new flag whip in a crisp New Jersey breeze, the tears came again. I love Lucent,” she wrote.\nWork was the main focus of Ms. Fiorina’s life in New Jersey, friends said, and big employee milestones were often celebrated at her home in Morristown. Christmas parties held at the house featured individually decorated trees in each room and Mr. Fiorina’s Yorkie dogs yapping at guests’ heels.\nMs. Fiorina took time for one hobby—gardening. She would sometimes wake before dawn to fill birdbaths and tend flowers. She also had a way in the kitchen, making a fragrant cranberry sauce that Ms. Wallace said she still remembers from when she helped decorate the couple’s home during Thanksgiving.\nThe couple left Morristown in 1999 when Ms. Fiorina was recruited to H-P, selling their home for $830,000, property records show. Ms. Fitzgerald has since brought Ms. Fiorina to her shore home.\nMs. Fitzgerald said she and other New Jersey supporters have watched Ms. Fiorina’s political rise with awe.\n“She looks like a tiger on TV, but she’s not,” Ms. Wallace said. “She would talk to you about whatever your interests are. She’s very approachable.”\nWrite to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KH439_carlyf_AM_20150914192719.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:09:47.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
