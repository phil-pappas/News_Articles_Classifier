A liaison between his daughter-in-law and Averell helped Winston considerably. by Lynne Olson During the weekend of the massive May 10 attack on London by German bombers, Winston and Clementine Churchill were staying at Ditchley, the opulent country estate near Oxford that belonged to wealthy parliamentarian Ronald Tree and his wife, Nancy.\nThe Trees had proposed that, whenever there was a full moon, the prime minister should come to Ditchley, rather than the official country residence, Chequers, a prime target in the event of an enemy raid.\nMembers of Churchill's entourage spent the weekend enjoying the Trees' lavish hospitality. Among them was Averell Harriman, the American businessman who had come to London as administrator of the United States Lend Lease program of aid to Britain.\nHarriman was approached by Clementine Churchill with an unsettling favour to ask.\nYoung and in love: the glamorous Pamela Digby Churchill in a British fashion and social magazine after the announcement of her engagement to Winston Churchill's son, Randolph. For Pamela, it was an escape from Dorset. The Churchills' 18-year-old daughter, Mary, had recently shocked her parents with the news of her engagement to the 28-year-old son and heir of the Earl of Bessborough, whom she had met just a short time before. Clementine was convinced that Mary was not in love with him, that she was too young to know what she was doing and had \"simply been swept off her feet with excitement\".\nWhen Clementine asked Winston to talk to their daughter, he had agreed, but, preoccupied as he was with running the war, he never found the time. In desperation, Clementine turned to Harriman. He had two daughters, she said. He knew what young women were like. Would he please try to reason with Mary?\nIt was, on several levels, an extraordinary request. Above all, it revealed how, in a few short weeks, Harriman had become not only a key figure in the prime minister's government circle but a de facto member of the Churchill family as well.\nTo Clementine's dismay, Churchill had resisted her view that weekends in the country should be quiet respites from the wartime madness of London. His weekend retreats overflowed with generals, admirals, air marshals, cabinet ministers, foreign government leaders, and a sprinkling of Churchill family members. Sometimes there would be as many as three shifts of guests: some summoned just for luncheon, others for dinner, still others spending the entire weekend.\nPamela Churchill and her son Winston - grandson of \"the\" Winston - in London during the war. According to his bodyguard, life with the prime minister \"had less schedule than a forest fire and less peace than a hurricane\".\nWhen not involved in top secret conferences, guests played tennis or croquet, or as Sir Charles Portal, chief of the air staff, did, relaxed by chopping weeds in Ditchley's gardens. At the centre of the action was the cigar-puffing prime minister, who, when he was not dominating the meetings, was holding court during lunch and dinner.\nHarriman, while part of the official retinue, was pulled into the life of the Churchills and their children in ways that other visitors were not.\nLover rather than adviser Interior view of Ditchley House, near Charlbury, Oxfordshire, England, 1948. The house was used at times as a residence and headquarters by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for several years during World War II. Frank Scherschel Still, the idea of counselling Mary Churchill about her love life must have seemed, at least initially, a somewhat daunting challenge to Harriman. His own two daughters had been raised by their mother, who divorced him when they were young. Most of his recent experiences with young women had been as a lover, not as an avuncular adviser.\nNonetheless, he gamely agreed to do as Clementine asked. Taking Mary aside for a heart-to-heart chat, he listened quietly as she poured out her side of the story and then talked to her about the uncertainties of war and the perils of making a hasty decision about such a vital, life-changing event as marriage.\nMary herself had begun to have misgivings about her engagement, and, after her talk with Harriman, she decided to postpone it; soon afterward, she ended the relationship entirely.\n\"I want to thank you very sincerely for your sympathy and helpfulness,\" she wrote Harriman a few days later. \"I thought it was most sweet of you – when you are so busy and have so many important claims on your time – to listen so patiently to a recital of my stupidities and heart-aches!\"\nAverell Harriman sits with then fiancee Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward shortly before their marriage in 1971, many decades after their original affair. Pamela, born to the British upper class, eventually married American wealth and then earned her own place as political doyenne and a US ambassador. AP For Harriman, the fact that Clementine Churchill had singled him out to play father confessor to Mary, was a source of tremendous gratification. He was now in the centre of the action, just as he had always longed to be.\nIn his courtship of Churchill and his family, Harriman employed the same energy and determination he previously had devoted to polo and his other enthusiasms. When he first arrived in London, he presented Clementine with a small bag of tangerines he had picked up in Lisbon. Her expression of delight made him realise how severely the sharp reduction in British food imports had affected even the prime minister's household. From then on, Harriman, a man usually known for his parsimony, played Santa Claus to the Churchills, plying them with goods that had long since disappeared from British stores – smoked Virginia hams, fresh fruit, handkerchiefs, silk stockings, Havana cigars.\nBesides playing to Churchill's penchant for rich friends and luxury, Harriman made himself available whenever the prime minister wanted to chat, no matter the hour or place. Often it would be close to midnight when he received a call from 10 Downing Street or from Churchill's study at Chequers, requesting his presence for a few hands of bezique, a complicated card game that was one of Churchill's favourite ways of relaxing.\nThe prime minister would also use Harriman as a sounding board for his thoughts on the latest developments in the war and Anglo-American relations. It was a useful exercise for both men, with Harriman gaining an insight into Churchill's mind and Churchill getting Harriman's views on the actions and reactions of the American president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and his government.\nDangerous liaison Intriguingly, however, Harriman, as single-minded and ambitious as he was, chose to put his privileged position with Churchill and his family in jeopardy almost as soon as he had achieved it, by beginning an affair with Pamela Churchill, the prime minister's 21-year-old daughter-in-law.\nThe two had met over lunch at Chequers in late March 1941, less than two weeks after the Lend-Lease representative had arrived in Britain. Like Harriman, the auburn-haired, blue-eyed Pamela had a fondness for cultivating important men and a fascination for political power.\nBy all accounts, she was immediately captivated by this businessman almost 30 years her senior, who was, she was informed by a friend, \"the most important American in London\".\nAt lunch, he had pumped her for information about Churchill and the press baron Lord Beaverbrook, an old friend and adviser of Churchill's and one of the most powerful and controversial men in Britain.\nHarriman, she later said, \"was a hick from America. He knew nothing\" about the current British political scene. But she also recalled how \"absolutely marvellous looking\" he seemed to her –\"very athletic, very tan, very healthy\".\nFocusing on Harriman with laser-beam intensity, she launched into what friends called her \"mating dance\", asking him questions, listening raptly to his comments, and laughing when he attempted a witticism.\nShe had charmed her father-in-law with the same warmly flirtatious manner and, in doing so, had become one of his favourite companions. With her husband, Randolph, with his regiment in the Middle East, in Egypt, and her six-month-old son, Winston, tended by a nanny in the country, Pamela spent much of her free time at Downing Street and Chequers, playing cards with Churchill, listening to his stories, and comforting him whenever he was worried or depressed.\nIndeed, virtually from the beginning of her marriage, Pamela had a far better relationship with Winston and Clementine than with her 27-year-old husband.\nHunger for new horizons The daughter of Lord Digby, an impoverished Dorset aristocrat, she had met Randolph Churchill a few days after the war began. Afraid that \"I would get trapped in Dorset for the rest of my life,\" she was desperate, she later said, for \"new horizons and challenges … I wanted to experience whatever there was to experience.\"\nRandolph proposed to her the night after they met, and the marriage took place two weeks later. For both, the union was \"as cold and calculated as a business deal\", Sally Bedell Smith, one of Pamela's biographers, wrote. \"He wanted an heir and she wanted a name and position.\" They each got what they were after, but, not surprisingly, the relationship was an emotional disaster from the start.\nSpoiled and indulged by his father, Randolph was a lively speaker and gifted writer who could be charming and witty when in the mood. More often, however, he was a blustering bully whose drinking, gambling, and womanising were a constant source of embarrassment for his parents.\nRandolph, said Mary Churchill, \"could be quite alarming – very noisy and quarrelsome. If he was in the right mood, he'd pick a quarrel with a chair.\"\nBut with her husband gone to fight, Pamela was finally free to enjoy the erotic frenzy of wartime London. The saying \"Live today, for tomorrow we die\" might be a war-movie cliche, but it resonated all the same throughout the British capital in 1941 – in hotels and nightclubs, pubs and palaces, situation rooms and bedrooms.\n\"There was a diffused gallantry in the air, an unmarriedness,\" observed one British writer. \"It came to be rumoured about the country that everybody in London was in love.\"\nSuch romantic fatalism and hedonism was intoxicating; conventional morality was laid to rest for the duration.\n\"The normal barriers to having an affair with somebody were thrown to the winds,\" recalled CBS head William Paley, who was in London for several months during the war. \"If it looked pretty good, you felt good, well, what in hell was the difference?\"\nLiberating impulse Adding to this uninhibited atmosphere was the heady new sense of freedom and independence experienced by young British women. Hundreds of thousands of women, even debutantes like Pamela who had never so much as boiled an egg, now signed up for jobs in defence industries or enlisted in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and other military units.\nWomen began wearing slacks. They appeared in public without stockings. They smoked, they drank, and they had sex outside marriage – more often and with fewer qualms and less guilt than their mothers and grandmothers.\n\"London was a Garden of Eden for women in those years,\" recalled Time-Life correspondent Mary Welsh, \"a serpent dangling from every tree and street lamp, offering tempting gifts, companionship, warm if temporary affections.\"\nPamela Churchill was in the vanguard of this early women's liberation movement, securing a job at the Ministry of Supply and a room at the Dorchester Hotel. Years later, she remembered walking down a Dorchester corridor, thinking, \"Here I am, 20 years old, totally free [and] wondering who will walk into my life.\"\nWhen she met Averell Harriman, she immediately set her sights for him. It was a spectacularly easy conquest. Harriman had been a hedonist long before coming to London, and he didn't need the city's carpe diem mentality to convince him he ought to be enjoying himself.\nHis affair with Pamela probably began in the midst of the devastating April 16 Luftwaffe raid on London, little more than two weeks after they met. They both had been guests at a dinner party at the Dorchester in honour of Adele Astaire Cavendish, the sister of Fred Astaire and wife of Lord Charles Cavendish, son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire.\nHarriman and his fellow dinner guests watched the fireworks of the bombing from an eighth-floor room at the Dorchester, then retreated to the comparative safety of Harriman's suite on the ground floor.\nWhen the others left, Pamela apparently remained behind.\nEarly the next morning, John Colville, private secretary to Churchill, saw Harriman and his boss's daughter-in-law walking arm in arm through the Horse Guards Parade, examining the devastation from the night before.\nLater that day, Harriman wrote his wife: \"Last night was a real 'Blitz'—perhaps the most widespread bombing of the war … Bombs dropped all around. Needless to say, my sleep was intermittent.\"\nHe included chatty details about the dinner party and listed the names of those who had been there, with one prominent exception – Pamela Churchill.\nPublic eye Initially, at least, the pair tried to keep their relationship as quiet as possible. Nonetheless, people began to notice – and talk. There was gossip that Harriman had been spotted tiptoeing down a hall at Chequers late at night.\nAmong those who deduced the truth was Lord Beaverbrook, who encouraged the liaison from the start. The owner of three major daily newspapers, Max Beaverbrook had been an outspoken appeaser of Hitler until May 1940. Once Britain was directly threatened by Germany, however, he threw himself into the war effort with the same energy with which he had opposed it before.\nClementine Churchill detested Beaverbrook, calling him a \"microbe\" and a \"bottle imp\" and begging her husband not to see so much of him.\nBeaverbrook – who, as Churchill's minister of supply, was in charge of most of Britain's war production – was particularly well known for his munificence to a wide circle of women friends, including Pamela, to whom he became a patron of sorts.\nHe gave her advice, lent her money to pay off Randolph's gambling debts, and housed her baby son and his nanny at Cherkley, his country estate in Surrey. Knowing only too well how much Britain needed American aid and how important Harriman was in getting it, he championed her affair with the American. Like Churchill, the newspaper mogul was determined to drag the United States into the war.\nHe was desperate to find out more about what the Americans were thinking and planning – something he could do, he thought, with Pamela's help.\nSoon the lovers were frequent guests at Cherkley, and Churchill's daughter-in-law became a back channel to Beaverbrook for news of the goings-on at the United States embassy in Grosvenor Square.\n\"She passed everything she knew about anybody to Beaverbrook,\" said the American journalist Tex McCrary. The affair was professionally beneficial to Harriman as well. \"It was very helpful to him … to have an in like that,\" Pamela later said. \"It made an enormous difference.\"\nIn the attempt to keep their relationship under wraps, Harriman and Pamela were aided by the arrival in June of Harriman's 23-year-old daughter, Kathleen, who had come to keep her father company for a few months.\nUnaware of the affair at first, she formed a close friendship with Pamela, and when the Harrimans moved into a larger suite at the Dorchester, Pamela moved in with them. Later that summer, the two young women, with Harriman's money, rented a cottage together in Surrey for use on the weekends. Harriman often joined them there.\nIt didn't take Kathleen long to figure out what was going on between her father and new best friend. Having been raised in a worldly, sophisticated milieu where such extramarital trysts were common, she kept the secret to herself. She was not close to her stepmother and seemed to regard Harriman more as a generous friend than a father.\nNonetheless, despite everyone's best efforts, the relationship eventually became common knowledge in both London and Washington.\nHarry Hopkins. President Roosevelt's closest adviser, passed on the news to the president, who, according to Hopkins, \"got a big kick out of it\". (The president had never forgotten a dinner in London in 1918 when he felt Churchill, then a 43-year-old cabinet minister while Roosevelt was simply a cocky young American official, had snubbed him and been discourteous.)\nHopkins himself was disturbed, \"fearing stories to the effect that the president's envoy was breaking up the prime minister's son's marriage,\" Pamela later told one historian.\nPlaying with fire Both Pamela and Harriman knew they were playing with fire. The affair, she noted, \"could have gone the other way\", igniting a public scandal that would have caused great damage to all concerned.\nIt still remains unclear whether either Winston or Clementine Churchill knew what was occurring under their roof at Chequers in the weeks and months after the relationship began.\nAccording to their middle daughter, Sarah, the Churchills and their children placed a high premium on personal privacy. \"We believe passionately in the privacy of our lives and other people's,\" she said.\nChurchill doted on Randolph despite his boorishness, and the news of his son's cuckoldry would certainly have come as a rude shock.\nYet, whatever his feelings, he needed Harriman and the Americans, and he had no intention of letting personal matters interfere with the national interest.\nPamela, for her part, believed that the Churchills were well aware of what was going on. She noted, however, that neither directly confronted her.\nAt one point in the war, Churchill casually commented to her: \"You know, they're saying a lot of things about Averell in relation to you.\" She replied: \"Well, a lot of people have nothing else to do in wartime but indulge in gossip.\"\n\"I quite agree,\" Churchill said – and never raised the subject again.\nThis is an edited extract from Citizens of London by Lynne Olson, published by Scribe, $27.99.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:05:31.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
