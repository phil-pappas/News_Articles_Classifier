It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) stands for something,\" he said. \n\"Twitter empowers the conversation that the world needs to see.\" \nDorsey also told the 1,500 developers that Twitter would make available analytical tools that can help them get better data on how people use applications. \nDorsey, a co-founder of Twitter, this month began his second stint as CEO as the San Francisco-based company seeks to revive growth and move toward profitability. \nOne of the first things Dorsey announced was the new Moments feature, which enables members to get a glimpse at breaking news. \n- \"Twitter Polls\" - \nOn Wednesday, Twitter announced another feature called \"Twitter Polls\" that enables users to \"weigh in on all the topics they care about.\" \n\"If you want the public's opinion on anything -- what to name your dog, who will win tonight's game, which election issue people care most about -- there's no better place to get answers than on Twitter,\" said a blog post from Twitter's Todd Sherman. \n\"For poll creators, it's a new way to engage with Twitter's massive audience and understand exactly what people think. For those participating, it's a very easy way to make your voice heard.\" \nDorsey was Twitter's acting CEO following Dick Costolo's resignation in June. This was his first major public appearance. \nOn October 13 Twitter said it was slashing eight percent of its workforce, or some 340 jobs, as Dorsey outlined his new \"roadmap\" to boost users and revenues at the money-losing messaging platform. \nThe San Francisco-based platform, which has not yet turned a profit, has struggled to expand its user base above 300 million, lagging rival networks such as Instagram and well behind the much larger Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) . \nHowever, Twitter says that one billion people have seen content published on its network through other sites or applications. \nTwitter promised new tools that will allow better integration with third-party apps, and better integration into websites. \nTwitter also announced a partnership with JCDecaux (Paris: FR 77919 - news ) display advertising, which will incorporate Twitter content into its signs. \n- Reaching out to businesses - \nTwitter is also hoping to convince businesses of the advantages of its platform, which include new tools that allows them to get a close understanding of users, including such information as demographics and personal interests. \nA merchant, for example, can identify a customer via Twitter and engage in a live conversation on the platform -- for example to correct a placed order. \nFacebook already has something similar with its Messenger app. \nThese new announcements did not halt the slide in Twitter stock, which dropped five percent on Wall Street Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:26:44.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
