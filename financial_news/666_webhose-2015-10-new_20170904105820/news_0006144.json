Emefiele's has won backing from President Muhammadu Buhari for his stance.\nSanusi, who is now the emir of Kano in Nigeria's Muslim north, also criticised foreign currency restrictions imposed by the central bank, which have frustrated local firms struggling to get dollars.\nHe also said interest rates were too high. The central bank let the main benchmark rate unchanged at 13 percent at its last monetary policy meeting in September while cutting the banks' cash reserve ratio to 25 percent from 31 percent.\n\"It's time to loosen monetary policy. We need to lower interest rates otherwise we compound an exchange rate crisis for businesses with high borrowing costs and declining demand,\" Sanusi said.
