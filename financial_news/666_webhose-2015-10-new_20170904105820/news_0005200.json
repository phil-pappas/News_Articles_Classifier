The 71-year-old investment veteran says he is owed “hundreds of millions” for wrongful termination, breach of written contract and breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, according to a court filing. “Their improper, dishonest, and unethical behavior must now be exposed” Bill Gross, from his lawsuit “Driven by a lust for power, greed, and a desire to improve their own financial position and reputation at the expense of investors and decency, a cabal of Pimco managing directors plotted to drive founder Bill Gross out of Pimco in order to take, without compensation, Gross’s percentage ownership in the profitability of Pimco,” according to the complaint. “Their improper, dishonest, and unethical behavior must now be exposed.” By allegedly forcing him out, Mr Gross claimed younger executives at Pimco could share larger profits and transform the company into an asset manager that invested in higher-risk equities and property. Pimco grew into one of the largest asset managers in the world Mr Gross stepped down as chief investment officer of Pimco on September 26 last year , causing a flood of redemptions - assets under management have dropped from around $2 trillion at their peak to $1.5 trillion. He had also fallen out with Mohammed El-Erian, another legendary bond investor who used to form a double act with Mr Gross. His lawsuit stated: \"Cracks soon began to appear in this alliance, however, as El-Erian sought to force Pimco out of its core focus on bonds and related fixed income securities and instead become a general-purpose investment management firm offering stocks, commodities, real estate, and hedge fund-like products to investors. Bill Gross's lawsuit \"Mr Gross was concerned that Pimco's expansion into new investment fields posed a particular liability to the company and its investors should another significant event, such as the collapse of Lehman Brothers, occur.\" Mohamed El-Erian Mr El-Erian said his own departure, months before Mr Gross left, came after he realised he didn’t spend enough time with his daughter, after the 10-year-old gave him a note citing 22 milestones in her life he had missed . He is now chief economic adviser at German insurer Allianz, Pimco’s parent company. Mr Gross later said there \"was no reasonable way” he could have stayed at Pimco . \"This lawsuit has no merit and our legal team will be responding in court in due course\" Pimco “Had there been a reasonable way to continue there, I would have stayed to my last breath. I was honoured by the trust of the millions of clients and thousands of employees over decades. They have been the centre of my life’s work. I am very proud of my record there for more than 40 years,” he said shortly after he left. “Pimco is a great firm with lots of great people, and Allianz was a fine owner for many years. But slowly and with great hesitation, I came to understand that it was time for me to leave. It happens sometimes to founders.” Mr Gross joined smaller rival Janus Capital Group, whose Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund oversees around $1.4bn in assets. A Pimco spokesman said: “This lawsuit has no merit and our legal team will be responding in court in due course. Our focus remains on our clients and their investment portfolios.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:52:15.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
