Photo: Sean Davey\nSo much are business conditions improving that the head of the treasury says he no longer gets \"beaten up\" when he asks how things are going.\nTreasury secretary John Fraser told a Senate hearing that he tried to meet with business leaders at least once a week.\n\"My own feeling, to be honest, is that things have been picking up somewhat. It's been happening for the last couple of months or so,\" he said.\n\"I can't put a figure on it, it's just you don't get beaten up like I did when I first came into this job.\"\nAdvertisement \"It's in the last two or three months or so. It's not just big business, it's tradies, all sorts of businesses.\n\"You can go to places around the world, New York and elsewhere and you get a feeling about conditions, not a massive impression but certainly a feeling.\"\n\"Some parts of Australia are doing better than others. Tasmania clearly is getting a terrific boost from tourism. Anybody trying to book hotel rooms in Hobart and elsewhere has seen it. Other parts of Australia are somewhat subdued.\"\nConditions seemed strongest in NSW and Tasmania and the most subdued in South Australia. Western Australia and Queensland were \"yet to bear the effects of the exit from the mining investment boom\"\nSurveys of business investment plans remained soft. Businesses wanted to see a sustained uptick in demand before they spent on new capacity and equipment.\nThe slowdown in China was having a greater impact than previously thought. It was difficult to see when the softness in commodity prices would be reversed and to what extent. The value of Chinese imports fell 20 per cent in the year to September, one of the steepest falls since the financial crisis.\nThe United States was likely to begin lifting interest rates within months, possibly before Christmas. When that happened foreign investors would shift their funds back to the US. The Australian dollar and global interest rates were likely to rise as a result.\nSince 2007 global debt had grown by $25 trillion.\n\"These high levels of global debt are ain important reminder of why it is an immediate priority for Australia to repair the fiscal position,\" Mr Fraser said. \"We need to address Australia's structural budget problem through greater expenditure restraint.\"\nThe lower dollar had underpinned a 7.3 per cent boost in services exports over the past year. China had become Australia's second-largest source of tourists after New Zealand. Financial services had experienced their fourth consecutive year of double-digit export growth.\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:12:56.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
