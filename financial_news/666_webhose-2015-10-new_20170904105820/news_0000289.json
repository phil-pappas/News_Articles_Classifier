The gas tax brings about $34 billion per year, but the federal government typically spends about $50 billion annually on transportation projects. \nTransportation advocates have pushed for a gas tax increase to help make up the difference, but Republicans have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump . \nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) has warned that it will have to begin cutting back on payments to states and local governments for infrastructure projects in November if Congress does not reach an agreement on a highway bill extension this month.
