Now, a lot more of those averages Joes have a preference for hoppy IPAs and richly flavored stouts and are more than happy to find a filling craft beer. So, advertising for light beer brands needs to change , which means ad agencies and chief marketing officers are getting fired, reports The Wall Street Journal. Next year, ads for Bud Light will start focusing on its quality and ability to bring people together. Meanwhile, MillerCoors is going to focus more on marketing to women. It won’t be easy to sway a new generation of beer snobs and whiskey lovers. Market share for the top light beers has slid from 35% in 2007 to 31.8% today.\nBRAVING EXCHANGES : With ominous headlines emerging years ago about how bad ad fraud is on the Web, particularly on open programmatic exchanges, surely the industry has licked the fraud problem by now. If not, advertisers must be staying far away, right? Well, according to Allstate and its programmatic buying partner Dstillery, wrong on both counts. Fraud is still alive and well in the exchange world , yet advertisers are still buying more ads in this environment, reports CMO Today. The reason why is simple: both Allstate and its partners say it’s much cheaper to buy ads this way than going directly to individual publishers. According to Dstillery, there’s still a lot of quality ad space in the exchanges, if you know where to look. Other advertisers are turning to theoretically safer havens like “private” programmatic exchanges, but brands that are heavily focused on price are still likely to be shopping on open ad exchanges for a while.\nHOT TICKET : Refinery29 is taking its well-earned cool clout among fashionable young women to one of the more exclusive clubs in media: Snapchat Discover . That’s the page of Snapchat that all the big media companies have been clamoring to get a position on every since it was unveiled early this year. Refinery29’s edition brings the total number of Discover partners to 15, reports CMO Today. What’s still uncertain about Discover is whether Snapchat users want this very programmed, almost TV-like interface where you can literally jump from content channel to channel. Snapchat says it has 100 million daily users but doesn’t say how many people use Discover versus making videos for their friends or following celebrities. Regardless, media companies believe Snapchat has some access to millennial programming magic, and they want in.\nSPONSOR BEWARE : Several European soccer teams have found themselves tied to some questionable sponsors , bringing some unwanted publicity, which could cause U.S. sports leagues to ask more questions when they enter massive ad deals. For example, the Spanish La Liga team RCD Espanyol has a $45 million sponsorship with Power8—a company police in Taiwan are accusing of swindling investors, reports WSJ. Meanwhile, last March, the Chelsea Football Club had to cut ties with CWM FX, after that firm got hung up in its own alleged fraudulent investment scheme. Usually, sports leagues stick with giant brands from the beer, soda and car worlds. But it’s interesting to look at what’s happening in Europe just as fantasy sports brands, which seemed to come out of nowhere, are suddenly throwing around ad money like dot-com firms from the 1990s.\nElsewhere Twitter is planning companywide layoffs this week [ Re/code ]\nElectronic Arts is expecting a massive hit with next month’s release of the video game “Star Wars Battlefront” [New York Times]\nApple reportedly deactivates News app in China [ New York Times ]\nDish Network spent the weekend in a battle with local broadcaster Tenga Inc. before the two sides came to an agreement Sunday [ WSJ ] [ Deadline ]\nWarner Bros. investment in videogames pays off as movies fall flat [ WSJ ]\nThe NBC sitcom “Undateable” plans to shoot its entire season live [ WSJ ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/technology/apple-is-said-to-deactivate-its-news-app-in-china.html", "https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "http://deadline.com/2015/10/tegna-blacks-out-dish-network-customers-in-38-markets-1201572725/", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "http://recode.net/2015/10/09/twitter-is-planning-company-wide-layoffs-for-next-week/", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "https://twitter.com/perlberg", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:38:40.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
