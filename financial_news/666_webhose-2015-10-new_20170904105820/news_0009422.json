Tara, Chief Director of the Ministry of Finance, dated 29 th September, this year. \n'We wish to state that this ministry shares the sentiments of the water producers association and understands that even though sachet water is a packaged product, charging VAT on it would make it a bit expensive and beyond the reach of the ordinary Ghanaian. \n'However, it has to be noted that it would require an amendment by Parliament to the existing law in order to consider and waive the VAT charge on sachet water which is a packaged product and under a strict interpretation of Act 870 of the VAT Act, 2013 is not VAT exempt,' the Ministry stressed. \nAn executive of the association, who spoke to BUSINESS GUIDE yesterday in an interview, said the development would take a heavy toll on the operations of the association's members and translate into high prices for the products. \n'Already, we are reeling under the harsh effects of the power outage and if the GRA should continue insisting on collecting VAT from us, that would force us to close down and send home most of our staff away. Also, the ordinary Ghanaian would have to pay high price.' \nAccording to the association, a lot of parliamentarians recently said they were unaware of that arrangement and had been deceived. \nThey therefore called on all Ghanaians to help them fight government for a waiver of that tax since it would impose untold hardship on the ordinary Ghanaian. \nA bag of sachet water containing 30 pieces would attract a VAT of GHÂ¢0.48, which translates into 2 pesewas on a sachet. \nBy Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:08:00.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
