Risks probably remain to the downside.\"\nCiti's economics team, led by chief economist Willem Buiter, said it expected further easing from the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the People's Bank of China and the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nAnd it said it expected \"very gradual and delayed tightening\" by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England.\nBuiter has said previously that global growth below 3 percent with a significant output gap represented an effective world recession.\nThe Citi note added the upcoming International Monetary Fund review will probably see China's yuan join the IMF's Special Drawing Rights currency basket from late-2016.\n(by Mike Dolan)\nBudget, Tax & Economy global growth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:35:05.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
