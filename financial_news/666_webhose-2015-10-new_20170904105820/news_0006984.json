The company offered £30 for goodwill but this did not arrive either despite repeated promises. \nBritish Gas now says: “Unfortunately Mr A’s refund was delayed by a processing error with his cheque. \n“We have apologised to Mr A and he has now received his refund. As a gesture of goodwill we have sent an additional cheque for £100 for the inconvenience caused.” \nThis ex gratia payment came three weeks later. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:58:30.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
