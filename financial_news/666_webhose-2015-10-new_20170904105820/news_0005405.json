Fairfax by Javier Blas and Agnieszka de Sousa Goldman Sachs Group hired traders from Glencore and hedge fund Moore Capital Management as the bank seeks to rebuild its bulk commodities team following a string of departures, according to people familiar with the situation.\nThe investment bank has recruited Espen Aaboe from Moore Capital and Brian Koizim from Glencore to trade coal and iron ore, according to the people, who asked to not be identified because the information hasn't been made public. Both will start in London at a later date.\nThe hires are a sign that Goldman Sachs is rebuilding its presence in the coal, iron ore and freight markets after it lost its top coal traders earlier this year and sold assets. Peter Bradley and Spencer Sloan were among traders who left the bank in January to form their own coal trading company, Javelin Global Commodities Holdings, with support from German utility EON SE and US coal producer Murray Energy Corp.\nEarlier this year, Goldman Sachs sold two coal mines in Colombia - La Francia and El Hatillo - and a port in the Latin American country to Murray Energy for a fraction of the $US569 million it spend buying the business in several stages from 2010.\nThe sale of the mines marked the end of operations at Goldman's commodities principal investments group, which over 35 years invested in everything from mines to oil refineries, power plants and metals warehouses. US lawmakers wanted to close a loophole that allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley to invest in physical commodities assets.\nGoldman was still the largest bank by revenue from commodities in the first half of this year after overtaking JPMorgan Chase & Co in 2014, according to London-based analytics firm Coalition. Commodity-trading firms view the bank as a rival and Goldman has less than $US200 million in credit exposure to those companies, chief financial officer Harvey Schwartz said October 15.\nKoizim and Aaboe will report to Jacques Gabillon, new global head of commodities structured finance and coal, iron ore and freight trading, one of the people said. Gabillon was previously head of the commodities principal investments group.\nGoldman Sachs and Glencore declined to comment. Moore Capital didn't return messages seeking comment. Koizim didn't return calls seeking comment. Aaboe couldn't be reached.\n Aaboe joined Moore Capital in 2011 as a commodities trader after spending more than a decade at Morgan Stanley, where he was a managing director. Koizim worked at Glencore for nearly eight years under head of coal Tor Peterson.\nThe departure of Koizim comes as Glencore weathers what the commodities trader described in its first half results as a \"challenging\" coal market \"owing to continued oversupply in numerous markets.\" Coal prices in Australia and South Africa, two of the world's top exporters, have fallen close to a eight-year low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:06:28.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
