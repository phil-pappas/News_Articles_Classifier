During the quarter, management launched ‘Clip On’ range of pressure cookers on a pilot basis in Bangalore and plans to roll out the product on a pan-India basis during 2HFY16. With a view to tap rural markets, TTKPT has introduced LED Lanterns — which management believes will be a good product to penetrate into rural areas. TTKPT is looking to buy a brand in Europe, the size of which will be limited to R4b, to tap the export opportunity.\nManagement guided for 10% revenue growth and 20% profit growth in 2HFY16. We expect FY16 revenue growth at 10%, along with ~100bp margin expansion—translating into 26% PAT growth. We cut our EPS estimates by 10%/9% for FY16E/FY17E, given the delayed export growth.\nManagement highlighted that price growth stood at 4% in cooker and cookware categories while volume growth accounted for the balance 3%. The southern market grew 6% while non-southern market grew 16% during the quarter. As a result of delayed festive season, management highlighted that festive demand will be reflected better in 3Q results as against 2Q in FY15. Management highlighted that ecommerce (which contributes 2-3% of overall revenue) is the fastest growing segment for the company and despite heightened activity in e-commerce, discounting trends are abating; this should drive growth higher going forward.\n 20, 2015 12:16 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:35:08.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
