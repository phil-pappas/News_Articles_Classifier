To make it as difficult as possible for stubbornness to build a nest, it helps to play devil's advocate and continually challenge the preferred outlook.\nWhat has been the preferred outlook?\nThe preferred outlook, first revealed on June 15 , has been based on the 2011 S&P 500 chart. Back then, my dashboard of indicators suggested that the S&P 500 of 2015 would mimic the S&P of 2011. Below is an updated comparison of 2011 vs year-to-date S&P 500 performance.\nBased on this analogy, we anticipated the sharp summer drop, followed by weeks of sideways trading and a break (or minimally test) of the initial August panic low (1,867 for the S&P). While a break of the initial August panic low was preferred, a test of that low was the minimum requirement.\nWe milked this “script” for what it's worth and got everything including the recent test of the August panic low (the S&P dropped to 1,872 on Sept. 29). But will there be another low?\nIn recent weeks, many analysts picked up — or picked on — my original 2011 analogy. Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but increased popularity of an indicator generally reduces its effectiveness. This could be a case in point.\nThe devil's advocate challenge of the preferred outlook started with my Oct. 1 column \" 3 Bullish Signals that May Surprise Wall Street .\"\nSince the S&P already fulfilled the minimum requirement (test of 1,867), the 150-point rally from the Sept. 29 low is legitimately challenging the ideal scenario of new lows.\nIt is too early to give up on the notion of new lows, however, and we shouldn't ignore the strength and breadth of the latest bounce from 1,872 to above 2,000. The chart below plots the S&P 500 against my favorite liquidity indicators. Here are two developments worth noting:\nThe Aug. 28 and Sept. 17 highs (red circles) triggered a lot of selling. The current rally pushed the S&P above price (and liquidity) resistance. Sellers have not (yet?) stepped in, but buyers have stepped up. Contrary to popular opinion, we expected a strong fourth quarter and wanted to buy stocks at new lows.\nUnfortunately, we didn't get those new lows (yet). It's hard to let go of a script that's worked so well for so long, but the devil's advocate cautions that the S&P 500 may well continue higher without delivering those new lows. (That doesn't mean there won't be any pullbacks, though.)\nWhat to do?\nIn tricky situations like that, it's often best to go back to the basics. Where is the next key resistance level?\nThe S&P must overcome this resistance hurdle to trigger the chance of further gains. But as long as the S&P stays below the resistance hurdle, the chance for new lows remains alive. Price reaction to this hurdle is likely to offer valuable clues and should be an opportunity for a low-risk setup.\nWhere is this key resistance, and why is it so important is discussed here: S&P 500 – New Highs or New Lows?\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.ispyetf.com/view_article.php?slug=S%26P_500_%2013_New_Highs_or_New_Lows%3F&ID=680#QxS9WeOZcyEFZo0K.97", "http://www.ispyetf.com/view_article.php?slug=2015_is_Shaping_up_to_Look_a_lot_Like_2011&ID=649#0kBaojxMsP2MZsvz.97", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/28/this-years-sp-500-looks-just-like-2011s-rebound.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:09:45.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
