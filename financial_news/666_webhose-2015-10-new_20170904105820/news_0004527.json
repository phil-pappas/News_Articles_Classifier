We have achieved £73million of savings in streamlining public sector back office processes from 2006 to 2014.” \nArlene Foster added: “A review is underway across Departments to identify new work processes that can generate revenue and reduce expenditure. This work is in addition to the OECD Public Governance Review, which is examining how our public services compare globally and where we can make improvements. \n“The OECD Review will bring forward recommendations to maximise the impact of current reform across the Northern Ireland public sector on both the quality of public services and value for money to the taxpayer. The Review, due to complete by the end of November 2015, will make recommendations which will help to inform the development of the next Programme for Government.” \nArlene Foster concluded: ‘Whilst we have made progress on reforming our public services there is much more to do. The challenges currently facing us will be exacerbated by increased pressures on public spending and increased demand for government services on a daily basis. \n“A fundamental element to the success of this programme lies in encouraging collaboration between government departments and partnership working across all sectors.” Note to editors: \nMedia enquiries only to DFP Communications Office on 028 9081 6724 or 028 9081 6725.
