Customers who are buying annuities need to understand how much they’re paying, and the risks involved. \n“Unfortunately many consumers have purchased an unsuitable annuity without financial advice and paid significant sums in commission without realising it. It is really important to protect consumers and ensure they can get good value from their pension savings.” \nAnnuity rates over the past 10 years for buyers aged 60 (dark blue), 65 (blue) and 70 (green) \n(Based on a single person with £100,000) \nSource: Hargreaves Lansdown \nData from the Association of British Insurers, the trade body which represents insurers, shows around 70pc of savers who buy an annuity do not take financial advice. \nAlan Higham, founder of pensionschamp.com, said: “The FCA should ban commission all together and introduce upfront fees instead. Commissions only serve to confuse the customer and the only time they see how much they are paying at a very late stage.” \nBilly Burrows, an independent retirement expert, estimates people who buy non-advised annuities are typically paying up to £500 more than the average saver who pays for full advice. \nThe FCA is also considering updating information it sends out to people approaching their retirement date, making clearer to savers the costs and benefits of shopping around for annuity deals, over sticking with their insurer. \nIn April the Government introduced a 0.75pc cap on excessive pension management charges to boost savers’ retirement funds by £1 billion, as part of a Government initiative to tackle “rip-off” levies that deplete customers’ savings. \nThe FCA will now collect further evidence on annuity commissions and has begun an industry consultation on whether a cap should be introduced which ends in January. \nA Treasury spokesman said: “We want to ensure that our financial services sector supports working people at every stage of their lives. \n“That’s why we’ve launched a major new review into financial advice to explore what more can be done to make sure people can access high quality, affordable, tailored advice and guidance so they can make informed decisions with their hard-earned money.” \nHave you been ripped off by excessive charges on your pension?
