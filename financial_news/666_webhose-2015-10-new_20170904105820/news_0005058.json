Yet among those who didn't graduate, that number drops to 40%. \nThose who graduated college are also more likely to say their finances are in good or excellent shape. Meanwhile, non college grads are nearly twice as likely than college grads to spend more than they make (35% vs. 19%). \nWhile the majority of those polled — 64% — have savings, that share drops to 57% for people who haven't graduated college, and jumps to 85% for those who did. And despite the burden of student loan debt, college graduates have much more financial confidence and satisfaction than those who skipped college or who started but didn't graduate. Are millennials doomed financially? \nStill, across the board, roughly half of Millennials (51%) say they foresee not making enough money as an obstacle to achieving financial wellness, whether they went to college or not. Indeed, wage growth has been slow in recent years, growing roughly 2% a year, according to Labor Department figures. \nThey also have some steep challenges in reaching goals such as \"to not have debt, to have a safe amount of savings and yet have adequate resources for the future,\" says Mark Avallone, a certified financial planner and president of Potomac Wealth Advisors in Potomac, Md. \nEven among those with savings, 43% have less than $5,000 socked away. Only a third of those who have savings have a 401(k). About half of older Millennials, ages 26-34, with savings have a 401(k), while just 14% of younger adults have started saving in such plans. \n\"They should be worried,\" Avallone says of the Millennial generation. \"Someone in their 20s, even on a modest income, will need to save $1 million or more (for retirement).\" \nAnd in the short term, the problem with prioritizing debt reduction over savings is that when emergencies inevitably arise, Millennials may not be prepared, says Tom White, CEO of iQuantifi, a financial advising site aimed at young adults. \n\"If you have a need for $1,000, and you don't even have that in your checking or savings account, what do you do?\" he says. How millennials should save for retirement \nDespite their debt load and small amount of savings, Millennials generally feel satisfied with their finances and confident about their ability to manage money — even though most also worry about their financial situation at least sometimes. \nThey're also wary of taking on more debt, with many hesitant to pull out their credit cards for items they can't afford. Nearly half said they completely disagreed when asked if they usually buy things they can't afford on a credit card. A little more than a quarter say they somewhat disagree. \nThere may be at least one encouraging sign for the country's young adults: The data show \"they are paying attention, which I think bodes well for the future,\" says Andrew Plepler, head of global corporate social responsibility at Bank of America. \"They are much more conscious of how important it is to live within your means and build savings and pay down debt. Those are good concepts for young people to have.\" SHOW COMMENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:20:36.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
