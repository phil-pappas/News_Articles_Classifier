Edmund Tadros Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Edmund Tadros Two spotlights focus on a clearing in the brush.\nA couple of male lions are on the hunt. They pause, raise their heads, sniff and stare into the darkness. There's an eerie silence as they try to flush out prey.\nAndrew Schoeman, a runner-up in the black‑and‑white category of the 2013 BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year, is sitting next to me in an open-top four-wheel-drive. My photography tutor for the next two days, Schoeman leans in to remind me of the optimum camera settings for the shot. Focusing on the lions, my mind flits between awe – their size, their calmness, their presence – and how best to frame the photo.\nWe're less than 10 metres from the lions; the proximity and size of their killer hazel eyes viewed through the lens sends a sudden chill that makes me shudder.\nMy favourite shot, a southern carmine-bee eater. Edmund Tadros The lions soon move on, disappearing back into the darkness as quietly as they emerged.\nMy first evening on photographic safari at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve in South Africa's Kruger National Park has certainly delivered. As our ranger/driver (known as \"FW\") swings back onto the dirt road chasing the next sighting, Schoeman and I go through my images.\nMany don't work: awkward framing or too dark are among my crimes against photography. But he likes a wide shot of the lion looking into the darkness. \"Good frame, nice shot,\" he says with the brevity of a true professional. I'm beaming.\nAs we rattle along the dirt road, I look up at the glittering sky before closing my eyes, enjoying the warm wind rushing over my face. The safari consists of FW, tracker Petro and Schoeman. As FW drives, Petro shines a spotlight over the bush, looking for animals. Schoeman sits quietly, camera at the ready.\nOn safari in South Africa's greater Kruger National Park. Edmund Tadros It's almost 40 minutes before we stop again, after Petro signals towards a tree. Sitting on a branch is a spotted eagle-owl, which, like the lions, ignores us as we snap away. (It seems Africa's wildlife are old hands when it comes to posing for the hero shot.) Then, when I zoom in, the owl glares at me with piercing yellow eyes.\nThe next day, I'm up before dawn, sipping a strong coffee as the sky lights up the bushveld around the lodge. I'm studying last night's hastily scribbled notes from Schoeman's crash course in wildlife photography. I bought a Nikon D5100 a few years ago and, until I met Schoeman, had used it in automatic mode. He took me through the basics of the camera, then lent me a Nikon 80-400mm AF-S VR telephoto lens. It's enormous but makes all the difference.\nPrivate sanctuary Daylight casts muted yellow rays over Sabi Sabi's Earth Lodge, a mix of ultra-luxury meets rustic design that blends into the environment, leading it to be included as one of National Geographic's Unique Lodges of the World. The ​13 self-contained private suites and main lodge are built into a hill, their external walls finished with golden thatch grass, while a lack of fences allows animals to roam the property.\nThe service is of the type whereby you never want for anything and no one ever neglects to greet you by name. Being the centre of so much attention is initially embarrassing, but it's frighteningly easy to adapt to it.\nMy suite has sweeping views, high pitched ceilings, king-size bed, airconditioning and, of course, Wi-Fi. Outside, this holistic private sanctuary includes a small garden, plunge pool and shower. It's so relaxing I can only be tempted out for safari drives and meals. The four-course dinners under the stars are a highlight, although it was disconcerting to see my very first impala in the wild then eat the same meat (carpaccio impala with red onion marmalade) only a few hours later.\nHilton and Jacqui Loon bought Sabi Sabi in 1980 with a partner, Peter Milne. In 1982, the Loons bought out Milne and over the years the South African couple have expanded their landholding, with Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve now totalling 6000 hectares. It is an unfenced part of the 65,000-hectare Sabi Sand Wildtuin (Reserve) which, in turn, is joined to the 5.5-million-hectare Kruger National Park conservation area.\nIn addition to Earth Lodge, there are three other lodges at Sabi Sabi: Selati Camp, Bush Lodge and Little Bush Camp. Earth Lodge, the most recent addition, was opened in 2001 and refurbished in 2011. Each of the four properties is accessible through a network of roads in the private reserve. The Loons are still active in the day-to-day operation of Sabi Sabi and have no more plans for expansion – unless, of course, further land becomes available.\nFinal touches As the sun rises rapidly about 6am, Schoeman, FW, Petro and I head out to explore. Tanned and with a solid build and somewhat taciturn manner, Schoeman is good company; his intent focus on his surroundings reminds me of the best news photographers I've worked with over the years.\nWe soon come across a small herd of elephants, including a mother and her calf. I click away while Schoeman advises me of the correct settings. As I chop off all manner of elephant parts, Schoeman explains the basics of framing: divide the picture into horizontal and vertical thirds. If the object has eyes, frame the image in the direction they're looking. Left to right is best. Finally, either amputate an entire section of animal, or get it all. I resume shooting as the elephants head off, trunks held high in the air.\nFW explains that the two females have smelt a male. When they meet up with the bull, he promptly tries to impress the females by repeatedly pushing his trunk against a marula tree to get the yellow-skinned tart, juicy fruit to fall. The herd stays to enjoy the fruits but despite his best efforts, it's clear the bull is firmly in the \"friends zone\" as far as the two females are concerned.\n\"The male wants to impress the females with his strength but he's not old enough for it to make it difference,\" FW observes with a touch of sympathy for the hapless young elephant. \"The females only want the strongest males.\"\nOur twice-daily expeditions into the reserve quickly acquire their own rhythm: FW driving, Petro on the special scout's seat out front of the vehicle (dubbed the \"snack seat\"), Schoeman and me in the back, cameras poised. Petro signals with his hand while talking to FW in the local dialect, Shangaan. When Petro makes a sighting, FW ensures the vehicle is positioned so I get the best angle. The photographic safari, which can accommodate up to six people, is all about helping budding snappers see the most animals and nail the best shots.\nAs we drive along, FW notes that out in the open, there's time to think. He grew up in the bush and prefers it to cities: \"I don't like too many people around, it gets too hectic,\" he says as he accelerates down a stretch of road.\nI take my favourite shot of the entire trip on the second morning – a close-up of a southern carmine bee-eater. It's one of many birds I snap yet, unlike the others, everything about this shot works: the colours are bright, the bird is looking in the right direction and, mercifully, it doesn't move too much. It's one of the few occasions that Schoeman looks at the small viewscreen on my camera and proclaims: \"Perfect.\"\nThese guys are a professional team and there's a certain amount of pressure to get the shot. Equally, having something to focus on is relaxing in its own way. My mind goes quiet with a task to complete as I'm forced to really look at the animals, noting the direction in which they're moving; trying to read their minds. When I get the shot, it's like getting a scoop. As a bonus, I learn basic photography skills and so acquire unique souvenirs I can enlarge and display on returning home.\nOn the third and final morning, we have the thrill of witnessing – and photographing – nature in action as a female leopard stalks a tortoise through the long grass near a watering hole. \"She looks hungry,\" FW notes dryly.\nLeopards are the athletes of the cat world; their jaws are strong enough to haul a carcass their own weight up a tree. In this case, the leopard stealthily disappears into the grass to strike. Only the top of her back is visible as she settles in for a well-earned morning snack. There's the sound of sporadic crunching as she breaks through the shell.\n\"Leopards are the most flexible cat,\" FW explains. Unlike other great cats such as lions, leopards will eat almost anything. \"I've seen a leopard eat a mongoose.\"\nI finish the trip with more than 1000 photos. Schoeman offers a primer in picture editing to help select and make basic adjustments. Looking at the photos on a big screen, it's the close-ups I find most compelling. I've been close enough to these creatures to snap their eyes lit with intent and intelligence. It's a sobering experience, and a timely reminder of where we not so humbly sit in the food chain.\nON SAFARI Day one: Farewell my loved ones, and head to the Qantas International First Lounge at Sydney Airport to enjoy a gourmet breakfast and 20-minute massage. Board QF63 (business class) to fly Sydney-Johannesburg. The food (a vinaigrette-covered salad of blue cheese, walnuts, baby beans and tomato is a highlight), entertainment (I watch three movies), and flat bed makes the 14.5 hours relaxing and enjoyable.\nDay two: Arrive same day in South Africa and head to Saxon Hotel in the wealthy Johannesburg suburb of Sandhurst for an overnight stay. The staff are so friendly, the warm interiors so welcoming, it feels like staying with a mate – albeit a mate with a 53-suite, three-villa estate and a world-class collection of African art.\nDay three : Breakfast overlooking the Saxon's infinity pool and gardens. Catch a Federal Air propeller plane for the 90-minute flight to Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve's airstrip in Kruger National Park. Greeted by a man named Candy offering me a cool face towel. Check into Earth Lodge's Suite 11. Relax, then head out on my first game drive about 4:30pm.\nDays four to six: On Safari, shoot images of the Big Five – lion, elephant, buffalo, leopard and rhinoceros – along with other animals such as hippos, impala and all manner of birds. Each outing includes a short break for a drink and local snacks, the most spectacular being the sundowner breaks in the evening.\nDay seven: Arrive home with Qantas.\nTAKE ME THERE Qantas: Sydney-Johannesburg return, economy from $2044, business class from $4999; departs six times a week.\nSaxon Hotel, Villas and Spa : Lead-in luxury suites from R4950 ($513.20) a night per room for up to two guests.\nFederal Air : Johannesburg-Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve, return from R6790 ($704.08).\nSabi Sabi Earth Lodge: All-suite lodge, from R12,700 ($1316) per person per night.
