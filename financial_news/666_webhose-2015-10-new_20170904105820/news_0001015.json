Anthony Johnson by Jemima Whyte and Angus Grigg Threats from big investors of a protest vote at Insurance Australia Group's annual meeting contributed to the board's surprise decision to abandon its controversial Chinese expansion.\nThe backflip on Thursday came less than one week before IAG's annual meeting, and as votes were starting to be lodged by investors.\nThe decision to abandon a further $100 millon investment in the Chinese general insurance sector was taken as foreign insurers continue to exit the market, citing a hostile regulator, falling market share and lack of profit.\nIAG was said to be \"advanced\" in discussions with Chinese insurers, and earlier in 2015 took a heavy write-down on its one investment in the country.\n\"It's very hard to make profits up here in China,\" one insurance executive, who asked not to be named, said. \"There is also a feeling the deck is stacked against the foreign insurers.\"\nDespite China's rapidly expanding insurance sector, foreign insurers had secured just 1.3 per cent market share, unchanged since 2005, Ernst & Young said. In September, AIG said it would \"suspend\" its automotive insurance business in China, following a similar move in 2014 by its American rival C.V. Starr.\nPoor track record Such a poor track record for foreign insurers in China was seen as a factor in Australian fund managers opposing IAG's expansion into the world's second-biggest economy.\n \"There is a sense that those insurers up here [in China] are just hanging on for grim death,\" the source said.\nFund managers including Nikko Asset Management and Investors Mutual have been public about their concerns regarding IAG's Chinese expansion plans, warning it was a risky strategy that could have an impact on the potential for capital management. Other large institutions, including Perpetual Investments, have also been reported to have concerns about the strategy. All declined to comment on Friday.\nIt is understood some investors raised the prospect of protest votes over the China expansion with chairman Brian Schwartz and vice-chairman Elizabeth Bryan when they conducted the usual pre-annual meeting roadshow a few weeks ago.\nUnusually, the majority of IAG's nine-person board are seeking shareholder approval for election or re-election, including Alison Deans, Raymond Lim, Elizabeth Bryan, Tom Pockett and Jonathan Nicholson.\nAt the annual meeting, investors will also be asked to approve the issue of more stock. The remuneration package of outgoing chief executive Mike Wilkins will also be put to a vote, as will the share issue to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway group.\nStill change their votes The timing of IAG's statement on Thursday saying it would abandon China surprised many, though one investor said it was worth noting that institutional investors could still change their votes even if they had been lodged.\nAs recently as last Wednesday, incoming IAG chief executive Peter Harmer said he was \"deeply committed to finding the right opportunities to invest there [in Asia].\"\nIn late August, Mr Wilkins said the company was seeking a national presence in China.\n\"We still think China is a meaningful market. If you're going to have a good Asian strategy you've got to be in China,\" he said.\nAustralian investors have also questioned the board's decision to issue shares to Berkshire Hathaway in August, at little or no premium to the market price.\nOne investor said the combination of the Buffett deal and the prospect of the company buying a Chinese insurer spurred investors to become more aggressive.\nUnder the deal with Mr Buffett, IAG will hand over 20 per cent of its Australasian business to the US group, allowing the insurer to reduce its capital requirements.\nBut investors were unhappy that Berkshire would be given a waiver that would permit anti-dilution rights for its shares in IAG.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:08:27.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
