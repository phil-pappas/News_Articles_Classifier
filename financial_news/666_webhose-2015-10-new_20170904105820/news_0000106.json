She urged emerging markets to diversify their economies and said some of them might be ill prepared to weather the financial storm that could arise when the US Federal Reserve eventually raises interest rates.\n\"We are concerned about their capacity to buffer shocks,\" Ms Lagarde said.\nPolicy makers in emerging markets should keep a closer eye on company debts denominated in dollars as well as to the banks that lent to them, she said.\nThe IMF said on Tuesday emerging market firms have racked up debts of $18-trillion and rate hikes in the developed world could spur a rash of corporate bankruptcies.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:52:28.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
