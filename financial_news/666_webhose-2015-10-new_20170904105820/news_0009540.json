Andrew Meares The challenge for governments now will be to persuade voters that their worst fears have not been realised in the hundreds of pages of fine print .\nBut for the governments trying to sell the agreement there is an even more fundamental impediment: they are selling a lie.\nThey will laud their negotiators for prising open foreign markets for their nation's exporters, while minimising the price that will be paid in the form of increased import competition.\nHard at it Illustration: David Rowe Malcolm Turnbull was hard at it yesterday, hailing the market access for our exporters that, since our tariffs were already low, would come at little cost.\nYet the truth, as the Prime Minister surely knows, is that the bulk of the benefits from trade reform do not come from gaining market access for our exporters. They come from opening our markets to imports, so that we can import the goods that other countries make more efficiently, and concentrate our resources on doing what we do best.\nThe benefits come from shifting labour and capital from our uncompetitive to our competitive industries.\nThat's a painful process, and a much harder message to sell.\nBut think about what it means. If the trade deal has cost us very little in terms of reducing our trade barriers, there must be relatively little benefit for the Australian economy.\nAs it happens, independent estimates published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington show the TPP as being of only marginal benefit to Australia.\nWhat Turnbull describes as \"a gigantic foundation stone for our future prosperity\" is more like a Hans Christian Andersen pebble, at least as far as Australia's trade is concerned.\nNon-tariff barriers And it is a pebble by political design. Australia's tariffs might be low, but there are plenty of \"behind the border\" non-tariff barriers to trade.\nBy pandering to the protectionist interests of their uncompetitive industries, the negotiators for Australia and our trading partners are reducing the benefits of their trade agreements.\nWe can't really blame the new Prime Minister for the TPP's inadequacies, but we can expect Turnbull to improve the quality of our future trade agreements.\nWriting in The Australian Financial Review , a former head of the Industries Assistance Commission, Bill Carmichael , has proposed a really clever way to reduce the secrecy of our trade negotiations and raise the quality of the subsequent agreements.\nIt is for the government to seek the advice of the Productivity Commission on Australia's opening offers in any new trade negotiations.\nThat would mean a public inquiry, in which all the competing interests could be heard and openly tested. It also would mean a set of proposed opening offers made with the interests of the entire economy at heart: a set of offers in which Australia would open its economy unconditionally to what our trading partners do best, so that we can specialise more in what we do best.\nReal winner If you think that sounds like the unilateral trade reform of the Hawke-Keating period, you are right. The commission's recommendations, if they were embraced by the government, would be taken as a gift by trading partners, but the real winner would be Australia, as it was in the 1980s and 1990s.\nAs the commission has said, unilateral trade reform would be more powerful than any of the bilateral free-trade agreements negotiated to date.\nThe commission's report would have to remain confidential until the trade agreement was completed, but then the public would able to compare the government's best effort with what the commission's recommendations would have made possible.\nThe process of dispelling the official nonsense and raising the quality of Australia's trade agreements would be under way.\nAlan Mitchell is The Australian Financial Review's economics editor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:05:12.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
