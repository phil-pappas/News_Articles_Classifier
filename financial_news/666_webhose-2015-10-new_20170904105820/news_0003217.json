Nigerians drink slightly less at 12.5 litres but in Tanzania and Zambia, consumption falls into single digits. \nTrue, in one or two large markets such as South Africa and Cameroon, levels are three or four times higher, but at a measly 8.8 litres a year, annual beer consumption on the continent is a fraction of other regions. Europeans drink 55 litres a year, while Americans guzzle 72 litres. \nWith the spending power of many less developed parts of the world increasing, the big brewers believe that these poorer countries represent their best opportunity for growth in a world where consumption is slowing in more mature markets Americans may drink the most beer but their thirst for the big brands is diminishing in favour of craft beer. \nSo, as the largest beer-maker in 30 of the 38 African markets where it operates, SABMiller would have been a big prize for anyone but for AB InBev, which somehow, despite being the largest brewer, is startling weak in the region, it was massive. \nIn a company presentation earlier this year, Mark Bowman, Managing Director of SAB’s African operations, revealed just how big the company thinks the opportunity is. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is targeting 10pc annual sales growth on the continent over the next five years, double the rate SAB notched up in 2014. For a beermaker like AB InBev, battling soggy sales in the US, Brazil and other big markets, such potential was simply too great to miss out on. \nThat’s not to say though, that it will be easy to tap into. Africans like to relax with a drink or two, they just don’t have the same taste for beer as westerners. \nIn many countries where disposable income is a fraction of most European countries, cheap homemade spirits with frightening names and the potency to make you blind rather than just blind drunk are much more popular. \nIn Kenya, the favourite tipple is kumi-kumi, or chang’aa, literally meaning “kill me quick”. In Nigeria, one local brew is a palm wine called “crazy man in the bottle”; Botswana has “dizzy spell”, and Zimbabweans are partial to a nightcap known as the “Scud”. Five years ago, the UN World Health Organisation estimated that that half of all alcohol drunk in Africa is illegal. \nThe trick then is how to persuade people to drink more beer, when it is more expensive and much weaker than many of the lethal moonshines available. \n• Which beers will a combined AB InBev-SABMiller (Amsterdam: MI8.AS - news ) own? \nSAB reckons it can be done because as such a dominant force it has the ability to keep prices down by cutting costs. With AB InBev behind it, this crucial advantage is multiplied. Breweries can be expanded, distribution speeded up, and suppliers consolidated and the enlarged company will be able to shoulder losses in the short term as it attempts to unseat the illegal, local sellers. In the beer industry, muscle is everything and many of these producers will only be able to put up a fight for so long. \nSo what does this new beast, which will manufacture one in every three beers sold around the world and will be able to compete so aggressively in new markets mean for its rivals? AB InBev and SAB were already the number one and two players by some margin prior to this deal, so the combination of the two puts huge pressure on the other big players to find a suitable merger. \nBelow them sits a handful of second tier names including Heineken (Other OTC: HEINY - news ) , Carlsberg (Other OTC: CABGY - news ) , Molson Coors of the US, Japan’s Kirin and Asahi, and San Miguel from the Phillipines, all of whom will be wondering which of their counterparts would make the most compelling partner. \nIt’s a daunting prospect. The industry has been consolidating rapidly for the last 15 years, ad the creation of“Megabrew” as it’s been dubbed, hasn’t just torn up the global map but ripped it to shreds, leaving the smaller players to scrap for the leftovers. \n= Flybe turnaround hits turbulence = \nJim French, the former chairman and chief of Flybe, was keen on playing up to the regional airline’s Exeter roots. “We come from Devon, wear grass skirts and drink cider,” he once said, mocking the tired stereotype of the West Country’s agricultural heritage. \nSadly for French, Flybe has struggled to shake another conventional image, which is that airline often make for horrible public companies. \nWhen the company floated in 2010, French dismissed concerns that it could prove to another disappointment for airline investors. Flybe was coming to market as an established company with a proven, profitable business model, carrying 7.2 million passengers, French argued. \nWith almost painful predictability, the airline, immediately issued a string of profit warnings as demand across many of its routes fell flat. \nFrench departed long ago and it has been forced into a three-year restructuring plan, which Saad Hamed, the current boss, claims is taking shape with revenue, capacity and passenger number growth up for the third successive quarter. \nHe’s right to point to an improvement but to hail the numbers as proof of a continued turnaround when FlyBe’s shares are languishing more than three quarters below where they floated at, feels a little premature to say the least.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:47:43.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
