A big drop in legal expenses significantly boosted Citigroup’s earnings. Overall, revenues slowed down, however, as the consumer banking and credit card segments suffered.\n\nRevenues slipped 5% to $18.7 billion, while adjusted revenues were $18.5 billion. Most of Citi’s major businesses saw revenue declines this quarter, but those were mostly offset by lower expenses. The company reported EPS (earnings per share) of $1.35, beating consensus estimates of $1.28 and up from the $0.95 reported during the same period last year.\nExcluding the effects of credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, EPS came in at $1.31. Net income rose by a whopping 51% YoY (year-over-year) to $4.3 billion due to a sharp decline in expenses. Excluding CVA, net income was higher by 36% at $4.2 billion due to lower operating expenses, credit losses, and taxes. However, operating income rose by 12% at $5.99 billion, aided by an 18% cut in operating expenses.\nOperating expenses and margins Operating expenses were $10.7 billion for the third quarter, mainly due to lower legal expenses compared to last year’s expenses. Legal and related expenses stood at $376 million, significantly down from the $1.6 billion reported in the prior year’s quarter. Further, repositioning charges were $81 million, considerably declining from the $382 million recorded in the previous year’s quarter. Cost of credit was higher by 5%, as lower net loan loss reserve release was partially offset by lower net credit losses.\nNet interest margins were lower by 1 basis point than the previous quarter’s margins at 2.94%, while net interest revenues rose 3% to $11.8 billion.\nCitigroup’s earnings come as a relief during an overall dull bank (VFH) earnings season. Peers such as Goldman Sachs (GS), J.P. Morgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC) failed to meet analysts’ estimates this earnings season.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Citigroup’s 3Q15 Earnings Top Expectations Part 3 - Analyzing Citigroup’s Segmental Earnings Part 4 - Citigroup’s Profitability Boosted by Lower Expenses Company Earnings Citigroup earnings per share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:04:21.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
