Analysts polled by Reuters had on average forecast STC would make 3.06 billion riyals. \nWeighing on the results was an increase of 1.14 billion riyals in service costs and a rise of 505 million riyals in operating expenses, it said without elaborating. \nThere was also a drop of 573 million riyals in net 'other income and expenses', due to costs related to an early retirement programme and foreign exchange losses primarily linked to the Turkish lira. \nThese factors offset a 9.7 percent increase in revenue, which climbed to 12.895 billion riyals from 11.75 billion riyals a year earlier. \nBoosting revenue was a 5 percent rise in mobile working lines year on year, while the company noted \"continuous strong growth in data traffic\" as it builds out its 4G mobile broadband network in Saudi Arabia. \nIn September, STC's chief executive told Reuters his firm would spend another $1 billion in the second half of 2015 on improving its networks as it tries to meet surging demand for web-based services. \nThe company competes domestically with Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) and Zain Saudi, and own stakes in operators in the Gulf, Turkey, South Africa and Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:30:17.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
