Apochi Suleiman, said the illegal camps were discovered on Wednesday through intelligence gathering. \nThe FOC said the illegal operation covered an area of over 100 hectares dotted with stolen products in Bilabiri Community. \nSuleiman said the command had deployed a combined team from Delta and Bayelsa, to ensure daily patrol of camps. \nHe said the command impounded six wooden boats laden with diesel, used by oil thieves to transport illegally refined products to the high sea. \nThe commander said that troops also discovered and seized electricity generating sets, pipes, hoses and other equipment used by thieves to siphon crude. \nThe FOC was accompanied by the Deputy Command Operations, Capt.
