They show us trends in health, the economy and housing. They tell us how us how our population is developing and give us information on the needs of our communities. \n“Most importantly, statistics help us to make informed decisions about how we deliver our public services. Reliable data allow us to plan ahead and develop policies that are targeted and meet the needs of the population. They also allow us to be more innovative and look at how we can do things better to ultimately improve the lives of people living in Northern Ireland. Our statisticians should be celebrated today for the part they play in achieving this.” \nThe Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) is responsible for producing official statistics and social research on Northern Ireland. \nSome statistics produced by NISRA include: \n· The Northern Ireland population at 30 June 2014 is estimated to be 1.84 million people. \n· The population has increased by 10,800 people (0.6%) from mid-2013 to mid-2014. \n· According to the 2011 Census, 1.8% (32,400) of the usually resident population of Northern Ireland belonged to minority ethnic groups, more than double the proportion in 2001 (0.8%). \n· In 2014 there were 24,394 births, 14,678 deaths and 8,550 marriages. \n· The number of people aged 85 and over at 30 June 2014 was 34,400. The growth of the population aged 85 and over is six times that of the population aged under 85 (6.9%). \n· The number one visitor attraction in 2014 was the Giant’s Causeway, with 788,000 visitors. \n· The proportion of smokers has fallen in the last decade from 26% in 2004/05 to 22% in 2013/14. \n· In 2013-14 the average (median) household income in Northern Ireland, before housing costs, was £404 per week or £21,100 per year.
