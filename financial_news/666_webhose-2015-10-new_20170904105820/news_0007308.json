Overall sentiment on equity markets is weak,\" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.\nASML, a supplier to top global semiconductor makers, was one of the biggest fallers, dropping 6 percent after its third-quarter earnings came in slightly below analysts' expectations, and with fewer than expected new bookings.\nSkanska also fell more than 7 percent, its worst day since August 2011, after it said writedowns would hit its third quarter profits.\nHowever, British financial company Hargreaves Lansdown rose 7.3 percent, the best performer on the pan-European STOXX 600 index.\nEven though Hargreaves reported a drop in first quarter assets under administration, investors were pleased by the fact that the company's new business in-flows had hit a record high.\nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Alasdair Pal; Editing by Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:19:33.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
