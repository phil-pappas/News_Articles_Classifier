Investors pored over the latest corporate earnings and economic news. The price of oil rose.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,176 as of 11:15 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added four points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,028. The Nasdaq composite gained 12 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,882.\nTHE QUOTE: \"People just want to get some comfort that the recovery in the developed markets is still intact,\" said David Lefkowitz, an executive director and equity strategist at UBS. \"That in my mind is really the key question going into earnings season.\"\nPLAYTIME AGAIN: Mattel climbed 5 percent after an Oppenheimer analyst published a research note highlighting the toymaker's core brands as a bright spot. The report came a day after Mattel reported disappointing third-quarter results. Mattel was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $1.13 to $23.67.\nSURPASSED EXPECTATIONS: Industrial conglomerate General Electric reported a decline in third-quarter profit, but strong performances from its core units helped the company top Wall Street expectations. The stock added 49 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $28.53.\nCRIMPED CASINO: Wynn Resorts slumped 3.9 percent after the casino operator said new gambling regulations in Macau continued to hurt its business. The stock fell $2.86 to $70.90.\nONLINE VIDEO PLAY: Shares in Alibaba rose 0.6 percent on news that the e-commerce giant has offered to buy up the rest of Chinese video streaming site Youku Tudou in a $3.6 billion deal.

The energy sector fell the most.\nMANUFACTURING REPORT: The Federal Reserve said that U.S. manufacturing production fell for the second straight month in September as factories cranked out fewer appliances, computers, and electronics. The decline suggests that a strong dollar, weak overseas economies, and cautious U.S. consumers are holding back factory output.\nMARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.4 percent, while Germany's DAX rose 0.2 percent. France's CAC 40 gained 0.4 percent. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi inched down 0.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite in mainland China was up 1.6 percent.

Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 19 cents to $49.54.\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices fell slightly.
