We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?\nI am a 24-year-old postgraduate (PhD) student in an area with little or no application to the job market (dataset analysis in palaeontology), although I have developed many transferable skills while studying.\nI am about to start the third year of a three-and-a-half-year course which is fully funded with a stipend. But I have come to realise that I have no interest in continuing in academia, I do not get on with my supervisor and the research topic is unfulfilling. I have pretty much decided to quit, but I am delaying because I have nothing to go to and, additionally, I don’t know how to leave without souring any future academic reference.\nI am applying for data analyst jobs, and have also considered doing a law conversion course, but I don’t know how to explain what has been effectively a two-year gap in my CV, or why I am applying for jobs two years into an uncompleted PhD.\nShould I: carry on applying for jobs while trying to rescue my PhD (but how would I explain this in job applications?); or quit, be temporarily unemployed, and have this glaring gap in my CV; or just limp on for a year and a half to complete a qualification which I have no interest in using?\nDo you need advice on a work issue?
