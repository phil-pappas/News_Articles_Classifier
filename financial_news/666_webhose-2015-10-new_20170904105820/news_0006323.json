Picture: Richard Waugh Source: News Limited\nNetEngine software developer and team leader Matthew Barram took advantage of this growth when he decided to learn coding about two years ago. “From when I first started coding to when I got a job was less than six months,” he says.\n“I started out with an online course for a few months, got some experience, got a referral to NetEngine and they said ‘We can’t find enough people, we want you on board’.”\nMr Barram says coding is a lot less complicated than it seems.\n“We’re always looking for people and the last thing I care about would be a uni degree. It’s absolutely irrelevant in this sector as far as applying for jobs,” he says.\nIS IT TIME TO QUIT YOUR JOB?\nSECRETS TO NAILING THAT PROMOTION\n“If someone had a month of full-time learning a new programming language that is in demand in Australia – Ruby on Rails or JavaScript – and they are able to talk and be a normal person, they will have no problem getting a job.”\nOnce in a job, the perks are plenty, too, as employers fight to retain their staff.\nMr Stronge says NetEngine appeals to its workers with a positive workplace, employee freedom and community involvement.\n“If we can’t pay them a salary that Google and Facebook can, they are part of a society that is more exciting than renumeration,” he says.\nPayScale data shows software developers earn between $45,000 and $93,000 a year.\nAt NetEngine, employees are allowed to work from home and in hours that suit them, coffee is free all day, beer is free all night, professional development is actively encouraged, the office is completely paperless and no one works on their birthday.\nThey are also encouraged to pursue personal projects and to participate in community and humanitarian initiatives such as Rails Girls, which inspires females to try coding, and Random Hacks of Kindness, which matches charities and social enterprises with developers who want to make a difference.\nRandom Hacks of Kindness will run in Brisbane on November 28-29.\nFor more information, visit rhokbrisbane.org\nFor more employment news, read the CareerOne section in Saturday’s News Corp Australia newspapers.
