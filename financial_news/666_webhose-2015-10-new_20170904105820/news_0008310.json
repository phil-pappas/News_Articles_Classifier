(http://bloom.bg/1LNdmbP) \nA Honda spokesman in China told Reuters that the company has not made public any plans about a new plant in Wuhan, adding that Dongfeng Honda's existing two plants already have more capacity than required to meet its sales targets. \nEarlier this year, Honda's chief executive said the Japanese automaker expects to boost China sales in the current fiscal year as demand among younger consumers helps it shake off jitters about the country's economy and financial markets. \n(Reporting by Sneha Teresa Johny in Bengaluru and Jake Spring in Shanghai; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi) Read the original article on Reuters .
