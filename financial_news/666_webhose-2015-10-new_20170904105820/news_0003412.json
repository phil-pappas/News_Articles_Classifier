Photo: Louie Douvis\nYou're invited to a get-together of like minds for tea and light refreshments. Dress casual. No RSVP necessary.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nThere'll be a few speeches and much moving of motions, if I can put it that way, but don't let that put you off.\nAMGs offer light refreshments, speeches and the odd bit of blood sport.\nSo few turn up these days to the AGMs of listed companies that you're bound to be welcomed with open arms. Besides, they're typically the only chance for small shareholders to meet senior managers and directors, let alone ask questions.\nAdvertisement It's true the bigger companies webcast their AGMs, removing the inconvenience of having to turn up, as well as allowing you to fast forward the boring bits. But then you'd miss the body language on the podium, which can reveal a lot. Unless you filled in the notice of meeting form at least 48 hours beforehand, you can't ask a question, either. And you certainly can't follow up on the spot anything said during the AGM.\nThe big institutions, which invariably control a swag of votes, are usually a no-show as well. No point really, since they vote in advance, a sort of postal vote by proxy. Besides, for their own personal briefing they can just pick up the phone.\nThere's tea, but often little sympathy, for underperforming boards. Photo: Tanya Lake\nBut some super funds, belatedly realising they have members' interests to look after, are going to AGMs or at least voting.\nAs a rule the only opportunity for small shareholders to have their questions answered is at the AGM. No special briefing for you I'm afraid, even though that honour is extended to brokers, though what's said is supposed to be simultaneously released to the market. Sure.\nIf you do pop along to an AGM, don't be shy. I once asked what I feared was a dumb question only to find myself surrounded by new best friends. Chances are if you think something is odd, so do others.\nThe old show of hands is under threat. Photo: Sean Davey\nBut in case it really was a dumb question, just think you will have broken the ice and somebody else might ask an even dumber one.\nMind you, AGMs can bring out the worst in grandstanding, filibustering and microphone snatching. And that's just the directors. I went to one marathon AGM until it got the better of me and I left before it finished, not that I can vouch that it ever did.\nWhere was I? Oh yes, if there's no electronic voting the first question to ask is why not? Having a proxy vote on your behalf is archaic and unnecessary in this day and age.\nSpecific questions include whether we've seen the last of capital raisings (banks), asset write-downs (media) and for resources stocks, how will debt be controlled?\nThe pity is that AGMs remain such formal affairs, especially when everything has already been decided behind closed doors. Oops, that sounds like a good excuse not to go. I'll take it back.\nAll right, so you won't decide the outcome on any issue, but you sure can show a protest vote when a show of hands is called for. You'd be surprised how embarrassing that can be for directors, even though they'll then call a poll and you'll lose anyway.\nYet even the show of hands is under threat. The big institutions hate that their millions of shares might only have the same voting worth as your 1000 on the floor of the AGM.\nI can see how it can be abused. Round up a few mates and a board can ram through resolutions, such as their own remuneration report, on a show of hands when a poll would have recorded a different result. But I'm not convinced that's enough to justify removing the one moment in the limelight for small shareholders. At least it's transparent, unlike proxy voting.\nAs for remuneration reports, there's a blood sport where an AGM could almost charge an admission fee for the spectacle of grown men and women cringing.\nBy the way, a question you should ask of directors up for election, though you'll have to do it through the chair, is: what's your contribution to the board?\nTwo strikes, which is 25 per cent of shareholders voting in two consecutive years against the remuneration report, forces another vote, which if it gets 50 per cent will spill the board.\nCompanies with one strike against them already include Boart Longyear​, Cabcharge (in 2013 it had the dubious honour of being the first to get three strikes and is back again for more), Cash Converters (with a second strike), FlexiGroup, Harvey Norman, McMillan Shakespeare, Mortgage Choice, Newcrest, Paladin Energy, Primary Health Care, Seven Group, Sino Gas, Sundance Resources and UGL.\n@moneyPOTTS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@FairfaxMoney", "http://twitter.com/@moneyPOTTS"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:04:52.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
