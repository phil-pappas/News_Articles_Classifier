More on that later.\nBut with honeymoon hopping, what I call chasing three and four-month special offers to new customers, you get to keep the government guarantee for a much better return than term deposits.\nAdvertisement Say you want to park some money for three months. The best term deposit is Bank of Sydney's 2.75 per cent, according to finder.com. At Rabo you could bump this up to 3.20 per cent using its Notice Saver account. It's a sort of halfway house between the instant cash of online accounts and term deposits; the rate is variable but you must give 31 days notice before you can get your money back. There are also 60 and 90-day versions that pay slightly more.\nBut honeymoon hopping would get you 3.50 per cent, Rabo's four-month introductory rate. After the four months, you could close the account and move your money to another bank's honeymoon rate. That'd be St George, also offering 3.5 per cent but for a month less.\nAnd so you hop back and forth between the two. And don't worry if you outstay your welcome â€“ most other banks offer three or four-month honeymoons as well.\nThe only thing you have to worry about, apart from remembering when the honeymoon ends, is that rates might fall in the meantime.\nAs it happens they seem to be going the other way. When Westpac lifted its variable home lending rate last week by 0.2 per cent it was surprisingly generous to savers, bumping up its four, seven and 12-month term deposits by 0.25 per cent. This uncharacteristic benevolence is somewhat mitigated by the fact that they're still lower than those from smaller banks.\nThis is all the more reason for not putting everything into one term deposit. It's better to spread your money with a cocktail of maturities to keep some flexibility and minimise the chances of rates going against you.\nBut why bother with term deposits anyway?\nThere are alternatives besides the honeymoon hop. Some banks offer special savings rates to existing customers in certain circumstances, for example if you make regular deposits.\nAmong the most intriguing alternatives are listed income securities which were once a hit with mum and dad investors even though they never mature. The securities, that is. As this shortcoming became more obvious, and other hybrids were issued at better rates, they fell out of favour.\nMost were redeemed by their issuers long ago but those from Macquarie and NAB soldier on. They're yielding just over 5 per cent because their price has been so heavily discounted and they don't have the government guarantee of a deposit.\nBecause they're perpetual they can only be cashed in by selling them on the ASX so maybe they're not the place for any loose change. Besides, the brokerage will kill you.\n@moneyPOTTS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@moneyPOTTS"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:31:13.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
