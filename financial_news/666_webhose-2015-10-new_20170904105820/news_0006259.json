Because of the higher risks that come with lending to such companies, they have to offer higher yields than those of their investment-grade peers. When spreads increase, it's costing more for these junk corporates to borrow. \nBut what's that mean for the stock market? \nThat's a complicated question, but we can begin answering by figuring out how much of the S&P 500 consists of junk-rated companies.
