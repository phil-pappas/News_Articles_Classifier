Arsineh Houspian by Sue Mitchell Private investment company TDM Asset Management's punt on a family-owned baby goods retailer three years ago has paid off in spades.\nTDM's 30 per cent stake in the Baby Bunting Group was worth more than $68 million on Wednesday after shares in the baby goods chain surged as much as 44 per cent on their sharemarket debut, valuing the company at more than $230 million.\nBaby Bunting shares, issued at $1.40, reached $2.02 before closing at $1.86, delivering strong gains for existing shareholders including TDM, founders Arnold and Gail ­Nadelman and the management team, and big stag profits for new investors lucky enough to snare stock in the $52 million initial public offer.\nThe offer was heavily oversubscribed, despite recent volatility on equity markets, and investor share applications were scaled back significantly.\nTDM partner and Baby Bunting non-executive director Tom Cowan said the strong demand for Baby Bunting's shares reflected the retailer's growth potential and the quality of its management team.\n\"There's a small number of businesses in Australia with a strong market position, outstanding management team and long-duration growth prospects,\" Mr Cowan said. \"Because there's such a small handful when they do come to market, they are highly sought after.\"\nNext stage, not exit events He said: \"We don't see these events as exit events but the next stage and journey in the business – public market investors are attracted to that model as opposed to the traditional private equity model.\"\n Baby Bunting chief executive Matt Spencer said the major shareholders, lead manager Morgan Stanley and co-lead manager Morgans, had no qualms about pressing ahead with the float despite recent sharemarket weakness.\n\"The investment community seems to be endorsing our growth strategy,\" Mr Spencer said. \"It wasn't a big transaction and therefore we were very confident that the investment community would appreciate what we have on offer.\"\nMr Spencer, a former Kathmandu, Coles and Shell executive, joined the company in 2012, the same year that TDM came in as a major shareholder.\nAt the time, Baby Bunting had 19 stores, mostly in Victoria, and sales of about $112 million.\nWhile two major baby goods specialists, Babyco and Mothercare, have collapsed in recent years, Baby Bunting has gone from strength to strength and is now the largest player in a highly fragmented $5 billion market.\nFootprint doubling plans Baby Bunting now has 33 stores and plans to double its footprint to more than 70 stores over the next five years by opening between four and eight stores each year.\nSales reached $180 million in 2015 and the company has forecast 21 per cent growth this year to $218.6 million, underpinned by same-store sales growth of 4.3 per cent and three new stores due to open before June 2016.\nPro-forma earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are expected to reach $16.3 million, compared with $12.4 million in 2015, boosted by stronger gross margins and productivity gains from recent investments in infrastructure.\n\"We have a very good opportunity to grow this business,\" Mr Spencer said. \"We are very clear we have a model that works, we are very clear on our store formats, we are very focused on organic rollout rather than acquisitions and we intend to invest in further infrastructure to support store growth.\"\nBaby Bunting differentiates itself from rivals by offering a wide range of products [about 6000], a high level of store service and a national pricing policy that means customers pay the same price in-store and online.\nTDM sold 18 per cent of its shares into the float but remains a long-term shareholder. Founders Arnold and Gail ­Nadelman, who opened the first store in Melbourne in 1979, reduced their stake from 12 per cent to 6.1 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:07:20.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
