Lawyers describe the case as the most important concerning sexual discrimination in pensions since the 1990s. \n• EU to push for same-sex marriages to be accepted across continent \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) relates to a legal loophole that leaves hundreds of thousands of gay and lesbian couples who are married and in civil partnerships worse off in retirement than everyone else. \nThis is because, as the law stands, they are not entitled to inherit company pension income accrued by their partners before 2005. \nSame-sex couples were given the legal right to inherit each other's pensions in 2005, but only for money saved after this date. \nAround 70,000 workers are expected to leave behind a same-sex partner when they die and data from the TUC suggests that they would be £5,714 better off if they were allowed to inherit their partner's full pension. \nSome major British employers, including Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) and Telefonica UK, the owner of O2, have voluntarily surpassed the legal minimum and already give same-sex couples the same benefits as husbands and wives. However, it is estimated that one in four final salary pension schemes does not do more than the law requires. \nA spokesman for Stonewall, the gay rights campaign group, said: \"The current situation is unfair - equality should not be denied on the basis of cost. Stonewall works with employers to ensure they recognise and act upon this loophole, and actively backdate pensions to provide equal benefits in their pension schemes.\" \nAlastair Meeks, a partner at law firm Pinsent Masons, said: “This is potentially very important for older individuals, who could stand to gain life-changing amounts from a change in the rules. However, as far as many employers are concerned, this is just one more cost they could do without.” \nkatie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:22:56.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
