However, the order has left investors in a panic and unclear about how to get their money back. It is important for investors to know that those who file and record their claims quickly have a better chance of getting their money back. In response to a Moneylife Foundation request, a deputy general manager (DGM) of SEBI has clarified as follows: It may please be noted that Hon’ble SAT in its order dated 12 August 2015 had directed PACL to wind up its existing schemes and refund all investors within a period of three months. The said time period will end on 11 November 2015. Recovery procedure can be initiated only after expiry of above period and after attachment of assets. As regards the freezing of bank accounts of the company, it is understood that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is conducting an independent inquiry. As per media reports CBI in February 2014 raided PACL premises and seized data and papers relating to money and property of PACL. As far as the suggestion to create an online mechanism for registering PACL investor’s requests is concerned, it may be noted that investors can register their complaints on SCORES platform ( http://www.scores.gov.in/Complaint.aspx?flag=n ). Since PACL Ltd is an unregistered/ unlisted entity, it does not have a SCORES Login ID due to which the complaints received on SCORES cannot be sent directly to the company electronically. However, such complaints are printed by SEBI and sent to the company for redressal. Further, regional and local offices of SEBI are currently receiving complaints against the company, which are then sent to the entity at its registered address for redressal. The investors can also send their grievances to the nearest SEBI office, the addresses of which are available on the SEBI website. On 6 October 2015, Moneylife Foundation had written to the SEBI Chairman as follows: We congratulate SEBI for its dogged effort to bring various Ponzi schemes to book and for your orders asking PACL to refund depositors’ money in a short and finite timeframe. However, ever since the SEBI order, many depositors are running from pillar to post trying to figure out the process of sending their requests for refund. We request SEBI to create an online process for registering PACL investor’s requests. Many of the investors seem to be from rural areas like Parbhani, so an alternative way of physically depositing their requests in SEBI offices across the country, and some public awareness in this regard would also be helpful. Requesting a quick solution from SEBI in this matter, the Foundation also cited several examples from PACL investors seeking refund from the company.
