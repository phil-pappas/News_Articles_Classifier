Mr Cassidy said the median P/E ratio of UBS's growth list, which included a host of new entrants including Dominos Pizza Enterprises and TPG Telecom from the small cap world, was 20.5-times, high compared with the broader market. But this number was well below peak levels, he said.\nThere was also a growing dispersion between \"growth and \"value\" stocks on the S&P/ASX 100 ex-resources – those with the highest and lowest PE ratios – exacerbating the notion that the growth stocks were comparatively expensive.\nThis could be explained by the global economic uncertainty, Mr Cassidy said.\n \"Economic uncertainty is likely contributing to higher than average price of growth and larger than average discount of the value end,\" he said.\n\"Lack of growth at the headline market level is also likely pushing up the price of growth somewhat.\"\nDespite looking expensive, that end of the market had appeal, Mr Cassidy said, particularly as the Australian dollar is expected to further depreciate, boosting companies with offshore earnings such as CSL.\nHe warns however, investors should be wary of \"overpaying\" in some cases.\nCSL and Resmed are companies identified by UBS as looking attractive on a price-for-growth basis.\n\"We think Ramsay Health Care, Cochlear, REA Group, TPG Telecom and Domino's Pizza Enterprises all appear expensive due to their high P/E levels,\" Mr Cassidy said.\nDominos is trading on a forward P/E ratio of 47.2-times earnings, with expected earnings-per-share growth of 35.1 per cent.\n\"ASX Limited, Tabcorp Holdings and Tatts Group appear expensive based on the moderate growth UBS expects,\" Mr Cassidy said.\nMacquarie Wealth Management said despite the high quality stocks not joining in the October equities relief rally, which have driven value, or low quality stocks higher, it expected value stocks to continue underperforming this year and advised sticking to growth.\n\"Rising growth and interest rate risks have driven a market intensely focused on earnings deliverability and relative earnings growth,\" the bank said.\nThe growth stocks recommended by Macquarie include Healthscope, Carsales, CSL, Ramsay Healthcare, Sonic Healthcare, Cover-more Group and Breville Group.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:03:57.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
