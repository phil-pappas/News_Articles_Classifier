It's not quite Halloween yet , but millions of Americans have already embarked on their 2015 holiday shopping campaign, and, somewhat surprisingly given the cautious nature of U.S. consumers since the Great Recession, financing options are in \" great demand \" according to CardHub.com. The consumer financial website seems particularly pre-occupied with so-called deferred interest purchases, a potential financial spider web for holiday consumers who are expected to spend about $834 each this holiday season and rack up $60 billion in credit card debt by December 31, 2015. According to CardHub, deferred interest plans are typically marketed as offering 0% introductory terms, but they come with a catch that distinguishes them from normal 0% credit cards. \"If you leave an unpaid balance of even $1 at the end of the introductory period or you miss a single payment, interest will retroactively apply to your entire original purchase amount,\" CardHub states. \"Thus, what you initially thought was a great deal could quickly devolve into a holiday nightmare.\" Calling deferred rate plans a \"wolf in sheep's clothing,\" CardHub says that, overall, holiday shoppers could spend 27 times more than they thought via deferred interest plans. \"Suppose, for example, that you're interested in opening a new credit card account to finance a couple of big-ticket items from your child's Christmas list,\" the firm states in its recently released 2015 Deferred Interest Report . \"Let's say they cost a total of $800, and you believe you can repay that amount within six months in the absence of interest. But things happen, and it ends up taking you seven months instead. With a normal credit card, you'd end up paying around $2 in interest -- assuming a 20% regular APR. With a deferred interest credit card, however, you'd pay roughly 27.5 times more -- i.e. $55 in interest -- easily eradicating any Black Friday deals that you may score.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:59:38.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
