The image resolves details as small as 2.9 kilometres.\nAt half the diameter of Pluto, Charon is the largest satellite relative to its planet in the solar system.\nCharon’s cratered uplands at the top are broken by series of canyons, and replaced on the bottom by the rolling plains of the informally named Vulcan Planum.\nThe scene covers Charon’s width of 1,214 kilometres and resolves details as small as 0.8 kilometres.\nAnother image shows the details of a belt of fractures and canyons just north of the moon’s equator.\nThis great canyon system stretches more than 1,600 kilometres across the entire face of Charon and likely around onto Charon’s far side.\nFour times as long as the Grand Canyon, and twice as deep in places, these faults and canyons indicate a titanic geological upheaval in Charon’s past.\n“With respect to its size relative to Charon, this feature is much like the vast Valles Marineris canyon system on Mars,” said John Spencer, deputy lead for New Horizons Geology, Geophysics and Imaging (GGI) at the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado.\nA composite of enhanced colour images of Pluto and Charon highlights the striking differences between Pluto and Charon.\nThe colour and brightness of both Pluto and Charon have been processed identically to allow direct comparison of their surface properties, and to highlight the similarity between Charon’s polar red terrain and Pluto’s equatorial red terrain.\nThe team has also discovered that the plains south of the Charon’s canyon – informally referred to as Vulcan Planum – have fewer large craters than the regions to the north, indicating that they are noticeably younger.\nThe smoothness of the plains, as well as their grooves and faint ridges, are clear signs of wide-scale resurfacing.\nOne possibility for the smooth surface is a kind of cold volcanic activity, called cryovolcanism.\n“The team is discussing the possibility that an internal water ocean could have frozen long ago, and the resulting volume change could have led to Charon cracking open, allowing water-based lavas to reach the surface at that time,” said Paul Schenk, a New Horizons team member from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 4:50 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:45:38.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
