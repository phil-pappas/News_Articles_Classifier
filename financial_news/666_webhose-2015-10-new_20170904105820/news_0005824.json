What we have not been able to do so far — and I’m the first to acknowledge this — is to change the dynamic inside of Syria.”\nThe president was confronted about several unsuccessful efforts in Syria, ravaged by a four-year-long civil war and now by the Islamic State terror group.\nObama also said he had no knowledge that Hillary Clinton, as his secretary of state, used a private server and email accounts to conduct official business.\nHe acknowledge that the arrangement resulted in security breaches but said he didn’t think she attempted to hide information and declined to address the question of whether she could be prosecuted under his administration.\nWho’s the tough guy?

And with respect to the Middle East, we’ve got a 60-country coalition that isn’t suddenly lining up around Russia’s strategy. To the contrary, they are arguing that, in fact, that strategy will not work.”\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News.\n Obama admits: I failed", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/barack-obama-admits-failure-in-syria-as-islamic-state-runs-riot-but-denies-vladimir-putin-is-the-stronger-man/story-fn5tas5k-1227565910610", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/12/1227565/910214-4ecab83a-7079-11e5-8252-216a34f84008.jpg", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/11/obama-defends-syria-strategy-criticizes-putin-leadership-role/?intcmp=hpbt1"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:46:53.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
