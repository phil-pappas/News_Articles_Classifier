NVS 0.85 % Her first reaction was, “I’m too small—this is really big.” Still, she interrupted her trip and headed to Novartis’ corporate headquarters in Switzerland.\nMs. Lin, best known for her 1982 design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., will unveil the new building in December. The interior has open spaces to encourage scientists and other employees to talk to each other and collaborate; its exterior is made to look like a modern version of a New England stonewall.\nRelated Reading\nThe Collector: Maya Lin (2/26/10) She has plenty to keep her busy just now, with the opening of the Novartis campus, a new exhibition of one of her works—an installation that takes over a room called “Folding the Chesapeake”—in a show at the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., and a new book surveying her art and architecture. Sitting in a book-lined room in her sprawling new studio in downtown Manhattan, Ms. Lin says that she’s taking a “midcareer pause.” In the decades since she won the contest for the Vietnam Memorial’s design as a 21-year-old undergraduate at Yale University, it felt to her that she had been working in overdrive, trying to define herself as an architect as well as an artist.\nShe was always inspired by the outdoors. Ms. Lin grew up in rural Ohio; her father was the dean of the College of Fine Arts at Ohio University and her mother was a literature professor. She was concerned about nature and the environment from a young age: She remembers petitioning customers at a local supermarket to boycott products from Japan because of its whaling industry.\nAt Yale, she intended to study animal behavior and zoology, but her father’s work inspired her to take an architecture class. Soon after, she submitted her proposal for the memorial. Her design—a black, V-shaped wall engraved with the names of some 58,000 troops who died or went missing in the war—generated a great deal of controversy; critics decried it as nihilistic. Eventually, organizers compromised and added a figurative sculpture by Frederick Hart of three soldiers near the wall.\nMs. Lin’s later architectural works include the Museum of Chinese in America in New York City (2009) and the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Ala. (1989). Her memorials “are not about death,” she says. “They’re teaching tools” to help people remember the events and relate them to history.\nBut she never wanted to be typecast as a monument builder. Throughout her career, Ms. Lin has also created landscape art and sculptures, such as Wave Field at the University of Michigan (1995), an outdoor sculpture of earth and grass that looks like undulating waves, inspired by the movement of water. She says, “There’s a very strong environmental aspect to all [my] structures.”\nMs. Lin says that her early influences went beyond architects to include sculptors such as the American Richard Serra. Still, after she earned her master’s degree in architecture, she remembers both professors and critics telling her that she wasn’t an artist. “I had gotten labeled as the kid” who had designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, she says. She ignored the advice that she should choose either art or architecture. “I just couldn’t stop doing both.”\nIt took a decade for her to feel that people were beginning to acknowledge her work beyond the Vietnam Memorial. One important moment came when someone she met told her how much he liked her 1993 “Groundswell,” an installation at the Wexner Center in Columbus, Ohio, that incorporates 43 tons of shattered glass.\nMs. Lin finds making art more difficult than architecture. “You really can do anything you want” with art, she says, whereas with architecture “you’re designing for others.” She compares art to writing a poem and architecture to writing a novel. “They’re both incredibly difficult and challenging, but sometimes that poem is harder…because I’m stripping it bare.”\nShe’s also been working on two less traditional ongoing projects that aim to draw attention to the environment. “What is Missing?” is a multisite, multimedia work including videos, satellite images and poetry that focuses on the idea that we are experiencing a crisis of biodiversity. “Confluence” consists of six outdoor installations—such as an elevated trail that helps viewers see wildlife from a different perspective—along the Columbia River basin marking the 200th anniversary of Lewis and Clark’s journey west.\nWhen she’s not working, Ms. Lin says that she’s a homebody. She lives in New York with her husband, an art dealer, and her two teenage daughters. During the summers, she and her family go to Colorado to spend more time outside.\nShe concedes that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial may still end up being her most acclaimed work. “I think I accept that it will be my most public work…and I’ll still always get questions like, ‘What do you do when something like that is your first piece?’ But it doesn’t matter to me as long as I feel, as an artist, I’m developing and I’m making work I feel resolved about,” she says. “It’s all one voice.”\nWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:07:55.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
