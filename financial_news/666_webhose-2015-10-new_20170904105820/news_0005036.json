Furthermore, the industry’s product offerings have been described as parochial, in addition to lacking in choice, diversification and quality. Asset managers have been called on to innovate and usher in a diverse product range that gives investors plenty of options.\n“If you are a global investor, you will struggle to invest in a Sharia-compliant manner, and even if there are good options, the problem is they are sub-scale,” Hydari said. \nHowever, through collaboration, asset managers can save time, money and end up with more diversity in terms of their product mixes, the bank said. \nDemand \nInvestors in the GCC are increasingly demanding more sophisticated Sharia-compliant savings, pension, insurance and mutual fund products. \n“They wish to diversify into a range of alternative and fixed income products — such as sukuk, leasing, trade finance, securitisation and other asset-backed instruments — as well diversify geographically,” the EIIB- Rasmala report said. \nThe Islamic pension fund industry has a long way to catch up globally. There is now a critical need for the creation of a GCC-wide pension fund framework. \nGlobally, pension funds hold assets in excess of $27 trillion, with Islamic pension funds making up just 0.001 per cent of this figure — despite the fact that Muslims represent almost a quarter of the world’s population. \nAccording to EIIB- Rasmala , diverting 20 per cent of investments from existing regional pension funds into Sharia-compliant funds would result in $36 billion being added to the global Islamic asset management industry. This would spur rapid innovation in terms of offerings and enable Dubai to capture the market and transform its Islamic finance industry. \nBy Siddesh Suresh ?Mayenkar Staff Reporter \nGulf News 2015.
