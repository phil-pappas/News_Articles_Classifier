The winner will take home a ticket to participate in the World StartUp Cup competition in the United States of America early next year. \nIn addition to the free exhibition, entrepreneurs who have started their business will participate in free workshops with experienced business leaders in the country; participants also get to meet up with some successful entrepreneurs to discuss issues affecting startups in Ghana and the way forward. The plenary session will be led by renowned entrepreneurs such as Tony Senaya (Horseman Shoes), J. J. Segbefiah (Brave Hearts Expeditions), and Francis Obirikorang (Swappaholics) to mention just a few. \nThe free exhibition has been made possible through the support of Young Entrepreneurs Savings Fund (YES) Fund, a product of ASN Financial Services Ltd (ASN FSL) that helps start up entrepreneurs build capital for their businesses. \n“It is estimated that 90% of new businesses fail within their first three years and ASN Financial Services Limited is supporting start-ups within the industry to avoid being part of the statistics. The growth of such SMEs is essential for the long term growth of this country\" said Mr. Johannes Okutu Akuffo, CEO of ASN FSL. \nDetails of the 2015 National StartUp Festival can be obtained at http://nationalstartupfestival.com/.
