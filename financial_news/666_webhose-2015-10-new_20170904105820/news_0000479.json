AB InBev’s mooted £68bn takeover of SAB , announced on Tuesday, is almost certainly going to require the disposal of the London-listed company’s interest in the venture because of expected regulatory concerns about competition. \nMolson Coors is the obvious buyer of the stake. An acquisition of SAB a so-called change of control - automatically gives Molson Coors the right to lift its interest in the joint venture to 50pc and name a chief executive of the business. It then also has first and last refusal over buying out the remaining 50pc. \nAB InBev and SAB have struck an “agreement in principle” for what would be Britain’s biggest ever takeover . The Belgian-Brazilian brewer behind Budweiser and Stella Artois has until October 28 to make a formal offer for SAB. \nSpokesmen for AB InBev and SAB declined to comment. Molson Coors did not return requests for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:35:24.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
