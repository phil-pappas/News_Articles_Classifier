Earlier, it could only be collected from the counters of the journey originating station.   The Indian Railways have also issued a format of receipt to be given by the defence personnel while collecting the ticket which specifies inter alia details such as PNR Number and \"Transaction ID\" on the Defence Travel System (DTS).   With a view to phase out the Defence Warrant System, railways commenced operations of DTS on its e-ticketing portal of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) in 2009.   It has also mitigated certain other problems encountered in booking i-tickets for the defence personnel through facilities like auto cancellation of fully waitlisted e-tickets, allowing booking of tickets on DTS during the first 30 minutes of opening of reservation which is disallowed for all other ticketing agents.   The i-ticket can be collected from any such counter by the defence personnel upon showing one of the ten prescribed proofs of identity allowed for undertaking the journey.    In case some other person collects the tickets on behalf of the defence personnel, then the person has to produce any of the ten prescribed proofs of identity in original along with photocopy of the ticket-holding defence personnel.  \nDisclaimer: Information, facts or opinions expressed in this news article are presented as sourced from IANS and do not reflect views of Moneylife and hence Moneylife is not responsible or liable for the same.
