The combined average from Q1 2002 to Q1 2008 was $25.1 billion, the report said .\nThe banks' Sharpe ratio — which calculates risk-adjusted return by measuring the mean revenue to revenue volatility — rose to 2.28 in 2009-2014 from 1.23 in 2002-2008. That indicates banks' annual earnings are enduring milder swings since the financial crisis.\n  View Enlarged Image \nTrading revenue has helped boost profits for the big banks, which raised their capital ratios after regulators imposed stricter capital requirements on them.\nSome analysts argue that the increased capital and liquidity requirements are resulting in market-making becoming more expensive while reducing market liquidity.\n\"Looser regulatory constraints would not relax the competitive pressure dealers face from the (high-frequency trading) and hedge-fund sectors, and could come at the cost of a less resilient financial system,\" New York Fed economists Tobias Adrian, Michael Fleming, Or Shachar, Daniel Stackman and Erik Vogt wrote in the report.\nBanks closed up on the stock market today . Citigroup rose 0.5% to 51.32, Goldman Sachs climbed 1.1% to 182.23 and Morgan Stanley rose 1.8% to 32.93. JPMorgan closed up 0.1% at 62.13 while Bank of America rose 0.4% to 15.75.\nThe study comes right before big banks report their third-quarter earnings. JPMorgan is scheduled to announce its results for the July-to-September period after markets close on Tuesday, Oct. 13. Wells Fargo and Bank of America report Q3 earnings on Oct. 14 before markets open. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs report on Oct. 15. Morgan Stanley announces Q3 earnings on Oct. 19.\nFollow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:47:26.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
