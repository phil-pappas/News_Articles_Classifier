There were no reported injuries.\nThe rainfall, up to 20 inches (50 cm) in little more than a day in the Dallas-area town of Powell according to one report, led to the cancellation of dozens of flights at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\nThe precipitation was expected to intensify over the weekend as moisture from tropical depression Patricia, which struck the Pacific coast of Mexico on Friday as a very powerful hurricane, meets with a storm system coming from the west and over Texas.\nCentral, western and northern regions of the state were drenched in the last 24 hours with between 5 inches (13 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) of rain, authorities said in a statement on Saturday morning.\nSome parts of the Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state, known to weather officials as Flash Flood Alley for its flood-prone conditions, received 8 inches (20 cm) in eight hours Saturday.\nMany parts of the state could see more than 8 inches (20 cm) of rain over the weekend, said the statement from the Texas Division of Emergency Management.\nThe Navarro County Office of Emergency Management said in a tweet it had reports of up to 20 inches (50 cm) of rain in the area, about 50 miles (80 km) south of Dallas.

Weather authorities said a coastal flood watches and warnings will be in effect for most of the day on Sunday.\nAuthorities in Navarro County requested sandbags for an unspecified number of homes that were being evacuated due to flooding, the statement said.\nInterstate 45 in Navarro County was shut down in some spots due to rising waters, stranding some drivers.\nFlash flooding in that county tipped part of a Union Pacific train carrying cement on to its side, and two crew members operating the train swam to safety, Jeff DeGraff, a Union Pacific Railroad spokesman, told CNN.\nAbout 100 flights were canceled on Saturday at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, one of the country's busiest air hubs, according to tracking service FlightAware.\nDozens of streets were blocked with barricades in San Antonio due to high water, according to the city's Emergency Operations Center.\nThe man who is missing fell into flood waters and disappeared while walking with his girlfriend and a dog.\n\"His girlfriend said she saw him go underwater and then she lost sight of him,\" said Christian Bove of the San Antonio Fire Department.\nHeavy rain also flooded streets in parts of the state capital, Austin, which has a population of about 910,000.\n(Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Karen Brooks in Austin; Editing by Frank McGurty and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:27:23.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
