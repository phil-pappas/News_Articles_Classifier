Getty Images by Paul Hayward The brilliant weaving run by Drew Mitchell that finally broke Argentina's spirit really began four months ago, when Australia's coach, Michael Cheika, displayed his pragmatism. Exploiting a U-turn that allowed the Wallabies to pick overseas players with 60-plus caps, Cheika recalled Mitchell and Matt Giteau from exile in Toulon.\nBy definition, teams who reach World Cup finals tend to be the ones who get most things right. Australia and Cheika have ticked a lot of those boxes here in England, off the pitch as well as on. Mitchell, who evaded six Argentine defenders before offloading to Adam Ashley-Cooper for the game's decisive try, had not worn the Australia shirt since December 2012, but his inspirational running when the Pumas were only seven points behind, was a triumph of flexible politics.\nEngland took the other route, keeping Steffon Armitage and other migrants to France at barge pole length. They would not be allowed to zoot back across the channel and take the jerseys of established players. You can argue all night about the merits of that policy. But the fact is that Australia found a way round a ban on exiled players and reaped the benefit when Mitchell set off on a gallop of extraordinary grit and enterprise.\nHis Argentine challengers, fraying by now, bounced off him or flailed in his wake. Mitchell swerved right across the pitch before his desperate offload bounced into the hands of Adam Ashley-Cooper and a thrilling contest was put to bed.\nThe first New Zealand-Australia World Cup final brings together easily the best two teams in the competition. If David Pocock was the Trojan of this semi-final, with three turnovers and a workrate that broke the measuring stick, Mitchell and Ashley-Cooper were the closers, the finishers; the men who made things happen. In the efforts of those wide boys, we could see the cunning of the Australian campaign, which began in Atlantis, otherwise known as Pool A.\nToughest group In the toughest of all the groups Australia beat both England and Wales before sauntering into a quarter-final against Scotland with more than a hint of complacency.\nKudos is due for their 20-point smashing of Stuart Lancaster's England side, which was inspired by attacking joie de vivre, and their narrower 15-6 win against Wales, which featured a heroic 10-minute goal-line stand when two Wallabies were in the sin-bin.\n Without a grave refereeing error in the quarter-final last weekend, the final on Saturday might have featured either Scotland or Argentina (rewind to Craig Joubert's erroneous award of a last-minute penalty against the Scots). But that reprieve was the only time Australia have not made their own luck in an impressively organised run to the last round.\nWith a philosophy described by Cheika as \"running footy\", Australia move the ball with sumptuous ease. They had a much sharper sense of when to stick or twist than Argentina were able to draw on at this stage in their upward cycle. The clash between Ashley-Cooper and Mitchell on one side and Julian Savea and Nehe Milner-Skudder in the All Blacks half of the pitch, is one to savour. Not to mention Richie McCaw v Pocock and Michael Hooper.\nMitchell, 31, and Giteau, 32, were readmitted in July shortly before a Rugby Championship that turned out to be a rehearsal for the final stages of this World Cup. Playing for Toulon (ie: leaving Australia) had rendered both ineligible for national service until Cheika overcame ethical and bureaucratic objections. His signature move as coach had been to secure access to all the country's most experienced talent regardless of where they drew a pay cheque.\nIn France, Giteau had been named top 14 player of the year in 2013-14 and Mitchell had excelled in Toulon's most recent European Cup win. The Rugby Championship strengthened the claims of both players. On the surface Cheika was applying simple logic to his World Cup squad selection but the 60-cap backtrack was cast by some as morally dubious desperation.\nHat-trick of tries Ashley-Cooper, who has 113 Test caps, is the first since Jonah Lomu to score a hat-trick of tries in a World Cup semi-final. His pre-tournament chirping about Australia's improvement now reads presciently. \"I think there are exciting times ahead,\" he said. \"We've been doing a lot of work throughout the year – not something we've done over the last decade – connecting as a Wallabies group throughout Super Rugby.\n\"The work we've done as leaders, as decision-makers, and certain members of the team with Cheik [Cheika] getting together with all the different provinces, I feel there's just a bond there. And that's something that's certainly going to be needed come September-October when hopefully we're playing for a final.\"\nImproving a balsa-wood scrummage has been Cheika's primary mission, but you can also see the unity and maturity that Ashley-Cooper said was there. You could see it when Argentina refused to yield and backed their high-risk rugby to carry them all the way to the final.\nIn the end, in all sport, you scan the battlefield for players who change the outcome through their talent for shaping events. This was Mitchell's part in the story as he ran round or past six Argentinian pursuers to set up Ashley-Cooper's hat-trick and extend Australia's lead to 27-15. Thus the bizarre modern restriction on player movements was blown away as Cheika's bet came good. Freedom reigned, in every sense.\nPaul Hayward is the London Telegraph's chief sports writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:04:25.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
