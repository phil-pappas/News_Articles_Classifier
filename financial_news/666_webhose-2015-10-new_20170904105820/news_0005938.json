LUKAS COCH However, there remained no consensus on lifting the rate of the GST with the ACTU and the Australian Council of Social Services still opposed.\nParticipants said afterwards the atmosphere of the meeting was extremely positive and it was as though a cloak had been lifted following the removal of Tony Abbott, who took to the airwaves immediately before the meeting to defend his legacy .\nIdeas previously ruled out or forbidden were allowed back on the table and nothing was considered off limits.\nBCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the exercise was important because it was demonstrating that it was okay to disagree while, at the same time, forge ahead on areas of consensus.\nCassandra Goldie and Jennifer Westacott. Louie Douvis Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell said there was agreement that the states needed to be brought into the process because so much of the agenda, whether if be the GST, inefficient taxes like stamp duties, or skill and the TAFE sector, was under their control.\n\"Many of the issues we talked about are not about federal government policy at all, they are state issues, and so the state governments need desperately to be part of the buy-in here,\" she said..\nThere was also a strong emphasis on getting more people into work, especially women, older people and the long-term unemployed, and developing closer ties between business and universities.\n\"We know that there are a lot of young people and not-so-young people out there that desperately want a job, and we know there are lots of businesses who would like to employ them,\" she said.\n\"We've got to bring that together and we think we can do that, in fact, we think we can do that inside current budget approaches.\"\nThe meeting was attended by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and eight of his minsters, three senior public servants, Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens and 12 sectoral representatives.\nBefore the meeting, Mr Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison emphasised that for them it was a listening exercise as the government puts together its reform agenda to put to the people at the next election.\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia urged caution in going after super taxes.\n\"A discussion around the equity and sustainability of superannuation tax concessions is both welcome and necessary, but it is also crucial that conversations and decision-making take place in the context of accurate information,\" said chief executive Pauline Vamos.\n\"There have been a number of incorrect claims made regarding the cost and distribution of superannuation tax concessions.\n\"In reality, superannuation is boosting incomes and lifestyle standards in retirement at a relatively low cost to government expenditure. When both super tax concessions and availability of the Age Pension are taken into account, government assistance for retirement income is broadly equitable across the range of incomes in the community.\"\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the government would forge ahead with a GST increase, with or without the consensus of the groups.\n\"It's in their DNA after all,\" he said.\n\"While it's always useful for governments to be engaging with a broad cross section of society, today's summit, held at this stage of the cycle, is evidence that the last two years has been a wasted opportunity,\" he said.\n\"This exercise has been less about governing and making decisions now and more about trying to provide legitimacy to the Liberal Party's election manifesto.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:52:58.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
