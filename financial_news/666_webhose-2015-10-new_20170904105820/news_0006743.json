Unfortunately, for those classified as “average,” it is becoming increasingly difficult to feel secure about their potential to ever retire in the traditional sense.Recently the Social Security Administration disclosed that the average American took home roughly $44,500 in net compensation. While that’s a 3.5% increase from 2013, when combined with other American averages, such as having less than $60,000 saved for retirement and predictions of spending upwards of $245,000 on healthcare during retirement, it’s easy to see why people are leery about reaching their golden years.Some quick calculations confirm what many people are worried about. Using the Social Security Administration’s Quick Calculator Tool, the average American baby boomer age 62 and claiming benefits in 2015 would receive approximately $982 per month (less than $12,000 per year). Furthermore, with $60,000 saved and a safe withdrawal rate of 4% this average retiree would need to find a way to live on roughly $14,000-$15,000 per year. That’s just 33% of their pre-retirement income … nowhere near the recommended 60-70% ratio.The picture gets a little brighter for those who work longer, yet lacks any real luster. A 66-year old in the same boat would have to find a way to make the most of their golden years on roughly $18,500-$20,000 per year, or about 42% of their pre-retirement income.These rather harsh calculations are supported by recent research from BlackRock, which found that 74% of Americans surveyed find it very difficult to keep on top of their bills while also saving for retirement. Baby boomers within the group went on to share they want to have $45,500 in annual retirement income, yet they've accumulated nest eggs that would generate only $9,150 annually, leaving a gap of $36,350.So what can the average American pre-retiree do? Work more? Work longer? Save more? Invest more aggressively?[caption id=\"attachment_fc936872217a4088b58e5a93869e51f7\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Will you be able to retire? (AP Photo/Mel Evans)[/caption]Yes. But that approach comes at an even greater cost. The more you work and save, the less time you have for yourself and the things that are important to you. As a result, your desire to retire dramatically increases but the pool from which will you need to draw from doesn’t increase at the same rate. You end up miserable and feeling stuck… as if nothing is working and you’re falling further and further behind as your goals get further and further away.It’s an interesting condition in which many people find themselves despite some obvious trends and factors to which their retirement thoughts and plans (and ultimately their results) could be dramatically improved.Consider, for instance, how retirement has changed. People often say how it’s different, and not their parents’ or grandparents’ retirement. However, when asked to be specific about it; i.e., how their own thoughts and ideas about retirement compare to those of their parents or grandparents, they can’t articulate them. They may blurt out something like “people are living longer and medical technology is better,” but the fact is that, although people may be living longer, it doesn’t necessarily mean those extra years are healthier ones.The reality is, even if you’re “average,” and behind in savings, thankfully everything is going to be okay, because retirement in the traditional sense is dead… done…six feet under.The point many are missing is that, for the first time, retirement is a state of mind instead of a physical event. Retirement no longer has a common look or feel; and gone are many of the previous standards and rules, particularly when it comes to work life. It used to be that when someone said they were retired it meant they no longer worked in any capacity.Nowadays, a huge percentage of retirees work part-time, dabble with seasonal labor, consult with not-for-profits or startups, and even launch their own business. Average retirement today is unique in that it almost always includes some form of work and, more importantly, it’s not done for purely financial reasons. They’re doing it in a way that helps them stay relevant, feel connected, and apply the skills they’ve learned over a long career.The problem is most people haven’t been given permission to make plans that no longer conform to outdated ideas about retirement. Everyone is still retirement planning like their parents and grandparents. They need to step outside of the box and become innovative. A move from right brain, logical planning, to left brain, creative planning is what’s required.If, for example, you wanted to retire from a $44,500 job at age 62, and want to live in that 60%-70% pre-retirement income range, you will need to make an extra $14,000-$15,000 per year. Taking it one step further, let’s say you live in Michigan or New York and are growing tired of frigid winters. To retire, you don’t have to slave at your full-time job for five more years, taking any overtime options, or avoid going out with friends to save money. You just need to find something you enjoying which pays $7,500 for the time you’re up north and then something else which will cover the remaining portion while you’re down south.That $7,500 goal translates into working 20 hours per week for six-months at $15 per hour. With this approach, you can stop worrying about jamming more and more into what you are currently doing, and start mentally retiring by looking for part-time work or starting a business that provides you $315 per week.Overall, Some research or new poll may lump you into the “average” category but that doesn’t mean you have to conform to those parameters. Don’t fall victim to planning your retirement the way your parents and grandparents did. Don’t aspire to saving enough money to sit around doing nothing. Break the mold, step outside of the box and retire with the right mindset and direction. It’s what will make you a cut above.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/fc936872217a4088b58e5a93869e51f7/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:25:27.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
