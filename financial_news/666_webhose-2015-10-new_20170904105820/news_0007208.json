Toffler Associates Chief Operating Officer Darin Powers says the company is on track to close calendar year 2015 with a 100% increase in revenue over 2014. “We have a proven track record helping the world’s largest organizations rapidly adapt their organizations to focus on innovation and value creation amidst accelerating change and disruptive market forces. Our team is intellectually powerful, collaborative, and focused sharply on actionable insights and strategies. Our value to organizations is reflected in growth in both client acquisition and revenue. We are heading into 2016 with a funded backlog that equals 2015 revenue and an unfunded backlog that is three times 2015 revenue,” said Powers.\nThe company’s growth continues to be fueled by helping public and private sector clients understand, plan, and adapt to emerging market disruption with strategic/advisory services, organizational transformation, innovation and agility plans, and risk management services that help to solidify market positions and gain competitive advantage.\nConsulting Magazine recently listed Toffler Associates on the top 10 list in 3 areas for its 2015 Best Small Firms to Work For rankings. The rankings are voted on by employees, a fact that Powers says shows the organizational transformation success isn’t all about revenue.\n“Our rankings were in the areas of work/life balance, overall compensation and benefits, and how interesting associates find their work on a typical assignment. This tells us employees are invested in and excited about our work for clients, and feel they are well compensated for it, “ said Powers.\nThe company is actively searching for talent to add to its team of associates and plans to grow 10 percent in Q4 of 2015.\nAbout Toffler Associates\nClients turn to Toffler Associates to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate the challenges of an uncertain future.
