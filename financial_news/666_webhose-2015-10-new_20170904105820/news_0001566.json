After having been laid off from my latest women's wear design job when the company moved the design office from Minnesota to New York, I decided to finally launch Nourish Collection , the breastfeeding clothing line I have been designing for a few years. I'm pre-launch now and boot-strapping the venture. This means \"What's in My Wallet\" is what I prioritize each day. It's very different from just a year ago, when I wasn't worrying too much about my spending. It matters a lot, now.Here are my things: 1. Large Chai Tea Latte: $4.53 To save money I usually buy the mix-in kind and make the latte at home but yesterday I was behind getting myself and my 4-year old out the door to school and work so I splurged on a pre-made beverage. 2. Groceries: $78.12 There are two of us but it seems my daughter is constantly eating. So I shop at Trader Joe's and Costco to keep costs down. We have our go-to fruits, veggies and other elements that we buy regularly. Then I mix up how they're presented or paired. That keeps things manageable, but interesting. 3. Puzzles, Crayons & Paper: $12.12 We go to the dollar store every month so Alexa can pick out a few new puzzles and replace any art supplies that need replacing. She loves painting and drawing, so we need to replenish those kinds of materials regularly. Our walls are FULL of her art. 4. Montessori Monthly Tuition: $875 This is our biggest expense right now. There are programs in Minnesota that subsidize education for 4 year olds, but the level of support that our school gives is worth the expense. And next year, she will attend kindergarten at a Minneapolis public Montessori School, which means no tuition![caption id=\"attachment_18434\" align=\"\" width=\"1940\"] Shore' design studio.[/caption] 5. Design Studio Rent: $305 When I decided to launch Nourish I quickly realized I needed space to spread out, to measure garments, to drape on my forms and house product. I found a pretty fabulous studio space to share with two surface designers (they work in natural plant dyeing, shibori, batik, and more). Each of us has our own space, and we share a small showroom and kitchen area within the studio. Creatively, it's amazing, but the best part is working alongside other moms. Their children are grown, so I benefit from their wisdom having raised strong, lovely young women. 6. Clothes/Shoes for the Girl: $40.35 She needed long pants (knit only, thank you!) and new shoes to catch up to her growth-spurt. So thankful for the many dresses she already has in her closet. They double as tunics for a longer life as she grows! 7. Parking Fee: $2.00 We have great resources for small businesses here in Minneapolis, and I attend free/low cost classes regularly to learn more about social media, modern networking, and pitching. This one was focused on the hidden features and uses of LinkedIn. It was more focused on B2B services, but I still gleaned enough for my purposes to make it worth my time. 8. Fast Food: $12.31 *cringe* Yes, this happened. 9. Fuel: $28.00 The cost of fuel here is hovering around $2.35, so I can fill up my efficient Toyota Matrix tank for less than $30. Thank goodness I didn't buy the Murano I test drove before the layoff announcement![caption id=\"attachment_18433\" align=\"\" width=\"959\"] Shore and her four year-old daughter Alexa.[/caption] 10. Child's Toothbrush: $3.14 That's right, one toothbrush. Because the other two were lost. And now, so is this one. For more on Nourish check out Heather's website , and Twitter and Instagram feeds.
