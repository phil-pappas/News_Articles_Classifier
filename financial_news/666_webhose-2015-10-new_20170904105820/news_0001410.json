Steven Siewert by Mark Story Gauging the debt levels of some listed stocks is no walk in the park.\nDeciphering whether a company generates more than it spends or relies on external funding, after factoring in its operations, investments and financing, can sometimes look more like a game of truth or dare.\nAfter all, Australian accounting standards allow \"wriggle room\" for companies to tinker with figures on their balance sheets, so it's often hard to distinguish between investment-grade stocks and those in varying stages of distress.\nWhen looked at in isolation, debt can lead to false assumptions about companies. Since the global financial crisis investors have less tolerance for stocks with big borrowings. Where management of companies running 30 per cent net debt to equity were once lambasted for having lazy balance sheets, they're hailed now for prudent fiscal management.\nWhile investment-grade stocks like to keep their net debt-to-equity to much less than 70 per cent, highly leveraged stocks in the banking, financial and infrastructure/utility sectors usually have enough cash flow to justify an investment-grade rating. Telstra, which has a net debt to equity of more than 100 per cent, is a classic example.\nCarrying a similar net debt-equity ratio, Fortescue Metals Group snubbed its nose recently at the market – especially naysayers fixated about its future debt covenants – by issuing a dividend. At face value, with a total debt of $9.5 billion and market cap of $5.5 billion, the troubled miner does look like a basket case.\nHowever, based on the balance sheet numbers Fortescue presents to the market, its earnings appear enough for its cash flow to allow it to sit within its debt covenant.\nBut Fortescue has no shortage of companions in the league of big stocks carrying excessive debt.\n Based on Bloomberg data, there are 199 companies on the ASX with total debt that exceeds their market caps. By removing the tiddlers, companies worth less than $100 million and those involved within banking, financial and utility sectors, we're left with 18 stocks where debt levels at first glance appear extreme. Eleven are involved in the materials and energy sectors.\nAt the extreme end of this infamous group is troubled toll road group BrisConnections, where total debt of $3.12 billion is16 times greater than its market cap.\nThen there's struggling steel and mining group Arrium. With a market cap of $254 million, it is confronted with reducing its $1.9 billion debt pile following the decision by lenders to offload a big parcel of debt in the mining services business on the secondary market. If iron ore and steel prices don't increase, Arrium will have to cut costs and contemplate further asset sales to avoid breaching its debt covenants in 2016 and beyond.\nMasking the true picture But because of some fancy balance sheet footwork, many stocks manage to mask more meaningful signals of distress on their income statements. A common way companies try to hide the impact of financial leverage, Montgomery Global Investment Management portfolio manager Andrew Macken says, is through the old chestnut of focusing investor attention on earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and often stripping out charges deemed non-operating.\nEqually common is the practice of moving line items within a company's cash flow statement. The net effect of moving interest expenses to financing cash flow is that cash flow from operations can appear decidedly better than it really is.\nThen there's the art of making a balance sheet look better through off-balance-sheet leverage of minority shareholdings in associate companies. By entering operating leases than are paid as an annual expense to use property and equipment, a company's balance sheet understates its true debt, Macken says. \"By only owning 49.9 per cent of a business, which may carry a lot of debt, companies are not obliged to include it on balance sheet, and a lot of leverage can be disguised within its consolidated reporting.\"\nIf there's an enormous difference between operating earnings and bottom-line earnings or net profit after tax (NPAT), Macken says investors need to find out what it is and why. As a case in point, by moving interest expenses from operating cash flows to financing cash flows, he says Fortescue's free cash flow appears better than it is. \"Remember that [Fortescue's] debt is denominated in US dollars, whereas the iron ore price is arguably driven by the cost bases of producers that are domiciled in emerging markets, which creates somewhat of a currency mismatch.\"\nWhat typically pushes companies into financial distress isn't a solvency issue but one of liquidity – the ability to meet day-to-day requirements, he says. \"The problem for Fortescue and others is that if the iron ore price falls much lower, cash flow could turn negative, and this could start to deliver liquidity problems.\"\nOne of the biggest problems of taking on excessive debt when times are good is that when times turn bad, management is forced to sell assets at depressed prices or issue new dilutive equity. \"A lot of highly indebted companies are being saved by low interest rates and if they were to go up [5 percentage points], a lot of these companies would be wiped out,\" Macken says.\nAlso providing artificial relief for highly indebted companies is \"covenant waiving\", which Macken equates to a corporate lifeline. Transport company McAleese bought itself 12 months of financial stability after renegotiating its bank facilities, which relieved it from the need to meet financial covenants.\nSome companies will be stressed when interest rates go up and covenant relief disappears, Macken says. \"Companies paying out more than they're earning are living on borrowed time, and if the sky does fall in on these stocks, remember a debt holder and even hybrids have priority over shareholders when it comes to claiming assets. Playing price momentum on distressed stocks is one way to play the sharemarket, but it's not investing.\"\nThe trouble with debt covenants, Elio D'Amato, of Lincoln Indicators, says is that while stocks are required to release their maturity dates no register exists and companies won't exactly broadcast these dates any more than is necessary.\nAs a case in point, while management of mining services company Brierty would have known well in advance it was in breach of debt covenants, it warned the market only when it posted its full-year profit of just $3.1 million in late September.\nQuinella of negative numbers Given the difficulty investors experience gauging the true health of any stock, Vanessa Gilbert, of online stock researcher Skaffold, suggests focusing on four vital indicators: debt, cash flow, profitability and funding. With that in mind, Smart Investor searched the ASX against five primary criteria to identify stocks to avoid:\nNo surplus cash: Calculated by subtracting the capital expenditure, investment and dividends paid from the company's cash flow generated from operations for the recent historical year.\nNet debt-to-equity ratio greater than 70 per cent: Measures the financial leverage of a company.\nCash interest cover of less than 4: Quality stocks should have a minimum of four times their interest bill covered by their cash flow.\nHistorical return on equity of less than 10 per cent: A gauge of past profitability. Quality stocks should have a track record of generating at least 10 per cent return on owner's equity.\nForecast return on equity of less than 8 per cent: Within the current low-earnings environment, good stocks should be delivering at least high-single-digit profitability.\nThe alignment of these five \"black holes\" within the constellation of the 23 stocks we unearthed (see table) exposes them to potential liquidity risks that Gilbert warns could threaten their survival. If debt gets called, these companies could be in big trouble, she says.\n\"The market is a constantly moving beast and stocks will move into and out of this rogue's gallery, depending on myriad factors,\" Gilbert says. \"When it comes to infrastructure and utility stocks on this list, especially Transurban, Origin and APA Group, you need to consider their assets that could potentially offset debt.\"\nGiven that these stocks seem to be going around in circles, Gilbert says they're susceptible to taking on more debt or raising capital, which would be shareholder decretive. She cites Duet Group as a prime example. \"While Duet is expected to deliver earnings per share of 7¢ in 2016, it's looking to pay [an unfranked] dividend of 17¢ per share, and the money has to come from somewhere.\"\nShe says a near doubling of the Transurban share price since in August 2011 also belies the theory that price always follows value. \"If all you want to do is trade price momentum, go ahead. But if you want to invest in an underlying business, you need to look at fundamentals.\"\nGood money after bad Many companies like to raise funding through hybrids. Unlike bonds, where interest and principal must be repaid on the due date, hybrids have the ability to extend maturity and defer or cancel interest payments. The beauty of this deferment is it gives companies with liquidity issues the ability to allay market fears by pushing out repayment commitments, and Origin Energy is a classic example, FIIG director of research Justin McCarthy says.\nWhen companies start making losses, people get concerned they're not going to get the income on their hybrids. At times when balance sheets are more stretched, McCarthy says, hybrids can be extended. While it's understood Origin is going to call ($900 million of hybrids) in December 2016, it can change its mind and can go to 2017 if it wants to.\n\"Risk increases as you go down the capital structure, and in times of stress we see how unlike bonds hybrids can behave.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:03:36.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
