However, the commission predicts the country will have a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of economic output this year and 3.5 percent next year.\nThe regions would overshoot spending targets this year and social security contributions would be less than projected, he said. But income and sales tax were growing fast.\n\"We will find that the better-than-expected growth rates will accelerate at the end of the year,\" he said.
