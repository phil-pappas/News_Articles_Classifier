James Verdier wants President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to suspend severance benefit to former executives of the National Oil Company of Liberia until investigation into the insolvency of the Company is completed. \nSpeaking Thursday at a news conference at the Ministry of Information, Cllr. Verdier said it was unjust to the Liberian people whose taxes will be used as benefit to leaders of NOCAL when they are not investigated for the mismanagement of the Company's resources. \n\"We have commenced investigation in the widely reported insolvency at the National Oil Company of Liberia,\" Cllr. Verdier told newsmen. \"There are issues of mismanagement, misappropriation of resources; waste of government resources that the LACC probe is intended to find out. \n\"We're hoping and want to recommend to the president that the issue of severance payment managers of NOCAL be suspended until this probe is completed,\" LACC Boss added. Clrr. Verdier said, the payment of severance pay to low-level staff and interns would be acceptable, not to managers who he, like President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, blame for the mismanagement and the nosedive of the integrity NOCAL. \nCllr. Verdier indicated that corruption cases were investigated and recommended to the Justice Ministry, and that the Commission was awaiting the Ministry to come up with findings in three months. \nCllr. Verdier then renewed call for the LACC to be granted prosecutorial power, which he argued will speed up corruption cases and combat the menace more strongly. \"Our Legislature needs to act if we are serious for corruption,\" he said. \"Give LACC that direct prosecutorial power, rather than waiting for three months before we can act after concluding investigation. \n\"It weakens the professional, it dampens the spirits of LACC when we investigate and we have to submit report to Justice Ministry and wait for three month before we can act,\" he lamented. \nHe explained that the LACC could not arrest people or officials suspected of committing corrupt acts due to the Commission's inadequate prosecutorial power. Cllr. Verdier also stressed that there was a strong need for the creation of a special court for economic crimes. \nHe expressed that when people are accused of corrupt practices \"This is the time for citizens to demand justice.\" The LACC boss said from 2008-2012 seven cases were investigated and recommended to the Justice Ministry and 2013 to present eight cases had been also investigated and recommended to the Justice Ministry.
