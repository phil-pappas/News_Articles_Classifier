On the one hand Netflix should be commended for buying the rights to such a powerful production. On the other, the video service’s coup underscores the shrinking theatrical market for independent features, regardless of their merit.\nMore Reviews ‘Room’ ‘Bridge of Spies’ ‘The Assassin’ The filmmaker, Cary Joji Fukunaga (“Sin Nombre,” “Jane Eyre” and, on TV, “True Detective”), based his screenplay on a novel by Uzodinma Iweala; he also did the stunning cinematography. In an unnamed African nation a bright, carefree boy, Agu ( Abraham Attah), becomes separated from his family during the chaos of a local rebellion, then falls into the hands of an unnamed rebel commandant who terrorizes him, trains him and turns him into a blindly obedient warrior. The commandant, played with chilling self-enchantment by Idris Elba, is a monster alongside whom Fagin might seem a saint. (In a recognizable reference to “Oliver Twist,” poor starving Agu asks his new captors, “Please, can I have some of that food?”) This is a harrowing film to watch. In spite of the vibrant jungle greens and the searing sun, it’s as bleak a vision of modern warfare as has ever been put on screen.\nRewind DVD // Streaming // Download ‘Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom’ (2013) A long walk indeed, and sometimes a pedestrian one, that devotes 141 minutes to a survey of Nelson Mandela’s whole life. But the big attraction of this respectful biopic, or tribute reel, is the superb performance by Idris Elba in the title role. At almost 6 feet 3 inches, he’s too big for physical similitude, but big enough in dramatic presence to measure up to his character’s courage and moral stature.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL087_REWIND_DV_20151015134930.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL087_REWIND_JV_20151015134930.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:37:14.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
