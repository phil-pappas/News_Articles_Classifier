Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Labor MPs approved changes to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement designed to safeguard Australian jobs after a robust debate that included several MPs who said the changes were not rigorous enough.\nOpposition spokesman on trade Penny Wong, who must now begin formal negotiations with Trade Minister Andrew Robb, prevailed in securing caucus support on Tuesday morning to make three non-discriminatory changes to the Migration Act that would not affect the terms of the agreement nor specifically mention China.\nBut the terms are weaker than Labor and the unions first proposed and will not require the Chinese to test the local jobs market first before bringing in skilled workers like electricians.\nThe first change requires local labour market testing before low-skilled Chinese workers could be brought in on 457 visas for projects worth $150 million or more.\nThe second requests the base rate of pay for 457 visa workers, which the Abbott government frozen be increased from about $54,000 a year to $57,000 and indexed thereafter.\nThe third requires that skilled workers brought in under 457 visas have their skills certified as a condition of obtaining a visa.\nThe FTA allows skilled workers such as nurses, engineers, electricians, plumbers, welders and carpenters.to be brought it without labour market testing.\nSenator Wong explained that for Labor to insist on this being changed would be to change the text of the agreement, which Labor has said it cannot do. The government says the Chinese will walk away from the deal if the actual substance is changed.\n For the same reason, Labor abandoned an initial demand that the FTA be stripped of the Investor-State Dispute Settlement mechanism, which would enable a Chinese company legal recourse against a policy decision by an Australian or state government should it feel it contravened the agreement.\nThe dumping of this and labour market testing for skilled workers was the main cause of dissent in caucus.\nThe changes to the Migration Act would be non-discriminatory in that they would make no specific mention of China or the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\nThe safeguards would, in effect, apply generally to all future trade agreements so as not to offend China. They would require no change to the agreement itself.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday senior government sources saying they could live with the Migration Act amendment proposed Labor because the government believes it would only enforce a commitment the government has already made, would not be a concession to Labor, and would not alter the agreement.\nWith the agreement not due for Senate debate until November 9, Senator Wong and Mr Robb, who have had several informal discussions, must bit come to a formal agreement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:09:52.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
