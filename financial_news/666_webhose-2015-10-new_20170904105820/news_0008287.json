Massachusetts Commissioner of Revenue , and summarily vacated the decision issued January 28, 2015, by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. The case has been remanded to the Supreme Judicial Court for further consideration in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision earlier this year in Comptroller of Treasury of Md. v. Wynne, 576 U. S. ____ (2015). \nThe U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Wynne held that Maryland’s personal income tax scheme (which allowed a credit against the state tax, but not the local tax, for taxes paid to another state) violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. In Wynne , the Court held in a 5-4 decision that the Dormant Commerce Clause precluded Maryland from imposing a tax that discriminates against interstate commerce by favoring intrastate over interstate economic activity, or that might lead to double-taxation of out-of-state income. The Supreme Court’s decision affirmed the use of the internal consistency test as the measuring stick for Dormant Commerce Clause violations resulting in double-taxation. \nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (“SJC”) is now tasked with applying the internal consistency test to First Marblehead’s facts. First Marblehead involves Massachusetts’ rules for the sourcing of loans by financial institutions for property factor purposes. For property factor purposes, Massachusetts sources loans of financial institutions to the regular place of business of the financial institution where the preponderance of substantive contact with respect to the loan occur. The location where the preponderance of substantive contacts with respect to a loan occur is determined based on the location of five factors, referred to as the SINAA factors (solicitation, investigation, negotiation, approval and administration). However, in First Marblehead , the taxpayer purchased loans originated by third-party banks and contracted with an unaffiliated servicing company to handle administration of the loans. Based on these facts, the Massachusetts Appellate Tax Board (“ATB”) found that the taxpayer had no SINAA factors, and sourced all of the taxpayer’s loans to its commercial domicile in Massachusetts. \nIn its vacated decision, the SJC affirmed the ATB’s holding, which resulted in a 100% Massachusetts property factor for the taxpayer. It is that result that now must be scrutinized by the SJC under the internal consistency test. \n© \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email… * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website \nIf you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at info@jdsupra.com \nExcept as otherwise described in this privacy statement, JD Supra will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of JD Supra, users of the Service, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms & \nIn the event there is a change in the corporate structure of JD Supra such as, but not limited to, merger, consolidation, sale, liquidation or transfer of substantial \nIf you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, your dealings with this Web site, or if you would like to change any of the information you have provided to us, please contact us at: info@jdsupra.com * With LinkedIn, you don't need to create a separate login to manage your free JD Supra account, and we can make suggestions based on your needs and interests.
