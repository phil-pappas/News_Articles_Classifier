He said that change would come \"as soon as possible.\"\nHe said the company would extend its low-cost manufacturing techniques and reduce spending on investments.\nThe company also plans to turn the next version of its large Phaeton luxury sedan into an electric-only vehicle to demonstrate the company's technological competence.\nVolkswagen AG, which has other brands including Audi and Skoda, is facing a crisis after U.S. authorities said it evaded emissions checks on 482,000 vehicles. The company has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to cover the costs of recalls and fines. But analysts say the costs in terms of fines and lost sales will likely be considerably higher.\nEarlier, the governor of Germany's Lower Saxony state, which holds a minority stake in Volkswagen, said the automaker should have admitted earlier that it manipulated emissions data in diesel vehicles.\nVW acknowledged the deception to U.S. regulators on Sept. 3, more than a year after researchers published a study showing the real-world emissions of two VW models were far higher than allowed.\nGovernor Stephan Weil told Lower Saxony's state legislature on Tuesday that \"this confession should clearly have come a great deal earlier - another serious mistake,\" news agency dpa reported.\nLower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake and Weil sits on Volkswagen's board of directors. He has said that the state's representatives were \"completely surprised\" by the emissions scandal and vowed to work to protect jobs.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:08:21.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
