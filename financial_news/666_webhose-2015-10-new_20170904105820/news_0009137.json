REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - RTX1Q3FS (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, has launched a service to help companies analyze their data and a briefcase-like product that will let them ship large amounts of data for storage on the cloud.\nThe company said on Wednesday the data analytics service, called QuickSight, is fast and easy to use by non-technical staff who want to share the analyzed data.\nThe service is now available for preview, Andy Jassy, AWS's senior vice president, said at an AWS event in Las Vegas.\nQuickSight users can share the data live as well as by screenshot, the company said.\nFor a standard edition of QuickSight, a customer will be charged $12 per month with no usage commitment, or $9 per month with a one-year commitment.\nFor the enterprise edition, the charge is $24 per month with no usage commitment and $18 per month with a one-year commitment.\nThe shippable storage product, Snowball, is designed to let companies move huge amounts of data to the AWS cloud without having to spend a lot of time and bandwidth to transfer it over the Internet.\nThe container weighs 47 lbs (21.3 kg) and can hold 50 terabytes of data. It has 110 Volt power, a 10 GB network connection. Several can run in parallel.\nUsers will be charged $200 per job in addition to shipping charges, based on the destination and shipment method.\nUsers will have 10 days to upload their data and ship it, after which they will be charged $15 for each extra day.\nAmazon shares were down 0.7 percent at $534 in early afternoon trading.\n\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy and Devika Krishna Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Ted Kerr)\nAmazon Web Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:16:10.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
