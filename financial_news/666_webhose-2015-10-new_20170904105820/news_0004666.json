Sean Davey Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Treasury secretary John Fraser has issued a bleak outlook for the domestic and global economy and warned that $57 trillion of world-wide debt is reminder of the urgent need to fix Australia's entrenched budget deficit.\nLamenting a $25 trillion surge in global debt since 2007, Mr Fraser told a parliamentary estimates hearing on Wednesday that the build-up is a \"major risk to the global outlook\".\nWarning that Australia's weak wages growth and fluctuations on commodity prices would weight on the budget, Mr Fraser said repairing Australia's fiscal position \"is an immediate priority.\n\"We need to address Australia's structural budget problem through greater expenditure restraint,\" Mr Fraser told a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Wednesday.\nHe said Treasury's main focus was ensuring that the economy continues to expand, and highlighted the significance of the recent Harper competition review.\n\"One of the key messages from the Harper is to explore at all levels of government about the delivery of health and education services.\n\"Many would recognise... there's always room for improvement in these major areas of spending.\"\n'There's progress' In a thinly-veiled endorsement of the Coalition's move to install Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister, Mr Fraser lauded the recent escalation in the focus on economic, financial and tax reform.\nCiting Tuesday's release of the government's response to the Financial System Inquiry, Mr Fraser said: \"It's good there's been progress.\n\"I'm delighted, as I think most people are, that Harper is very much back on the table,\" he told the committee when asked whether he was \"happy with the pace of reform.\"\n\"I think the tax reform discussion, whatever you want to call it, has been moving in a very intelligent direction with all parties airing options.\n\"Yeah, I think there's progress.\"\nSuper system a 'little strange' On superannuation, Mr Fraser said that 16 years after its introduction there were many parts of the superannuation system that are worth revisiting, given a number of \"issues which on the face of it may look a little strange.\"\n\"The prime minister has indicated, the Treasurer has indicated, that many things are back on the table.\n\"There were a lot of unintended consequences and things we didn't think of back in 1990s,\" Mr Fraser said. \"And the government and community have recognised there ares that need to be looked at.\"\nHe made the remarks after being asked about reports there are 475 superannuation accounts, with balances of more than $10 million and receiving $1.5 million in annual tax free income.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:06:14.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
