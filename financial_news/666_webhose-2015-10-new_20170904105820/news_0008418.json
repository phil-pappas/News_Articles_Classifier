They provide high interest, short-term loans to consumers who don’t qualify for loans from banks. Unable to repay the loans in time, many borrowers fall into cycles of debt, critics say. \nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is looking to crack down on the industry, but some Republicans have tried to block those efforts. They argue that payday lenders provide much-needed cash to struggling families who can’t find loans elsewhere. This money is often used to pay bills, they say. \nThe report contends that certain Republicans who voted to protect payday lenders received significant campaign contributions from the industry, though it does not allege any violation of the law or campaign finance rules. \nAmong lawmakers receiving the contributions included House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) and former committee Chairman Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.). \nThe House Financial Services Committee oversees payday lenders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:52:17.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
