Priceline fell 2.4 percent to $1,312.\nTripAdvisor users will be able to book accommodation from Priceline’s Booking.com website directly through TripAdvisor, the Needham, Massachusetts-based company said in a statement. TripAdvisor, which didn’t disclose terms of the deal, said it could eventually get access to Priceline’s other websites.\nThe deal pulls TripAdvisor closer to the world’s largest online travel-booking company. Priceline, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, had gross bookings worth $50.3 billion last year through its sites, which include Kayak, OpenTable and Agoda.com.", "external_links": ["http://www.pricelinegroup.com/\\"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:15:00.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
