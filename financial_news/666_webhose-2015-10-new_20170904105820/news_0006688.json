Brazil's oil company association, the IBP, also blames growing government control of the industry.\nChambriard, speaking to reporters in Rio de Janeiro, said she expects Brazil to import 400,000 barrels a day of vehicle fuels, primarily gasoline, in 10 years. Projected imports of gasoline and diesel are more than double the 176,879 barrels that Brazil imported daily during the first nine months of 2015, according to ANP data.\nDespite declining fuel demand, spurred by Brazil's economy facing its worst recession since the 1990s, Petrobras' 14 Brazilian refineries cannot meet all the country's needs.\nChambriard also said the ANP is studying a plan to renew some oil-rights concessions granted to Petroleo Brasileiro SA , as Petrobras is formally known, early. The concessions, granted in the so-called \"Round Zero\" to Petrobras involved some of the company's most important fields.\nThe areas represented concessions Petrobras was allowed to keep after Brazil's government ended the company's monopoly on Brazilian exploration and production in 1997.
