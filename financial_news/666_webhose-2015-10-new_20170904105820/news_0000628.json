The union could tell its 52,700 GM members to walk off their jobs at that time. However, if the union's negotiators believe there is progress toward an agreement, the deadline can be postponed.\nGM and the union have been in talks since July and have for the last several days intensified negotiations to reach a deal. The UAW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have a new contract that goes into effect on Monday, while Ford Motor Co has yet to enter intensified talks with the union.\nIn a statement, GM responded: \"We are working with them to address the issues and remain committed to obtaining an agreement that is good for employees and the business.\"\nIn several concessionary contracts with the UAW since 2007, GM has lowered its average labor costs to about $55 per hour from about $75. GM executives, including Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens, have recently said the company must keep labor costs in the UAW contract at a point where they do not threaten GM's double-digit North American profit margins achieved this year.\nThe UAW has said often \"this is our time\" to receive remuneration from concessions in 2007 and 2009 that helped GM to survive a bankruptcy in a government-sponsored bailout.\nHowever, GM executives have made clear that its continued health largely depends on its ability to keep labor costs competitive with foreign-owned companies with U.S. plants. The rivals have erodoed the No. 1 U.S. automaker's market share for decades.\nAverage U.S. labor costs for Toyota Motor Co are about $48 per hour, and those of Nissan Motor Co are $42, according to estimates by the Center for Automotive Research.
