That hope was dashed by delays around the negotiating table, however. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the pact is unlikely to come before Congress for an up-or-down vote until well into the Presidential primaries, exposing it to the full rhetoric of the campaign season. \nMany of Mr Obama's fellow Democrats in Congress and organised labour fear the trade pact will hurt American jobs. \nSenator Bernie Sanders, an independent seeking the Democratic nomination for President, blasted the agreement, saying: \"Wall Street and other big corporations have won again.\" \nMonths are likely to go by as the TPP package is finalised, reviewed and debated by Congress. Under \"fast-track\" authority granted by Congress, lawmakers have the power to review the agreement and cast an up-or-down vote, but not amend it. \nRepresentative Sandy Levin, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee that also oversees trade, warned that a 90-day review period could result in adjustments. \nMr Levin applauded the pact for making progress on worker rights issues in Vietnam and Malaysia and on tobacco issues. He added, however, that Mexico must do more to comply with an existing free-trade deal with the US. \nThe Obama administration is hoping a well-coordinated campaign over the next several months will convince lawmakers that the free-trade deal will have more benefits than costs. \nRepublican Representative Kevin Brady, a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement: \"Done right, this agreement will open 1bn middle class customers to American goods and services (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:26:35.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
