Chris Hawley Architect & Co. of Fargo has prepared one-story and two-story designs for consideration at a public meeting Dec. 1 at the Capitol. \nLawmakers earlier this year authorized $4 million from the state’s Capitol Building Fund and $1 million from private donations to build the new residence, presumably on the site of the existing home. \nAn additional $50,000 in state money had been set aside to provide for temporary housing expenses for the governor and his wife during demolition and construction, but that money now will not be needed, state facilities management director John Boyle said. \nConstruction won’t begin until at least $500,000 in donations is collected. A fundraising group expects to roll out a website and announce multiple large donations in coming weeks. \nFunds are being raised by a task force appointed by the Capitol Grounds Planning Commission and the nonprofit Friends of the Residence group that was formed in the 1980s to address renovations to the governor’s residence. \n“We hope to have the first $500,000, hopefully, by the end of the year,” co-chairman Jim Poolman said. \nThe current 10,000-square-foot residence was completed in 1960 and is in need of repairs in excess of $2.8 million. Security concerns and handicap accessibility are cited as major concerns. \nGov. Jack Dalrymple is the state’s eighth chief executive to reside in the current dwelling. He is not running for re-election. \nThe home is the second official governor’s residence. The original Governor’s Mansion, built in 1884, is a few blocks south of the Capitol.
