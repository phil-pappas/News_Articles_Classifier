Maintaining a healthy work-life balance can be super-tough in today's \"always connected\" work environment, but some jobs allow for more flexibility than others. \nUnfortunately, average work-life balance satisfaction ratings have been on the decline for several years, according to Glassdoor, a Web site for job seekers that shares employee-written company reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports and interview questions. On average, employees have rated work-life balance a 3.2 this year, down from 3.4 in 2012 and 3.5 in 2009, according to Glassdoor's 5-point rating system. \nGlassdoor's latest report identifies the 25 best jobs for work-life balance by culling employee reviews from its Web site on employee work-life balance satisfaction.

For example, the No. 1 job on our list, data scientist, boasts flexibility and the ability to work from home or come into the office later to accommodate schedules. Plus, the high-demand for data scientists gives job candidates more weight in negotiating their schedules.\" \nIronically some of the most demanding jobs currently also boast strong work-life balance, particularly in the tech industry. \n\"Tech companies are known for their generosity in offering their employees flexible work schedules and the ability to schedule their own hours,\" Dobroski wrote. \"In addition, tech companies also grant perks such as on-site gyms and unlimited vacation policies that make it easy for employees to prioritize healthy lifestyles and make room for personal time.\" \nJob titles considered in the report must have at least 75 \"work-life balance\" ratings shared by U.S.-based employees over 12 months through September 30. The jobs must also include the term as one benefit to the job for at least 15% of its reviews on Glassdoor.com. Each job title must also have at least 200 job openings on Glassdoor's site to be considered for this report. \nCheck out which professions were ranked highest for work-life balance. \n10.
