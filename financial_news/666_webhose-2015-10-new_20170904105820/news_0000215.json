Antrix, with the support of Department of Space, is preparing to file in court its application for remedy,\" the space agency said in a statement here.   The Netherlands-based International Criminal Court (ICC) tribunal recently awarded $672-million (Rs.4,434 crore) damages to Antrix Corporation for scrapping the $300-million deal with the city-based Devas Multimedia Ltd.   Ruling in favour of the company in the controversial case, the court found Antrix liable for unlawfully terminating the agreement in 2011, Devas said in a statement here.   The then UPA government cancelled the controversial Devas-Antrix contract in February 2011, invoking sovereignty and decided to use the advanced satellite (GSAT-6) for the country's strategic use.   Under the annulled deal, Antrix was to lease transponders of the satellite to Devas for allowing it to offer digital multimedia services using the S-band wavelength (spectrum), reserved for strategic purpose.   The space agency, however, launched the controversial satellite (GSAT-6) on August 27 from its spaceport at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh, about 90 km north of Chennai, as a communication satellite, using a heavy rocket.
