It will work with Westinghouse to train staff on how to maintain nuclear plants.\n\"The amount of nuclear power plants being built in Asia is quite substantial so there is obviously an after sales opportunity in the maintenance of those plants,\" Mr Chilcote said.\nSimilar tie-ups were inked with Saab Australia and alloy products manufacturer Teralba Industries.\nPublic perception still an issue Nuclear power made \"a lot of sense\" for Australia, Mr Chilcote added. \"Look at what brown coal and the associated emissions are doing on the environment. There's a lot less waste out of nuclear, the hardest part is overcoming the public perception.\"\nThe option of nuclear power for Australia is being examined within a South Australian royal commission, with findings due next year. Meanwhile, the federal government's greenhouse gas reduction targets, of 26 to 28 per cent cuts from 2005 levels by 2030, and the anticipated retirement of ageing coal-fired generators have also set the scene for discussion.\n\"In the next decade you have several very large coal plants that are going to need to be retired, and you're going to have to choose to build something to replace those,\" Mr Roderick said.\n\"If you're going to talk about carbon reduction and greenhouse gas reductions you're going to have to bring nuclear into the mix.\"\nMr Roderick's discussions this week included federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt, Port Adelaide member Mark Butler and senior officials from the offices of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Resources Minister Josh Frydenberg.\nHe has been pointing out that Westinghouse's AP1000 nuclear plant uses \"passive\" technology that doesn't require electricity to be able to safely shut itself down, averting a Fukushima-like situation. This type of plant is under construction in the US and is set to be used in the UK, China and India.\nMr Roderick said that more than 70 per cent of a new plant could be constructed using Australian commodities and suppliers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:26:12.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
