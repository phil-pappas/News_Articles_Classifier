Previously the problem was limited mainly to older vehicles and front air bags. Eight people have been killed worldwide because of the faulty inflators and more than 100 have been hurt.\nThe latest recall covers certain 2015 Chevrolet Equinox, Malibu and Camaro vehicles as well as the Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS and GMC Terrain.\nConsumer Discretionary vehicles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:06:34.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
