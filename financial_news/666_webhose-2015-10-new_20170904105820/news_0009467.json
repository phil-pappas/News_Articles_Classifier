Then the PF government taxes and gets half the allowance amount for each soldier. But this time they have gotten all the money from each soldier and their salaries for September have not been paid. It looks like the PF government are taking advantage because these government employees are not unionised and cannot go on strike action as they can just command them into submission\", sources have disclosed. Zambia \nPresident Edgar Lungu has arrived back in the country to face up to the challenging times being experienced. see more » Copyright © 2015 Zambian Watchdog. All rights reserved.
