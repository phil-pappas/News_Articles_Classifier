Alcoa AA, +9.35% has tried to deal with a downturn in commodities markets by cutting production capacity , but analysts have continued to slash estimates during the quarter.\nFactSet Alcoa’s stock and aluminum prices moving in sync Last week, Alcoa said it would separate into two publicly traded companies in the second-half of 2016, becoming the latest commodities-based company looking focus more narrowly on its more profitable businesses.\nThere is some hope for an upbeat outlook, however, as aluminum prices have held above the August lows. The company also announced a new supply deal with Ford Motor Inc. on Sept. 15 and, on Monday, a $1 billion deal to provide Airbus Group SE AIR, +3.62% with aerospace fastening systems.\nHere are some things to watch for:\nEarnings : Alcoa is expected to report earnings per share of 14 cents, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet. That is less than half the earnings per share of 31 cents in the same period a year ago, and down from FactSet’s consensus estimate of 21 cents as of June 30.\nAlcoa had missed earnings expectations in the second quarter, after beating forecasts for the previous five quarters, and for 12 of the previous 13 quarters.\nRevenue : The FactSet revenue consensus is $5.68 billion, down from $6.24 billion a year ago, and from an estimate of $5.88 billion on June 30.\nThe company beat revenue expectations in the second quarter, after missing in the first quarter.\nStock price : Alcoa’s stock slid 13% during the third quarter, to suffer a fourth-straight quarterly decline, but it could have been a lot worse.\nThe stock had closed at $8.11 on Aug. 25, the lowest level since Oct. 9, 2013, and down 27% since June 30. But it ended the quarter at $9.66, up 19% from its August low.\nOn Monday, the stock soared 9.1% in afternoon trading in the wake of the Airbus news, putting it on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain in four years. It was still down 34% year to date, while the S&P 500 index had slipped 3.5%.\nWall Street analysts are mostly positive on the stock, as the average rating is the equivalent of overweight, according to FactSet. The average stock price target is $12.86, which is 24% above current levels.\nOther issues : Investors should keep an eye on Alcoa’s estimate for global aluminum demand growth, since the prices of aluminum and Alcoa’s stock tend to move together. The company in July had projected global demand to increased 6.5%.\nAluminum prices fell sharply during the third quarter, with cash prices closing at $1,562 a ton on Sept. 30, according to FactSet, down 5.1% during the quarter and 15% on the year. However, prices ended September up 5.2% from the August low.\nAnalyst Josh Sullivan at Sterne Agee CRT said that while Alcoa’s value-added businesses gained ground in the aerospace and automotive markets during the third quarter, declines in premiums and alumina pricing keeps him cautious on the company, and prompted him to cut his 2015 EPS estimate to 71 cents from 83 cents and his 2016 outlook to 72 cents from 90 cents.\n“While we believe the split will ultimately be positive for [Alcoa] shareholders, we need to gain comfort with the capital structure and state of the upstream portfolio before getting off the sidelines,” Sullivan wrote in a note to clients. The upstream businesses include the bauxite-mining, alumina-refining and aluminum-production businesses.\n ", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/boqSavBCsZL"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:09:54.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
