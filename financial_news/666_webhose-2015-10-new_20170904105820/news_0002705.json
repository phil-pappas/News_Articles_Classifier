The data are not publicly available but Barclays accounts for about 10 percent of the business, industry sources estimated. \nThe sources also estimated British banks account for about 40 percent of Visa Europe's card payments, so could be in line to receive about $8 billion, or more than 5 billion pounds. Much of the remaining activity is in France, Spain and Italy. \nThat could see major banks including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Santander and BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) in line for hundreds of millions of euros each, sources said. \nVisa Inc. wants to re-unite with the European arm to give it more global scale to compete with arch-rival MasterCard. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said in July it was in talks to unite with Visa Europe and wanted to conclude talks on a deal by the end of October. \nVisa Europe declined to comment and Visa Inc. could not immediately be reached.
