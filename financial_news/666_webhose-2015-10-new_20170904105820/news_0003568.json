Expectations for an extension of the ECB's trillion euro stimulus programme have grown in the past month.\nWhile loose monetary policy is usually supportive for bond prices, benchmark Bund yields have broken below 0.50 percent only once since June - for a few hours last week.\nMany in the bond market are wary after making losses on a rapid bounce in Bund yields from near-zero levels in May, a move that coincided with a brief uptick in inflation.\nWhen yields are so low, an increase of just a few basis points can cause major losses for investors as they lose the protection of coupon payments, which are close to zero as well.\nAs a result, instead of joining the rally in shares -- as they had done in the past when reacting to signs of more central bank stimulus -- bonds have been ditched in recent weeks during periods of higher risk appetite.\n\"Many are reluctant to buy German 10-year bonds at levels close to 50 basis points,\" said Jan von Gerich, chief strategist at Nordea. \"Still, as the ECB minutes yesterday reminded us, the central bank remains tilted towards further easing measures, which leaves bond yields with more downside potential.\"\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were up 2 basis points at 0.61 percent, a 10 basis point rise in a week in which below-forecast economic data strengthened the case for further monetary policy measures.\nStock markets were up across Europe, reflecting the increased risk appetite.
