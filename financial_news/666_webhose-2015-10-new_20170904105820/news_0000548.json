Erin Jonasson Share on twitter by Misa Han Australian in-house lawyer salaries are lagging behind their US and Asian counterparts, following the wider slump in salaries across the legal industry.\nNearly 40 per cent of in-house counsel in Australian and New Zealand earn less than $110,000 a year in base salary, according to an Association of Corporate Counsel survey of over 5000 in-house lawyers in 73 countries. Fewer than 15 per cent of in-house Australian and New Zealand lawyers earn more than $550,000.\nIn comparison, more than half of in-house counsels in the US earn between $110,000 and $220,000.\nOn top of lagging salaries, in-house lawyers in Australia are facing few prospects of career progression compared to their global colleagues. Only 29 per cent of Australian lawyers said they expect a promotion, which puts them significantly behind China (65 per cent), Singapore (60 per cent), Brazil (59 per cent) and the United Arab Emirates (58 per cent).\nACC's Tanya Khan said the results reflected the challenging market conditions for in-house counsel.\n\"Market conditions mean in-house counsel are constantly being asked to do more with less, creating an ongoing challenge for the profession,\" she said.\nBut legal recruiter Mahlab managing director Lisa Gazis said most in-house lawyers earn between $100,000 and $200,000, including superannuation, and experienced 3 per cent growth consistent with inflation. She remained positive on the salary outlook.\n\"No, I don't think there would be a slump. There is a better chance of improvement because they are getting bonuses – 55 per cent of in-house lawyers received bonuses – and hiring activity has been on the rise for lawyers with three to eight years' experience,\" she said.\n It's not all bad news for Australian lawyers. The report found that while Australian in-house lawyers were likely to be paid less with fewer promotion prospects, they were more likely to enjoy work-life balance. Australian lawyers on average worked 47 hours a week, compared to 50 hours in the US, 51 hours in Hong Kong and 52 in Singapore.\nThe comparatively low salary and shorter working hours could be due to Australian in-house counsel being less involved in cross-border work. Only 57 per cent of Australian and Kiwi in-house counsel said they had responsibilities for multinational work, compared to 86 per cent of lawyers in Europe and 82 per cent in the rest of the Asia Pacific region.\nEarlier this year, The Australian Financial Review reported that the million-dollar lawyer is a dying breed. A report from Mahlab revealed that equity partner salaries at large firms dived by a third in the past three years , from $1.2 million to around $750,000.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:08:30.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
