Photo: Virginia Starr\nTax shelters enjoyed by the rich need to be closed before any changes are made to the GST, and only then should Australia begin a discussion about a higher rate and broader base, a new paper from the Australian Council of Social Service says.\nFor the first time, the social services group has indicated it's open to a GST debate, but only as a last resort.\nLess than one in five people over 64 years pays income tax, due in large part to poorly designed superannuation tax concessions.\nACOSS submission to the federation review The cost of services should not be shifted to consumers, but rather raised through the tax system, its submission to the government's federation review argued.\nAll regions, including those led by Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr, would get more money under a model proposed by the Australian Council of Social Service. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe Turnbull government needed to eradicate income tax shelters that \"are no longer fit for purpose and disproportionately benefit higher income households\".\nAdvertisement These included superannuation tax breaks in the retirement phase, capital gains tax breaks, negative gearing and private trusts and companies.\n\"All options to strengthen the tax system should be on the table but we should not start the conversation with a higher GST,\" ACOSS chief exceutive Cassandra Goldie said.\n\"This is one of the last options that should be considered to provide the increased revenue governments will need.\"\nEradicate tax shelters Several changes could be made to end tax shelters.\nFirst, the government could extend the 15 per cent tax rate for superannuation fund earnings to accounts in the \"retirement phase\" which were currently exempt from tax. This would be offset by a 15 per cent rebate for individuals below the tax-free threshold of $18,200.\nIt could also broaden the \"base\" of the Medicare levy by closing a range of tax shelters and loopholes available for higher income earners to reduce their exposure to the levy.\nRather than increasing the rate, the levy would be extended to tax-sheltered income such as capital gains, wages offset by deductions for negatively geared property investments, and income diverted into private trusts and companies.\nThe paper also said deductions for negatively geared investments in property and shares should be replaced \"with a more efficient and less costly tax incentive for affordable rental housing\" and the government should remove tax advantages associated with diverting personal income into private trusts and companies.\nRich retirees pay, poor retirees gain As the recent financial system inquiry headed by David Murray has suggested, there's scope to examine superannuation concessions that benefit wealthy retirees .\n\"Currently, less than one in five people over 64 years pays income tax, due in large part to poorly designed superannuation tax concessions and tax offsets for seniors,\" the ACOSS paper said.\nRevenue increases to help finance essential services, such as healthcare, should be linked legislatively with \"community service guarantees\" – which would apply in areas of shared responsibility and be legislated – to ensure affordable access for essential services. These guarantees would replace major grants to the states.\n\"One option is to earmark tax revenues to expenditure in community services,\" the paper said.\n\"For example, revenue from the Medicare levy, together with revenues from the reforms to the tax treatment of superannuation for people over 55 years old, would be earmarked to future healthcare and NDIS services. This ensures a good fit between future growth in spending and revenues as the population ages.\"\nBroader tax bases need not come from GST To ensure there was a broader tax base, the paper suggested making owner-occupiers pay land tax.\nThis could replace state-based stamp duties on property transactions.\nThere could also be a broadening of the base of payroll tax by replacing inefficient state taxes such as insurance taxes with more efficient ones.\nThe GST exemption for fresh food was important and needed to be retained. The bottom 20 per cent of income earners spent 19 per cent of their income on food, compared with 15 per cent for the top 20 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:00:25.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
