Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Macquarie Bank has poured cold water on the idea of a soft landing in the housing market , warning that an oversupply of apartments and slower-than-expected population growth will cut prices by as much as 7.5 per cent over the next two years.\nPopulation growth that is at its slowest in nine years and is likely to moderate further, the bank says. This will only worsen a supply and demand gap already being influenced by record levels of housing approvals and starts, which will lead to a sharp correction, Macquarie Wealth Management said in a report titled Aussie Macro Outlook: Population & Housing - Perishable .\nHousing starts, which topped 200,000 for the first time in the year to March , will also take a tumble, falling to 161,000 this year and then to 150,000 in the year to June 2017, with the biggest adjustment coming in the middle-density, investor-driven sector of the market, the report says.\n\"The combination of strong supply and weak population growth means that the housing market has a period of adjustment ahead of it,\" the note said. \"The extent of house price adjustment is contingent upon the pace of retrenchment in the supply of new housing into the market.\"\nThe adjustment could even be longer: A lack of buffers like public spending and tax cuts will make this adjustment harder, Macquarie warns. Robert Shakespeare The true picture may be even worse, without the buffers that have been around during other times of correction, such as rising debt-to-income ratios, fiscal expansion and/or tax cuts, boosts in participation (meaning more people joining the workforce) or major income boost (such as through rising commodity prices), the report says.\n\"The absence of factors that supported previous adjustments also suggests that the adjustment phase to the current episode may be longer, slower and more prone to shock than prior instances,\" it said. \"Additionally, more may be required of prices, construction and rates to drive normalisation.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-10-12T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:10:16.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
