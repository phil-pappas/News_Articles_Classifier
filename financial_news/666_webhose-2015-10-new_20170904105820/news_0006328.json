James Davies by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald The Northern Territory government is expected to announce a preferred bidder for the Port of Darwin's 99-year lease as early as Tuesday, sources told Street Talk on Monday night.\nIt's understood private Chinese group Landbridge (perhaps best known in Australia for last year's $178 million takeover of Queensland coal-seam gas play WestSide Corp) is the frontrunner.\nSources close to the process said negotiations had dragged on while the NT government worked through a number of highly contentious issues around foreign ownership. Sensitivities are heightened by military interests in the port.\nIt will be interesting to see whether Landbridge has any equity partners, including Australian superannuation funds, in its bid.\nForeign ownership was carefully considered as part of a NT parliamentary inquiry into the long-term lease.\nThe committee recommended that a component of the lease be retained by an Australian entity and the sale advisers consult with the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Department of Defence during the sale. The recommendation was adopted by the NT parliament.\nStreet Talk revealed Landbridge's involvement in the Port of Darwin auction late last month.\nLandbridge has been competing against JPMorgan-advised Port of Brisbane and a Macquarie Capital-advised grouping of Colonial First State and Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management.\n Melbourne's Flagstaff Partners is selling the lease for the Port of Darwin on behalf of the NT government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:41.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
