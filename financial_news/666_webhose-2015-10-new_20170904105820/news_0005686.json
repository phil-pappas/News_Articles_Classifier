Brookville,   Long Island Arts Alliance and Bank of America are proud to announce Arts Alive LI 2015 – a unique collaborative initiative that aligns with regional priorities to help Long Island become culturally and economically richer, a more vibrant, diverse, and inclusive place where people want to live, work and visit. Kicking off on October 1, 2015 and running through October 31, 2015, this month-long celebration of cultural events showcases Long Island’s best arts and cultural attractions featuring live music, performing arts, exhibitions, parades, festivals, and more, during the National Arts and Humanities Month of October. Entire communities throughout Long Island play host to Long Island’s rich cultural landscape. Also new in 2015 is the Hispanic Heritage cultural resource Latino Arts Alive LI, which can be found at ArtsAliveLI.org . Latino Arts Alive LI was first launched on September 15 in celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month and is the first of several planned heritage resources for the site. “Arts Alive LI is specifically tailored to promote and market Long Island’s premier stages, foremost art venues , cultural sites and communities in order to grow new audiences, increase cultural tourism to the region and support economic growth,” said Theresa Statz-Smith, Executive Director, Long Island Arts Alliance. “We hope Arts Alive LI is an example of how to organize and mobilize the region’s arts and cultural assets in order to revitalize our communities and energize our downtowns. With nearly 75 venues participating, Long Islanders, visitors and tourists can discover world class arts and culture in our beautiful island setting of beaches, vineyards and communities with their families, friends and neighbors.” “Bank of America is a long-time, ardent supporter of the Long Island community. We're invested in the places where we live and work, which is just one reason we are proud to present Arts Alive LI,” said Bob Isaksen, Long Island President, Bank of America. “The Long Island arts and cultural industry is a vital economic engine, providing skilled and high-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced, while attracting increased tourism to the area – all designed to boost the local economy and showcase Long Island as a wonderful place to live, work and play.” Arts Alive LI 2015 is presented by the Long Island Arts Alliance and Bank of America with additional support from MSC Direct, Bloomingdale’s and by a grant awarded to the Long Island Arts Alliance by New York State's Empire State Development and the I ♥ NY Division of Tourism under Governor Andrew M. Cuomo's Regional Economic Development Council Initiative. Additional partners include Southwest Airlines and WLIW21.
