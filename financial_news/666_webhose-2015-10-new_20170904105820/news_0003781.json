As a South African Communist Party (SACP) stalwart, academic and the holder of a philosophy PhD, his credentials were impeccable.\nA month after his appointment Mr Nzimande made pronouncements about ushering in an era of renewal and said it was \"imperative that poor students should not be denied the opportunity to quality higher education\".\nBut as students have risen up to collect their dues, the minister has been ill-prepared in responding to their demands and he was humiliated yesterday as they booed and jeered him in Cape Town.\nThe student uprising has also raised an existential question about Mr Nzimande: whose minister is he any way? The SACP views him as its deployee in government, while he has been on the fringes of the Cabinet. His star has waned from the heady post-Polokwane days when he was seen as part of President Jacob Zuma’s inner circle.\nThere is now talk in ANC circles that Mr Nzimande’s mishandling of the protests has left some in the party unhappy. The ANC is holding a briefing later today about the outcomes of discussions with youth and student leaders.\nThe ANC Youth League has already laid the blame for the crisis squarely at the minister’s feet, while left-leaning alliance partners have issued a flurry of statements backing Mr Nzimande.\nYouth league general secretary Njabulo Nzuza said it was unhappy that Mr Nzimande had not made any progress in providing free education, and will be meeting the Progressive Youth Alliance today to deal with the minister’s \"failings\".\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) yesterday condemned the \"opportunistic attacks\" directed at the minister.\n\"The responsibility of delivering free education ... cannot be left at the door of one individual, who is subject to the decisions of both the Treasury and the Cabinet,\" said Cosatu spokesman Sizwe Pamla.\nOpposition parties have called for Mr Nzimande’s removal.\nDemocratic Alliance spokesman on higher education Yusuf Cassim led a picket outside the department’s headquarters in Pretoria.\nWith Penelope Mashego.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:34:17.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
