Picture: Gregg Porteous\nAnthony Keane SUCCESS with money requires much more than simply earning plenty of it.\nThe biggest earners often waste the biggest sums of money, while people who make their money work as hard as possible often enjoy the best financial results.\nHere are some ways to make your money do some hard labour of its own.\nFIND the best savings accounts\nAVOID LAZY SAVINGS\nCash parked in a transaction account earning next to nothing is the laziest cash. Even 2.5 per cent from a term deposit is better than 0.01 per cent from an everyday account, which is going backwards after inflation.\nShop around for the best savings rates you can find, and be aware that your money might work harder doing something else.\nDEAL WITH DEBT\nPaying down debt is usually that something else. Aim to pay off the highest-interest debt first, because even if it’s only a small debt it packs a nasty punch.\nCredit cards have much higher interest rates than home loans and personal loans and should always be paid off first before other forms of debt. Source: News Limited\nInterest rates on debt are usually much higher than on savings, so consider moving money from savings accounts into debt-reduction options such as mortgage offset accounts, where you can still access your money but get the biggest bang for your buck while it sits there.\n“Get smart with how you repay debt,” says Wise Owl Financial adviser Allan Ward. Balance transfer cards can help if a niggling credit card debt won’t go away. You can get up to 16 months interest free, then switch to a new balance transfer card later if needed, Ward says.\nA SUPER SACRIFICE\nPeter Ziggy, the CEO of wealth creation firm 3P Corporation, says salary sacrifice — where you make deposits into your super fund with your pre-tax wage — is a powerful way to get wealthier.\n“If you are on the 30 per cent tax rate and having money salary sacrificed into super, you are actually saving half that in tax because the tax that is applied is only 15 per cent,” he says.\n“That money then goes into superannuation, which is a very tax-effective environment to be invested in, and long-term your benefit multiplies and multiplies and multiplies.”\nCOMPARE superannuation accounts\nBuilder Alex Ognjenovski invests in property to get his money working for him. Picture: Gregg Porteous Source: News Corp Australia\nWRITE IT DOWN\nWritten goals for savings, budgets and investments give you an end target and help you map out how you want to get there.\n“If you don’t have a target you will hit whatever you shoot at, and that’s pretty much nothing. If you have goals things become a lot more meaningful,” Ziggy says.\n“Putting together your own plan or getting a plan done for you is paramount.”\nZiggy says having a written budget helps you “keep a tab on the stuff that blows out”.\nWard says writing down everything you spend, part of the budgeting process, shows where your spending priorities are and they may surprise you. “I have never had anybody do a budget and come back to me and say it didn’t tell us anything we didn’t know,” he says.\nINVEST NOW\nFinance nerds call compound interest the eighth wonder of the world. It means earning interest on your interest and so on — so $1000 invested today and growing by 7 per cent a year doubles in a decade and quadruples in 20 years. So the sooner you start, the better.\n“Don’t discount he benefits of compounding interest,” Ward says. Long-term money such as superannuation should be heavily invested in growth assets such as shares and property, he says.\n“Ignore the noise of what’s happening in the sharemarket at the moment. Understand that a market downturn is a good time to invest, not a bad time.”\n@anthonykeane\n Make your money work for you ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ebdb92192d21ea83d5d2489218f2d32a", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/superannuation-personal#itm_t=story&itm_l=keane-savings-success", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/savings#itm_t=story&itm_l=keane-being-savings-success", "http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/85eda3cb7649f97c332cd826e6c193a2?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "https://twitter.com/keanemoney", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0ced582e1cd82ea73548ee41da45ddf3", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FUwd3BkdDrmiPJwQo_skoqcg6AWV40rPC%2FMGngRNnbuHoiqTJH4xMDoxOjBtO_wVGe&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-10-07T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:46:21.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
