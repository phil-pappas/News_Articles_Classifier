Information services company Experian declined the most, dropping 4.5 percent and heading for its worst session in 16 months. The company disclosed a data breach that exposed the personal information of some 15 million people who applied for service with T-Mobile US Inc.\n“Undoubtedly a breach of this magnitude is a major setback, especially to a company that takes data security very seriously … Experian’s business is that of handling data, which makes this incident particularly embarrassing,” analysts at Barclays said in a note.\n“T-Mobile is obviously reviewing its relationship with Experian. In itself the loss of one client is fairly immaterial but if it triggers other account reviews, it could become more significant.”\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 5:40 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:42:02.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
