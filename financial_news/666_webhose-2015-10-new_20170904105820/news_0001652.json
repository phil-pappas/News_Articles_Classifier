Bonar 2024s were about 7bp tighter to yield 9.45%. \nBatakis is largely viewed favorably by the market, though some would have preferred Scioli's economic advisor Miguel Bein. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) had a good track record when she was treasury undersecretary for the Province of Buenos Aires, which posted fiscal surpluses in 2013 and 2014, according to Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) analyst Casey Reckman. \n\"She is known to market participants and has been outspoken about the need to resolve the dispute with holdout creditors,\" she said. \nPIPELINE \nPeru (A3/BBB+/BBB+) has appointed BBVA (Amsterdam: BA6.AS - news ) , BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) and JP Morgan (Other OTC: MGHL - news ) to arrange fixed income investor meetings in Europe from October 20 to update on the country's financing program and discuss developments in the economy.
