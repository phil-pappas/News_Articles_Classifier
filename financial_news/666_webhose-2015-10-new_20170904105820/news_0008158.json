Tracking the plunge in energy prices, Cheniere's shares are down by almost half from their peak in 2014.\nOnce Cheniere's first LNG plant starts up, the company will have a new production train starting up every six months until mid-2019, leaving it with seven total lines of gas liquefaction at its Sabine Pass project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and at another terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas.\nThe seven trains will account for almost half of the 65 million tonnes per year (tpy) of LNG export capacity under construction in the United States.\nCheniere has sold most of its 31.5 million tpy of LNG via long-term contracts, with about 4 million tpy remaining for sale in spot markets, Souki said.\nThe company plans to start offering a cargo a month from December, he said, hoping this will improve market liquidity.\nThe company is permitted to build another two trains, but has yet to take investment decisions.\nThe current pricing structure is not a strong argument for building further LNG plants, Souki said, with any projects needing at least $8 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to sell to Europe and $9 per mmBtu to sell to Asia.\n\"I'm pretty sure the market will come back,\" he said, however, adding that Cheniere has applied for permits to build more trains.\n\"You don't make a decision like this based on what's happening in the next six months. You make a decision based on what you think is going to happen over the next 20 years.\"\nFor any trains beyond the seven that have been committed to, Cheniere would not have to sell the gas until 2020-2021, Souki said, giving it time to wait until LNG prices recover.\n(Editing By Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:06:17.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
