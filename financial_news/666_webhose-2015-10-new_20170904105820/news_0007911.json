Is it possible that UBS has a 'rogue' representative in PNG?\"\nThe joint statement is politically significant because, until recently, Mr O'Neill's political position has been seen to be impregnable.\nBut he has come under pressure as the country's fiscal position deteriorates and he has had to battle with cascading corruption investigations.\nThe statement is also significant because Mr Somare, the country's \"founding father\", and Sir Mekere Morauta, who is widely respected for his commitment to probity and fiscal responsibility, have not been known to see eye-to-eye.\nOver the weekend Mr O'Neill defended the UBS-financed investment in \"our country's biggest taxpayer and one of the largest employers\", saying the deal was necessary to clean up \"the mess left behind\" by the previous Somare Government.\nFairfax has sought comment from UBS and Mr O'Neill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:12:58.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
