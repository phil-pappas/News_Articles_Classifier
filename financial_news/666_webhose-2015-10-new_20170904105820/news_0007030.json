Quick work \n“Thanks to their leadership and the quick work of the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, today I am proud to announce that the critical programs for veterans and elderly and disabled Americans, which previously could not give effect to the marriages of couples living in states that did not recognize those marriages, will now provide federal recognition for all marriages nationwide,” she said. \nLynch said that federal benefits \"will be available equally to married couples in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories.\" \n\"The department will continue to work across the administration to fulfill our commitment to equal treatment for all Americans, including equal access to the benefits of marriage that the Obergefell decision guarantees,” she said. \nDespite the Supreme Court decision in Overgefell v. Hodges, some localities have refused to grant same-sex marriage licenses in recent weeks. Late last month, Texas AG Ken Paxton told county clerks that they could deny marriage licenses based on religious beliefs . This led to an ethics complaint being filed against him. \nThe extension of federal benefits is not affected by those disputes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:00:29.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
