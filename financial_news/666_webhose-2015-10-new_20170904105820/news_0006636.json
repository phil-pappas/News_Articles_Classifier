In November, the Government of Rwanda and Ericsson will introduce a Smart Bus Initiative that might get to grips with gridlock elsewhere in Africa. Russell Southwood spoke to Ericsson's Programme Manager, Smart Rwanda, Edgar Kasenene. \nThrough its consultancy arm, Ericsson began last year to work with the Government of Rwanda. Through a joint venture with KT, The Government was rolling out an LTE wholesale network and those involved from Ericsson \"identified huge areas for co-operation around the Government's Smart Rwanda 2020 Vision. As part of that process, we had a portfolio of solutions speaking to Smart City ideas... The City of Kigali has an impressive plan to transform the city, making it more eco-friendly and there was a requirement for intelligent transport solutions.\" \nThe door opened for these ideas through a combination of three things: a strategic vision; the political will to execute it; and the bandwidth to deliver new, smart ways of doing things. An MOU was signed between the Government of Rwanda and Ericsson in at the global mobile talkfest in Barcelona earlier this year. \nThere are currently 3 bus operators, serving around 400,000 people daily. And whilst Kigali undoubtedly has traffic jams they are quite modest alongside the gridlock found in cities as different as Luanda, Nairobi, Lagos and Johannesburg. Drivers drive with some degree of care and courtesy and actually stop when there's a red light showing. \nThe challenges that exist for the bus operators might stand as a proxy for any African bus operator. Operators and drivers do not follow timetables and the regulator does not have the ability to monitor or control them. Drivers often go off the advertised routes. Passengers have no access to bus locations and journey times. Because of this, passengers will often take other means of transport (a car or taxi) which in turn increases the number of vehicles on the roads. \nThe collection of cash takes a long time as people board and there is what is always what is euphemistically described as \"revenue leakage\". The City and the regulator have no way of tracking revenues: less revenues mean less investment in public transport. \nThe Smart Bus Initiative has three elements to tackle these problems. Firstly, it will automate fare collections with smart cards and validators, giving cashless payment options. This will enable passengers to buy their fare before boarding, needing only to validate their payment as they enter the bus. \nSecondly, the City and its operators can move from manual monitoring of its buses and whether they adhere to the routes laid out. There will not only be GPS tracking but the central management location will be able to contact drivers and reroute buses to meet high demand. At present buses often wait at bus stops until they fill up. \nThirdly, in phase 2 the system will look at how many potential passengers are looking at the bus timetable to see where changes might need to be made. Passengers will have access to bus locations and timetables both through USSD on basic phones and an app for smarter phones. \nThe long-term vision is to have a Connected Bus Stop, which Ericsson will be showing a prototype of at Transform Africa later this month. It will not only have bus information for waiting passengers but give city and what's on information as well. \nThe roll-out is scheduled to start in November 2015 and will be completed by May 2016: it will cover 400 buses. Phase 2 will cover fleet management and will include the functionality for bus drivers to change red lights to speed up their journeys. \nAlthough Ericsson is reluctant to put the budget cost in the public domain as contracts are still being tied down, the sums involved are relatively trivial alongside the potential impact. \n\"We believe that this is a unique application - Rwanda is ahead - that will make public transport more efficient and reduce traffic in those cities. The growth in the African middle class has increased car ownership. The middle class are more demanding and public transport has to be modern and reliable.\" \nEricsson has calculated that an average of 182,000 people will go from using their cars to taking public transport and believes the numbers will increase with the introduction of Phase 2. It is also doing a study to look at the reduction in CO2 emissions as the City of Kigali has set itself targets to reduce these emissions. \nSo are any other African Governments interested in this approach? Understandably Ericsson wants to get Rwanda working fully before going out to other Governments but it will be using the Transform Africa event in Kigali (19-20 October) to showcase the work. Kasenene also points out that other African countries don't always have modern, regulated buses. So they are developing apps that can be used with smaller commuter taxis. \nBut as African economies grow, Government and City leaders need to get to grips with their traffic problems before they strangle the very productivity gains that have made over the last decade. \nBackground Briefing on Smart Transport \nKamal Bhattacharya, IBM Research Africa on using traffic flow data in Nairobi to improve the city \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTh8jtAHodY \nKevin Webb on what has to change about Open Transport data for cities like Manila & Nairobi \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJXvrrRR1GY \nKevin Webb, Conveyal on how Open Transport data started in the developed world \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwjefkToUfs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:21:27.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
