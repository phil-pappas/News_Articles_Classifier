The three major Wall Street indexes came off their initial lows, with the Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) composite pushing into positive territory in midday trading. \nOn the supply front, the Treasury Department will sell $35 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday and $29 billion in seven-year debt on Thursday. It will also auction $15 billion in two-year floating-rate securities on Wednesday. \nThe Treasury postponed its monthly sale of two-year fixed-rate notes because it might not be able to borrow money when that auction would have settled on Nov. 2. \n(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:44:14.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
