India's Maggi noodle recall continued to have a significant impact on growth in the South Asia Region, Nestle said. \nIn its Skin Health division, Nestle's U.S prescription drug rebates exceeded the amount of money that was set aside for this purpose. This resulted in an additional one-off charge in the third quarter, it said. \n(Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Michael Shields)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:25:05.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
