This includes a multi-million-dollar wildfire tab and pay increases for teachers. \nIdaho's Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee drafts the budget during the 2016 legislative session. Once written, the rest of the legislative body rarely makes significant changes before approving it. \nInformation from: The Spokesman-Review, http://www.spokesman.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:03:23.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
