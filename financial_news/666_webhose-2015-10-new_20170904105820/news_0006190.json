The scandal at car maker Volkswagen is also expected to dampen sentiment.\nAnalysts say signs of slowdown in the euro zone's economic powerhouse reinforce the case for further stimulus measures from the European Central Bank.\n\"Investors have already lowered their expectations for the German economy in recent months. We expect this trend to continue in October and the ZEW index to drop from 12.1 to 5.0... as a result,\" Commerzbank analyst Markus Koch said in a note.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, were down 1 basis point at 0.57 percent, a one-week low.\nEuropean equities were down 1.1 percent in early deals.\n\"A number of elements are now in favour of Bunds. Economic data have been weak recently and we expect them to remain weak. This will be positive for Bunds,\" KBC rates strategist Piet Lammens said.\nPortuguese 10-year yields fell 2.1 basis points to 2.42 percent, reversing a similar rise on Monday.\nPrime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho's centre-right grouping won most votes in an Oct. 4 election but lost its parliamentary majority and has begun to seek support from the opposition.\nSocialist leader Antonio Costa said on Monday he was in contact with two far-left parties, including the Communists, to work out a government programme that would ease austerity.\nHowever, he added it would have to \"respect Portugal's international commitments\", a statement aimed at calming worried investors.\n\"There is upwards pressure on Portuguese yields in recent days relative to elsewhere,\" said Martin van Vliet, senior rate strategist at ING. \"This is the aftermath of the actions and uncertainty to form a stable government.\"\nItalian yields fell before an auction of up to 7 billion euros of three-, seven- and 15-year bonds. Ten-year yields fell 1.2 bps to 1.67 percent.
