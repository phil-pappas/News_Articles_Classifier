Monday saw strong increases in industrials, energy, telecommunications and materials stocks. \nFriday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for September showed job growth slowed in the last three months, increasing prospects that the era of near-zero interest rates will continue for a while yet. \n\"Wall Street's favorite movie is 'Nightmare on Your Street'. The missed unemployment number means the Fed is probably going to hold longer,\" said Stephen Massocca, Chief Investment Officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. \nThe Fed, which has not raised interest rates since June 2006, kept its benchmark rate unchanged in September, citing an uncertain global economic outlook and volatile markets. \nTraders are pricing in only a 31-percent chance of a December hike, down from 44 percent before the jobs report, according to CME Group (Kuala Lumpur: 7018.KL - news ) 's FedWatch program. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 304.06 points, or 1.85 percent, to 16,776.43, the S&P 500 gained 35.69 points, or 1.83 percent, to 1,987.05 and the Nasdaq Composite added 73.49 points, or 1.56 percent, to 4,781.26. \nAll 10 major S&P sectors closed higher.

They were helped by a rally in U.S. gasoline and Russia's willingness to meet other major oil producers to discuss the market. \nThe Nasdaq biotechnology index fell 0.7 percent, breaking three days of gains. The index was crushed in the previous eight sessions on investor worries about drug price regulations. \nThe United States and other Pacific Rim countries reached a trade liberalization deal which fell short of industry group expectations for drug patent protection. \nDuPont shares shot up 5.5 percent in after-market trading when the chemical company announced its chief executive was retiring and that it had extended cost cuts. Trian Fund Management co-founder Nelson Peltz has been calling for deep cost cuts and a breakup of Dupont. \nWith third-quarter earnings season starting this week, investors are beginning to factor in what could be the biggest fall in profits for S&P 500 companies in six years.
