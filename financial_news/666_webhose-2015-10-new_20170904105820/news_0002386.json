The Novartis (NVS) deal should also add revenues to the Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare segments. These factors should have a long-term effect, and analysts estimate year-over-year growth of ~3.4%, ~5.4%, and 5.4% for 4Q15, 1Q16, and 2Q16, respectively.\nOn an annual basis, the estimates show a growth of ~4.7% for 2015, ~3.0% for 2016, and ~2.7% for 2017.\nThe chart below compares analysts’ estimates against actual revenues reported by the company since 3Q13. We’ll discuss the various factors affecting these expectations for future revenues in the following parts of this series.\n\nSegment expectations 3Q15 The company is divided into three business segments:\nthe Pharmaceuticals segment the Vaccines segment the Consumer Health segment Revenues for the Pharmaceuticals segment have reflected a shift in product performance. For the present quarter, revenues from new products as well as the HIV franchise have surpassed the fall in the sales of its key products, Seretide and Advair, turning the Pharmaceuticals segment back to growth.\nHowever, the disposal of the company’s oncology business to Novartis should have an impact on both revenues and profitability for this segment for the coming quarters.\nThe growth from acquiring meningitis vaccines, among other vaccines, from Novartis in March 2015 has led to more exposure and revenues for GlaxoSmithKline’s Vaccines segment. Although the meningitis vaccines are adding to revenues, they have lower profit margins.\nThe Consumer Health segment’s revenues are expected to have positive growth, following the successful launch of Flonase OTC and other oral health products under the Sensodyne brand.\nFor 2Q15, the company’s revenues rose by ~2%. In the same quarter, Merck’s (MRK) revenues fell by ~11%, Pfizer’s (PFE) fell by ~7%, AstraZeneca’s (AZN) fell by ~7%, and Novartis’s fell by ~5%. This was due to changes in foreign exchange. Investors could consider the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) or the Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH) in order to divest the risk.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - GlaxoSmithKline’s 3Q15 Earnings: What Should You Expect?
