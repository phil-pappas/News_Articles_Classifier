Their business includes managing oil, gas and mineral reserves, developing master-planned residential communities and developing commerce centers. In the course of doing business, sensitive files including strategic plans, financial statements, and other intellectual property need to be shared with external business partners and advisors. Once they are downloaded from the IBM ECM system, they are typically shared via email, file-sharing services and are often accessed using mobile devices and personal laptops. \n\"We realized that the files we were sharing could easily get into the hands of an unauthorized user when a device is stolen, by accident when an email is sent to the wrong person, or maliciously since the file could be readily copied and forwarded,\" stated Richard Daley, Director of Records and Information Management at Tejon Ranch. \"We were looking for a way to extend the security we had internally to content that is shared outside of our perimeter. The Seclore FileSecure Connector for IBM ECM makes it easy for us to automatically add persistent, file-centric security to content that is downloaded from IBM ECM and shared during collaboration processes.\" \nSeclore FileSecure EDRM protects files wherever they go. Using FileSecure, organizations can control and audit exactly who can access a file, what they can do with the file, for how long, and from which device. These usage controls remain with the file and can be remotely modified or revoked by the document owner at any time.\nWith the IBM ECM Connector for Seclore FileSecure, organizations can automatically apply granular usage policies to content as it is downloaded and shared. The policies are persistent and will protect that content even after it has left the IBM ECM system, ensuring secure internal and external collaboration. Policies already defined in IBM ECM can be 'federated' and mapped to the usage policies that are used to persistently protect files to streamline the administration effort.\n\"We are really excited to have Tejon Ranch as a new user of Seclore FileSecure,\" stated Vishal Gupta, CEO at Seclore. \"The combination of Seclore FileSecure and IBM ECM is providing Tejon Ranch with a seamless way to leverage and extend their investment in IBM ECM and ensure that all of their sensitive information can be securely shared.\"\nAbout Seclore \nSeclore offers an innovative Enterprise Digital Rights Management solution, FileSecure, which enables organizations to control usage of files wherever they go, both within and outside of the organization's boundaries. The ability to remotely enforce and audit who can view, edit, copy, and re-distribute files empowers organizations to embrace mobility, file-sharing, and external collaboration with confidence. \nEasy to deploy and use, Seclore FileSecure extends the security of DLP, ECM, ERP, File Sharing and eMail solutions to protect information that move beyond the perimeter.
