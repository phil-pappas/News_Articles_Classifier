A forbearance agreement with some bondholders and fuel lenders expires Thursday night, unless the parties extend that deadline. The contract keeps restructuring talks out of court. Bondholders and fuel lenders last month agreed to a tentative plan that would include a 15 percent loss.\n“I am confident we will come to an agreement with the monolines,” Lisa Donahue, Prepa’s chief restructuring officer, said Tuesday at a meeting organized by Puerto Rico’s Chamber of Commerce in San Juan. “The solution with the monolines is much more complicated. Their model is cash out, while the bondholders are more inclined to cut losses.”\nPrepa, bondholders, insurance companies and fuel lenders have been in negotiations since August 2014. The utility has improved its operations during that time. Donahue expects to reduce recurring expenses by as much as $390 million through fuel improvements and changes to customer management. Prepa has already achieved $106 million of recurring savings and another $80 million in one-time savings, Donahue said.\nBond insurers MBIA Inc., Assured Guarantee Ltd. and Syncora Guarantee Inc. back about $2.5 billion of Prepa’s debt. The insurers would be required to make up to investors whatever principal or interest the utility fails to pay on time and in full. Prepa faces a $196 million interest payment on Jan. 1, Bloomberg data show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:08:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
