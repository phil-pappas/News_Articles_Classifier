( YUME ) the global audience technology company powered by data-driven insights and multi-screen expertise, today announced the launch of its Outstream video offering. The move into Outstream further diversifies YuMe’s leading end-to-end digital video advertising solutions and complements its well-established in-stream business. The new Outstream solution enables premium editorial publishers to monetize non-video content, while providing increased opportunity for advertisers to reach their audiences across highly viewable inventory with interactive video ad formats. As one of the first entrants to the digital video marketplace, YuMe has unique advantages in the marketplace, with more than ten years of global video experience. \n“As a publisher, we’re excited about this new and engaging way to monetize our editorial assets,” said Larry Weitzman, CineSport’s Chief Content Officer and Chief of Operations. “By offering our advertising partners a channel that places their messages at key points of maximum attention, YuMe is creating value for everyone in the ecosystem, publisher, advertiser and consumer alike.” \nBenefits of YuMe’s new Outstream product offering for brand advertisers and publishers include: \nEnhanced Viewability : New Outstream ad formats only play when visible, either embedded within editorial content or at another natural point of peak user-engagement. Incremental Monetization of Non-Video Content : Outstream enables publishers to further monetize editorial content by creating additional video ad inventory through a simple YuMe JavaScript tag. Buying Flexibility : Available programmatically or on a direct basis. “YuMe has driven some of the most innovative advertising solutions in video,” said Jayant Kadambi, Yume’s Co-founder and CEO. “Given the increased demand from both publishers and advertisers for brand safe ads that are 100% viewable, delivered at a point of heightened attention, that can be delivered across platforms at scale, we are confident that Outstream will be the next chapter of that innovation. We have always believed in evolving our offerings to build global audiences at scale.” \nAdvertisers and publishers can look to YuMe as a single source of interactive video for both in-stream and Outstream formats. This comprehensive set of offerings differentiates the company from others that largely focus on one type of video offering. YuMe is uniquely positioned in its offering of customized solutions developed by its in-house creative studio for both in-stream and Outstream video ad units, a capability that allows them to tailor the units to the specific needs of both the advertiser and publisher. \nThe launch of Outstream comes during a period of rapid product innovation and global expansion for YuMe, following June’s launch of the company’s full stack programmatic offering and its move into the Chinese advertising market, the world’s second largest digital video marketplace, earlier this Summer. \nABOUT YUME \nYuMe, Inc. ( YUME ) is a leading provider of global audience technologies, curating relationships between brand advertisers and consumers of premium video content across a growing range of connected devices.
