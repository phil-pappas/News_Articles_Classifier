Just realize that, without a plan in place to help it grow, those newfound riches are finite. \n“Almost anyone who gets a large windfall can fall prey to ‘sudden wealth syndrome,’” says Shomari Hearn, certified financial planner and vice president of Palisades Hudson Financial Group. “The recipient can fall into the trap of believing their newfound wealth will never run out and they can buy everything and do anything.” More Headlines Boosting Retirement Income: How to Generate Funds in Your Golden Years \nHearn notes that some people who get an inheritance, sign a big contract, get a stock payout or win a settlement buy huge houses and boats and go on spending sprees. Some invest heavily in risky ventures or faltering businesses owned by friends or family members. However, some -- especially professional athletes or those in science, technology, engineering and mathematics professions who see their share of a stock split or company buyout balloon -- fall under the category of “high net workers.” That means they've made a whole lot of money but, according to Frank Trotter, executive vice president of EverBank, will still need to work, because they aren't taking the right financial steps to secure their wealth. \n“I don’t think fear is a key element for this group, but a lack of action will prevent them from moving from a high cash-flow segment to high net worth,” Trotter says. “I defined ‘rich’ as 'the sustainable ability to reasonably buy what you want without regard to budget – whether retired or not.' For a majority of high net workers, this will not be achieved, based on their average behavior.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:27:02.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
