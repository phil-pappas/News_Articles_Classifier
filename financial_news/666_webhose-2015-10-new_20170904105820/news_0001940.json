PUBLISHED: 09:38, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:40, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 GETTY Tesco is matching brand product prices against its rivals \nThe retailer has promised that shoppers will never pay more for branded items at Tesco than at Sainsbury's, Asda or Morrisons. \nA new price match will be made at the till, and customers who could have paid less at the grocer's main competitors will have the money immediately deducted from their total bill. \nBut the move will make little difference to British shoppers who are increasingly opting to do their shopping at Lidl or Aldi. \nThe chain admitted it's not included the discounters in the scheme because of the different names offered by the stores- less than 10 per cent of the branded products in Tesco are offered by Aldi or Lidl. \nHowever, Britain's largest supermarket has insisted that the new system means less hassle for customers, as it claims to try to make shopping 'easier' for British households.
