AFR by Stephen Howard Why should I invest in fixed income when interest rates are only going to increase and I am going to lose money?\nThis is the question many investors have been asking themselves recently.\nWith the investment world's attention focused on the US Federal Reserve's potential increase of interest rates and the recent decision by Westpac to increase its home loan rates, it is only natural for investors to believe that interest rates may increase, despite widespread speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia will hold or even cut the official cash rate.\nAll too often investors seem to find themselves between a rock and a hard place when it comes to allocating money to fixed income. However, the worst thing they can do is get caught up in the headlines and predictions and try to decide whether to invest now or to wait and invest at a future point when interest rates may be higher.\nStephen Howard. Susan Gordon-Brown While this type of dilemma is completely natural, investors risk missing out on the intrinsic benefits that a long-term investment in fixed income can provide. Further to missing these benefits, investors may unfortunately find themselves in a situation where they are attempting to time the market with their asset allocation decision: a strategy that has the potential to erode long-term investment performance.\nWhen investing in a broadly diversified portfolio of assets, including allocations to fixed income, long-term success requires investors to have the strategic discipline to stick with their asset allocation decision and not try to time the market.\nBroad diversification is critical and investing in low-cost, well-constructed portfolios is essential. Achieving consistent out-performance of the financial markets is extremely difficult, yet all too often investors are trying to do just that, even with defensive assets such as bonds.\nBy timing the market investors run the risk of having an asset allocation that is sub-optimal for their needs and this ultimately can undermine the long-term success of their investment program.\n Shifting attention back to the fixed-income asset class, while it is true to say that rising interest rates may cause short-term pain for the fixed income sector, long-term investors in fixed-income portfolios will actually benefit from higher rates of interest.\nA simple financial instrument While fixed-income securities appear to be complex in nature, they are really one of the simplest financial instruments available in the market.\nUltimately, a fixed-income security is a loan that pays a periodic rate of interest in the form of a coupon payment, and repays the principal value at maturity.\nAs fixed income portfolios tend to invest in hundreds of individual securities, there is a constant flow of coupons and maturity proceeds into the fund, and all of these cash flows are reinvested at the prevailing rate of interest. As interest rates increase, these cash flows are reinvested at higher yields and this ultimately leads to a long-term increase in the performance of the investment.\nThe accompanying chart illustrates the relationship between the yield to maturity (labelled start of period yield) on a typical fixed-income portfolio and the total rate of return derived from the portfolio over the following five years.\nThe chart shows that increases in interest rates are actually a good thing for long-term fixed-income investors. The yield of the fixed-income portfolio to the time of the investment has proven to be one of the best predictors of return for this asset class.\nIf investors are still not convinced that maintaining discipline through a period of rising rates is worth it, they should remember that as well as capturing long-term growth, fixed income can also provide an insurance policy for when markets decline.\nLooking back through the past 25 years of Australian market cycles, whenever equities' performance has dropped, fixed income securities have provided consistent income in times where yield has been hard to come by. This is why fixed income has been so important to many investors during market volatility in recent years.\nAnd while there is speculation about a general rise in rates, it is also entirely possible we will see more cuts amid a lack of confidence expressed by many investors and businesses.\nIt's vital for investors to remember that when equities markets swing up again, fixed-income securities won't be \"underperforming\", they'll be doing exactly what they're meant to: providing a stream of stable income through good and bad market periods.\nStephen Howard is head of fixed interest at Vanguard Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:03.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
