Thousands of unsold units in different metros have added to the misery of the realtors and builders. Considering that a long stretch of festivals is upon us, builders have started to work on promotional and marketing efforts aimed at generating a substantial sales target this festive season. Banks have also come out in support of the builder folk, drafting offers and home loan melas specially to encourage home buyers to take the next step. \nWhy is there a need for aggressive measures? \nThe real estate market in India hasn’t exactly been in its prime in the past 4 years. Buyers have postponed their decision factoring in various elements like a price correction. Additionally, the high interest rate on home loans has also been responsible to a large extend for the delayed buying decisions. With the market in doldrums, crashing home buyer interest as a result of financial burden and the job crisis in various sectors have added to the current scenario. \nWhy buy now? \nSome builders have been promoting their respective projects with offers in different metros irrespective of the season or time of the year. If deals and offers have been up for grabs, then why is the home buyer segment not positive? And why will they buy now if they haven’t done so throughout the year? \nThis question brings us to the fact that there are various offers floating in the market throughout the year. What makes the season special is not just the variety of offers but the extent to which many builders go to push sales. The market is driven by buyer sentiments throughout the festive season, which helps home buyers analyze and negotiate to a price point suited to their budget. \nOffers a buyer should expect \nThese festive offers come in a variety of ways. To give you a sample of the kind of offers, here’s what to expect this festive season in different metros: \n• Rebate on down payment and subvention schemes • Electronics and other consumer goods as free gifts • Exclusive offers on ready-to-move-in-apartments • Rebate on price per sq. ft. during a given period • Waiving off certain additional costs like free additional car park • Home or interior design related gifts and offers \nThese offer a fair idea of the kind of offers one can expect. However, choosing what works best for you is an individual decision. Avail offers that get you the most financial benefits with a trusted project or builder. Builders have kicked off their festive season with Ganesh Chaturthi, Onam and now Dussera, Diwali, Durga Pooja and Christmas. Now it’s time for you to make a smart choice! \nAnupriya Dharma for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: By Mary from Philadelphia, United States (happy diwali) [CC BY-SA 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons \nBy: indiaproperty.com Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic Taxation Q Interest rates are going to go down.
