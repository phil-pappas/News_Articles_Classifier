But if consummated, the deal will create the world’s largest brewer that sells about a third of the world’s beer.\nHere are five key facts to know about this mega-beer merger.\n1. The price looks to be about $105 billion After rejecting four other proposals, SABMiller’s SAB, +8.93% SBMRY, -0.18% board unanimously agreed to recommend to shareholders InBev’s ABI, +1.98% BUD, -0.35% offer of 44 pounds ($67.67) a share. If all shares were sold at this price, SABMiller would be valued at about £71 billion.\nHowever, InBev also offered a partial-share alternative for 41% of SABMiller’s stock — the chunk owned by the brewer’s two biggest shareholders Altria MO, +1.14% and BevCo. That essentially works out to a cash-and-share combination translating into a price of £39.03 a share.\nThe partial-share alternative brings the total SABMiller valuation down to £68 billion, or $104.58 billion. InBev had made previous offers at £38, £40, £42.15, and £43.50 per share, but SABMiller rejected them, claiming they undervalued the company.\n2. The share price The £44-a-share bid offered to the majority of SABMiller’s shareholders marks a 50% premium to the brewer’s trading level on Sept. 14, the day before media speculation about a potential merger erupted.\nSABMiller shares jumped 8.5% to £39.31 on Tuesday in London trade after the takeover agreement, still putting it more than 10% below the offer price.\nShares of InBev rose 1.8% in Brussels, while U.S.-listed shares of the brewer climbed 1.9% in premarket action.\n3. Watch out for the world’s largest brewer with 29% market share Ahead of this merger, InBev was already the world’s largest brewer, followed by SABMiller in second place. Now, if this just-announced tie-up goes through, the new company will overwhelmingly take the top spot as the biggest brewer in the world, with a combined market share of 29%, according to estimates from research firm Euromonitor.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:13:09.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
