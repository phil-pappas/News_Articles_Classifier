Advertising Print This Post Photo: Bloomberg \nCitigroup has promoted Elinor Hoover to the role of Co-Head of Investment Banking for Consumer Products, her latest executive role in her four years with the lender, according to a recent Reuters report. \nIn her new role as the Co-Head of Investment Banking, she will be sharing the position with Jeffrey Schackner, Citi’s other co-head. \nMs. Hoover joined Citigroup back in 2011 and has been taken roles as its Vice Chairman of Capital Markets and also its Co-Head of Financial Strategy and Solutions. Prior to landing at Citigroup however, she worked for more than a decade at Morgan Stanley in a number of senior level roles. \nThis included most recently as its Vice Chairman of Global Capital Markets at Morgan Stanley, as well as its North American Co-Head of Fixed Income Capital Markets and Corporate Derivatives. \nBack in late July, Citigroup secured the services of Joe Bond , the former executive at foreign exchange (FX) and contracts-for-difference (CFD) provider Abshire-Smith. Following the move, Mr. Bond shifted gears to work as Citigroup’s Associate Vice President (AVP) of Treasury Sales. In this capacity he has since been based out of Citi’s London branch, where he has focused on steering the lender’s treasury sales for UK clientele. Got a news tip?
