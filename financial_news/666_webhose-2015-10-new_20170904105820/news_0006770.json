PUBLISHED: 12:10, Tue, Oct 13, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:35, Tue, Oct 13, 2015 GETTY Last year Black Friday took retailers by surprise, according to experts \nThe shopping frenzy this year falls on November 27 and is set to be an even bigger hit among British bargain-hunters than last year. Black Friday - the day after the US bank holiday Thanksgiving - is the day that American retailers have traditionally enticed shoppers to spend with one-day sales. But in recent years the trend has been slowing growing in Britain, with most of the country's biggest brands joining in with promotions. Tesco, Amazon, Asda, Currrys, Argos, John Lewis and Boots were just some of the big name retailers that cut prices for the event last year. And now experts have warned UK businesses to make sure they are prepared for this year's big day. Last year some retailers were caught off guard by the huge demand from British shoppers with a a number of national retailers seeing their sites go down or loading very slowly. Black Friday and the following so-called Cyber Monday were the overwhelming peak trading days of last year, according to commerce consultancy Salmon. Some brands even had to implement holding pages, which led would-be buyers to abandon purchases.
