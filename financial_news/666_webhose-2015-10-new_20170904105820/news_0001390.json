The Sparta Program's popularity among cities and towns around the country reflects both outstanding word-of-mouth between government officials, and a growing recognition among decision makers regarding the economic advantages of leasing over having to pay for costly equipment entirely up front through full cash outlays. By selecting the Sparta Municipal Lease Program for its major equipment needs, the costs can be spread over time and thereby give more flexibility to a municipality's budgeting considerations.
