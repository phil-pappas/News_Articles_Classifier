In the 1840s, Englishman Charles Babbage, now known as the \"father of the computer\", designed (though never built) the \"Analytical Engine\", a machine which could accurately and reproducibly calculate the answers to maths problems.\nWhile translating an article by an Italian mathematician about the machine, Lovelace included a written algorithm which would allow the engine to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers.\nAround 170 years later, Whitney Wolfe, one of the founders of dating app Tinder, was allegedly forced to resign from the company . According to a lawsuit she later filed against the app and its parent company, she had her co-founder title removed because, the male founders argued, it would look \"slutty\", and because \"Facebook and Snapchat don't have girl founders. It just makes it look like Tinder was some accident\". (They settled out of court.)\nMen invented the internet? The original Apple watch - its launch celebrated here in September 2014 by Apple CEO Tim Cook, left, and Bono, second from right - lacked a period tracker for women. \"These technologies are built by male-dominated teams, for a male audience,\" writes Barbara Speedy. Marcio Jose Sanchez This past week saw the marking of Ada Lovelace day on October 13 – an international celebration of inspirational women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). It's lucky we have this day of remembrance, because, as Wolfe's story demonstrates, we also spend a lot of time forgetting and sidelining women in tech.\nIn the wash of pale male founders of the tech giants that rule the industry,we don't often think about the women that shaped its foundations: Judith Estrin, one of the designers of TCP/IP , for example, or Radia Perlman, inventor of the spanning-tree protocol . Both inventions sound complicated, and they are – they're some of the vital building blocks that allow the internet to function.\nAnd yet David Streitfeld, a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist, somehow felt it accurate to write in 2012 : \"Men invented the internet. And not just any men. Men with pocket protectors. Men who idolised Mr Spock and cried when Steve Jobs died.\"\nPerhaps we forget about tech's founding women because the needle has swung so far into the other direction.\n A huge proportion – perhaps even 90 per cent - of the world's code is written by men. At Google, women fill 17 per cent of technical roles. At Facebook, 15 per cent. Over 90 per cent of the code repositories on GitHub, an online service used throughout the industry, is owned by men .\nSilicon Valley myths favour males Yet it's also hard to believe that this erasure of women's role in tech is completely accidental. As Elissa Shevinsky writes in the introduction to a new collection of essays on gender in tech, Lean Out just out in the United States (order online or get the ebook): \"This myth of the nerdy male founder has been perpetuated by men who found this story favourable.\"\nDoes it matter? It's hard to believe that it doesn't. Our society is increasingly defined and delineated by code and the things it builds. Small slip-ups, like the lack of a period tracker on the original Apple Watch, or fitness trackers too big for some women's wrists, gesture to the fact that these technologies are built by male-dominated teams, for a male audience.\nIn Lean Out , one essay written by a Twitter-based \"start-up dinosaur\" (don't ask) explains how dangerous it is to allow one small segment of society to build the future for the rest of us: \"If you let someone else build tomorrow, tomorrow will belong to someone else. They will build a better tomorrow for everyone like them… For tomorrow to be for everyone, everyone needs to be the one that builds it.\"\nSo where did all the women go? How did we get from a rash of female inventors to a situation where the major female presence at an Apple iPhone launch is a model's face projected onto a screen and photoshopped into a smile by a male demonstrator?\nThe toxic culture of many tech workplaces could be a cause or an effect of the lack of women in the industry, but it certainly can't make make it easy to stay. Behaviours range from the ignorant - Martha Lane-Fox, founder of lastminute.com, is often asked \"what happens if you get pregnant?\" at investors' meetings - to the much more sinister.\nAn essay in Lean Out by Katy Levinson details her experiences of sexual harassment while working in tech: \"I have had interviewers attempt to solicit sexual favours from me mid-interview and discuss in significant detail precisely what they would like to do. All of these things have happened either in Silicon Valley working in tech, in an educational institution to get me there, or in a technical internship.\"\nOthers featured in the book joined in with the low-level sexism and racism of their male colleagues in order to \"fit in\" and deflect negative attention. Erica Joy writes that while working in IT at the University of Alaska as the only woman (and only black person) on her team, she laughed at colleagues' \"terribly racist and sexist jokes\" and \"co-opted their negative attitudes\".\nCasual offices protect offenders The casual culture and allegedly meritocratic hierarchies of tech companies may actually be encouraging this discriminatory atmosphere. HR and the strict reporting procedures of large corporates at least give those suffering from discrimination a place to go. A casual office environment can discourage reporting or calling out prejudiced humour or remarks. Brook Shelley, a woman who transitioned while working in tech, notes: \"No one wants to be the office mother\". So instead, you join in and hope for the best.\nAnd, of course, there's no reason why people working in tech would have fewer issues with discrimination than those in other industries. A childhood spent as a \"nerd\" can also spawn its own brand of misogyny - Katherine Cross writes in Lean Out that \"to many of these men [working in these fields] ... it is all too easy to subconsciously confound women who say 'this is sexist' with the young girls who said… 'You're gross and a creep and I'll never date you'.\"\nWhen I spoke to Alexa Clay, entrepreneur and co-author of the Misfit Economy , she confirmed that there's a strange, low-lurking sexism in the start-up economy: \"They [appear] all very open and free, but underneath it there's still something really patriarchal.\"\nStart-ups, after all, are a culture which celebrates risk-taking, something which women are societally discouraged from doing. As Clay says, \"Men are allowed to fail in tech. You have these young guys who these old guys adopt and mentor. If his app doesn't work, the mentor just shrugs it off. I would not be able to get away with that, and I think women and minorities aren't allowed to take the same amount of risks, particularly in these communities.\n\"If you fail, no one's saying that's fine.\"\nLean out canaries! The conclusion of Lean Out , and of women in tech I have spoken to, isn't that more women, over time, will enter these industries and seamlessly integrate; it's that tech culture needs to change, or its lack of diversity will become even more severe. Shevinsky writes: \"The reason why we don't have more women in tech is not because of a lack of STEM education. It's because too many high profile and influential individuals and subcultures within the tech industry have ignored or outright mistreated women applicants and employees.\"\nTo be succinct - the problem isn't women, it's tech culture.\nSoftware engineer Kate Heddleston has a wonderful and chilling metaphor about the way we treat women in STEM.\nWomen are, she writes , the \"canary in the coal mine\". If one dies, surely you should take that as a sign that the mine is uninhabitable – that there's something toxic in the air. \"Instead, the industry is looking at the canary, wondering why it can't breathe, saying 'Lean in, canary, lean in!'. When one canary dies they get a new one because getting more canaries is how you fix the lack of canaries.\"\nWe need more women in STEM, and, I'd argue, in tech in particular, but we need to make sure the air is breathable first.\nLean Out is published by OR Books", "external_links": ["http://alyssafrazee.com/gender-and-github-code.html", "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/radia-perlman-dont-call-me-the-mother-of-the-internet/284146/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/technology/lawsuit-against-kleiner-perkins-is-shaking-silicon-valley.html?_r=2&smid=tw-nytimes&seid=auto", "https://medium.com/@katylevinson", "http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/TCP-IP", "http://findingada.com/", "http://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/how-our-engineering-environments-are-killing-diversity-introduction", "http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/lean-out/", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/whitney-wolfe-settles-sexual-harassment-tinder-lawsuit-1-million-2014-11?r=US&IR=T", "http://www.gadgette.com/2015/09/10/old-tech-new-lows-apples-iphone-6s-announcement-was-a-joke/"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:00.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
