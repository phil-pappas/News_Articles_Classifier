He used his stake to oppose a $590 million takeover offer from Foxtel — which is half owned by Herald Sun publisher News Corp — and US cable heavyweight Discovery Communications.\nAnalysts said his latest move gave him plenty of bargaining power in a rapidly changing media landscape.\n“The question is, what’s the end game? Is he trying to block anything that could work against him?” IG market analyst Evan Lucas said.\n“He’s clearly ahead of the curve and knows a lot more about the media game in this country than I do.”\nMorningstar analyst Brian Han said yesterday Mr Gordon could be agitating for a board seat at Nine to play a role in anointing a successor to its chief executive, David ­Gyngell.\nThe network has begun a search for someone to replace Mr Gyngell.\nThe Nine transaction is due to be completed on November 9.\nShares in Nine closed down 3c at $1.585 yesterday.\npaul.gilder@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Gordon turns to Nine Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/gordon-turns-to-nine-entertainment/story-fni0dcne-1227576282010"], "published": "2015-10-21T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:34:50.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
