Maybe there truly is a new mental disorder driving our obsession with selfies , even though reports that the American Psychiatric Association had actually classified the behavior as a clinical problem have been proven unfounded.But whatever the root cause of the selfie craze, people are now dying in pursuit of taking that perfect picture of themselves while traveling. According to a report by Conde Nast Traveler , more people have died thus far in 2015 while taking selfies, than from shark attacks. (As of August there were eight confirmed shark-related deaths, while the selfie-related death toll had reached at least ten.) One traveler died while trying to take a selfie during the running of the bulls in Spain. Another perished after tumbling down a set of stairs during an attempted selfie at the Taj Mahal. And the list goes on. Often, the deaths and injuries involve the use of selfie sticks - a literal and figurative extension of the selfie phenomenon. What's more, when people aren't killing themselves over a selfie, they're causing all sorts of other damage and complications. In Costa Rica, tourists have been interfering with the nesting habits of vulnerable sea turtles by attempting to take selfies with them, the country's government reported. Meanwhile, a rollercoaster at Disneyland, in California, was brought to a screeching halt after a passenger stuck out a selfie stick while the ride was in progress. All of which has led to an outright ban, as well as threats of bans, on the use of selfie sticks at a growing list of the world's most famous tourist destinations, attractions and locations. \"Selfies are getting to be out of control -- I've seen people taking them at the edge of waterfalls, at the top of mountains, near wildlife,\" says Rick Rockwell, content manager for the website appPicker and a travel blogger who started the site CalEXPLORnia . \"It's crazy. Because of social media, it has come down to an egotistical desire for attention. No matter where people go, and what they do, they're taking a picture...I've seen people taking selfies at the summit of mountain peaks in the Tahoe basin, where at any moment, because of a gust of wind or the wrong step you could fall off the ledge.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:35:17.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
