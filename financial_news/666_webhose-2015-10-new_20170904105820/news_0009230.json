Known as the Financial Readiness Score (FRS), the free patent-pending tool uses a proprietary methodology based on USAA’s core beliefs for building financial security. The dynamic tool identifies financial risks in areas including budgeting, insurance, debt, retirement savings, and certain life events that could negatively impact a member’s financial well-being. It analyzes a member’s financial readiness in four key areas — protecting, saving, spending and planning.\nFRS summarizes a member’s financial readiness environment based on personal information such as life stage, household information, and income, into one number from 1 to 100. The tool provides a personalized, prioritized action plan to help improve financial wellness and reduce financial related risks.\n“Our mission is to facilitate the financial security of our members and their families, and USAA saw a need to create a simple tool to help them understand and take action steps toward improving their financial well-being,” said Lea Sims, assistant vice president of USAA Enterprise Advice Group. “Our FRS tool meets this need and is more dynamic than some other online financial assessments because it covers a broad spectrum of financial needs and certain financial risks. The FRS tool does some of the heavy lifting for our members behind-the-scenes, and can be updated as members’ financial situations change over time.”\nNearly 141,000 USAA members used the FRS tool in a pilot study conducted during the prior year. Fifty-eight percent of the participants were 25 to 44 years old, and they discovered that their financial well-being could improve most when considering changes in retirement savings and/or emergency funds.\nMembers can obtain their free FRS score and action plan by visiting usaa.com or the USAA Mobile App.\nAbout USAA\nThe USAA family of companies provides insurance, banking, investments, retirement products and advice to 11.1 million current and former members of the U.S. military and their families.
