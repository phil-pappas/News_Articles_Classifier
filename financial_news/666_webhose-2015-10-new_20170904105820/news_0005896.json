(NASDAQ: FCFS ), a leading international operator of retail pawn stores in the U.S. and Mexico, today announced revenue, net income and earnings per share for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. Mr. Rick Wessel, chief executive officer, stated, “We are pleased to again report significant growth in our pawn operations as evidenced by core revenue growth of 15% in the U.S. and 14% in Mexico on a currency-adjusted basis. Operating results in Mexico were solid, as core same-store revenues grew by 8% and same-store pawn loans increased by 4%. While peso-denominated earnings in Mexico increased, the average exchange rate of the Mexican peso decreased 25% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This significantly impacted dollar-translated earnings in Mexico and, at the current exchange rate, will further impact earnings in the fourth quarter, which is reflected in our updated earnings guidance for the year.” Continuing its strategy to reduce non-core consumer/payday lending operations, the Company also announced plans to close eight additional stand-alone consumer loan stores in Texas during the fourth quarter of 2015, bringing the total to 22 such store closings this year. As a result of these store closures and other regulatory activity continuing to affect the present and future profitability expectations for payday and title lending products, the Company recorded non-recurring restructuring expenses related to U.S. consumer loan operations of approximately $5.5 million net of tax, or $0.19 per share during the third quarter of 2015, of which $5.1 million was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge. Note: All growth rates presented above and in “Revenue Highlights” and “Pawn Operating Metrics” are calculated on a constant currency basis. The average exchange rate of the Mexican peso decreased 25% and 18% during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, compared to the comparable prior-year periods. As used herein the term “year-to-date” means   2015. Earnings Highlights Diluted earnings per share   totaled $0.40, which included $0.19 per share of non-recurring and primarily non-cash restructuring expenses related to U.S. consumer loan operations. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter, excluding these non-recurring expenses, was $0.59 compared to prior year adjusted earnings per share of $0.69. On a comparative basis with the prior year, third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings were reduced by $0.12 per share due to the 25% decline in the value of the peso and approximately $0.05 per share due to decreases in earnings from non-core jewelry scrapping and payday lending operations. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are defined in the detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures provided elsewhere in this release. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share were $1.45. Excluding the non-recurring expenses related to the restructuring of the U.S. consumer loan operations and other non-recurring expenses, adjusted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.88 in the same prior-year period. Comparative earnings for   reduced by $0.23 per share due to an 18% decline in the value of the peso, approximately $0.16 per share due to decreases in earnings from non-core jewelry scrapping and payday lending operations and $0.04 per share due to incremental interest expense related to the Company’s senior note offering in March 2014. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-recurring charges) for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $140.4 million, an increase of 7% on a constant currency basis. Net income was $68.2 million for the same trailing twelve month period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income is provided elsewhere in this release. Revenue Highlights Core pawn revenue, composed of retail merchandise sales and pawn service fees, increased 14% during the third quarter of 2015 compared to the   revenue increased 9% to $170 million, reflecting the strong growth in core pawn revenues partially offset by a 30% decline in total non-core payday lending and jewelry scrapping revenues. Retail merchandise sales increased by 17%   compared to the prior-year period, driven by increases of 19% in the U.S and 16% in Mexico. Pawn fee revenue grew 9% in total compared to the prior-year period, with increases of 10% and 8% in Mexico and the U.S., respectively. Same-store revenue growth from core pawn operations (excluding scrap jewelry sales and consumer loan fees) increased 8% in Mexico, decreased 4% in the U.S. and resulted in 4% overall growth in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, 52% of revenues were from operations in Mexico which were primarily conducted in Mexican pesos and translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. On a constant currency basis, using the prior period average exchange rate, 56% of year-to-date revenues would have been generated in Mexico. Revenue from non-core scrap jewelry operations declined 35% during the third quarter as compared to the prior year and accounted for less than 1% of total gross profit for the current period. The decrease was the result of a 29% decline in scrap volume produced and a 9% decrease in the weighted-average selling price of gold. The gross margin for scrap jewelry sales was 11% in the third quarter of 2015, which was consistent with the prior-year period. Non-core revenue from consumer payday and title lending operations decreased 25% in the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014, primarily the result of store closings and regulatory restrictions. The Company’s U.S. consumer loan operations comprised only 4% of total revenue and total gross profit in the third quarter of 2015. \nPawn Operating Metrics Consolidated gross margins on retail merchandise sales remained strong at 38% during the third quarter of 2015. These gross margin results were especially impressive given the ongoing shift toward general merchandise inventories and the integration of recently acquired stores, many of which had lower margin structures. Pawn loans receivable increased by 5% on a year-over-year basis at quarter end, growing equally in both the U.S. and Mexico. On a same-store basis, pawn loans increased 4% in Mexico, which represented a significant improvement from the prior quarter when same-store loan growth was less than 1%. Same-store pawn loans were down 5% in the U.S., due in part to the continued impact of lower gasoline prices, which dampened loan demand, and lower loan balances in many of the Company’s acquired stores as they continue transitioning to the Company’s best practice lending and operating standards. Same-store pawn loan balances were down much less in many of Company’s larger established markets. Annualized inventory turns for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015 were 3.4 times per year. Aged inventories (items held for over a year) accounted for approximately 5% of total inventories, an improvement from 6% in the prior quarter, due primarily to aged inventories in recently acquired stores. Excluding inventories in the stores acquired during the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015, aged inventories represented only 4% of total inventories, which includes slower turning retail gold jewelry. Total inventories at September 30, 2015 increased 15% over the prior-year period, in-line with store growth and largely driven by acquisitions. Store Count Activity During the quarter, the Company opened eight new locations in Mexico. Year-to-date, a total of 62 stores were added as the Company acquired 30 large format pawn store locations in the U.S. and opened 32 new stores in Mexico. As of September 30, 2015, the Company operated 1,045 stores composed of 700 stores in Mexico, of which 657 are large format, full-service pawn stores and 345 stores in the U.S., of which 283 are large format, full-service pawn stores. Financial Metrics The adjusted EBITDA margin was 20% for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the impacts of non-core payday lending and wholesale scrap jewelry operations, the adjusted EBITDA margin remained consistent with the prior year. The calculation of adjusted EBITDA margin is provided elsewhere in this release. Pre-tax store operating margins were 25% for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015. The Company’s adjusted return on equity for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015 was 17% and the adjusted return on assets was 10% for the same period. These financial ratios were calculated after adjusting for the non-recurring items described in more detail elsewhere in this release. Liquidity As of September 30, 2015, the Company had $73 million in cash on its balance sheet and $101.5 million of availability for future borrowings under its long-term revolving bank credit facilities. The average interest rate on the Company’s $68.5 million outstanding bank debt at quarter end was 2.75%. The leverage ratio at September 30, 2015 (outstanding indebtedness divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) was 1.9:1. Net debt, defined as funded debt less invested cash, was $211 million at September 30, 2015. The leverage ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net debt was 0.7:1 and the ratio of net debt to equity was 0.5:1. Cash provided by operating activities was $93 million for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015, while free cash flow totaled $71 million. Free cash flow is defined in the detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures provided elsewhere in this release. The Company authorized a two million share stock repurchase plan in January 2015. Year-to-date, the Company had repurchased 661,000 shares under the plan at an aggregate cost of $32 million. For the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2015, the Company invested $57 million in acquisitions, $22 million in capital expenditures and $32 million in stock repurchases, funded primarily with operating cash flows and a $12 million increase in net debt. Consumer Loan Store Closings and Asset Impairments As part of the Company’s long-term strategy of reducing non-core consumer/payday lending operations, the Company closed 14 consumer loan stores in Texas during   2015 and plans to close at least eight more of these stores during the fourth quarter. These closings will reduce the number of remaining freestanding U.S. consumer loan locations to 43 stores, all located in Texas.   the Company recognized non-recurring expenses related to the restructuring of the U.S. consumer loan operations of $8.4 million (pre-tax) related to its freestanding Texas consumer loan locations, which included a $7.9 million (pre-tax) U.S. consumer loan operations non-cash goodwill impairment. The total charge, net of tax benefits, was $5.5 million, or $0.19 per share. These non-recurring charges are a result of the continued significant deterioration in payday lending market conditions, primarily due to increased regulations, as well as our continued de-emphasis of non-core payday operations resulting in consumer loan store closures. As of September 30, 2015, the Company has no remaining goodwill or other intangible assets associated with its U.S. consumer loan operations. Fiscal 2015 Outlook Due primarily to the significant further weakening of the Mexican peso during the third quarter of 2015 and expected continued impact in the fourth quarter, the Company is updating its fiscal full-year 2015 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.50 per diluted share. The adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the impact of non-recurring expenses related to U.S. consumer loan operations and non-recurring costs related to store acquisitions. The Company’s previous guidance for the second half of the year, as provided in July 2015, was based on a projected exchange rate in a range of 15.50 to 16.25 Mexican pesos / U.S. dollar. The actual average exchange rate for third quarter was 16.40 Mexican pesos / U.S. dollar. The projected rate for the fourth quarter is now set at a range of 16.25 to 17.25 Mexican pesos / U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the incremental impact on dollar-translated earnings in Mexico is estimated to be an additional $0.07 to $0.11 per share of earnings as compared to the previous guidance. Given the further declines in U.S. gasoline prices during the third quarter, the Company's updated guidance is also more cautious about short-term fourth quarter U.S. pawn loan demand. The Company expects to add approximately 80 new stores in 2015, a majority of which will be de novo large format pawn stores in Mexico. \nAdditional Commentary and Analysis Mr. Wessel further commented on the third quarter results, “During the quarter, our operations in both Mexico and the U.S. continued to post significant currency-adjusted growth in revenue and earnings. We also experienced growth in pawn loans outstanding, driven by store additions and continued maturation of younger stores in Mexico. Of significant note was the 4% growth in currency-adjusted same-store pawn receivables in Mexico, which exceeded the growth rate in earlier quarters this year. This metric has historically been a strong leading indicator of future revenue growth. While we continued to see slight weakness in overall U.S. pawn demand due in part to lower gasoline prices, a portion of the same-store pawn loan decline relates to stores we have acquired over the past several years. In these stores, the Company continues to implement best practice lending policies that in many cases may reduce the pawn loans outstanding in the short term, but should drive long-term improvements in retail margins, loan yields and the overall return on pawn assets.” “The further strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the third quarter continued to impact our dollar-reported operating results as the average exchange rate of the Mexican peso decreased 25% during the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the prior-year period. Although consolidated earnings have been impacted by the volatility of the peso, we have seen very limited impacts on customer traffic or local transaction metrics and margins. As such, our in-country, peso-denominated operations in Mexico continue to generate significant growth in revenue, earnings and cash flows. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of the Mexican economy and the value of the peso as evidenced by continued foreign investment, especially in the manufacturing sector. We believe by continuing to reinvest our peso-derived earnings into large format pawn stores outside of the U.S., we will drive long-term shareholder value.” “The strength of our cash flows and balance sheet provide the capacity and flexibility to further drive shareholder value. Our current leverage ratio of 1.9:1 indicates our capacity for additional leverage as future accretive and strategic investment opportunities arise. The Company continued to repurchase stock under the current two million share authorization with 661,000 shares purchased at an aggregate cost of $32 million during the first nine months of 2015. Over the trailing twelve months, the Company has invested $111 million in capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases with a nominal $12 million increase in net debt.” “In addition, we are diligently reducing our exposure to the payday lending space. This year we will close at least 22 of our freestanding stores in Texas, and this portion of the business is expected to contribute less than 4% of revenues. With these closings, we have no remaining consumer loan stores in Texas cities which currently have significant ordinance restrictions on payday lending. The non-cash charge to write off our remaining goodwill from consumer loan operations completely removes the most significant payday lending asset remaining on our balance sheet. Most importantly, the Company can continue to focus on the growth of our pawn stores which offer fully regulated lending products that are significantly safer and more affordable for our customers.” “We continue to believe our pawn operations in both Mexico and the U.S. are well positioned to provide affordable short-term credit to unbanked and underbanked consumers in targeted markets with favorable population and demographic trends. Although we continue to be challenged by headwinds from weaker foreign currency exchange rates, lower gold prices and the expected decline in our non-core payday operations, First Cash has demonstrated a history of consistent revenue and earnings growth in our core, currency-adjusted pawn operations.” \nForward-Looking Information This release contains forward-looking statements about the business, financial condition and prospects of First Cash Financial Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (together, the “Company”).
