We have to use our heads, and not our stomachs,\" Mathunjwa said. \"That has to be taken to structures of AMCU.\" \nOnly at Sibanye does the AMCU have a clear path to a strike that would not be deemed wildcat. \nThe Chamber of Mines has said Harmony and AngloGold will go to court to prevent AMCU from striking because they have signed wage deals with three other unions representing most of their workers. \nThe industry says this means they can apply the same agreement to the rest of their workforce. This happened two years ago in the gold sector, when AMCU was forced to accept agreements signed by other unions. \nSibanye's situation is different: it will only sign an agreement if all four of the unions represented at its operations accept it. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if Sibanye wanted to, it could not impose an agreement on AMCU because the other three unions combined do not represent a majority of its workers.
