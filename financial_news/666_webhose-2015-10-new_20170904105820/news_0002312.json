Senior 1-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nDespite upgrading the stock's rating, the broker downgraded its earnings per share forecasts. For 2015, it reduced EPS expectations by 6pc to reflect increasing headwinds in Senior's Flexonics business - which manufactures heat exchange solutions for the energy and diesel engine markets. \nThomas Rands, of Investec, said: “We believe our new forecasts not only capture the current headwinds, for Flexonics, but also build in some contingency.” \nInvestec also reckons management will confirm conditions have deteriorated across its truck, automotive, power and energy markets over the past two months. Analysts do not forecast growth in operating margins in its aerospace division. \nHowever, amid the negatives, Investec believe Senior's “programme positions, operational flexibility, good and consistent cash generation and robust balance sheet” are all attractive - and undervalue the group at its current share price. \nShares in Senior have fallen by more than 17pc so far this year, and while Investec acknowledges investors are likely to be concerned about the number of downgrades it has received recently, the broker says Senior's performance has been in line with its peers who have faced similar challenges. \nInvestec is not the first broker to turn positive on an engineering company despite the slew of negative notes circulated in recent times. \nOnly last week, Citigroup (Swiss: C.SW - news ) upgraded FTSE 100 Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) as it believes the company’s new chief executive, Andrew Reynolds Smith, can offer it the “fresh start” it needs. \nAndrew Simms, of Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) , said: “We believe a new chief executive provides a fresh perspective to address Smiths’ corporate strategy.” \nThe move by the bank caused shares to rally by more than 2pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:30:11.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
