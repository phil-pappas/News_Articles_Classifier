This followed allegations made in a Citron Research report that the company used specialty pharma Philidor to inflate its revenues. Pearson defended Valeant's accounting practices, and said Philidor made up only 5.5% of its revenues. Valeant said it found no evidence of wrongdoing, and set up a committee to review the issues raised. Shares fell by as much as 13% premarket, but were down by just 3% in the final hour of trading.
