Here are the answers to some of them:\nQ: Will the new guidelines affect what insurance covers?\nA: Not directly. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are required to cover 100% of the cost of annual screening mammograms for women starting at age 40, although that could change in the coming year when the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issues its new guidelines.\nRelated\nNew Guidelines Push Back Age for Mammograms The health law generally requires insurers to cover 100% of preventive services that the task force gives an A or B grade recommendation. But the task force’s 2009 recommendation that women should wait until age 50 and have mammograms every other year created so much controversy that women in Congress added an amendment to have the Affordable Care Act follow the task force’s previous guidelines, endorsing annual screening at age 40, instead.\nThe task force’s proposed new guidelines again call for biennial mammograms starting at age 50 and ending at age 75 , with a B recommendation (based on the strength of the available evidence). It said women who value the benefits more than the harms could start screening in their 40s, but gave that recommendation a C. That could give insurers more leeway to impose cost-sharing on mammograms for younger women or mammograms done annually. But Congress could intervene again and require full coverage.\nEither way, those rules only cover screening mammograms for women at average risk. If a mammogram finds something suspicious, follow-up scans and biopsies are considered “diagnostic” and can be subject to patient deductibles and copays.\nQ: What does the American Cancer Society mean by saying women “should have the opportunity” to start mammograms at 40 and have them annually after 55 if they choose to?\nA: The cancer society is saying that financial or other barriers shouldn’t limit women’s decisions—in short, that mammograms should be fully covered even for those ages.\nQ: Why is the cancer society now recommending annual mammograms starting at 45, not 40?\nA: Researchers weighing the evidence looked at the benefits and risks in five-year intervals, rather than the usual 10-year intervals, and determined that a 40-year-old’s risk of breast cancer was low—closer to a 30-year-old’s than 50-year-old’s—and there was a far greater likelihood that screening women in their early 40s would have a false-positive result than find cancer. In the society’s view, the risk of breast cancer starts to be high enough at age 45 that women should be all screened annually.\nQ: Why did it move to biennial screening for women after age 55, after recommending annual mammograms for so long?\nA: To weigh annual versus biennial screening, the society commissioned a separate study from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, part of the National Cancer Institute. That group found younger women benefited from annual screening because their cancers, though rare, tend to be aggressive. Tumors in postmenopausal women tend to grow slowly enough that annual screening has only a small benefit over biennial screening, but adds significantly to the risk of false positives.\nQ: Why is the American Cancer Society recommending against clinical breast exams?\nA: Richard Wender, the society’s chief cancer control officer, says the group’s main message is that clinical breast exams shouldn’t substitute for mammograms, which give the best chance at finding cancer. He said, “we’re not telling doctors to stop giving them.” But he also said that most clinicians give very brief exams and that a thorough breast exam should take at least three minutes—which the society says could be better spent explaining the new mammography guidelines instead.\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:53:14.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
