Louie Douvis \"With the recent drought stripping between 50-100 basis points from economic growth, the risks to our bottom of consensus forecast of 2.0 per cent GDP growth in 2016 remain to the downside,\" Mr Toohey said.\nThe combination of preemptive independent interest rate hikes by the banking system and the emergence of a new and significant threat to Australia's economic growth comes at a particularly uncomfortable time in Australia's economic cycle, Mr Toohey added.\nHe said financial conditions were at a similar level to where the RBA eased policy in February and May 2015, while momentum in the non-mining economy appeared to have slowed.\n\"Higher mortgage rates will tighten financial conditions further, in the absence of an offsetting rate cut by the RBA and can be expected to further slow underlying activity growth into 2016 when combined with the emergence of drought conditions,\" he said.\n Odds shorten for cuts Financial markets also reacted to Westpac's move, shortening the odds of further RBA easing.\nAccording to one index which tracks interest rate swaps, the chances of 25 basis point cut at the RBA's November policy meeting are now 57 per cent, compared with 39 per cent before Westpac announced its $3.5 billion capital-raising and 0.2 percentage point increase in its variable rate home loan to owner-occupiers and investors.\nA revival of concerns about the slowdown in China, following mixed trade data on Tuesday , and signs that the US Federal Reserve may delay an interest rate increase are also adding to the pressure on the RBA to loosen monetary policy further.\nThis was reflected in a separate index compiled by Citi, which now sees a 100 per cent chance of a rate cut by February and a 60 per cent chance of another move by July.\nSince lowering the cash rate to 2 per cent this year, the RBA has been reluctant to cut further, partly for fear of adding fuel to already overheated residential property markets in Sydney and Melbourne.\nGovernor Glenn Stevens and other officials have also questioned the efficacy of another reduction, while maintaining that the much-needed rebalancing of the Australian economy away from mining-related investment is taking hold.\nSigns of cooling However, much of this transition has been built around housing construction and investment, which is starting to show signs of cooling.\nNew capital adequacy rules and regulatory controls on lending to buy-to-rent or buy-to-sell investors aimed at cooling this segment of the mortgage market are working.\nBy extending these additional interest costs to owner-occupiers, Westpac could help take heat out of this segment of the market, say a range of commentators.\nMacquarie Group, for one, sees houses prices declining by an average 7.5 per cent after March next year.\nAlthough not a huge drop, it would hit the so-called \"wealth effect\" of home-owners, whose spending has been driven by perceptions of growing asset value in the absence of income growth from wages or other investments. A cooling market would also discourage further investment by developers, hitting the jobs market and affecting ancillary spending on furniture and household services. Given the long lead times between housing starts and completion, it could drive supply above demand.\nForce the hand of the RBA With other areas of the economy still sluggish, despite the benefits of a weaker dollar, a slowdown in housing would again force the RBA's hand, says Macquarie Securities analyst James McIntyre.\n\"In our view, the announcement by a major bank of an out-of-cycle 20 basis point rate hike - for investor and owner-occupier loans - all but seals the deal for a November rate cut front the RBA,\" he said.\n\"Other banks are likely to reprice loans at some point,\" he said.\nNomura's fixed income strategist for Australia Andrew Ticehurst agrees Westpac's move could encourage similar increases at the other three big lenders.\n\"A key thing to stress here is that the RBA thinks about is end borrowing and savings rate in the real economy; it adjusts its cash rate to try to achieve desired borrowing and savings rates in the real world,\" he said.\n\"Nomura's house view is for a 25 basis point RBA rate cut in February, and not this year.\n\"But particularly if the other three big lenders follow Westpac's lead, this would of course increase the possibility that the RBA could respond this year,\" he said.\nCredit Suisse equity analyst Damien Boey said on Wednesday that Westpac's move added weight to the bank's view that the RBA would cut rates again.\nHe said latest lending data showed that the macro-prudential crackdown was crimping property investor and buyer activity.\n\"That's all not boding well for the growth outlook when you consider that we are in the middle of a rebalancing exercise and we need the housing and credit-intensive sectors to pick up the slack,\" he said.\n\"I think the issue here is that people are coming around more to the view that rate cuts will be required,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:10:25.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
