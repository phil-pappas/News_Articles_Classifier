Both are approved for the treatment of patients suffering from relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).\nResults will be presented at a European Committee for Research and Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) meeting.\nNew five-year data from the extension study on Lemtrada showed that in the majority of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients when treated with Lemtrada, consistent treatment effects were maintained across relapse, disability, brain atrophy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesion activities for three additional years in the extension study (three, four and five). Moreover, 68% and 60% of the patients treated with Lemtrada in the extension of two pivotal phase III studies – CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II – did not receive additional Lemtrada treatment during the following four years, through month 60.\nOn the safety front, the incidence of most adverse events during the extension study was either comparable or lower than the pivotal studies through year five.\nMeanwhile, new MRI data from a phase III study (TEMSO) on Aubagio showed that the drug significantly slowed brain volume loss (or atrophy) compared to placebo over a period of two years in patients suffering from RMS.\nSanofi’s MS franchise which consists of both Aubagio and Lemtrada registered sales of €468 million in the first half of 2015, reflecting an increase of 118.3% year over year. On the second quarter call, Sanofi had said that the MS franchise is on track to cross more than $1 billion in annualized sales in 2015.\nWhile we are pleased with the encouraging data on MS drugs, we note that the market is highly competitive given the presence of companies like Biogen Inc. BIIB and Novartis AG NVS among others.\nSanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Another favorably ranked stock in the health care sector is AstraZeneca plc AZN carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
