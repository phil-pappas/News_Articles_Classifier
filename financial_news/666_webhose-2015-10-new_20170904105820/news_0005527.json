Backed by CommonFloor.com —Flatchat is a mobile-based platform that helps students and bachelors find accommodation and flatmates. The app has been completely re-designed for the Singapore market, and is expected to be publicly available to users by November 2015. Singapore will be the entry point for Flatchat’s expansion to international territories. Singapore is the fourth-largest financial centre in the world, with a high population density comprising a large community of Indian expats. Additionally, the island city-state receives thousands of students from across the world every year. Finding suitable accommodation here fosters a lot of concern and apprehension among foreign students. Also, the Singapore rental market is highly controlled and expensive, making Flatchat a perfect offering. Commenting on the launch, Sachin, Head of Operations, Flatchat, says, “After months of research, we decided to begin our global expansion with Singapore. I believe Flatchat’s unconventional approach to home rentals, its interactive and quick responsive app and peer-to-peer chat model will be able to create differentiation. This philosophy, apart from eliminating brokerage costs works well with the modern smartphone-savvy generation. We are extremely thankful to CommonFloor for their support.” Sumit Jain, Co-Founder & CEO, CommonFloor.com, commented, “ We are excited for the Flatchat team and the journey that they are embarking on. The objective of simplifying and solving accommodation concerns for students and bachelors in Singapore holds a great opportunity. As a first mover in creating value by building a customer-centric ecosystem for real estate, we are confident of the immense growth potential in this decision to go international. It is a major step in driving future readiness through technology and will translate into growth, for both Flatchat and CommonFloor.” Launched in 2014 by Gaurav Munjal and Hemesh Singh, Flatchat connects the prospective accommodation seeker with home owners or potential flatmates. Within a year of its inception, Flatchat has established a strong user base of more than 150,000 in India. The app is currently available on both Android and iOS platforms.
