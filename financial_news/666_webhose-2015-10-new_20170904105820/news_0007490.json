AP by James Chessell Chinese President Xi Jinping has enjoyed nothing less than the royal treatment during his four-day visit to the United Kingdom.\nFrom a grand state banquet at Buckingham Palace attended by the Queen and Prime Minister David Cameron to an official procession along London's Mall in a golden carriage, the first visit by a Chinese head of state to Britain in a decade has not lacked pomp and ceremony.\nWell before Xi and Cameron enjoyed dinner at the British PM's country retreat, Chequers, on Thursday, both sides had hailed a new \"golden era\" in UK-Chinese relations after decades of hostility over the former colony of Hong Kong. For its part, Downing Street claims the visit by itself will result in more than £30 billion ($64 billion) in deals and investment for Britain.\nDescribing China and Britain as \"global powers with a global outlook\" in a joint press conference on Wednesday, Cameron declared \"we should increase our financial and economic co-operation, with the UK as the partner of choice for China in the West\".\nBut not everyone is happy with the enthusiastic welcome Xi has received. Senior Western military, intelligence and diplomatic figures – including some high-ranking Australian officials – believe Britain is cosying up to China without giving proper consideration to security threats or its own national interests.\n\"By kowtowing to China so uncritically, to put trade before everything else, does show that Britain's international relations are being run out of the [UK] Treasury rather than the Foreign Office and suggests that national and regional security are an afterthought,\" says an Australian government source, requesting anonymity.\n'Shared sense of dismay' Australia's concerns have not been raised at an official level, but the source says there is \"a shared sense of dismay\" among British, Australian and US foreign officials about the government's constant accommodation of Beijing.\n There is no better example of how the UK's approach to China differs from that of Australia and the United States than investment in critical national infrastructure. Britain has actively encouraged Chinese state-owned enterprises to sponsor its nuclear power industry, with the announcement of China General Nuclear Power Corporation's investment in the proposed Hinkley Point reactor in Somerset timed to coincide with Xi's visit.\nThe economic benefits for both sides are obvious. The UK government secures much-needed funding for a big-ticket project which had previously failed to attract much interest from potential investors. By participating in Hinkley Point, which is being built by the French energy group EDF, Beijing will get to construct a nuclear power plant on the Essex coast using its own technology. This will be the first China-designed reactor to be built in the West.\nBut many observers accuse Chancellor George Osborne, who has led the government's efforts to woo China, of ignoring genuine national security concerns raised by the UK Foreign Office, intelligence agencies and high-ranking military officers. One potential threat of allowing China to build such a critical piece of national infrastructure reportedly presented to the British National Security Council is the prospect of a digital \"trapdoor\" or \"loopholes\" being installed in the reactor's computer systems that could allow Beijing to override British control.\n\"It's one thing to do deals with China about buildings or industry, but nuclear is simply a different ballgame altogether,\" says Paul Dorfman, who works at University College London's Energy Institute and has advised the British government and Ministry of Defence on nuclear issues.\n\"America wouldn't touch China with a barge poll, no other European country would touch China with a barge poll. And China would not allow the UK to come and build and operate a nuclear reactor on Chinese soil. It's an astonishing move by the boyish Chancellor … the Foreign Office are, I believe, incandescent about Treasury influence.\"\nCyber-crime concerns Australia does not have nuclear power plants. But Australian Security Intelligence Organisation warnings about potential security breaches prompted the government to block Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from working on the national broadband network.\nOnce again, the British approach could not be more different. Not only was Huawei allowed to supply crucial telecoms hardware for a broadband network built by the privately owned BT – despite the British government not having proper safeguards in place to scrutinise the work – but Xi toured Huawei's UK operations on Wednesday.\nThe UK government argues that its eagerness to do business with China is prudent. \"My message is that Britain can't run away from China,\" Osborne said during his own visit to China last month, where human rights and national security concerns were downplayed. \"Quite the opposite – we should run towards China\".\nRejecting suggestions the UK was compromising its own strategic interests, foreign secretary Philip Hammond this week argued that \"national security depends on economic security\".\nBut experts such as University College London's Dorfman point out that British businesses and government departments are regular targets for cyber attacks carried out by Chinese entities. Xi's visit to the US in September was marked by President Barack Obama 's threat to pursue sanctions against Chinese online espionage, even as both countries reached an agreement not to conduct or support cyber-crime.\nThe subject was raised in a less fractious manner during the British visit, with both sides pledging to end \"cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or confidential business information\". However, not everyone is happy with the pact, given many security analysts believe the US agreement has failed to curb Chinese hacking.\n\"I think that [the UK] should consider sanctions on China, not rolling out the red carpet,\" former Cameron adviser Steve Hilton told the BBC on Tuesday.\nThe other concern expressed by Australian officials about Britain's relationship with China involves the disputed reefs in the South China Sea. Australian and US defence and foreign ministers concluded two days of talks in Boston earlier this month by expressing \"strong concerns\" over China's construction of artificial islands in the contested waters.\nThe UK may be located a long way from the contested area, but the size of its economy and its permanent seat on the UN Security Council mean it retains at least some of its diplomatic influence. Australia and US officials like to describe Britain as a like-minded ally and would hope to have Cameron's whole-hearted support should tensions in the South China Sea escalate.\nThis may well be the case. But it is hard to be confident about the strength of old alliances when the UK is pursuing a foreign policy that appears to put economics before all other concerns.", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:29:05.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
