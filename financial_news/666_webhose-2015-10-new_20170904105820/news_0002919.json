Inpex Corp fell 3.6 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co shed 1.9 percent.\nTrading houses were also lower, with Mitsubishi Corp shed 2.5 percent and Mitsui & Co dropped 2.2 percent.\nOil stumbled 5 percent as traders took profits after last week's surge to an 11-week high, and on a report that OPEC continued to boost crude production despite a persistent glut.\nAirline shares, which benefit from lower fuel costs from cheaper oil, outperformed. ANA Holdings rose 2.2 percent and Japan Airlines Co gained 2.6 percent.\nAnalysts said that while there was a lack of market-moving domestic catalysts, U.S. earnings announcements may set the direction until the end of the month, when many central banks around the world are scheduled to have policy meetings.\n\"Investors brace for weak earnings, but if U.S. companies give positive surprises, the market may be supported,\" said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities.\nHe also said that investors were focused on China's just-published trade data. \"China's imports, which measure domestic demand, are especially closely watched,\" Kuramochi said.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.6 percent to 1,505.92 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 slid 0.7 percent to 13,499.73.\n(Reporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:22:33.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
