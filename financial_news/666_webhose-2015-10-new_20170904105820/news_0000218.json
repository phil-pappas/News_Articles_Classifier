For Sydney, back in 2001 the market rose for three years and three months then slowed. We are at that point now with Sydney,\" Corelogic RP Data's senior research analyst, Cameron Kusher said. Erin Jonasson \"Also some of the push to slow down investor lending is working its way in.\"\nAcross the country, capital city dwelling values rose 0.9 per cent rise in September and 4 per cent lower than the September quarter.\nThe results mirrored auction clearance rates in the major cities. Both Sydney and Melbourne have cooled to clearance rates in the 70s in recent weeks .\nMr Kusher said despite the flat conditions in the dwelling prices, the market is still strong with supply just meeting demand.\n \"The rest of spring will be a bit patchy though,\" he said.\nBrisbane surprises Strong investor interest and a net growth in population in Brisbane is fuelling some of the rise in dwelling prices for the city.\nOver the quarter, Brisbane grew 1.9 per cent and 4.6 per cent for the last 12 months.\nâ€‹While half of Australia's capital cities have seen values rise over the past quarter and year, the other half did not fare as well.\nIn Darwin, dwelling values fell by 3.9 per cent over the 12 months to the end of September, while in Perth, values were 0.9 per cent lower over the year.\nAdelaide home values dropped by 0.3 per cent, and Hobart values are 0.2 per cent lower.\n\"Weakening labour markets, slower population growth and less demand for housing is placing downwards pressure on prices to differing degrees across these markets,\" Corelogic's head of research, Tim Lawless said.\nYields still low While house prices are cooling, rental yields across the cities remained compressed.\nThe lowest gross rental yields can be found in Melbourne where the typical house is now providing a gross return of just 2.9 per cent, and units are providing a gross return of 4.1 per cent, Corelogic said.\nIn Sydney, gross yields are also at a record low with houses providing a gross return of 3.1 per cent and units yielding 4.1 per cent.\n\"With the first month of Spring behind us, it is clear that housing market conditions are being tested, particularly in Sydney,\" Mr Lawless said.\nIt is still better to buy than rent in some parts of Sydney .\nProperty valuer Propell tipped Sydney and Melbourne house prices would slow to 5 per cent growth .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:03:40.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
