That means the markets with the cheapest homes aren't necessarily the most affordable for every worker.\nIn Bakersfield, Calif., the median home value is $166,300 ii , and the average annual teacher salary is $61,000 a year iii . Since people in Bakersfield are accustomed to spending 22 percent of their income on a house payment, a Bakersfield teacher could afford a $310,000 home. In today's market, that includes about 86 percent of the homes on the market iv – more than anywhere else in the country. \nContrast that with a teacher in Salt Lake City, Utah, where teachers make $38,000 a year and people historically spend the same share -- 22 percent -- of their incomes on a mortgage payment. There, teachers could buy a $195,000 home – meaning only about a quarter of the homes on the Salt Lake City market would fall within their budget.\n\"There's a lot more to home buying affordability than just the cost of the home. Incomes vary a lot across the country – even within the same occupation,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Dr. Svenja Gudell. \"There's also the question of how much of your paycheck you're willing to put toward a house payment, and finally, whether you can find a home in your price range. Many potential buyers are checking all the right boxes prior to buying a home – saving a healthy down payment, organizing finances and qualifying for a loan – only to find there are few homes available within their budget and close to their job.\"\nZillow's analysis of affordability by occupation found that lawyers and judges could affordably buy almost every home on the market in Buffalo and Syracuse, NY, but could afford only about 66 percent of the homes for sale in Stockton, Calif.\nFirefighters, whose average salaries range wildly depending on geography, could afford a $583,000 home in Seattle – or a $167,000 home in Little Rock, Ark. Part of the reason for the big difference is that people in Little Rock have historically spent a smaller share of their income on their house payment.\nIn the notoriously expensive San Francisco metro area, food-service workers v could afford less than 10 percent of the homes on the market, even if they spend the market-norm of 37 percent of their income on the monthly payment. Teachers could afford about a third of the listings, while firefighters – who make almost as much as the average lawyer there – could afford three-quarters of the homes for sale in the area.\nTeachers vi \nFirefighters vii \nMetro \nMedian\nIncome \nMaximum\nHome\nPrice \n% of\nListings\nin\nBudget \nMetro \nMedian\nIncome \nMaximum\nHome\nPrice \n% of\nListings\nin\nBudget \nTop 5 \nTop 5 \nBakersfield, CA \n$ 61,000 \n$ 310,000 \n86.4% \nRiverside, CA \n$ 107,000 \n$ 653,000 \n90.9% \nModesto, CA \n$ 57,000 \n$ 335,000 \n84.2% \nCleveland, OH \n$ 68,000 \n$ 319,000 \n89.2% \nBuffalo, NY \n$ 50,000 \n$ 229,000 \n79.7% \nSacramento, CA \n$ 102,000 \n$ 715,000 \n89.2% \nStockton, CA \n$ 51,000 \n$ 332,000 \n79.5% \nToledo, OH \n$ 77,000 \n$ 296,000 \n88.7% \nRiverside, CA \n$ 56,000 \n$ 339,000 \n76.3% \nIndianapolis, IN \n$ 68,000 \n$ 375,000 \n88.1% \nBottom 5 \nBottom 5 \nProvo, UT \n$ 32,000 \n$ 171,000 \n23.8% \nCharlotte, NC \n$ 41,000 \n$ 180,000 \n44.1% \nSalt Lake City, UT \n$ 38,000 \n$ 195,000 \n26.3% \nRichmond, VA \n$ 54,000 \n$ 228,000 \n49.7% \nVirginia Beach, VA \n$ 41,000 \n$ 177,000 \n26.7% \nAugusta, GA \n$ 45,000 \n$ 148,000 \n51.0% \nPortland, OR \n$ 40,000 \n$ 213,000 \n28.5% \nCharleston, SC \n$ 56,000 \n$ 258,000 \n52.5% \nCharleston, SC \n$ 37,000 \n$ 170,000 \n30.4% \nNashville, TN \n$ 45,000 \n$ 198,000 \n53.0% \nLawyers and Judges viii \nConstruction Workers ix \nMetro \nMedian\nIncome \nMaximum\nHome\nPrice \n% of\nListings\nin\nBudget \nMetro \nMedian\nIncome \nMaximum\nHome\nPrice \n% of\nListings\nin\nBudget \nTop 5 \nTop 5 \nBuffalo, NY \n$ 89,000 \n$ 403,000 \n94.7% \nBuffalo, NY \n$ 35,000 \n$ 159,000 \n63.2% \nSyracuse, NY \n$ 105,000 \n$ 436,000 \n94.5% \nToledo, OH \n$ 37,000 \n$ 142,000 \n61.4% \nDayton, OH \n$ 87,000 \n$ 351,000 \n93.8% \nAkron, OH \n$ 35,000 \n$ 152,000 \n59.7% \nScranton, PA \n$ 98,000 \n$ 414,000 \n93.3% \nCleveland, OH \n$ 30,000 \n$ 141,000 \n56.7% \nGrand Rapids, MI \n$ 104,000 \n$ 405,000 \n93.3% \nLas Vegas, NV \n$ 30,000 \n$ 176,000 \n54.7% \nBottom 5 \nBottom 5 \nSpringfield, MA \n$ 29,000 \n$ 165,000 \n36.8% \nPortland, OR \n$ 27,000 \n$ 142,000 \n9.2% \nHonolulu, HI \n$ 70,000 \n$ 601,000 \n63.4% \nColorado Springs, CO \n$ 20,000 \n$ 101,000 \n9.9% \nStockton, CA \n$ 37,000 \n$ 246,000 \n66.5% \nSalt Lake City, UT \n$ 28,000 \n$ 145,000 \n10.9% \nCharleston, SC \n$ 84,000 \n$ 385,000 \n66.5% \nHouston, TX \n$ 24,000 \n$ 84,000 \n12.0% \nWorcester, MA \n$ 58,000 \n$ 306,000 \n66.9% \nVirginia Beach, VA \n$ 30,000 \n$ 128,000 \n12.1% \nAbout Zillow\nZillow® is the leading real estate and rental marketplace dedicated to empowering consumers with data, inspiration and knowledge around the place they call home, and connecting them with the best local professionals who can help.
