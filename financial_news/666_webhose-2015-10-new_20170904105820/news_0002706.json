The U.S. territory defaulted on debt in August by paying only a fraction of what was due on some bonds.\nSome legislators in Washington have also been contemplating imposing a financial control board on Puerto Rico. The idea was debated during a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing.\nThe bill sent to the Puerto Rico legislature by Padilla on Thursday is designed to be independent and nonpartisan, the governor's office said in a statement. The board's five members would be selected by Padilla, \"with the advice and consent of the Puerto Rico Senate,\" according to the statement.\nMembers must have 10 years of expertise in finance, economics or other pertinent fields, cannot be direct holders of Puerto Rican debt and cannot have been government employees in the past five years, the statement said.
