He said Latin America was also weak because of Brazil's recession.\nThird-quarter sales were 2.33 billion euros, giving an organic growth rate of 0.7 percent, compared with 1.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.9 percent in the first.\nAnalysts had been expecting organic sales growth of 2.1 percent in the third quarter, according to company consensus.\nThe results were weaker than number two Omnicom, which reported third-quarter organic sales growth of 6.1 percent on improved margins, but where the dollar's strength caused a 1.1 percent fall in reported revenues to $3.7 billion.\nInterpublic Group also outpaced Publicis on organic sales growth of 7.1 percent and reported sales growth of 1.3 percent on revenue of $1.87 billion.\nAsked to explain the lag with peers who are also heavily exposed to the U.S. market, Levy said that there were differences in the client portfolios, and that Publicis' higher proportion of digital business meant customers could more easily delay or alter projects.\nHe also acknowledged that some of Publicis' teams may have been distracted by the pressures of trying to keep important media buying contracts. He cited U.S.-based agency Starcom MediaVest as an example. The agency recently lost part of a contract with food maker Mondolez to rival Dentsu Aegis and Coca-Cola's U.S. media buying to IPG.\nBig companies are revisiting which agencies they use to place their messages everywhere from television to the web in an effort to cut costs and ensure they are using online, mobile and digital ads effectively.\nSuch media buying contracts account for most of ad agencies' profits, while the creative work of designing ads is less lucrative.\nA debate over billing practices and rebates in media buying has also fuelled distrust, prompting some companies to put their agencies under review.\nThe United States-based Association of National Advertisers, which includes companies that spend more than $250 billion on marketing, recently hired investigators to look into the rebate practices of agencies.\nLevy expressed confidence that the investigation would reveal no wrongdoing at Publicis. \"We scrupulously respect our contracts with clients,\" he said.\nAnalysts said Publicis, which along with IPG was the most exposed to the $27 billion in media buying contracts under review, had done quite well in the initial battle to keep customers with losses offset by wins at Citibank and Etihad among others.\nWith about half of the reviews finished, some big ones remain up for grabs, including key accounts for Publicis such as Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, and Twenty-First Century Fox.\n\"When we look at the results so far, we have come out very well positioned,\" said Levy, adding that some price deflation had been seen on the contracts although it was difficult to give specifics.\n\"Our acquisition of Sapient allows us to offer something really different to clients, and its that approach rather than the price that wins deals.\"\nPublicis shares are up nearly 5 percent this year compared with a 12 percent rise for the European media index, a 7 percent rise for WPP, and a 6 percent drop for Omnicom.\nSmaller rival Havas will publish third-quarter sales after market on Thursday, and WPP on Monday.
