Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jonathan Barrett Former Rabobank money market trader Paul Thompson will face wire and bank fraud charges in the United States should an extradition order proceed.\nThe Perth resident was arrested on Thursday by Australian Federal Police officers and is in Hakea Prison, south of Perth city.\nMr Thompson has been indicted by a grand jury in the US over allegations he conspired to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor; a benchmark used to set the rate on trillions of dollars of bonds, home loans and other interest-rate products around the world.\nAuthorities have been prosecuting traders, and fining banks, for collaborating to shift Libor to a \"fix\" which would make them money on derivatives linked to the rate.\nThe rate could be manipulated because it required participating banks to submit rates they could theoretically borrow at in the market, rather than actual prices, which opened the way for false pricing. The Libor process has since been overhauled.\nPaul Thompson is facing extradition on \"wire and bank fraud\" charges unknown \"Mr Thompson is wanted to face prosecution in the United States for wire and bank fraud offences,\" a spokesperson for the Attorney-General's Department said.\n\"As the matter is now before the court, it would not be appropriate to comment further.\"\nAccording to extradition procedures, Mr Thompson will only be released on bail if a magistrate determines there to be \"special circumstances\" that justify bail be granted.\nA magistrate normally determines whether the former head of Rabobank's money market and derivatives trading for south-east Asia is surrendered to the US; however there are provisions in the law that can allow that person to be prosecuted in Australia if directed by the Attorney General or relevant minister.\n Mr Thompson could also simply consent to the extradition and face trial in the US; or alternatively, he could fight any order through an appeals process.\nThe Fremantle-born Mr Thompson, who has a family home on the upmarket Perth suburb of Dalkeith, worked in Rabobank's Singapore office from 2006 to 2011 as head of money market trading. More recently, he has been working for a Perth real estate agent.\nA family spokesman said Mr Thompson would apply for bail, and that he hoped to defend himself against the allegations in Australia or the United Kingdom.\n\"The family had hoped that, as this case evolved, Paul could have an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations in either Australia or the UK,\" the spokesman said.\n\"In either of those countries he would have good access to the necessary evidence, witnesses, financial and emotional support to defend himself properly. This would be in the same way that some of the UK citizens involved in this investigation have had the opportunity to defend themselves at home.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:35:20.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
