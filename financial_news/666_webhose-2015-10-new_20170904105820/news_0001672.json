It's interesting that First Data cut its price and not the offering size,\" said Francis Gaskins, president of research firm IPO Desktop.\nAtlanta-based First Data, which hived off money-transfer giant Western Union in 2006, plans to use proceeds from the IPO to reduce its debt of about $21 billion.\n(Reporting by Rachel Chitra in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Richa Naidu; Editing by Ted Kerr and Anil D'Silva)\nIPOs First Data Corp initial public offering", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:58:56.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
