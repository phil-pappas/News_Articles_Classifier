Picture: THE TIMES Related articles SABC charges embattled COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng with misconduct Motsoeneng’s appeal to Constitutional Court abuse of court process, says DA Motsoeneng remains in office despite DA’s push to compel his suspension In this article Companies and organisations: South African Broadcasting Corporation BELEAGUERED South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng has effectively been suspended pending his disciplinary hearing, the broadcaster confirmed in a letter sent to the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Tuesday.\nLast week Mr Motsoeneng, who has been fighting tooth and nail to hold onto his high-paying job, took a voluntary leave of absence until the completion of disciplinary hearings against him.\nHowever, the DA raised concern that his leave of absence did not amount to a suspension and so he could still exercise his powers as chief operating officer.\nThe opposition party then threatened to seek an order of contempt against the SABC for refusing to implement the suspension.\nIn the letter to the DA dated October 20 2015, the SABC’s lawyers confirmed that the public broadcaster accepted \"the terms as contained in paragraph 6 of your letter of October 18 2015 in relation to Mr Motsoeneng’s voluntary leave of absence\".\nThis means Mr Motsoeneng will not be allowed to access the premises of the SABC, other than for the purpose of attending his disciplinary inquiry; he will not be allowed to contact any SABC employees, or access any company documents, either physically or electronically; and he will not exercise any of the powers of the chief operating officer or participate in matters relating to the board or in the governance of the SABC.\n\"As such the DA reached a settlement that we would postpone the application for contempt of court indefinitely as our concerns have been addressed and satisfied in full. Should we be concerned about the terms not being met, we will be entitled to approach court again,\" said DA federal executive chairman James Selfe on Wednesday.\nHe said it was critical that an \"independent person\" presides over the disciplinary proceedings.\nMr Motsoeneng faces various charges of misconduct including gross dishonesty and abuse of position. His disciplinary hearing is scheduled for October 30.\nHe lodged the appeal to the highest court last week, in which he is challenging a landmark Supreme Court of Appeal judgment handed down earlier this month.\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal judgment confirmed the public protector’s powers and also ruled that Mr Motsoeneng be suspended pending a disciplinary hearing.\nThe High Court in Cape Town had earlier ruled that he be suspended pending a disciplinary hearing, but found that the public protector’s remedial actions were not binding.\nMr Motsoeneng’s long-running court battles stem from a damning public protector report released in February 2014, which found he had fraudulently misrepresented his qualifications, irregularly increased his salary and purged senior staff who disagreed with him.\nThe appellate court said that, given Mr Motsoeneng’s position at the public broadcaster, the disciplinary process risked being compromised if he remained in his position while it unfolded.\n© BDlive 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:51:58.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
