CREDAI and its members have put up several hoardings across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai to appeal for the token strike and protest. Also for the next one month, builders would wear a black ribbon as a mark of protest.   Through its hoardings, CREDAI is stating, \"Dear System, We want to live! Stop Killing Us! This is in reference with the death of Cosmos Group chief Suraj Parmar, President of Thane chapter of Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry (CREDAI-MCHI). Last week, Parmar, chairperson and managing director of the Cosmos Group, shot himself with his personal .32 calibre pistol in a sample bungalow at one of his upcoming projects at Kasarvadavli in Thane. Parmar had left a 15-page suicide note, in which he blamed red tape and non-payment of loans as primary reasons for the drastic step.      In its hoarding, CREDAI said, \"This is an appeal from CREDAI and its members to the Government to create the right atmosphere of trust and co-operation. And take action to prevent delay in projects due to political interference and corruption so that we could invest all our strength in building a strong nation.\"   Although, the builders have called for a strike and protesting against wrong policies and corruption of the 'system', there is limited sympathy for them. This is because the ordinary people hold builder lobby primarily responsible for high prices of homes in and around Mumbai and lack of unaffordable homes.  However, there is no denial about the fact that rampant corruption and collusion with politicians are important factors. It is good that this is now out in the open and will hopefully turn the heat on the government to ensure a clean-up.   Apparently, a press conference of the builder's body in Mumbai was cancelled due to some pressure from political quarters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:34:17.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
