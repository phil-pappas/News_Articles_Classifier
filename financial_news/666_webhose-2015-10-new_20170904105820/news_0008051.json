Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Nick Lenaghan Giant Malaysian sovereign developer UEM Sunrise has few concerns over settlement risk as it launched construction of the tallest residential apartment tower in the Melbourne CBD.\nThe $770 million, 92-storey Aurora Melbourne Central, with 941 apartments and 250 serviced apartments, will not be finally complete until late 2019.\nBefore then owners of lower level units will be able to take up residence, even as concrete is being poured on the higher level.\nUEM Sunrise managing director Anwar Syahrin Abdul Ajib, played down the prospect of buyers failing to settle, pointing to the considerable diversification by country of Aurora's buyers.\nAround 70 per cent of the buyers are from offshore, including China, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Europe.\n\"That gives us comfort,\" he said. \"We have that risk, yes, but it is within manageable levels.\"\nAlso mitigating settlement risk is the fact that foreign buyers usually borrow on significantly lower loan-to-value ratios than their typically highly leveraged Australian counterparts.\nForeign buyers usually have the capacity to pay in full by cash but employ some debt for tax purposes, he said.\n This month the Reserve Bank of Australia sounded its strongest warning yet on the potential for over-supply in some apartment markets, including Melbourne .\nSettlement risks The central bank warned about the prospect of price drops and subsequent settlement risk as buyers of off-the-plan apartments were forced to tip in more of their own cash.\nThe prospect of settlement risk has become a hot topic among developers and bankers as lenders further tighten borrowing criteria.\nLast week Lend Lease chief Steve McCann confronted the issue directly, pointing to his group's strong pre-sales and solid margins .\nThomson Geer property lawyer Eu Ming Lim, who is acting for UEM Sunrise on the Aurora project, said the settlement risk associated with overseas buyers had been overstated.\n\"A significant portion of good-quality overseas purchasers would provide personal funds for settlement with the balance coming from the local Australian banks,\" he said.\n\"The reality would appear to be that purchasers are usually able to provide all personal funds if required, or alternatively contribute additional equity even if there was a shortfall.\"\nAmbitious scale Addressing the launch event, architect Callum Fraser, of Elenberg Fraser, acknowledged the scale of the project, whose unique design has been modelled on Malaysia's national flower, the hibiscus.\n\"I've never been so terrified in my life heading to market with 1000 apartments,\" Mr Fraser quipped.\nAurora, to be constructed by Probuild, is already sold out while a second 446-apartment project, Conservatory, also in the CBD has has sold around 70 per cent so far.\nUEM Sunrise is now turning its mind to a residential conversion of the former police complex on St Kilda Road and will consider other opportunities, including the mooted the White Bay redevelopment in Sydney.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@NickLenaghan", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/115129227206723134737/posts"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:02:06.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
