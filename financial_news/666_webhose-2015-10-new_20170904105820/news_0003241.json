Sales were down in eight out of the 21 main industries, accounting for about half the sector. In volume terms, sales fell by 0.1 percent.\nSales declined for a third consecutive month in the petroleum and coal product sector, falling 5.2 percent as both prices and the volume of products sold declined.\nThe steep drop in the price of oil, a major export for Canada, put the country in a mild recession in the first half of the year but economists and policymakers expect growth picked back up in the second half of 2015.\nThe decline in factory sales in August was tempered by a 6.7 percent increase in sales in the motor vehicle assembly industry after maintenance shutdowns in July.\nNew orders tumbled 5.6 percent due to declines in the aerospace product and parts sector, while overall inventories rose 0.5 percent.\n(Reporting by Leah Schnurr ; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:51:30.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
