It has badly affected investment demand,” Rastogi said.\nStill, next month India will celebrate Dhanteras and Diwali, when demand could improve, she added.\nGlobal gold prices are on track to post their third straight annual loss this year, already down nearly 40 percent since hitting a record high in 2011.\nDealers in India were offering a discount of $8 to $12 an ounce this week, compared to $7 to $11 last week.\nDemand from rural areas has been hit particularly hard as farmers suffer from the first back-to-back drought in India in three decades.\nTwo-thirds of gold demand in India comes from farmers and residents of small villages who see jewellery as way to store wealth. But lower-than-normal monsoon rainfall this year due to El Nino weather pattern has eroded rural incomes.\n“Demand from rural areas has moderated due to drought. Jewellers from the countryside made thin purchases in the last few weeks,” said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bank.\nElsewhere in Asia, demand remained lacklustre. In top consumer China, prices on the Shanghai Gold Exchange ticked up to a premium from a small discount late last week, though dealers at bullion banks said physical buying wasn’t strong.\n“Demand is very sluggish,” said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers Ltd in Hong Kong, adding that a strong dollar and a recent price rally was hurting demand.\nIn Hong Kong this week, premiums dropped to 80 to 90 cents an ounce, from $1.20-$1.30 last week.\nFirst Published on October 22, 2015 7:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:05:25.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
