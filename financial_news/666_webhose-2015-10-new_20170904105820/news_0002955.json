The Federal Reserve earlier this week said Synchrony could function as a standalone company. \nThe conglomerate overall reported third-quarter net earnings of $2.51 billion, or 25 cents per share, compared with $3.54 billion, or 35 cents per share, a year ago. \nExcluding special items, earnings of 29 cents a share exceeded the average estimate of analysts by three cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nRevenue fell 1.3 percent to $31.68 billion, weighed by a 16 percent slump in its segment supplying equipment and services to oil and gas customers, which has been hurt by weak crude prices. \nRevenue in its aviation segment increased 5 percent, while revenue in its power and water division, its biggest segment, grew 1 percent. \n(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York; Editing by W Simon and Bernadette Baum)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:00:41.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
