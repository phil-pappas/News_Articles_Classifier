Chris Hyde Share on twitter by James Chessell NBN chairman Ziggy Switkowski says the combination of video on demand services such as Netflix and larger broadband data packages means most broadcast television is now irrelevant to young Australians.\nMr Switkowski said households that subscribed to video on demand services were now downloading the equivalent of \"several movies a day every day of the week\" which was changing the viewing habits of consumers.\n\"There is no doubt that if you are under 20, the notion you would watch broadcast television for anything other than sport is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\"They can't believe that there was a generation that allowed network programmers to determine when we get to watch things and that we could only watch an episode a week. It's a completely different view and perfectly understandable.\"\n\"There is no doubt that if you under 20, the notion you would watch broadcast television for anything other than sport is ridiculous,\" said Ziggy Switkowski. Free-to-air television networks rely on \"linear\" channels with regular schedules to attract the bulk of their audiences.\nHowever, the popularity of online services such as Netflix and Apple's iTunes has prompted networks to launch their own VOD offerings.\nSeven West Media and pay television group Foxtel have formed the Presto joint venture while Nine Entertainment group has teamed up with Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review , to launch Stan .\nWhile sport remains an example of \"appointment viewing\" because it is broadcast live – the AFL grand final attracted a bumper capital city audience of 2.6 million people for Seven – growing numbers of viewers are using VOD to watch other programs such as dramas, comedies and movies when they want.\nAlmost 10 per cent of Australian households subscribe to a VOD service, according to research company Roy Morgan, and Netflix is the most popular. Bloomberg Mr Switkowski said the growth in average household broadband data allowances from the growth in average monthly data allowances for Australian households from about 20GB \"three years ago\" to around 120GB now was \"substantially the Netflix effect\".\n\"Netflix had less than 10 per cent of households yet they were accounting for a quarter of all the data traffic,\" he said.\nFive to 10 movies a day \"When you worked it out, it meant they were downloading [the equivalent of] between five and 10 movies a day per household.\"\nNBN's satellite Sky Muster launches from Guiana Space Centre last week. NBN / YouTube Nearly 10 per cent of Australian households subscribe to a VOD service, according to research company Roy Morgan. The same research found Netflix was the most popular provider of VOD services.\nMr Switkowski is a former chief executive of telecommunications giant Telstra, which owns 50 per cent of Foxtel. Rupert Murdoch's media and entertainment company, News Corporation, owns the other 50 per cent.\nThe NBN launched the first of two $500 million satellites into orbit last week . The satellites, which blasted off from South America, will provide around 200,000 homes and businesses in remote areas with improved peak download speeds of 25mb/second.\nHowever, the growing popularity of bigger data plans had raised concerns the two satellites would not have the capacity to cater for medium-term demand in the bush.\nMr Switkowski conceded some people in remote areas will ask, \"why can't we have Netflix-like data allowances so we too can several movies a day?\"\nHowever, he argued that \"in the next year or two there is going to be such an improvement in their experience that the pressure on us will be how fast we can get them on the new satellites\".\nThe NBN believes it can also improve and expand its fixed-wireless service in regional areas to handle additional demand in remote communities.\n\"With the two satellites, I think we've bought ourselves several years,\" Mr Switkowski said.\n\"And then you say in five years' time, 'what is their requirement going to be and will there be an experience gap? If you are looking for problems, will there be one or two per cent of the population that feels like they're missing out?' Possibly.\"\nThe reporter travelled to French Guiana as a guest of the NBN", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/netflix-and-other-videostreaming-services-could-overtake-foxtel-by-2018-20150807-gitnzi.html", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell"], "published": "2015-10-05T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:59:51.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
