Boubyan owns 9 percent of Equate. \nOnce the deal is finalised, Boubyan is not expected to provide any financing to or inject any funds into Equate, the statement said. \nLast November, Dow said that as part of a $7-8.5 billion divestment plan, it would reduce its equity positions in all of its Kuwaiti ventures in order to release capital for other strategic purposes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:17:58.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
