One, of course, is trackside for the spring racing carnivals at Sydney's Royal Randwick racecourse and Melbourne's Moonee Valley next Saturday for the Cox Plate in the lead-up to the Melbourne Cup next month. However, the other is where the interest lies for non-horsey types: real estate. While serious money was changing hands at the various tracks at the weekend, spotted cruising the streets of Sydney's eastern suburbs attending the open for inspections of some serious piles of bricks was Freelancer chief Matt Barrie . And it seems his wheels of choice is a Hummer-style vehicle, complete with customised number plates, said to look a bit like FLANCR, as spotted by a CBD spy as the car rumbled past. Whether he is just engaging in the weekend sport of rubbernecking at some posh houses, or is in the market to buy, time will tell. Barrie, who listed his outsourcing company in November 2013, has also been in the news of late, saying that start-ups and technology companies should be put on the national agenda for debate to prevent the brain drain of young Australians in the tech and start-up sector, who are heading overseas, particularly to Silicon Valley. He reckons this sector will be the one to replace the mining sector as the engine for growth for the economy and, therefore, needs some government attention.\nNarrow victory Rupert Murdoch has survived a vote to eliminate his News Corp dual listing by an activist shareholder, but only just. The results of the annual general meeting, which was held in New York on October 14 and lodged with the SEC two days later, showed the vote on the dual listing recorded 89.6 million against, narrowly nudged out the 87.8 million that voted for the motion. Loyal shareholders include Mr Murdoch and his family trust who together hold 39.4 per cent of News Corp's voting stock, equal to about 78.7 million shares. They also supported the News Corp board's executive compensation, with 138.8 million saying \"yes\", against the 38.5 million who voted \"nay\".\nPumped up Advertisement Talk around the petrol bowsers is that a sale in some form of United Petroleum is back on the agenda. Melbourne-based founding owners Avi Silver and Eddie Hirsch have been looking at a float of the business for a while. It has about 8 per cent of the country's retail fuel distribution market and owns 330 petrol stations throughout the country, along with a further 80 wholesale stations. KPMG, which is advising, is tight-lipped about any deal. However, word is that bankers have been making some discreet calls to property agents asking how to value a petrol station. It was said earlier in the year that United Petroleum could bundle its stations into a real estate investment trust, but those plans were apparently put on the back-burner. Sales of petrol stations have been in the news with 7-Eleven and supermarket/petrol giant Woolworths raising more than $200 million over the past few years, combined, from the sale and leaseback of petrol stations. Yields on those leasehold sales were about 5.1 per cent.\nWalk with a wish\nNothing like a bit of interstate rivalry to get the wallets open. Real estate group CBRE held its annual Walk for a Wish charity event on Friday. More than 1000 staff trekked 10 kilometres concurrently across capital cities and raised more than $220,000 for Starlight, beyondblue and UNICEF, taking the total amount raised since 2009 to more than $1 million. To boost donations, the CBRE Melbourne and Sydney office had a bet as to which would raise more cash and Sun City won, meaning the southerners must fly the NSW flag in their boardroom for a week. And anyone walking along Bourke Street Mall may also see CBRE's Victorian managing director, Mark Coster , sporting a new look, because he shaved his head to raise more cash. Adding to the cause was Sydney-based CBRE director Brendan Jordan , who raised over $4000 and got a Friar Tuck haircut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:27:57.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
