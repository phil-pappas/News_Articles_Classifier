REUTERS/Thomas Peter/Files By Alex Lawler\nLONDON (Reuters) - Oil eased further below $50 a barrel on Wednesday, falling for a third day, on concern a supply glut will persist and demand slow down as economic growth moderates in No. 2 consumer China.\nChinese growth for the third quarter is expected to fall below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday the oil market would remain oversupplied in 2016.\nBrent crude was down 5 cents at $49.19 a barrel as of 0824 GMT. Brent fell to $42.23 on Aug. 24, the lowest since March 2009. U.S. crude was up 1 cent at $46.67.\n\"Prices should remain low,\" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures. \"We are still in oversupply.\"\nThe IEA forecast on Tuesday that oil demand growth would slow next year and a potential increase in supply from Iran would counter slowing output from the United States and other countries outside OPEC, keeping the market oversupplied. [IEA/M]\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2014 dropped its longstanding policy of supporting prices by cutting output, choosing instead to defend market share against higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale oil.\nIn a sign the strategy is working, a forecast from the U.S. Energy Information Administration sees U.S. shale production falling by the most on record in November, extending a nationwide output decline into a seventh month.\nStill, the latest round of weekly U.S. supply reports is likely to suggest no end to the glut is yet in sight. \nAnalysts expect reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Department of Energy (EIA) will show crude stocks rose by 2.9 million barrels. \nThe API releases its data at 2030 GMT, followed by the EIA on Thursday.\nOPEC has shown no interest in cutting production to support prices, but cash-strapped member Venezuela has been pushing for the group once again to control output and seek a \"floor\" for prices at $70.\nVenezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino said on Tuesday eight non-OPEC countries had been invited to attend an Oct. 21 technical meeting of oil experts, which will discuss Venezuela's suggestion of a price floor.\n\n(Additional reporting by Meeyoung Cho in Seoul; Editing by Dale Hudson)\nCommodity Markets International Energy Agency", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:42:52.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
