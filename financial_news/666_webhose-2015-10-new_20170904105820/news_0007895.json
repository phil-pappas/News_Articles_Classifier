It is poised to launch its winter bestseller , a mocha iced coffee, which has been placed by Tesco at the front of 1,300 supermarkets. Tesco has also just accepted its slim can into its Meal Deal offering, which the Cregans predict will drive a 60pc increase in sales. \nIn recent years, small suppliers have complained of Tesco’s tough payment terms but the founders say their deal with the grocery giant is “superb”. \n\"They were very supportive during [the manufacturing issue] and ensured shelves were restocked to their fullest when we received stock again,” says Ms Cregan. \nThe pair borrowed £140,000 from their parents to start Jimmy’s Iced Coffee and owed their production facility £250,000, but the company is now debt free \nIf the acquisition deal goes ahead, the siblings plan to stay with the business and “do all the fun entrepreneurial stuff”, Ms Cregan said, adding that their ambitions were still focused on the start-up. “We want to be in every fridge, in the travel and convenience sector, across the globe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:49:23.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
