These cells are then filled with enamels, usually finely ground glass in paste form, which are then fired in a kiln.\nDetail of a large cloisonne enamel yenyen vase from the late Ming/early Qing dynasty, 17th century, which is estimated at $50,000-$70,000. Both Leonard Joel and Sotheby's Australia offer interesting examples at next week's spring decorative arts sales among a mix of Asian, Australian and European antiques and art.\nJoel's sale is in Melbourne on Sunday and Sotheby's in Sydney on Tuesday. Sotheby's catalogue cover features an impressive 70cm high cloisonné \"yenyen\" vase dating to the 17th century, the late Ming/early Qing era, which is expected to fetch $50,000 to $70,000. The elaborately shaped body is profusely decorated with enamelled flowers and vines, with gilt-bronze dragon handles.\nSotheby's Asian art consultant Ann Roberts says prices for good cloisonné increased considerably about two years ago. \"Now, for early pieces, 15th century for instance, [prices] are very high,\" she says.\nThis piece, which she describes as very large and impressive, was consigned by a Sydney vendor. Originally acquired from Beijing by a Scot in the late 19th century, it was brought to Australia by descendants. A number of potential buyers have asked for condition reports but she says the piece has only some minor issues and can easily be put back to original condition.\n Also notable is an unusually large (60.5cm) 19th century rhinoceros horn libation cup which has a pre-sale estimate of $60,000 to $80,000. Coloured a rich caramel, it is deeply carved along its full length, and has a provenance to Sotheby's Belgravia in 1977 and subsequently the collection of the prominent Zorich family of Adelaide.\nFrom the same Adelaide source is an unusual carved rhino horn chalice (estimate $50,000 to $70,000) and several fine 19th century ivory chess sets.\nThe sale offers a selection of 19th/20th century Chinese furniture in the sought-after huanghuali wood, as well as porcelain, ivory and jade. Among the European art are paintings, vintage Max Dupain photographs, and antique furniture, clocks, silver and glass.\nJoel's most spectacular cloisonné item is a large plate or charger, decorated in bright enamels with nine cavorting dragons in the waves. Dating from the 19th century, it is 84cm in diameter and estimated at $2500 to $3200.\nAmong Joel's top Chinese lots is a Tang dynasty (618-906AD) silver box and cover of foliate form 33cm in diameter, decorated with deer, cranes and phoenixes - both the shape and motifs reflecting Sassanian (Persian) influence. It is estimated at $15,000 to $20,000.\nAlso from the Tang era at Joel's is a large standing figure of a plump-cheeked lady in flowing robes holding a mirror, apparently based on an eighth-century emperor's beloved concubine (estimate $35,000 to $45,000).\nAnother rarity is a blue and white porcelain plate circa 1680 bearing the Dutch East India Company initials, the entwined VOC, but of Japanese origin rather than Chinese. It is said to be one of a small number of Arita wares made for use by officers serving in Dutch territories when China's Ming dynasty collapsed in 1644.\nAmong the other fascinating offerings at Joel's: scientific instruments including a unique 1799 military and naval rangefinder telescope and, from a single owner collection of Australiana, a rare wood panel of a cockatoo by Robert Prenzel and a host of Australian ceramics painted by art heavyweight Arthur Boyd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:06:48.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
