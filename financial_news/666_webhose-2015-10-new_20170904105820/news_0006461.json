Speaking at a seminar here, Rajan stressed that the Indian tax system should be transparent and predictable to attract foreign investments.   According to him, to make products in India, a framework has to be created making it easy to do business in the country.   He also said the supply side issues have to be addressed so that prices were under control and the demand side was taken care of.   Stating that nine percent growth in economy was an aspiration, Rajan said the supply side constraints had to be removed while ruling out growth sans inflation.   He said the human capital in the country needed to be upgraded so that businesses get the kind of people it requires.   Rajan also called for greater coordination between leading central banks so that the monetary policies can be used in a more effective manner.
