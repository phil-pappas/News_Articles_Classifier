So I'm delighted to join the In Campaign's board as Chair, and I look forward to introducing the rest of the board at our campaign event on Monday.\" \nLord Rose spent seven years at M&S as chief executive and chairman and is expected to make the business case for Britain remaining in the EU. He is currently chairman of Ocado, FatFace and Oasis Dental Care. \nThe Conservative peer will do battle with another Tory member of the House of Lords, former Chancellor Lord Lawson, who is leading the Conservative campaign to leave the EU. \nSeveral campaigns are jockeying for position as the referendum battle shifts up a gear. \nOn Friday a cross party group of donors and politicians launched the “Vote Leave” campaign , while the rival “Leave EU” - backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage - was unveiled last month. \nA third campaign group, Business for Britain, is focusing on putting the economic case for leaving the EU. \n:: Analysis: Focus On 'No' Leaves 'Yes' Void \nThe announcement about Lord Rose comes as David Cameron met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss his renegotiation strategy. \nMrs Merkel had a working lunch with the Prime Minister at his country residence, Chequers. \nMr Cameron is attempting to reform Britain’s relationship with the EU ahead of the referendum on its membership and the German Chancellor will be key to whether or not his strategy is successful. \nEarlier he met the Estonian Prime Minister as part of his attempt to build alliances ahead of the crucial renegotiations. \nPrime Minister Taavi Roivas told Sky News after the meeting: “I do agree with David Cameron that even the best unions can be made better. \n“We can be open to discussions and I think David Cameron will be taken very seriously and we'll find a way to make the EU stronger together. \n\"I believe that we can listen to David's ideas and use many of them to make the EU a better place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:42:27.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
