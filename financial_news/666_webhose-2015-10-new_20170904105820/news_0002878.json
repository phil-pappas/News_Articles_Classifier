Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The home of high-profile chef Neil Perry's Rockpool restaurant in Sydney's Bridge Street has exchanged hands for $8.51 million.\nA Hong-Kong-Australian family, through their company I-Fung Pty Ltd, acquired the landmark strata retail property at lot 2 of 7-11 Bridge Street in the financial end of the Sydney CBD.\nLeased to the Star Restaurant Group trading as Rockpool Est. 1989 until 2023, the 490-square-metre property at the historical Burns Philps building rakes in a 6.78 per cent yield.\nA staple meeting venue for corporate executives, 7-11 Bridge Street is Rockpool's global flagship restaurant in the Rockpool Group.\nOther restaurants in the group include Rockpool Bar & Grill Sydney and Spice Temple on Hunter Street.\nThe building has been substantially reconstructed behind its original facade.\nKnight Frank's Andy Hu and Dominic Ong negotiated the off-market sale for a private owner.\n\"The strata retail asset is famously leased to Rockpool, who is considered to be the most iconic name in Australian fine dining, and is the key reason for this passive investment,\" Mr Hu said.\n \"This is one of the largest retail sales in the Sydney CBD this year, thus far.\"\nIn dollar terms, the Rockpool sale would be the largest in 2015 but sources on Wednesday confirmed Bvlgari House on Castlereagh Street has sold for just under $30 million.\nThe property on a 975-square-metre site with a sandstone facade with a long-term lease to a Bvlgari jewellery store was sold to a high-net-worth Spaniard.\nThe Rockpool property exchanged at $17,367 a square metre and Bvlgari House at $25,641 a square metre, but both these rates are not the highest for Sydney.\nIn May, I-Fung Pty Ltd also picked up a 19-square-metre \"hole in the wall\" at shop 2, 70 Pitt Street for $2.2 million. Leased to Batch Coffee Pty Ltd, the transaction translates to $113,684 a square metre.\nThe southern end of the Sydney CBD, on George Street, near Chinatown was the surprising winner of the most expensive retail real estate in Sydney: 50-square-metre Shop B at 653 George Street sold for $3.5 million in April for about $70,000 a square metre.\nClose by, investors paid $5.6 million for Shop 181 at 569 George Street in May or $64,500 a square metre.\nA Pie Face outlet was not cheap either: 234 George Street sold for just over $4 million, about $73,182 a square metre in April.\n\"While opulent, the Rockpool deal was just average,\" Mr Hu said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:07:51.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
