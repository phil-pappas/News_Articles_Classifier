On Wednesday, police fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse students who blocked two key entrances to the institution’s campus.\nA similar meeting between management and student leaders is scheduled at the Tshwane University of Technology, which likewise saw protests at some campuses.\nThe Democratic Alliance Students Organisation (Daso) said on Wednesday it would picket outside the Department of Higher Education and Training’s headquarters in Pretoria.\nDaso will demand the removal of Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande, while the broader position of the DA is that student protests should refocus on the lack of state financial support for universities.\nNational Shutdown Collective member Anele Nzimande said on Wednesday the grouping of organisations — which co-ordinated on the demands but remained open and nebulous — was demanding that the Department of Higher Education and Training respond by Friday to co-ordinated demands. The demands include an announcement of a fee decrease percentage for 2016 and a move towards free tertiary education.\nThere were continuing attempts to co-ordinate with students at Technical Vocational Education and Training colleges and agricultural colleges but this was difficult, said Ms Nzimande.\nMedia coverage had focused on formerly white institutions, which itself was reflective of structural problems, and the movement aimed to be as inclusive as possible, she said.\nWith RDM Newswire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:51:20.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
