But the growth rate would be significantly higher than the 10-year average of 2.5 percent.\nHoliday sales rose 4.1 percent in 2014, said the NRF. Its forecast is a closely watched benchmark for the upcoming holiday season.\nNRF President and Chief Executive Officer Matthew Shay said while some economic indicators have improved, U.S. consumers remained \"somewhat torn between their desire and their ability to spend\" due to worries about the economy.\n\"Potential disruptions from yet another government shutdown in mid-December and a slower pace of job creation and income growth are just a few key factors that will impact holiday shoppers' spending this year,\" Shay said.\nThe NRF said holiday sales will account for 19 percent of the industry's $3.2 trillion in annual sales. Many retailers earn an outsized portion of their profits during the holiday.\nOnline sales are expected to increase by 6 percent to 8 percent during the holiday to as much as $105 billion, the NRF predicted.
