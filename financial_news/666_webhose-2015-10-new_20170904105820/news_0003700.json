She said the deposit “is a big opportunity cost.” The two companies reiterated on Oct. 9 that they’re still considering the terms of a possible offer.\nHong Kong-listed Shanshui has been mired in a shareholders’ fight for control since April amid President Xi Jinping’s call to cull weaker firms in industries grappling with overcapacity. Its largest shareholder Tianrui International Holding Co. has been trying to change Shanshui’s board. Shanshui’s 2020 notes, sold at 98.98 cents on the dollar in March, plunged to as low as to 80.3 in July amid the squabble.\n“The deposit suggests the official general offer from CNBM and ACC is drawing closer, which is positive for Shanshui bonds,” said Ross Lee, a credit analyst at Bank of China Hong Kong Ltd.\nInvestors have speculated that a bigger shareholding by state-owned CNBM could mean higher certainty of repayment of the bonds.\nHenry Li, chief financial officer of Shanshui, confirmed the deposit, adding Shanshui also got the information from Asia Cement. An operator at CNBM wouldn’t connect to its investor relations department.\nShanshui’s $500 million of 2020 notes rose 0.83 cent on the dollar to 94 cents as of 12:26 p.m. in Hong Kong, the highest since Aug. 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:42:35.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
