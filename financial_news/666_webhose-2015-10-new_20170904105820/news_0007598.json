James Alcock Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan The tables have turned in the Sydney housing market with more sellers looking to offload properties in September this year compared to a year ago, research group SQM Research said.\nProperty listings in Sydney rose 7.6 per cent in the month of September and increased 11.1 per cent compared to the same time a year ago.\n\"The Sydney surge in listings is another indicator now suggesting that the Sydney housing market is now slowing,\" SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher said.\n\"Buyers should now find there is a little more choice out there compared to earlier this year. Yet, I note that asking prices are still higher. I suspect vendors are not quite registering that conditions have changed somewhat since the white hot market of autumn.\"\nMelbourne, on the other hand, had fewer listings in September this year compared to last year.\n\"This is suggestive of a strong housing market that is not slowing down at all,\" Mr Christopher said.\nMelbourne also had the highest increase in dwelling values in September at 2.4 per cent beating Sydney's marginal rise of 0.1 per cent, according to Corelogic RP Data.\nNationally, housing stock for sale is down 0.1 per cent compared to last year.\n Sydney, Perth and Darwin had more stock but Melbourne and Hobart had less.\n\"Weakening labour markets, slower population growth and less demand for housing is placing downwards pressure on prices to differing degrees across these markets,\" Corelogic RP Data's head of research Tim Lawless said this month.\n\"With the first month of Spring behind us, it's clear that housing market conditions are being tested, particularly in Sydney.\"\nWhile Sydney is cooling - auction clearance rates continue to hover around the 70 per cent mark, lower than the same time last year - median prices remain high.\nThe house median price is now at $1.1 million.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-06T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:04:45.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
