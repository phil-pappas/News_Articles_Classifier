Mobile banking and payments are growing considerably worldwide, but analysts predict the most significant impacts are occurring in Asia, which is frequently a test market for new technology. Fiserv has worked with a number of forward-thinking financial institutions on innovations including Bangkok Bank’s Bualuang mBanking service and Westpac’s new omnichannel banking experience. The area’s regional banks are also often willing to invest in new initiatives and technology to meet the needs of a diverse customer-base. It is fitting then that financial services leaders from across the world will soon converge in Singapore for Sibos 2015, the biggest event on the industry calendar. What can we expect from Sibos 2015? There are a number of expected hot topics: Digital banking, wearables and mobile capture. Shifting consumer expectations and behaviours are driving the move from a cash-based to a digital ecosystem, especially in the Asia Pacific region. Digital banking and mobile financial services have already had an impact, but as technology evolves, where do we go next? Financial institutions can leverage the increasingly advanced image capture capabilities of the smartphone to deliver high-value financial services and features, and the potential for wearable technology and devices is becoming a reality. The compact nature of the devices and their ability to deliver quick, simple messages makes them a fit for financial services, in particular the mobile payments process. New technology and trends in payments. It’s no secret that payments are rapidly evolving on a global scale, and similar to digital banking advancements, consumers expect faster and more convenient payment methods that fit with their everyday lives. In Australia, for example, banks and other organizations need to be prepared for the launch of the New Payments Platform (NPP) and be ready to manage customer expectations. In the U.S. and U.K., following the launches of Apple Pay™ and Samsung Pay, the entry of technology giants into the global payments market is changing the landscape as well. Crime mitigation. How can we effectively combat money laundering, as well as fraud across multiple mobile and electronic channels, while meeting regulatory and customer requirements? Simply knowing your customers and correspondents is not enough in today’s competitive, real-time business environment. Understanding them over the full relationship lifecycle is what will set you apart by allowing you to mitigate your risks and protect your customers from risk. An enterprise view of customer risk, analytics, relationship link analysis, data mining methodologies, transaction scoring and strategic efficiencies all play a vital role. Operational risk mitigation. Recent high profile balance sheet misstatements put the spotlight on the need for robust financial controls across all businesses. There is no doubting the damage to reputation, share price and the bottom line when controls fail or are not in place. The cost of manually researching and solving exceptions is also a major issue for financial institutions, as is the risk of noncompliance with key regulatory controls. Institutions must deploy technologies that bring reconciliation activities together to present the bigger picture. Impact of regulation. Whether it’s EMV™ implementation in the U.S., T2S across Europe, or new regulations for audit compliance for wealth advisors in Australia, ever-changing regulatory requirements impact all financial services organisations and providers. The industry must work to ensure trust and security for its customers, while implementing regulatory requirements in the most cost-effective and timely manner. At Sibos 2015, Fiserv will discuss these hot topics and how Fiserv is using technology to meet customers where they are, enhancing the way we live and work in a world that’s moving faster than ever before. Fiserv will showcase our latest technology innovations, including solutions for digital banking and payments, core banking, financial crime risk management, financial control, revenue enhancement and more. Fiserv will also present two sessions on the Sibos agenda. Murray Walton, chief risk officer, will host a panel, Joining Forces on Cyber Intelligence, at 10.15 a.m. on Monday, 12 October. Andrew Davies, vice president, Global Market Strategy, Financial & Risk Management Solutions, will speak about the importance of understanding your customer when it comes to financial crime risk management Tuesday, 13 October.
