The Australian and New Zealand dollars maintained losses from Monday, with both currencies regarded as bellwethers for China given their trading links. Japanese index futures rose, while shares in Sydney fell with contracts on Chinese stocks.\nChina had an outsized impact on financial market sentiment last quarter, and Monday&apos;s 3Q GDP data proved a reminder.\n“The key question for investors is how much can growth accelerate in the December quarter and will there be more policy stimulus,” Matthew Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual Ltd. in Sydney, which manages about $21 billion, wrote in an e-mail to clients. “The answer to both questions is - not a lot. I still believe that within three years official Chinese growth will have a five handle in front of it and if deflation pressures on the corporate sector persist, one could be more confident that financial stresses will only build over this time.”\nWhile U.S. stocks seemed to shrug off the data, Asian equities ended Monday lower. The region’s largest economy grew 6.9 percent last quarter from a year earlier, exceeding the 6.8 percent rate projected by economists but below the government’s official target for 2015 of 7 percent.

Japan’s larger Topix index retreated 0.7 percent Monday, helping drive a 0.3 percent decline in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The yen, which typically moves at odds with Japanese shares, was little changed for a second day, trading at 119.51 per dollar.\nWhile futures on the Kospi index in Seoul added 0.1 percent in most recent trading, those on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index were down 0.3 percent. Contracts on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of mainland stocks listed in the city, dropped 0.4 percent.
