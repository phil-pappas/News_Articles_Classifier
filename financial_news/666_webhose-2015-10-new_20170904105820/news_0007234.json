Photo: Erin Jonasson\n Heading into this year's annual general meeting season many executives are seeking meetings with their superannuation fund shareholders to get on the front foot in the stoush over executive pay and bonuses. Companies in the troubled resources sector and those that received a \"strike\" against their remuneration report last year are under particular pressure.\nHOSTPLUS chief executive David Eliaâ€‹ said his fund would meet six ASX 100 companies to discuss a variety of issues, including executive remuneration, ahead of this annual general meeting (AGM) season, up from two meetings last year.\nThere is certainly much greater awareness among companies of the need to genuinely engage with super funds as the natural owners of their shares.\nDavid Elia, HOSTPLUS CEO. \"There is certainly much greater awareness among companies of the need to genuinely engage with super funds as the natural owners of their shares,\" he said.\nExternal fund mangers, asset consultants, proxy advisers and special interest groups still play an important intermediary role in how super funds flex their muscle with portfolio companies.\nAdvertisement HOSTPLUS is a member of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), which has put activism on executive remuneration high on its agenda this year.\nCompanies have been given a nudge to take the issue seriously since the introduction four years ago of the \"two-strikes\" rule, a law designed to hold directors accountable for executive salaries and bonuses. It means an entire company board can face re-election if shareholders disagree with how much executives are being paid.\nMeetings double \"The number of meetings we are holding with ASX 200 companies to discuss executive remuneration has more than doubled since the \"two strikes\" rule came in,\" ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said.\nThese discussions are usually held with the company chairman and head of the board's remuneration committee.\nAgainst a backdrop of tumbling commodity prices , highly paid executives in the battered resources sector should be especially ready to defend their pay packets.\n\"Executives at resource companies who were handsomely rewarded for high commodity prices rather than skill in previous years should expect to feel the heat over their pay this AGM season if they think they can justify similar compensation,\" Martin Lawrence, Ownership Matters co-founder and governance, said.\nMr Lawrence said companies needed to show how they were aligning executive pay and bonuses to long-term shareholder returns.\n\"Annual bonuses are probably the worst form of \"at risk\" pay in terms of their correlation to shareholder interests,\" he said.\nNewcrest Mining, Australia's biggest goldminer, is among those facing the risk of a second strike . Other resources sector companies in danger of a second strike are Boart Longyear,Paladin Energy, Sino Gas & Energy, and UGL.\nSome of the largest ASX-listed companies facing an AGM in the coming months with a first strike already on the board are Harvey Norman, McMillan Shakespeare, Primary Health Care, FlexiGroup and Cabcharge.\nBut companies are also keen to sit down with super funds to convince them their remuneration packages are fair before they get a first strike.\nUniSuper, which a large slice of its investment management in-house, has seen an especially strong response.\n\"As a consequence of internalising more of our domestic equities over the past five years we have seen improved levels of direct engagement with companies. Remuneration tends to be a standing agenda item as it is critical for shareholder alignment,\" Talieh Williams, UniSuper head of governance and sustainable investment, said.\n\"One of our major concerns is the complexity surrounding many executive remuneration packages. We want to see sensible remuneration outcomes that also pass a common-sense test\".\nA spokesperson from AustralianSuper, the country's largest super fund, also said there had been a \"definite rise\" in the number of companies reaching out for a meeting to discuss remuneration ahead of the coming round of AGMs throughout October and November.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/super-fund-activists-declare-open-season-on-boards-20150925-gjv0kn.html", "http://www.afr.com/business/mining/with-glencore-commodity-rout-beginning-to-look-like-a-crisis-20150929-gjx6gi", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/newcrest-mining-chairman-vows-to-change-executive-pay-levels-20141031-11ev0x.html", "http://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/glencore-woes-prompt-investors-to-dump-commodities-shares-20150928-gjwwm4"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:47:19.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
