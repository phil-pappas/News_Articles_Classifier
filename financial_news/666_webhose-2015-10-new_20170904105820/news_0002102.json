( OTCQB : GEQU ) and its fully-owned subsidiary Global Equity Partners Plc. (\"GEP\" -- www.gepartnersplc.com ), a specialist consultancy firm with offices located in Dubai and London, is extremely proud to announce a strategic partnership agreement with the \"Middle East Prospect Exhibition\" (\"MEPEX\" - www.mepexonline.com ), to act as their exclusive selected Financial Partner for capital raising, Advisory and Public Listings for all of the MEPEX participants. \nThe Middle East Prospect Exhibition (MEPEX) brings together Companies in the Energy Sector in the Region and provides a market place for buying, selling and financing of Oil and Gas related projects and companies. MEPEX had 280 Oil and Gas related participants for its first exhibition and is looking to grow those numbers in the coming months and years. MEPEX is the \"One-Stop-Shop\" to conduct all Energy and Petroleum business in the MENA Region, which is a huge and very significant industry in the Middle East. \nMr. Peter Smith, CEO of Global Equity International, Inc., said, \" MEPEX and GEP can together become a significant force in the financing and listing of Oil and Gas companies in the Middle East; with their contact and relationship base and our experience we have a tremendous opportunity in a multi-billion dollar industry. MEPEX is already a significant player in its sector and also in the Region. The management completely understands the Middle East Oil and Gas landscape with a vast degree of experience on their executive committee. When I first discussed the possibility of an alliance between GEP and MEPEX with Mr. Habib Al-Alawi, it was evident within a very short space of time that we had similar views and focus for the future of corroboration, and it is an honour to be selected as the exclusive financial partner for such a significant institution. In essence, MEPEX will attract companies in the Oil and Gas sector, of which there are many in this Region, who are seeking the services we offer. We will dedicate time and resources to helping those Oil and Gas companies achieve their goals. It is a fantastic opportunity for all parties and we are completely ecstatic to be working Habib and his team at MEPEX. We will finalize the structure of the partnership in the Kingdom of Bahrain in the coming weeks with a view to establishing an 'offering' for the Hydrocarbon community in the Region with MEPEX being the funnel for our consultancy services. \" \nMr.Habib Al-Alawi, Director of MEPEX, said, \"With this strategic partnership we can take MEPEX to the next level as we can now offer a 'complete solution' from showcasing to funding these Exploration & Production opportunities and ultimately listing them on a recognized Stock Exchange. Along with our new 24/7 online Expo ( www.mepexonline.com ), we anticipate being able, via Global Equity Partners, to assist with providing investment and IPO opportunities to our members and exhibitors. This, in my opinion, makes MEPEX a unique market place and offers many more needed solutions for Oil and Gas Start-Ups. \" \nAbout Global Equity International, Inc.
