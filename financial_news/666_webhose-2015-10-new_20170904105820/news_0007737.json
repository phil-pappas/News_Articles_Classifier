It opens doors on many levels and I greatly welcome this initiative, which is assisting as many people as possible to enjoy the economic and social benefits of being online. \n“Our role here today is to bring the internet to a wider audience, to connect people to jobs, to provide instant information, to introduce new forms of communication and social interaction, and increase and improve government services, consumer power, and convenience.” \nThe Minister continued: “My Department is responsible for digital inclusion and has been working hard to increase the digital skills of our citizens. Since its creation in 2011, the Go ON NI programme, through a range of projects to help people get online and improve their web knowledge and skills, has increased the number of citizens in NI accessing the internet by 13%. \n“Northern Ireland is an exemplar region as it is the first region in Europe to provide 100% broadband coverage. However despite this, 20% of citizens still do not have access to the internet and lack basic digital skills and capabilities. The consequences are profound. Without access, skills, motivation and trust, people will continue to be digitally excluded, with a real social and human impact affecting job prospects, health, education and more. We must continue to work together to ensure this doesn’t happen.” \nGoogle, BT, and Barclays also provided information and advice on the effective use of software tools, social media, apps, and web presence at the event. DFP Digital Transformation staff were also in attendance to discuss online government services with attendees. \nThe Minister continued: “I wish to thank the GO ON NI partners for delivering this digital event. I believe it will play an important role in helping local communities get online in a meaningful way, and develop new digital skills and competencies.” Notes to editors: Go ON NI is run by the Digital Inclusion Unit, Enterprise Shared Services (ESS) within DFP to increase digital skills amongst digitally excluded sections of the population. The Google Garage scheme is part of a wider initiative to help businesses and organisations improve and develop digital skills. By 2019, the NI Digital Transformation Programme aims to deliver 70% of all citizen transactions with government electronically. Seven services have already been delivered online, including paying your rate bill, searching and buying birth, death and marriage certificates as well as buying ordnance survey maps. Plans are underway to deliver an additional nine online services through the nidirect website by March 2016. Media enquiries only to DFP   028 9081 6725 or 028 9081 6724.
