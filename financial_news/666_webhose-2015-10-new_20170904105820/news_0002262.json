Innovation and speed-to-market of new features is vital for fast growing companies. NewVoiceMedia’s recent growth research found that its customers are growing at 13 times the international average, having increased revenues by an average of 44 percent in the last financial year, compared with global economic growth of 3.5 percent.\nWith one in 10 people already owning a smart watch, and one in four interested in purchasing the Apple Watch¹, the demand to be connected on the move is increasing. Coupled with that, 82% of consumers believe that a quick resolution is the number one factor that leads to a great customer service experience². In response to this, NewVoiceMedia launched ContactWorld for Wearables, enabling sales and service professionals to access their Salesforce data anytime, from anywhere, meaning they can engage with customers more quickly than ever before and never miss an important call or update. Furthermore, as call notifications contain the customer or prospect’s background information, reps have the information they need to navigate calls smoothly when they take them.\nWhile wearables in the enterprise are driving improved business performance, with ContactWorld Vision, businesses also have access to instant, deep analytics about customer communications to help boost sales performance and deliver better customer experiences. With Vision for Sales, salespeople can immediately access invaluable information like revenue driven per rep, call, or vertical; while Vision for Service provides internal information about agent productivity and cost-to-serve, offering rare insight into customer experience.\nFurthermore, the company’s new component for Salesforce Lightning presents businesses with an interactive timeline for contact engagement which displays all interactions, both inbound and outbound, meaning sales reps benefit from a full view of a prospect’s activity, which allows a better understanding of them and their motivations, and whether a prospect is ‘hot’ or ‘cold’.\nContactWorld QuickStart, which was launched in August, is an end-to-end solution for SMBs, serving up to 25 users. With all numbers, minutes and hardware required, provided by NewVoiceMedia, the solution offers sales and service professionals a great value customer contact solution with the fundamental call features needed to grow their business, meaning they can invest their money in further expansion and scale the use of ContactWorld to support their growth.\nBy continually innovating and bringing the latest features to customers, NewVoiceMedia ensures that businesses are in the best possible position to address issues highlighted by its recent research, which revealed that sales teams are failing to recall information offered previously by prospects, frustrating more than half of them.\n“We are perpetually focused on innovation to continue offering customers the best possible technology within a single Salesforce desktop and provide excellent support globally”, said NewVoiceMedia CEO Jonathan Gale.\n“The company is extremely agile in its development, creating updates every week, and we are committed to making our cloud capabilities best-in-class and enabling our customers to deliver exceptional service and drive a more effective sales team. We developed ContactWorld to make customer engagement easier and more successful for sales and service professionals in companies of all sizes, and these innovative new features will help them achieve this even more effortlessly, without being tied to their computers or compromising their busy schedules”.\nFor more information about NewVoiceMedia, visit http://www.newvoicemedia.com.\n¹GlobalWebIndex, April 2015\n²LivePerson, 2013\nAbout NewVoiceMedia\nNewVoiceMedia powers customer connections that transform businesses globally.
