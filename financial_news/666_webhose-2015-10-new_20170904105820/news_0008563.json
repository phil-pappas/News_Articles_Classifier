The company surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 9.36% during this period.\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.\nWill Jardiance, Cyramza & Animal Health Counter Generic & Currency Threat? \nWhile Lilly’s top-line will remain under pressure due to the loss of exclusivity of key products like Evista and Cymbalta, products like Trulicity and Cyramza should provide some support. Lilly should also see an uptick in Jardiance sales – the company and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim scored a big win recently with Jardiance succeeding in a long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes study.\nThe highlight of the results was Jardiance's ability to actually reduce CV risk - an essential part of diabetes management. These study results are a huge positive for Lilly - the company noted that Jardiance is the only glucose-lowering agent to have shown CV risk reduction in a dedicated CV outcomes study. With about 50% of deaths in type II diabetics resulting from CV disease, the addition of this data to Jardiance's label would lead to a major surge in sales.\nOther drugs in Lilly's portfolio like Glyxambi and Synjardy could also benefit as both belong to the Jardiance family. While Glyxambi is a combination of Jardiance and Tradjenta, Synjardy combines Jardiance and metformin.\nMeanwhile, Animal Health segment revenues should continue to benefit from the acquisition of the Novartis NVS animal health business earlier this year.\nHowever, currency will once again affect results this quarter. Lower volume in China is another area of concern. Growth is being impacted by government initiatives and policies and more hospitals and institutions are shifting to lower-priced generics. This scenario is expected to continue in the near-term.\nR&D spend will also increase with the company progressing with the development of olaratumab and exploring label expansion opportunities for Cyramza.\nWhat Our Model Indicates \nOur proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.\nPositive Zacks ESP : Earnings Surprise Prediction or Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.67%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares.\nZacks Rank #3 (Hold) : Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.\nThe combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 and +2.67% ESP makes us very confident in looking for a positive earnings beat on Oct 22.\nStocks That Warrant a Look \nHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.\nThe Earnings ESP for Amgen Inc. AMGN is +1.27% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 28.\nThe Earnings ESP for Bayer AG BAYRY +1.82% and it carries a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 29.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
