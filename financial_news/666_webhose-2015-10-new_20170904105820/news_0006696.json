One major venue for banks to trade currencies with each other, ICAP (LSE: IAP.L - news ) -owned EBS, said on Wednesday the yuan was now its third most traded currency after the euro and yen. \nSome of their in-house data also showed that daily trade in the offshore market, which a year ago tended to peak around 2300 GMT at the start of the Asian day, now instead sees its biggest spike when London wakes up. \n\"If you look at what has been happening over the past few years, (Chinese bank) CCB (HKSE: 0939-OL.HK - news ) has been appointed as the first clearing bank in London. Other Chinese banks have been setting up and expanding their trading desks in London,\" said Jessica Roberts, who supervises a growing yuan business at EBS. \n\"(That) perhaps suggests something about where the main RMB trading hub will be.\" \nLIBERALISATION \nTraders in London said the extension would not affect them immediately, because they currently trade the yuan through the offshore market and via non-deliverable forwards as most foreign traders cannot directly access the onshore currency. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may raise question marks about CNH going forward...and it may mean that over time there'll be less need for non-deliverable forwards, but we're still a way from that because they've not fully opened the market,\" said Ian Gunner, a currency fund manager at Altana (LSE: 0JYG.L - news ) in London. \n\"The next move now would be to have more freedom to partake in onshore trading.\" \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. The sources declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the matter. \nChinese President Xi Jinping is due to visit London next week, where UK officials hope to attract Chinese investment and win concessions for British firms - including banks - in mainland markets. \nIt is unclear how much real impact the extended hours would have on investor sentiment in the near term. \nOffshore markets in Hong Kong - the largest centre of CNH trade - have struggled in the aftermath of a surprise devaluation of the yuan in August. That left investors worried that economic growth was slowing down faster than previously thought and that other devaluations may follow. \n\"It's onshore hours that they have extended so not something that affects us directly. However, I would say that it's further evidence of the liberalisation process and (China's) efforts to bring the onshore market in line with the offshore market,\" said Insight Investment currency fund manager Paul Lambert.
