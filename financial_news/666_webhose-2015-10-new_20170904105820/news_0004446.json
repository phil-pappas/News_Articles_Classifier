Photo: Jesse Marlow\nThe debate about whether the bond market is actually \"smarter\" than the equity market has raged for decades. But during a long and distinguished career in investment management, Mark Burgess studied to find an answer.\n \"It turns out the bond market is smarter. It tends to see things a little earlier,\" he said at a panel discussion in Melbourne last week hosted by boutique bond fund Jamieson Coote Bonds.\nSo what does the bond market see now? Government bond rates are stubbornly low but more worryingly, credit spreads, a measure of corporate default risk, are on the rise especially in certain sectors.\n\"There's excess supply in the system and a lot of people have borrowed in areas where there is excess supply. Supply surges are very dangerous and can kill an industry, and we're seeing that in commodities. We saw it [recently] in shipping, which got swamped by capacity.\"\nBurgess, who ran Australia's sovereign wealth fund the Future Fund from 2012 to 2013, sits on JCB's advisory board along with esteemed economist Saul Eslake, who joined Charlie Jamieson of JCB to discuss an important moment in financial-markets history in front of a gathering of investors and advisers.\nHe described the \"absolutely dramatic impact\" of falling long-term interest rates on risk assets such as infrastructure, real estate and equities as \"largely done\" and as we enter the next phase, some investors' true skills may be exposed.\n\"There is not an infrastructure fund manager in the world that does not think they are a great investor – but they're not all great investors.\n\"In fact, that industry has attracted a lot of people with not a lot of experience yet they've all had the wind of falling long-term interest rates behind them – which has been a powerful force in revaluing those assets.\"\nAt a time when the Federal Reserve is contemplating a hike in interest rates for the first time in almost a decade, and China and emerging markets are showing signs of vulnerability, its undoubtedly a turning point for financial markets.\n\"We're breaking all the rules and we are forging absolutely new ground,\" said Jamieson, a former trader at Bank of America Merrill Lynch who founded the boutique bond fund alongside Angus Coote.\n\"There's no country in history that has ever started and ended a QE programme.\"\nJamieson pointed out that \"as much as the Fed has told us again and again and again that they're data dependent, by virtue of their actions they're absolutely market dependent.\n\"It [quantitative easing) has been far too effective so when things get hard that will always be on the policy shelf and turned to in times of stress.\"\nThe response of policymakers to the world's biggest debt bubble was to create 50 per cent more debt as zero interest rates – creating a \"catch 22\" situation.\n\"Its going to take a long time to work out this situation. Investment returns will be compressed for a long period and it's hard to see how that can really materially change.\"\nWhile Jamieson is sceptical that the Fed can return the world to an era of \"normal\" interest rates, Eslake is \"less dubious\" about its ability to lift interest rates, if not in 2015 then some time in 2016.\nBut a lengthy delay in the Fed lifting interest rates and any pressure it may place on the Reserve Bank to cut rates to help push the currency lower, could risk putting further heat in the property market.\n\"I do worry that in two or three years' time, if the population trend which has emerged over the last year continues and the underlying demand for housing falls away, while we build upwards of 200,000 of new dwelling a year for three years, then the balance for supply and demand that has kept dwelling prices at a high level could change quite significantly,\" Eslake says.\n\"If by then the RBA is raising interest rates it could be a rather unpleasant combination.\"\nEslake says the impact of the falling Australian dollar has yet to be fully transmitted to the economy. He's also expecting a further decline in the Australian dollar to the mid-to-low 60s for the long run.\n\"Since commodity prices in my view are almost certain to fall further, fair value for the currency will also fall further. The last thing the Reserve Bank wants is another period where the terms of trade are deteriorating but the currency isn't falling,\" says Eslake.\nThe fall in commodity prices is having a far more dramatic impact on other economies such as Brazil and Canada, which Eslake points to as evidence that Australia hasn't made a \"hash of the commodities boom\" for the first time in its history.\nWhile the weight of gravity is pushing policy rates lower, Eslake doesn't believe the Reserve Bank wants to cut interest rates and is hopeful many of the actions taken by the central bank to allow the economy to transition from the resource boom are still working. But he believes the \"missing ingredient\" in Australia's growth equation may finally have been found in the form of the leadership change.\nMalcolm Turnbull's appointment may finally unleash those \"animal spirits\", which Eslake feels have been held back by \"increasing despair at the performance of the coalition government\" combined with the prospect that a Labor government that had not learnt its lessons would be reinstalled.\n\"With the right political environment I think our [economic] performance can be somewhere in between where it's been over the last two years and where it was for the 15 years from the early 1990s to 2006,\" said Eslake.\nIn contrast, animal spirits had run a little too wild in other parts of the world.\nBurgess expressed his concerns about the rise of debt-funded share buybacks in the US as management incentives, and cheap debt encouraged large corporations to gear up.\nBut he was much more worried about the opposite problem developing in Australia. Boards and management had become too risk averse because of an intense push to pay out a large share of earnings in the form of dividends, largely as a result of tax policy.\n\"What that does is it discourages the CEO and the board from taking investment risk and therefore by not taking investment risk you don't grow your company over the medium term, and it's bad for all of us.\n\"I know we all want yield but do we really want non-risk takers as well? Because the net result of that is unemployment and a stagnant economy. Australia really has an opposite problem, which is that dividend imputation is creating a problem of a lack of risk taking.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:10:17.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
