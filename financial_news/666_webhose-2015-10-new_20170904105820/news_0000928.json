The former two hit new records, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 109.6 points, or 0.63 percent, to 17,598.76, the S&P 500 gained 18.1 points, or 0.88 percent, to 2,070.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 92.72 points, or 1.88 percent, to 5,012.77.\nLong-dated government debt yields rose, as the gains in equities reduced the appeal of safe-haven bonds. China's rate cut did not move commodities investors to bid up oil prices, which were flat to lower.\nChina's surprise move saw it cut its benchmark one-year lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent and lower big banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to 17.5 percent.\nThe FTSEurofirst was up 2 percent and added to what will be a fourth-straight week of gains for MSCI's 45-country All World index.\nIn the FX markets, the offshore yuan sagged to its lowest in a month, while the euro stayed below $1.11 to put the dollar on course for its biggest weekly rise against major currencies since late May.\n\"It is basically throwing more fuel into the global risk rally after Draghi's pretty bold moves yesterday,\" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, about the China cut.\nGlobal bond investors backed off safe-haven debt in the U.S. and Germany. Additional Chinese stimulus could help global growth, boosting yields on benchmark U.S. treasuries and European debt. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 16/32 in price to boost its yield to 2.087 percent.\nSeparately, the prospect of more ECB stimulus by the end of the year saw Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time ever, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them rather than get paid.\nGreece's bond curve was close to normalizing, having been distorted for months following its political crisis that saw it teeter on the brink of leaving the euro.\n\"Draghi has come out and kitchen-sinked the whole thing, everything is now on the table,\" said Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank in London.\nBrent was flat at $48.09 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 1 percent to $44.93.
