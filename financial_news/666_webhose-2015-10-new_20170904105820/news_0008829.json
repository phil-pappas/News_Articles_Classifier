Socialist challenger Antonio Costa secured 32.4 percent.\nThe election creates some political uncertainty. No minority administration has lasted a full term in Portugal since the overthrow in 1974 of dictator Antonio Salazar. But investors are taking heart from pledges by both Passos Coelho and Costa to stick to European Union budget deficit limits.\n\"The only difference from what we had before is that we have no clear majority so it means that the government could be more vulnerable,\" said Patrick Jacq, rate strategist at BNP Paribas. \"But at the end of the day it won't change economic policies.\"\nTen-year Portuguese bond yields were up 0.2 basis points at 2.32 percent. They fell to a five-month low of 2.269 percent at the open, but later rose as most other euro zone yields moved up.\nThe election result was broadly in line with recent polls.\n\"With both main contenders openly pro-euro, markets have followed campaign developments calmly, assuming that, whoever the winner, there would be no major departure from fiscal discipline,\" said Paolo Pizzoli, senior economist at ING.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were 4.5 basis points higher at 0.56 percent. Most other yields on top-rated bonds were 4-5 bps higher as investors preferred riskier assets, such as stocks, as weak U.S. jobs data on Friday pushed back the prospect of a Federal Reserve rate increase to early 2016.\n\"Markets have been scaling down quite drastically expectations of a rate hike happening this year, and that is supporting risk appetite and stock markets,\" SEB head of fixed income research Jussi Hiljanen said.\nLower-rated euro zone debt is also benefiting from expectations the European Central Bank will soon expand its trillion-euro bond-buying programme to stoke inflation.\nThe below-forecast U.S. employment data renewed worries about a global economic slowdown and helped the euro strengthen against the dollar, increasing pressure on the ECB.\nRecent election results have been supportive for southern euro zone markets. Greece's vote two weeks ago did not yield a hung parliament as many had expected, while a vote in the Spanish region of Catalonia on Sept. 27 did not give pro-independence parties a clear mandate.\nSpain's 10-year yields touched a five-month low of 1.75 percent after Standard & Poor's upgraded its rating by one notch to BBB+, citing a strengthening economy and solid labour reforms. Yields were then flat on the day at 1.79 percent.\nItalian yields tracked their peers to five-month lows of 1.609 percent, before steadying at 1.65 percent.
