But saving off your premium isn't a bad deal either. If you are sincerely getting all your insurance done, it is also important to know some cool tricks to save off on your premium with just a bit of care, caution and management. Research online and compareBuying an auto insurance online isn't something new to the world. We've been buying insurance policies online for quite a few years now but in case you didn't, it's time to shift your base from traditional insurance to online. You not only get to compare different policies and buy what suits you the most, you also get to save a few hundred dollars for sure. Be a loyal insurant If you stick to the same insurance company for all your insurance policies, like life insurance, health insurance, general and house insurance and auto insurance, you can avail multi-line discount that trims down your insurance premium amount if not drastically, then considerably, still. Similarly, when you get all your cars on the same policy, you can avail multi-vehicle discount which is another way to downsize your premium. Install an anti-theft deviceYour auto insurance company will charge you less premium if you get an anti theft system installed in your car. That's because the probability of your car getting stolen is much less with this device. So you are not only saving your car from theft, but also saving on your monthly insurance bill. Raise your insurance deductiblesIf you can own a nice, luxury car, of course you can pay for small repairs and jobs done from time to time. If you raise your deductibles, your premium amount can drastically fall, and you pay for repairs until your insurance kicks in. Don't drive to workInsurance premium is more for those who drive more, specifically to work every day. If you share a ride with your colleagues or take on to public transport, your premium will anyway come down a tad. Do you need collision cover?Most auto insurance policies have an additional collision coverage which we have been taking knowing or unknowingly. If your car is old and its value has dropped with time and use, think if collision cover is worth a hoot or not. You can skip this one as it is optional, but if you think your car has a good value then it's not really worth skipping it. So talk to your car valuator before you decide on this one.
