There are two upcoming workshops to be held October 20th in Lafayette, CA and October 22nd in Walnut Creek, CA.\nDeciding when and how to claim Social Security benefits is one of the most critical decisions an individual or a couple will ever make, especially for women. Women generally live longer than men and are more dependent on Social Security for their financial well-being in their later years, according to Slate. By age 85, almost two-thirds of Social Security recipients are women. The right claiming decision can potentially boost lifetime retirement income by tens of thousands of dollars. However, many women (and couples) fail to maximize their benefits because they don’t understand the little-known rules that can help them get more out of the system.\n Who should attend? Women, between the ages of 58-66, who are single, married, divorced, or widowed, and men who have women in their lives (wives, sisters, mothers).\nThis workshop features the essential information all women need to know who are concerned about financial security in retirement. There are two dates and locations:\nTuesday October 20\n5:30-7:00 pm\nLafayette Library\nArts & Science Discovery Center\n3491 Mt Diablo Blvd, Lafayette CA\n*light dinner provided\nThursday October 22\n5:30-7:00 pm\nGardens at Heather Farms\nRotary Room\n1540 Marchbanks Dr, Walnut Creek, CA\n*light dinner provided\nThis Workshop focuses on Women’s financial needs. The focus on women is a part of Jeff Starks commitment to empowering women and focusing on their unique needs. As part of Jeff’s commitment to women’s issues, Jeff proudly received the Women’s Choice Award. The Women’s Choice Award was created by Delia Passi, the leading advocate for female consumers and former group publisher of Working Woman and Working Mother magazines. Delia created the Women’s Choice Award for Financial Advisors in an effort to help women identify those advisors who are committed to providing quality service. The award allows this outstanding group of advisors to showcase their commitment to the women’s market, while giving potential clients a starting point for entrusting their finances to an advisor.\nAs the financial industry wakes up to the fact that a great majority of the female population are seeking advisors they can trust and greatly value financial security, WomenCertified Inc. has created the solution. This powerful, national initiative distinguishes advisors who support female consumers in their quest for financial education.\nMedia Inquiries:\nJeffrey M.
