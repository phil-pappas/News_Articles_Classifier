Below are the things I exchanged money for. I omitted all the purchases at my office cafeteria (because boring). Know that they are frequent and feature my morning black coffee in to-go mug, lunch of soup or salad or both and afternoon chocolate chip cookie or pie. 1. Plane tickets to Paris: $683.34 I’m going for pleasure. I’ve never been to Paris. I feel proud to allow myself this indulgence. This is one of the nicest things I’ve done for myself. 2. Dumpling soup dinner for one: $12.67 I used to live in Los Angeles, where the restaurants were as diverse and plentiful as the people. Mom-and-pop Asian restaurants are scarce in the D.C. area, where I now reside, so I get my fix whenever I happen upon one. 3. Dinner of tuna pita and potato salad: $8.57 Casual and delicious Mediterranean restaurant outing with a new friend. I’m new to the area. Therefore, I make friends over food. At this point, my grocery list consists of apples from the farmer’s market and a loaf of bread and butter for my morning toast. 4. Electric bill and phone bill: $14.26 and $141.43 My electric bill is oddly low and my phone bill is extremely high. I have reasons. My heat, oven and stove run on gas. I live alone and I don’t spend a lot of time at home. As for my phone bill, I pay for my dad’s phone as well as mine. Even still, this can’t be right, right? Right? 5. Unspeakable item from Wendy’s: $1.58 It wasn’t my proudest moment. Again, purchases made in the midst of new friends!(Next five purchases are more things I ingest: Vietnamese dinner, Shake Shack ice cream, Sodastream canister, tacos, overpriced black coffee. Skipping over these so my post isn’t: The Last 10 Things I Ingested. Estimated total: $50). 6. One ticket to a magic show via Living Social: $25 I can explain. Actually, I really can’t. It was campy good fun. 7. Amazon order: $48.38 Twelve compostable bamboo toothbrushes ($31.99 + tax), rechargeable batteries and charger ($12.97 + tax), and recyclable rubber gloves ($2.49 + tax). All this in an effort to be eco-conscious. I feel good about these purchases. I also like knowing I'll have enough toothbrushes to last me three years. And batteries to last me forever, theoretically.I moved around a lot in my twenties. This willingness to blow up my life and start over elsewhere has baked in a neurotic-mindful thought process about what I bring into my house. This, coupled with my anxiety about all the plastic flooding our oceans and the climate change, is why my recent purchases reflect a sort of conflicted consciousness. 8. A black cashmere/wool/silk Versace sweater, purchased secondhand at unnamed consignment store: $76.14 This is my favorite clothing purchase in a very long time. This sweater makes me feel like every other sweater I've ever owned is just an allusion of a sweater. I plan to wear this into the ground over many years to come. 9. Black Chanel booties, purchased secondhand at another unnamed consignment store, but for different reasons: $52.88. Beautiful, in fantastic condition and fifty bucks before tax? Too good to be true. I purchased these with the knowledge that they may be tight in fit. I wore them to the magic show and regretted it immediately. Such pain I had yet to experience. It was a different, unexpected kind of pain. I've purchased shoes unwisely before, but this was a throbbing pain that made me keenly aware of my own heartbeat. I thought such purchases were behind me, like in my twenties. I guess I’m a slow learner. 10. David Foster Wallace’s Infinite Jest , purchased new at Kramerbooks: $19.03. After my unsuccessful search for a used copy around town, and deciding against the ebook version, I felt the next best choice would be to support a privately owned store. An ebook, of course, would be the greener alternative, but there was a pleasure in picking up this massive tome in a bookstore I had to acknowledge. It’s the only respectful way to grapple with this work. Yes, I realize I just made a slew of purchases on Amazon and that contradicts my shopping preferences, but I'm only human and I don't have a car. Favorite purchase? Plane tickets to Paris. Because, of course. Any regrets? Chanel booties. There is a reason $50 Chanel booties are there for the taking. They are size 5 and that’s probably a lie.", "external_links": ["http://i.forbesimg.com/media/2012/03/16/0316_forbeslife-paris-the-granjon-way_650x455.jpg", "http://thebillfold.com/2015/07/saying-yes-to-moving-and-better-opportunities/"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:16:34.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
