These measures to be taken up by MUDRA are targeted towards mainstreaming young, educated or skilled workers and entrepreneurs including /women entrepreneurs.\n2. According to the NSSO Survey of 2013, there are some 5.77 crore small business units, mostly individual proprietorship, which run manufacturing, trading or services activities. These encompass myriad of small manufacturing units, shopkeepers, fruits / vegetable vendors, truck & taxi operators, food-service units, repair shops, machine operators, small industries, artisans, food processors, street vendors and many others.\n3. Most of these ‘own account enterprises’ (OAE) are owned by people belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or Other Backward Classes.\n4. The biggest bottleneck in the growth of entrepreneurship in this sector is the lack of financial support. A vast part of the non-corporate sector operates as unregistered enterprises and formal or institutional architecture has not been able to reach out to meet its financial requirements.\n5. Providing access to institutional finance to such micro/small business units/enterprises will not only help in improving the quality of life of these entrepreneurs but also turn them into strong instruments of GDP growth and employment generation.\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 7:34 am © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:54:03.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
