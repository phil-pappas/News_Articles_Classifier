It has been criticised by politicians, investors and consumers for the time it is taking to produce answers.\nThe KBA and other European national authorities are due to provide an update to the European Commission in Brussels later on Thursday on investigations of the emissions scandal in their respective markets.\nAlso, Germany's transport ministry, which has in the past said about 2.8 million cars in Germany were affected, said Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt would make a statement on Volkswagen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT).
