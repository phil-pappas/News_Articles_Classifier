Photo: Ryan Stuart\nWas it the South African parent company's aggressive corporate culture, a forensic expenses investigation or a broken foot in the early days of his tenure that hobbled Iain Nairn's prospects with David Jones?\nThe busted foot is the latest story doing the rounds since David Jones chief Mr Nairn's shock departure from the department store business this week.\nIn the absence of a fulsome explanation for Mr Nairn's sudden exit, countless theories have got an airing, including speculation over a falling out between Mr Nairn and his boss in South Africa, Woolworths Holdings chief Ian Moir.\nThe injury could buttress this theory. The dodgy foot allegedly kept Mr Nairn away from some important David Jones events and put the relationship between Mr Nairn and Mr Moir on an unstable footing.\nAdvertisement Mr Nairn's swift execution and the indecently quick appointment of former Marks & Spencer executive John Dixon to the top job this week kept the rumour mill running hot.\nSome retail insiders point to Woolworths' tough culture to explain Mr Nairn's departure following David Jones' impressive full-year financial results, including 10.4 per cent sales growth in second half of the year.\nBut an internal review of expenses has also been drawn into the narrative over the unconventional change of guard.\nThe review focused on the expenses of all Mr Moir's director reports but Woolworths would not reveal what triggered the investigation.\nHowever, the review did not extend to the department store's financials.\nA spokesman for the company said David Jones auditor Ernst & Young signed off on the accounts for the period ending June 30 and \"there were no discrepancies in those accounts nor have there been any discrepancies investigated by Ernst & Young subsequent to that date\".\nOne experienced retailer said it was hard to believe Mr Nairn's performance was the source of any tension with Woolworths, given David Jones unveiled a 28.8 per cent spike in full-year operating profit to $161 million in August.\nHe said talk of a spat over strategy was also difficult to make sense of, when Mr Nairn would have understood Woolworths' commitment to private label before taking on the role of chief executive.\n\"There was definitely a falling out between Nairn and Moir,\" he said.\n\"I think what started out as an expenses review has turned into something else.\n\"It's very suspicious.\"\nMr Dixon will not join David Jones until January next year, leaving the department store without a leader for the next three months, including the vital Christmas and New Year period.\nThe appointment of Mr Dixon, credited with turning around Marks & Spencer's £​5 billion food operation, has fuelled talk David Jones is preparing to launch a gourmet food operation.\nProperty insiders report David Jones has already run the rule over sites in key city locations for what could be a new, scaled-back format featuring food and fashion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:47.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
