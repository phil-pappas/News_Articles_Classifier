It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) hit its highest in nearly three weeks against the dollar in early trade after SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) accepted a takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev, in a deal worth 69 billion pounds. \nBut it gave up those gains, trading 0.7 percent lower against the dollar and hitting a five-month low against the euro after UK inflation turned negative again. \nEarlier data showed Chinese imports fell 20 percent in the year through September, highlighting falling demand in the country and putting pressure on Beijing to roll out further stimulus measures. \nThat dragged the Australian dollar from a two-month high, to trade 1 percent lower at $0.7295. The New Zealand dollar was also down 0.6 percent at $0.6675. \n\"The sharp drop in Chinese imports don't augur well for Australia and hence we are seeing the Australian dollar come under pressure,\" said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole (Swiss: ACA.SW - news ) , London. \nChina is a huge export market for Australia and the Australian dollar is used as a proxy for investments to China. \nThe Australian dollar also tumbled 1.2 percent against the Japanese currency, to 87.31 yen. \nThe yen benefited from a flight to safety as stocks fell, while the dollar languished at three-week lows against a basket of currencies as expectations faded that the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year. \nThe dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six major counterparts, hit a three-week low of 94.539. Against the yen, the dollar was down about 0.3 percent at 119.63 yen, while the euro rose to $1.1411 , a three-week peak. \nThe euro eased back a bit to trade at $1.1375, after the monthly ZEW survey of German economic sentiment came in below expectations, with morale hurt by the Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) scandal and weakness in emerging markets. \nThe euro, though, rose to a five-month high against the British pound, as September's surprise fall in UK consumer prices dampened the positive impact for the pound from the confirmation of the SABMiller/Anheuser-Busch InBev merger. \n\"The negative inflation numbers will make it hard to justify a rate hike in the UK,\" said Geoff Yu, currency strategist at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) . Money markets are pricing in a chance of a rate hike by the Bank of England in the last quarter of 2016.
