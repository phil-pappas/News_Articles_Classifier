Vivendi reserves the right add to the stakes and to ask for seats on the game companies’ boards, it said.\nUbisoft and Gameloft shares jumped last week after Vivendi acquired minority stakes in the companies. The investments -- which both targets said were unsolicited -- show renewed interest from Vivendi in the video-game industry, after it gradually sold shares in Activision Blizzard Inc. over the past two years to retain only a 5.7 percent stake as of June.\n“These investments are part of a strategic vision of operational convergence between Vivendi’s content and platforms on one hand and the Ubisoft and Gameloft productions in video games on the other,” the company said.\nUbisoft has risen 67 percent this year, giving the Montreuil, France-based company a market value of 2.8 billion euros ($3.2 billion). Gameloft is up 32 percent, valuing the company at 375.8 million euros. Both companies were created by the Guillemot brothers, who still run them and own minority stakes in each.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:54:53.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
