This is not the first critical voice in Germany against austerity politics. However, this carries the weight of German economists that are very much part of the policy elite in Germany and the EU. What adds to their credibility is their attack on both Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the government’s junior partner, namely the SPD.\nThey point towards a widening social cleavage, as the primary trigger of a rise in right Eurosceptic parties across Europe, including Germany. More profoundly, they point towards a German hegemonic project of austerity that is threatening to destroy Europe. In response to this challenge, they sign a 12 point manifesto.\nThe manifesto is in many respects a personal attack on Chancellor Merkel, held responsible for the imposition of an austerity regime across Europe and accused of honing — along with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble — a narrative of German domination reminiscent of the past century. But, the manifesto is also an attack on the lack of a principled stand by the SPD.\nThe economists accuse the Chancellor of a policy aimed at saving German and French banks, imposing the burden on the Greek population. The economists underscore that the austerity plan that has been imposed on Greece since 2010 is devoid of any theoretical or practical substance. They point towards a (German) policy impasse, calling for an investment-driven rather than austerity-driven strategy to avoid the final breakdown of the Greek economy.\nThe SPD is being accused of tolerating if not conniving with “neoliberal” policies that they would have condemned had they been in opposition, including “pension cuts, unjust VAT increases, privatisation, the undermining of trade unions and free collective bargaining and an altogether reduction of the Greek demand, without which the country cannot get to its feet.”\nThe German economists call on the SPD to return to its conventional wisdom of an investment-led strategy and the promotion of real reforms in Greece, including the fight against corruption and the reform of public administration. Last but not least, they call for a European debt conference.\nFocusing on the European project, they reiterate various suggestions that have been put forward mainly in France, including the institution of a Eurozone Finance Minister, an open and accountable Eurogroup, and a Euro Parliament.\n ", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg", "http://www.queries-feps.eu/call-for-social-democrats-for-a-european-europe-instead-of-a-german-europe/"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:33:36.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
