Explaining about the forum in Dar es Salaam, Chairperson of Tanzania Business Community (TBC), Mr Johnson Minja, said the aim of our meeting is to discuss with the political leaders from CCM, CHADEMA and ACT Wazalendo their plans for the Tanzanian business people and economic development at large. \" We decided to have a forum with CCM, CHADEMA and ACT-Wazalendo because currently they are the most competitive parties as we approach general election in a few days to come and one of the party is expected to lead the next government,\" Mr Minja said. \"Among other issues we are looking forward to hear their policies on how they will make sure Tanzanians will benefit from their national resources, how locals especially businesspeople will be helped to benefit from international investment laws and how the candidates will fight corruption. We want to hear how they will protect traders as they are oppressed and lastly we want to hear how they are determined to improve tax collection systems,\" he noted. The forum will take place at Julius Nyerere Convention Centre (JICC) from 10.00 am to 12:00pm and government officials and economists are expected to be part of the forum. Mr Minja said delegates from other regions had already arrived and others were expected to arrive yesterday night to reach 700 representatives from all over Tanzania. He called upon participants to observe the code of conduct that is black suit and should avoid wearing their political party regalia or carrying flags because the forum is for national development issues and not political campaigns. Mr Minja added that it was important to know policies their candidates have for businesspeople as they have great contribution to economic development of the country before they make decisions on October 25.
