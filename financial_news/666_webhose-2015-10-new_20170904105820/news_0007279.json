Michael Pascoe comments.\nPT1M39S 620 349 If some headline-writing went feral over Westpac's home loan rate rise, it looked like a meltdown when the rest of the cozy cartel chimed in. Even Prime Minister Turnbull took time out from giving multiple \"exclusive\" interviews to have a whinge .\nBut after a weekend to let the ink cool and broadcast hyperventilators catch their breath, those extra 15 or 20 points on home loans shouldn't matter nearly as much as has been suggested.\nYes, the move by the Big Four club adds up to a small de facto tightening of monetary policy. But who will feel it?\nA Melbourne Cup day rate cut by the RBA would be a surprise. Photo: Louie Douvis\nOnly 35 per cent of Australians have a mortgage anyway. And of those, a fair whack didn't reduce their repayments when rates were cut in February and May and they won't increase their repayments now.\nAdvertisement Of the remainder, most have made inroads into their mortgage, built up equity, and will hardly feel threatened by the average repayment increase of less than $10 a week. As ASIC discovered this year, even interest-only borrowers tend to be responsible – include their offset accounts in the equation and they actually have more \"equity\" than the principle-and-interest mob .\nWhere's the disaster?\nThe majority of mortgage holders didn't reduce their repayments when rates were cut in February and May and they won't increase their repayments now. Photo: Wayne Taylor\nSure, there are indeed first home buyers mortgaged to the hilt – but if their bank was responsible, doing as APRA has ordered them, and the borrowers haven't been fibbing, the loans have been made with the expectation that rates could rise not 20 points but 200.\nSo, unless the headline hysteria catches on, there's really not much of a case for the rate increases per se pushing the Reserve Bank to cut rates next week to compensate for the banks' favouring their shareholders over customers. The impact on the economy of the nominal few dollars a week for a minority of the population should be minor and be part of the background within weeks.\nIf the banks were moving enough to impact on demand, the RBA could indeed act as it targets the rates we actually pay, with its cash rate merely the means of getting there.\nBut with the current situation of the banks putting their shareholders (and executive bonuses) ahead of customers, there could be a degree of moral hazard if the RBA was seen to be too willing to underwrite the club's profits. It's not as if any of them are fragile.\nThe RBA might well consider that the expectation of a little margin compression is already built into the banks' share prices anyway. The generous dividend yields on offer suggest the market has priced in the much-telegraphed requirement for extra capital.\nThe main question the RBA will be asking itself next Tuesday is whether this little round of rises will be enough to hold back businesses from investing: will business think the consumer has been terrified by the move and therefore consider demand not strong enough to warrant investment?\nI find it hard to imagine that that's the case. There are plenty of other issues surrounding the missing animal spirits and the last two NAB business conditions surveys have pointed to a tipping point being close – the nation's chief financial officers can't cost-cut their way much further to improved profits.\nBesides, we still have the Turnbull honeymoon effect boosting business confidence , as well as the prospect of beating the All Blacks to be the only nation to win three Rugby World Cups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:40:03.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
