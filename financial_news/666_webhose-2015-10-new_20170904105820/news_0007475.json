(Photo by Jesse Marlow/Fairfax Media) Jesse Marlow Share on twitter by Michael Smith The loss of Medibank Private's chief executive less than a year after its $5.7 billion initial public offer was something that was never in the prospectus.\nFrom the outside, the decision by George Savvides to step down five months from now looks abrupt and raises questions about why the relatively fit 58-year-old would want to go at this stage of the company's transition.\nBut Savvides and Medibank chairman Elizabeth Alexander have been talking about CEO succession for some time and agreed it was the right time for new blood to run the company as it enters the next stage.\nSavvides, who has been running the company for 13 years, was always going to be the transition guy. He managed Medibank's transition to a for-profit company five years ago and finally out of government hands last year.\nWith his current contract due to expire in 2017, Savvides and Alexander decided they didn't want a repeat of the distracting succession speculation that dogged companies such as Myer when chief executive tenures were coming to a close. They decided to clear the air.\nSavvides, who is about to be become a grandfather, also wants to spend more time with his family.\nStill, the timing is not ideal as it creates a period of uncertainty while a successor can be found and comes early in the company's public life.\nAbout 340,000 Australians have money riding on Savvides. While Medibank had a poor run in the early months following its IPO, the stock picked up after posting a strong full-year result in August.\n Retail investors paid $2 a share for Medibank shares while institutional investors paid $2.15. The stock was last trading around $2.51, down 1.8 per cent. It is still up 29 per cent from a 52-week low of $1.94 on August 18.\nMedibank increased net profit 118 per cent to $285.3 million in the year ended June 30, beating the prospectus forecast of $251 million.\nWhile he would not directly criticise the way the Medibank IPO was priced, Savvides said in an interview with this column in April that his job was made more challenging by the pressure on the government to maximise its returns from the sale.\nThere were suggestions at the time the IPO - priced at the top of the range - was overvalued, although those valuations now look justified based on the current share price. Medibank went to the market at 24 times earnings compared with 18 times for rival insurer nib.\nSavvides has been vocal in public healthcare policy and says he wants to play a role in reforming the healthcare system to make it more affordable.\nSavvides plays veterans' hockey for Melbourne University. But his real passion is speedboats and he regularly takes his sons waterskiing behind his 200 horsepower speedboat.\nThe company will consider internal and external candidates.\nSavvides' early retirement adds to the list of departures from the senior ranks of top200 companies announced on Wednesday. Origin Energy finance chief Karen Moses and IAG chairman Brian Schwartz are also going.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:04:01.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
