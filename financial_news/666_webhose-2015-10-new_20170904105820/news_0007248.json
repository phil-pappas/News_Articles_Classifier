Seven and Nine clearly are telling us that.\" \nTEN'S NETWORK NUMBERS \n* Net loss $312.2m vs net loss of $168.3m for 2014/15 \n* Revenue up 4.5pct to $654m \n* No final dividend", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:19:30.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
