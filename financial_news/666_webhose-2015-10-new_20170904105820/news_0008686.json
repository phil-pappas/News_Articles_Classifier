Other advisers could be added at a later stage, according to Sky News. \nBAML and RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) worked on Metro Bank’s £387.5m fundraising round last year . The company is also thought to be in the process of adding more PR advisers ahead of the initial public offering (IPO). \nFive years after the bank’s American founder Vernon Hill opened the first branch in Holborn in central London, Metro Bank has attracted more than half a million customers and reported deposits of £2.8bn at the end of last year. \nMetro’s business is split evenly between consumer and business banking. However, the company is yet to turn an annual profit. \nIts investors include the Reuben brothers, the US property developer Richard LeFrak and the hedge fund manager Steven Cohen. \nMetro Bank is set to follow its fellow challenger banks Virgin Money and Aldermore onto the London stock market. The value of the bank through the IPO has been mooted at £1bn. \nMetro Bank could not be reached for comment on the appointment of advisers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:00:32.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
