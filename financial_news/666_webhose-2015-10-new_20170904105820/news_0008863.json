The staff there couldn’t help me because I had no ID. \nI decided that I would close the account and withdraw my savings of £5,000. I returned with a friend with ID, PIN etc. \nThe desk hand took my bank card and handed me a transaction receipt. It informed me that the bank had no method of giving the cash other than in £20 notes. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) proceeded to count out the money. I complained to her about the fact it didn’t even have £50s. I said I was anxious about carrying cash around with me. \nShe became rude and I asked to see the manager. DB, London \nThe “desk hand”, as you describe her, proceeded to tell the manager that you were being rude. \nYou felt you couldn’t deal with this and left without any cash. Three and a half months later you visited a different branch and were told that your account had been frozen and would remain so until you proved where your money had come from. \nYou asked for a written explanation. None was forthcoming. I understand there were not enough £50 notes to fulfil your request. \n• 'Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) is hounding me for someone else’s debts' \nI am told there was a misunderstanding. Barclays asserts that the account was never frozen and funds were always accessible with identification. \nYou are saving for an operation that the NHS won’t do. You report that the situation has made your anxiety and depression worse. Being bullied by a bank like this, which does happen, can make people feel deflated. Further to my involvement £300 has been paid for the distress and inconvenience caused. \nYou have actually stayed with the bank to give it another chance. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:52:45.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
