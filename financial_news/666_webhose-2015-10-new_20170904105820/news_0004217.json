My husband has his own pension and pays into it regularly. \nShould I consolidate my three pension pots into one? Is there a pension provider that is best suited to stay-at-home mums? And should I be trying to put away some money each month or will a few years off be ok? \nAlso, what are the implications for my state pension? TD, via email \nThis is becoming an ever more common scenario. Many parents are choosing to stay at home to care for their family rather than return to work, as childcare costs continue to rise. \nDavid Smith, pension expert at Tilney Bestinvest, said the issue of pension consolidation is one of the most common questions he is asked by parents who have decided not to return to work. \nIn each case the answer depends on the type of pension schemes they have and whether they come with added benefits such as guaranteed annuity rates, protected tax-free cash, guaranteed investment returns or guaranteed maturity values for example. These valuable extras could be lost following a transfer. \n“As a general rule of thumb though, employer pension plans tend to have lower charges than standard personal pensions and even though no further contributions are being paid in, your funds can remain invested until such time you take your pension or decide to transfer,” Mr Smith said. \n“The key is ensuring that each of your pensions are at least invested in a suitably diversified funds, with a good track record.” \nThere are no particular providers that offer specific products for stay-at-home mums, so the key is to ensure your funds are invested in line with your preferred level of risk. \nIf you are unsure, many pensions have ‘lifestyling’ strategies which look to take away the stress of determining your own investment strategy by managing your pension on your behalf. The main benefit being that these funds aim to reduce risk and, as a result, aim to protect the value of your funds as you near your retirement age. \nIt’s a good idea to make regular contributions, as long as you have a cash reserve already put aside for emergencies. Non-earners can only contribute a maximum of £3,600 a year gross to their pension, which is £2,880 net. \nMr Smith said the good news is that the Government does not want to deprive stay-at-home parents of their state pension entitlement. \nState pension top-ups overhaul: you risk paying more for nothing \nParents are entitled to credits to their National Insurance record, as if they were paying voluntary additional contributions themselves. \nIn essence, parents are given a credit for each year they are registered for child benefit for a child under the age of 12, if they have not already paid enough National Insurance in that tax year. This is an automatic calculation and there is no need to lodge any claim. \n\"For example, a parent aged 35 may already have 10 ‘qualifying years’ (years in which sufficient National Insurance has been paid) thanks to working and earning a sufficient amount,\" he said. \"They may then be entitled to 12 years whilst looking after their child, return to work at age 47 and only need a further 13 years to qualify for the full new state pension, for which a minimum of 35 qualifying years is required.\" \nHave a question for our experts?
