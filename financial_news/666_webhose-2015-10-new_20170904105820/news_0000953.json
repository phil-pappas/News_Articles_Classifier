Plans for Kim Kardashian’s birthday party this year have yet to be revealed, but if the past is any indicator, she’ll probably be celebrating in Las Vegas. After all, Kim has held her birthday party at the Venetian hotel’s TAO nightclub on the Strip several times. \nThen again, Kim might want to take it easy this year. Just a couple months after the “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” star turns 35 years old, she’s expected to give birth to her second child — a boy — with husband Kanye West. Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are already parents to 2-year-old daughter North West. \nNo matter how she decides to spend her birthday, Kim certainly has a lot to celebrate. It’s quite possible that she’s Hollywood’s most successful reality star. Kim Kardashian’s net worth is $85 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth . The site estimates Kanye West’s net worth at $145 million, bringing their combined fortune to a total of $230 million. Kim Kardashian Net Worth Breakdown: 5 Ways the Reality Star Makes Money \nKim Kardashian’s salary for 2015 is estimated at $52.5 million, which is nearly double the $28 million she earned in 2014, reports Forbes. The reality star has become such an expert at monetizing her fame through endorsement fees, clothing lines, book deals and more that it’s no surprise that her net worth has reached $85 million. Here’s a look at how Kim built up her fortune. \nRelated: North West, Blue Ivy: 29 of the Richest Celebrity Children 1. Kim Kardashian’s Salary From ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians’ \nIn early 2015, the Kardashian family reached an $80 million agreement — with ratings bonuses — to continue their hit show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” for another three seasons with an option for a fourth, reports TMZ. The E! show recently wrapped up its tenth season, but Season 11 of “Keeping Up With the Kardashian” is slated to premiere on Nov. 15. \nKim Kardashian’s salary for the show is $15 million, according to Mirror Online. (However, OK! magazine reports the star is making $30 million.) And since viewers want a glimpse into the home life of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, she reportedly receives a $5 million bonus when her famous husband appears on camera. 2. Kardashian Kollection and Kardashian Kids \nKim partnered with her sisters — Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian — to design the Kardashian Kollection for Sears. The clothing line brought in $600 million in 2013, earning the trio a combined $30 million, reports Forbes. The sisters apparently ended their partnership with Sears due to the retailer’s potentially grim future, but rumor has it they have already found a new yet-to-be-announced home for their Kardashian Kollection. Also, pieces from the Kardashian Kollection are available on the Dash online store. \nKim, Khloe and Kourtney also have a children’s clothing line called Kardashian Kids available at Babies “R” Us. And, the trio also owns Dash boutique — which has locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York — but their earnings from the store and its new show on E!, “Dash Dolls,” are unknown. \nBesides clothing lines, Kim also sells her discarded clothes, shoes and accessories on eBay. From February 2013 to February 2014, Cosmopolitan magazine found that she sold more than $212,000 worth of goods on the site, donating about $21,200 to charity and pocketing the remaining $190,886.53. \nRead: Wahlbergs to the Kardashians: 13 Celebrity Families Making Millions Together 3. Kim Kardashian’s Endorsement and Appearance Fees \nAs a mega-celebrity, Kim receives offers to endorse products and make appearances at parties and events. And these gigs pay her a lot of money. In 2014, for example, she reportedly received $500,000 to attend the Vienna Annual Opera Ball as the guest of Austrian businessman Richard Lugner, reports TMZ. And for her 34 th birthday, she was reportedly paid $500,000 to appear at the nightclub and entertain guests for at least four hours, according to AOL.com. \nBut $500,000 is nothing compared with Kim Kardashian’s endorsement fees, which range from $750,000 to $1 million, reports Radar Online. In 2013, Kim reportedly earned $3.2 million from promoting Quick Trim diet products, Fusion Beauty, Bravada, Fit In Your Jeans by Friday workout DVDs, Beach Bunny Swimwear, Kardashian for Bebe line and Kim Kardashian perfume at Sephora, according to The Richest . The year before, Kardashian earned an estimated $20 million for the sales of her three fragrances Gold, Love and True Reflection. 4. ‘Kim Kardashian: Hollywood’ Earnings \nIn summer 2014, the “Kim Kardashian: Hollywood” app hit the market with the namesake herself reportedly taking in 45 percent of net profits, reports TMZ. According to the Daily Mail, the Kim Kardashian app earned $1.6 million in its first five days of release, $43 million in three months and was expected to reach $200 million by the end of the year, putting $85 million in Kim’s pocket. 5. Kim Kardashian Book Profits and Acting Gigs \nEarlier this year, Kim Kardashian released a book of selfies — yes, selfies — titled “Selfish.” As of August, total trade sales reached approximately 125,000 copies in the U.S. and internationally, reports US magazine. Kardashian’s exact earnings from “Selfish” are unknown, but the book was originally priced at $19.95 and can be found on Amazon for as low as $9.46. \n“Selfish” wasn’t Kim’s first dip into the literary world, though. Partnering with Kourtney and Khloe, Kim co-authored the books “Kardashian Konfidential” and “Dollhouse.” Both books made it onto the New York Times Best Sellers list. \nKim has also tried her hand at acting, appearing in the 2013 Tyler Perry film “Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor” and four episodes of the television series “Drop Dead Diva,” among other projects. Her earnings for these ventures have been kept under wraps. \nKim Kardashian’s hardworking nature and business-savvy skills have helped her amass a fortune most people can only dream about. So, the answer to the question ‘How rich is Kim Kardashian?’ is currently $85 million. But, that number is quite likely already on the rise.
