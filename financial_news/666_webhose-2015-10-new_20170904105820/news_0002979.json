Economic projections prepared for the meeting show that 13 of 17 of the central bankers saw a rate rise as appropriate this year.\nHis remarks follow cautious comments on Monday from fellow Governor Lael Brainard that the central bank take a wait-and-see approach to liftoff that contrasted with the views voiced recently by other officials, including Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and New York Fed President William C. Dudley, that liftoff was still appropriate if the economy grows as expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:59:04.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
