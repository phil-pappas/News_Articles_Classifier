Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle A bit like Wile E Coyote, face blackened after the Acme explosives have blown up in his face, Labor moved on to Plan B for annihilating Malcolm Turnbull on Monday.\nEven as some Labor figures insisted that last week's attack on the Prime Minister's investments in the Cayman Islands had actually been a success, the opposition's actions in Question Time suggested it was anxious to move on from a strategy as quickly as possible after awful poll numbers appeared to tell a different story.\nSo, after one brief reference to multinational tax avoidance, Labor was winding back the clock on Monday to the 2014 budget, as it moved from trying to warn voters that Turnbull was \"not a Labor PM in drag\", not \"one of us\", to painting him as \"Tony Abbott in drag\".\nThe opposition wanted to make Turnbull squirm over the fact he is apparently locked in to the same, deeply unpopular policy positions as his predecessor on everything from cuts to health and education funding to emissions reduction\nThis was a strategy that at least went more to the financial concerns of voters rather than those of the Prime Minister.\nBut like Wile E's fleet-of-foot nemesis, the Road Runner – and indeed like the prime minister most fond of bringing Road Runner analogies into the House of Representatives, PJ Keating – Turnbull was a little too fast to fall for that particular plate of seed.\n\"Can I simply say that the government's policies are unchanged,\" the PM told the House.\n\"Our policies will change often in the face of an inability to get them through the Senate and we will have to renegotiate and you will see examples of that, and policies are reviewed and reconsidered\".\n Meep Meep!\nNow most people think that the government will have to change a lot of its policies from the 2014 budget – those that have not already changed.\nThat's either because they can't get through the Senate, or because they are political poison and will have to be, at the best, modified or traded off.\nThe mid-year review of the budget is also looming, at which the government will have to make a call on whether it is going to proceed with a lot of these decisions which are now overdue, or surrender and bring to book a budget deterioration.\nBut there was not any great gotcha moment on offer from the prime minister in question time.\nIn the circumstances, Labor was quietly grateful for Senate estimates throwing up one of those colourful distractions that everyone loves: in this case, the fate of a marble table trashed during a boisterous party in the cabinet rooms the night Tony Abbott lost of the leadership.\nThe questioning produced some great fun as some poor sods from the parliamentary bureaucracy – who weren't at the party – were quizzed on where all the bits of marble had gone, and even whether there might have been issues of \"structural integrity\" in the marble which led to it breaking (as it was being danced on).\nBut what seemed more perplexing was why, if the table had been smashed, someone – for example, the host of the party, or possibly the minister widely rumoured to have been dancing on it – hadn't just immediately offered to pay the cost of getting it fixed.\nThat's what you would do, isn't it, if you accidentally smashed someone else's furniture?\nBut maybe, you would only do that if you were \"one of us\".", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:10:23.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
