CEO of Gilbert + Tobin, Danny Gilbert, at his desk in the new open plan office. Christopher Pearce That was August. Within a couple of hours at the much smaller pilot workstation, Gilbert informed everyone he wasn't going back.\n\"Now I am permanently here until we move in May,\" he says.\nMaking the move At Gilbert + Tobin's current offices on Park Street, the countdown is on; red recycling bins are overflowing, artists' impressions of the new offices are taped up on the walls, books are being tagged to see if anyone has used them in the past five years and partners are busy with an unaccustomed activity: cleaning out their offices.\nAshurst's new offices at Martin Place. For lawyers, this is akin to cultural revolution. And Australia is leading the world in its willingness to radically alter the office traditions of the global legal market place.\nGilbert + Tobin is one of those most enthusiastically adopting the new fashion by pulling down all its walls. Gilbert bravely calls its the \"death of office\". Each person will still have their own desk – no law firm is yet at the radical hot desking phase – where staff work at whatever desk is available.\n\"Those kind of [corner offices] spaces really cement in hierarchy, because they are emblematic of status and power. People don't always know how to respond to those things. One of the great advantages to open space is it seems to break down artificial barriers to human communication,\" he says. \"That's the theory, I hope it's right.\"\nConfidentiality and privacy Private workplaces are an alternative place to pull out the laptop. Minter Ellison's new office space. Michele Mossop He is betting it is. Gilbert + Tobin will move onto laptops, wireless headsets and the popular sit-to-stand desks that will supposedly make seamless the habit of jumping into one of many meeting or quiet rooms and putting a document up on a big screen.\nBut what about the sacred tenets of the law industry, focused on the need for confidentiality and privacy? All that still remains as it is the essence of the client relationship. What has changed is the way lawyers interact with each other and the clients.\nAnd what happens to a traditionally hierarchical profession when law graduates no longer have the corner office to aspire to?\nIt's no secret Australia's law sector is going through huge changes in every way, with the legal market no longer so clearly stratified. Most domestic firms that made up the traditional big six have undergone global transformations through mergers, alliances and takeovers in the past four years.\nOpen plan, no walls, not even screens. Minter Ellison's new office space in central Sydney. Michele Mossop This followed the aftermath of the global financial crisis where most big practices shrank their footprints because real estate costs are second only to salaries. Everybody started working on how to make businesses more efficient. Gilbert + Tobin, for instance, will lease about 8300 square metres, or 3.5 floors, compared with the 9300 square metres it has now.\nThat doesn't solve the need for confidentiality. Lawyers handle very sensitive documents and also need privacy when taking confidential phone calls. Gilbert + Tobin's chief operating officer Sam Nickless says client confidentiality is still paramount. In the new space the firm will have lockable team rooms for example. And a technology reorganisation will focus on security and confidentiality of electronic documents.\nAgile working Another catalyst for changing the office is also increasingly obvious: their key clients are doing it.\n\"The Australian workplace is quite sophisticated, but lawyers have been slow to get there,\" principal of architect firm BVN, Bill Dowzer says from New York. \"Corporate Australia for the last few years has shifted to working as effectively as possible, not as lavishly as possible. This has been led by financial services. For instance, all of our top-tier banks have gone to alternative ways of working. Even insurance firms have embraced agile working.\"\nNone of this comes simply for law practices. When a big law firm decides to move out of the traditional and into the \"agile\" workspace, the immediate problem is paper – mountains and mountains of it. Lawyers are famous for being paper intensive and physically marking up documents.\nMinter Ellison – which moved to its brand new offices at Governor Macquarie Tower, in Sydney's financial belt, in May – got rid of about 70 per cent (5200 metres) of its files and books in a nine-month program called Project Declutter.\nIn the switch from its traditional offices across the road, the firm has adopted a \"hybrid\" model. There are offices for some partners, albeit much smaller, as well as fixed desks in an open-plan space. But the offices back the building's core and don't have windows, so perhaps unsurprisingly, 35 per cent of partners chose to move into the open-plan area and those numbers have grown since the firm moved in. No lawyers have chosen to return to an office.\nMinters has also disposed of most of its library, which partner Andrew Cunningham says is largely available in digital format. There is a display wall of books; he jokes that they are there for young graduates to see what a book looks like.\nNot that this strategy always works. Clayton Utz kept its large library when it moved to Bligh Street in 2011 and now boasts that many other law firms borrow books.\nVideo calls The amount of paper isn't the only change in the agile office.\n\"The number of people making video calls has shot up dramatically since we moved,\" Corrs Chambers Westgarth chief operating officer Jon Kenton says.\nCorrs went completely open-plan in Sydney in October 2013. Kenton says not everyone was sold on the idea [of open-plan] in the beginning but with innovation in technology over the past few years, the case for change grew.\nIt doesn't just take technology to bring down barriers. Even something as simple as an internal staircase provokes cultural change. Herbert Smith Freehills partner Peter Dunne says he could go for months without seeing a colleague on another floor. The firm moved to the new ANZ tower in 2013 after more than 30 years at the MLC Centre, in Martin Place – Sydney's Wall Street.\n\"It was like a rabbit warren by the end,\" Dunne says. \"You wouldn't see people going in or out. There's a cost to something like an internal stairway, like we have now, but there's been a noticeable change in energy and engagement. I'm always running into people now I never used to see. I think these days you want to be a million miles away from the isolated mahogany wood corner office.\"\nGrand layouts Sarah Kay workplace director of Woods Bagot – which designed new workplaces for DLA Piper, Corrs and Gilbert + Tobin – says there are the same number of offices but they are now designated as quiet rooms and meeting rooms. Most have phones and screens for laptops.\nLaw firms still have big, grand layouts. The space is just used differently.\nAshurst, which opened its new Sydney headquarters at the historic former Commonwealth Bank \"moneybox building\" at Martin Place in July, has kept a more traditional office layout. Some partners are in open bays or cubicles but all offices are now shared by two people. Having fewer offices has been balanced out by more breakout areas, meeting rooms and a grand old library surrounding the atrium.\n\"There has been the odd request for frosted glass for someone's office but it's been remarkably free of complaints,\" partner James Marshall says. \"It's not quite open-plan, but sharing is a theme. Over time given the pressure on lawyer costs and being more efficient I think it's inevitable we will all move to open-plan.\"\nOne issue with the change is less tangible: hierarchy. Hassell director Kirsti Simpson, whose firm was behind the design for Ashurst's new offices, says as recently as 10 years ago, office sizes and location reflected whether you were a junior lawyer or a senior partner. It was seen as important to know your place so you could aspire to something, she says.\nAttracting young talent King & Wood Mallesons is doing a staged fitout at Governor Macquarie Tower. The firm was a trailblazer, with its mergers and acquisitions team going open-plan in the 1990s. Now each of its floors is being gutted and re-fitted one at a time with teams being given the choice of whether they retain offices or go into open-plan.\n\"I don't think having offices is the determining factor when it comes having a formal hierarchy. Office space is about creating an environment where you do your best work. Who am I to say all lawyers must sit in open-plan? That is actually creating the hierarchy,\" managing partner Sue Kench says.\nTalented young graduates aren't necessarily aspiring to the corner office any more either.\nBVN's Dowzer says recruiting smart young people is becoming difficult. \"You've got the really great graduates now going to sexy technology companies. A top law firm in New York City used to be able to get the best graduates without question, now they are seen by many as being out of touch.\"\nAt they very least, law graduates now want access to senior practitioners to advance their careers. At DLA Piper's one-year-old offices at Martin Place, for instance, all senior partners and lawyers share an office with a junior employee. \"About 50 to 60 per cent chose to sit in open-plan, but for those that didn't, they now must share with a junior lawyer,\" managing partner John Weber says.\nAustralia more adventurous It may be dangerous to assume every young lawyer wants to be collaborative all of the time in an open environment. But it's equally dangerous to assume things in the law sector won't be turned on their head even more. While Australia has largely been more adventurous than Britain and the US, it is still too soon to determine what works.\n\"This is all still so new. We haven't seen a full lease term yet in this way of working. It will be fascinating over the next few years to see how those that embraced agile and open-plan have gone,\" Hassell's Simpson says.\nOne person watching closely is Michael Rose, the managing partner of Allens Linklaters, currently housed at Deutsche Bank Place on Phillip Street. Rose thinks adapting and modifying office space will become a constant process, not something happening every 10 years with a move. Allens has hired architects BVN and Hassell to separately pilot alternatives for its office space when its lease expires. That will include spaces for both non-dedicated and dedicated workspace. And yes, that could mean hot desking, the next quantum leap for the law sector.\nWhatever happens, there will be no return to the 'old times,' says Steve Urwin of Kernel Property, whose company helps firms such as Allens negotiate with landlords for their office space. Any suggestion there will be a reversion back to traditional space is \"fanciful,\" he says.\n\"As paper printing and storage among lawyers continues to reduce dramatically, we'll also eventually see a take up in unassigned desking in law firms, as we have across other corporates,\" Urwin says.\nBack at Gilbert + Tobin's space, when Danny Gilbert is asked whether he thinks his new arrangement makes him more approachable, he turns to his secretary, who is now no longer separated from him by a wall, and asks her if he has been more accessible to his staff.\n\"Oh yeah, and much less intimidating,\" she responds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:10:29.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
