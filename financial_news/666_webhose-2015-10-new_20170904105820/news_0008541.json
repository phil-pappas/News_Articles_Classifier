Camelot’s booming online operations, with mobile sales surging by 72pc compared with a year earlier, have helped it offset waning interest in EuroMillions, which has suffered recently due to fewer big jackpots. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) means that the lottery has now handed out more than £57bn in prize money since its inception, and raised over £34bn for good causes. But despite the record half-year sales and Duncan’s belief that the lottery is regarded as a “national treasure”, he insists that ensuring the draw-based game’s lasting popularity is not as easy as some might think. \n“Up until two years ago, Lotto had been in fairly steady decline for 10 years, even though the National Lottery itself had grown overall,” he says. \nDuncan, 53, was managing director of Camelot’s UK operations for three years , before the company was split in two last year. The international division was spun-off and Duncan was made chief executive of the UK business. \nHe says that making sure the Lottery is a continuing success is all down to “how effective you are in terms of innovation”. To that end, he has embarked on two major shake-ups of Camelot’s flagship to keep players interested in the Lotto balls. \nThe first was lifting the price per Lotto ticket from £1 to £2 in 2013, which boosted sales but was controversial as it was the first hike since the draw’s launch in 1994. The second was implemented earlier this month, when the number of balls in the Lotto draw was increased to 59 from 49 . At the same time, Camelot, which is owned by Canada’s Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, introduced a “Millionaire Raffle” that guarantees at least one £1m prize is won with every draw. \nAs a result, while the jackpot will be won fewer times, when it is it will be bigger, and the raffle ensures that more millionaires will be created overall. \n“The initial impact has been very positive, sales are up,” Duncan says. Nevertheless, the new format has drawn criticism because it will pay-out fewer jackpots, and he concedes that “we don’t take these sorts of steps lightly, that’s for sure”. However, Duncan says Camelot knew the draw “needed a bit of a shake-up” and had been considering the change for “well over two years”, looking at “every single permutation and combination that you can imagine”. \nDuncan is no stranger to trying something new. As chief executive of Channel 4 between 2004 and 2009, he presided over the launch of 4oD, which meant Channel 4 was the first broadcaster to provide access to all of its commissioned programmes on the web. While at the BBC between 2001 and 2004, Duncan was also behind the launch of Freeview. \nEducated at Whitgift School and then University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Duncan joined Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) in 1984 as a marketing graduate trainee. He progressed swiftly, becoming responsible for brands such as I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter, PG Tips, Super Noodles and Flora. His varied career, which also included a year as boss of car dealership HR Owen before joining Camelot in 2011, prepared him well for the lottery. \n“What really appealed to me was that it did seem to draw on all the different things I’ve done,” he says. While Duncan describes Camelot as “ultimately” a “consumer goods company”, his television experience was “also highly relevant”. \n“We’re going through the same digital transformation that the media industry went through five, ten years ago,” Duncan says. \nRepositioning the lottery for the digital age has been one of his biggest challenges. Last year, Camelot overhauled its website and mobile platform in a revamp “that cost the thick-end of £25m”. The company plans to invest further in technology to improve player communication and is exploring other uses for smartphones. \n“I could see a situation where people are zapping their smartphone on a code in store, rather than queuing to get a ticket at the kiosk,” says Duncan. One of his aims is to mine Camelot’s data so the company can more effectively target player communication about causes it supports. Camelot generates £34m each week for such initiatives as playgrounds, parks, arts funding, and sport. \n“It’s a bit like having a Children In Need every week and yet most members of the public have only probably, at best, got a partial view as to where that money has gone,” says Duncan. \nThe charitable aspect of the lottery was a key attraction of the Camelot job. Duncan is a regular churchgoer who, while a student, spent four months in Calcutta on Mother Teresa’s mission. When he left Manchester he considered a career in the charity or voluntary sectors. \nHe says his faith is not incompatible with working at Camelot because he believes it is fundamentally different from other gambling firms. \n“I think the lottery model is inherently a very good model, I wouldn’t be comfortable working at a pure gambling company, definitely not,” he says. However, the line separating betting companies and lotteries is becoming increasingly blurred, which is a worry to Duncan. While there is a ban on betting on the National Lottery, some firms allow punters to place wagers on the outcome of foreign lotteries and Camelot believes the rise of online gambling is making it easier to bet on draws. \nThe company, which promotes EuroMillions in the UK, is particularly concerned about what it calls a “loophole” that allows bets to be placed on European versions of the draw. It has urged the Government and Gambling Commission to close the loophole to preserve the difference between lotteries and gambling. \nAnother threat is the rise of rivals People’s Postcode Lottery and Richard Desmond’s Health Lottery that Camelot believes are denting the amount it can raise for good causes. \nBoth competitors are made up of society lotteries that are advertised under national brands. Duncan says that Camelot has no issue with the principle of society draws, many of which are small and local. But he argues that the larger Health Lottery and People’s Postcode Lottery “pay a disproportionate amount on expenses and marketing and paying themselves” rather than on good causes. In contrast, at Camelot just 4pc of National Lottery revenues is spent on operating costs, less than 1pc is profit, and the rest goes to good causes, to retailers, or returned to players in prizes. \nCamelot campaigned aggressively against its rivals and an attempt to close the Health Lottery altogether was unsuccessful , but Duncan is unapologetic for the company’s stance. \n“Ultimately our job is to be the best stewards we can of the National Lottery on behalf of the nation,” he says. The wind is blowing in his favour. The Culture, Media and Sport select committee earlier this year recommended that Government caps lotteries’ operating expenses and that operators are forced to be more transparent about where their money goes. Duncan is hopeful the government will act on the report in the next six months. \nAnother challenge looming on the horizon is the competition for the next National Lottery licence. \nCamelot has run the draw from the very beginning, although it almost lost it to Sir Richard Branson’s People’s Lottery in 2000. \nThe present licence expires in 2023 and Duncan thinks discussions about the next bidding process will start in 2019 or 2020. \n“The way we’re thinking about it is we need to do the best possible job we can for the next few years,” he says. “We don’t obsess about it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:04:02.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
