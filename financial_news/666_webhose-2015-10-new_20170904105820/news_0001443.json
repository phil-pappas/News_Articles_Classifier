It's also a true Jaguar, as much as you can measure these things in today's share-and-share-alike car industry.\nThat's another way of saying it isn't a mildly repackaged Ford, as per the previous little cat, known as the X-Type. This new XE is an in-house design with aluminium architecture, mostly aluminium body panels and, in one variant, an all-new Jaguar designed-and-built engine known as Ingenium.\nIts arrival provides a welcome extra choice for the luxury buyer and its success is absolutely crucial for the brand, now owned by Indian conglomerate Tata. It is really Jaguar's sister brand, Land Rover, that has been doing the heavy lifting in commercial terms in recent years.\nFortunately for Tata, however, despite all Jaguar's ups and downs, the oh-so British brand still creates serious passion.\nAt a shade over $60,000, this car is pitched directly against the big-selling C-Class Benz. The bad news? Well, it's mainly bad news for Jaguar, not necessarily buyers. The new XE Jaguar lobs into the super competitive medium-luxury segment and none of the well-entrenched competitors will be giving any quarter.\nThe Germans have far more marketing clout and offer extraordinarily broad ranges in this segment (sedans, wagons, two- and four-door coupes, cabriolets and more). The Brits are restricted at this stage to a sedan.\nIt's also true that a small Jaguar carries historical baggage. The Ford Mondeo-based X-Type was born in 2001, and died of neglect in 2009. It was dowdy to look at, uninspiring to operate and very hard to love. And it never shook off the marque's well-earned reputation for poor reliability and substandard build quality.\nThis car has to reverse that image and do so emphatically if Jaguar is to generate the sort of volumes that will allow reinvesting in new models and new technology.\nThe interior feels a little sparse and breaks away from traditional Jaguar cockpits as there is none of the burred wood and English club leather chair affectations. It is well done, but hardly innovative. The car we drove was the 2-litre petrol model, known as the 20t, in the Prestige trim level. The Ingenium engine has surfaced so far only in diesel form (with petrol versions to come); the car we tested uses a carry-over unit from the Ford days.\n'Best-looking in class' In the lead-up to launch, Jaguar promised the best-looking car in the class. Some will say \"mission accomplished\"; to these eyes, the exterior is attractive but not stunning or hugely distinctive. The SUV that will follow (the F-Pace) is a more dramatic statement and that might be why the company showed that off (as the C-X17 concept) first. Both cars are built off the same platform, as is the new XF sedan which, due to a muck-up with production timing, arrived at pretty well exactly the same time as the smaller XE.\nJaguar has always been marketed as a driver's car, even with limousines, and the XE doesn't disappoint. For a base model the 20t has superb road manners. It isn't particularly light despite the extensive use of aluminium (it weighs in at 1530 kilograms), but it feels lithe and nimble and has lively performance.\nThe steering – borrowed from the XF – loads up immediately and tracks consistently, and the turn-in is further improved by an effective and unobtrusive torque vectoring system, which brakes the inside wheels during cornering.\nOn a nice bit of winding road, with the free-revving two-litre working hard (and giving off the occasional growl), all impressions are of a car you could have plenty of fun with.\nDespite the modest antecedents, the base two-litre engine delivers a very competitive 147kW and 280Nm. A 177kW version of the same engine is available while hero duties go to a supercharged three-litre V6.\nThat said, the base engine works best in the high-rev range and doesn't quite match the German for fuel efficiency. The official lab-derived figure is 7.5L/100km on the combined cycle. On the other hand, everyone has the right to be suspicious of any official numbers at the moment. Let's hope there is soon a major overhaul of the way all economy and emission figures are measured (and, more importantly, verified) in the wake of the VW shambles.\nThe two-litre engine is matched to an eight-speed automatic which generally works well though it can be a bit stuttery at low speed in the Sports setting. The rotary gear selector would be better utilised on a dishwasher but the paddles work well.\nA hard balancing act The ride is firmer than we have come to expect from Jaguars – once renowned for a magical balancing of the competing demands of ride and handling. That's harder to do of course in a small car.\nThe interior feels a little sparse and breaks away from traditional Jaguar cockpits. There is none of the burred wood and English club leather chair affectations. It is well done, but hardly innovative. But for the big Jaguar embossed on the steering wheel, the smaller \"Jaguars\" signs on the vents and elsewhere, and a couple of other subtle touches, it could be almost any brand.\nSome things are quite plasticky and not everything fits beautifully – at least by the elevated standards of the class. At a shade over $60,000, this car is pitched directly against the big-selling C-Class Benz. The cowling around the instrument panel on our car, for example, protruded slightly on the left side. A small thing (and on an early production car), but it's something you can't help but notice.\nEquipment levels are competitive. There are a few things that are standard on the XE and not on the direct competition, including full auto braking if a collision is imminent. Other things are not quite as up-to-date (for example, xenon headlights and cruise control that doesn't engage the brakes to maintain the set speed).\nThere is generous headroom in the back, thanks to a huge concavity in the rear headlining. The seats are comfortable, the large touchscreen is a pleasure to use.\nThere must be many Jaguarphiles who have long been waiting for a good small Jaguar. It this car proves reliable, and can match the competition for build quality, it has the scope to find buyers well beyond the hardcore devotees.\nJaguar XE 20t Prestige\nPrice (excluding on-road costs): $60,400 (as tested: $65,690)\nEngine: 2-litre turbocharged inline four (petrol)\nPower/torque: 147kW / 280Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 7.5L / 100km\nC0₂: 179 grams per kilometre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:11:19.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
