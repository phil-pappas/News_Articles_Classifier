Robert Shakespeare Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans It's been almost 40 years since Santos was last seriously under the gun on the takeover front .\nBack in the late 1970s it was corporate raider and eventual jail bird Alan Bond making a tilt at Santos. This time its the exotically named Scepter Partners, with its headquarters in Bermuda and $14 billion in backing from sovereign wealth funds and a strong connection to the royal families of Brunei and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe firm might sound like something out of a James Bond film, but it knows its oil and gas. It also has patience on its side.\nScepter Partners has its head office in Bermuda, but also has offices in New York and Hong Kong. The chairman of the Scepter board is Prince Abdul Ali Yil Kabier, a scion of the Royal Family of Brunei, and other directors include the United Arab Emirates's Sheik Juma al Maktoum.\nThe chief executive is Rayo Withanage, an expert in mergers and acquisitions who was a brilliant law student at the University of Auckland and then went on to knock over a Masters degree at the London School of Economics.\nHe officially assumed the role as Scepter chief executive just two weeks ago.\nMr Withanage, who is touted as one of the most influential financiers in the Middle East and Asia, built up an entity called BMB Group into a powerful ultra-high net worth fund with backing from the investment arms of family offices in Asia and the Middle East.\nBMB was originally set up in 2006 and the Royal Family of Brunei was one of the original founders and they were closely advised by investment bankers and key players from private equity firm Blackstone.\n Just a few months ago the main investors decided they needed some more grunt and wanted to come out of the shadows of being a relatively conservative family office looking after the funds of ultra high net worth individuals.\nThere was more money to be made by being more aggressive, and getting the timing right in picking off unloved assets in a down cycle.\nScepter Partners was the result, with more clout and more capital after extra sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors were brought into the tent.\nInvestment banker Anthony Steains and some of his former Blackstone Asia advisers have come on board and are part of the management team.\nMr Steains spent 20 years wheeling and dealing in mergers and acquisitions across Asia. Former HSBC chairman John Bond is also on the Scepter board.\nThe global clout and wealth of Scepter, and the exotic connections to some of the most powerful ruling families around the world, means this entity has an air of mystery.\nBut make no mistake, it has set a floor under the price of Santos shares with its $6.88 per share indicative offer, which is likely to be the start of the end game for a break-up of Santos as we know it, as the oil and has firm separately runs an asset sale process.\nAlan Bond, one of Australia's most famous corporate raiders in the 1980s, died in June this year. In the late 1970s he was a predator of Santos but was blocked by the South Australian Government who in 1979 put in a 15 per cent shareholder cap to stop Bond from taking over vital Cooper Basin oil and gas assets.\nThat 15 per cent cap was removed in late 2008 as the board and executives wanted Santos to be on an even playing field and subject to full market forces.\nThe sharp slump in the oil price just as Santos completed its heavy capital spending on its massive $US18.5 billion GLNG plant in Queensland and a weak balance sheet, has left the garage door open for the ruling royal families of oil-rich nations to drive right on in.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-10-22T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:10:04.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
