Simon Letch by Jemima Whyte When fear and loathing hits markets – as it has in spades these past weeks – the small companies are almost always torched. But this time around, it's different.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 this quarter chalked up its worst three months in eight years , as investors panicked about the impact on asset valuations of falling commodities prices, the prospect of the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates, China's slowing economic growth and the threat of long term deflation.\nCommodities trading giant and miner Glencore bore the brunt of those fears , falling 30 per cent in one session this week as investors sold on worries it would not be able to meet debt payments if commodity prices didn't pick up.\nIn Australia, electricity provider and gas company Origin Energy also faced its own moment of reckoning – opting to raise $2.5 billion at $4 a share to ensure it could pay its debt load. For a company that knocked back at $15.50 a share offer in 2008, it was a loud reminder of how much times have changed.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 this quarter chalked up its worst three months in eight years, as investors panicked. Louie Douvis But while once-unassailable companies are being savaged (remember Glencore just one year ago was lining up for a tilt at Rio Tinto?), small caps are emerging comparatively unscathed.\nPerhaps this sell-off is more rational than it looks? Perhaps it's not an Armageddon, or an indiscriminate GFC-style rout, but a rational resetting of prices in certain sectors, a tech-crash style unwinding of the resources boom? Or perhaps there's much more to come.\nUsually, when it's \"risk-off,\" small caps are first out of the portfolio, on the basis they lack liquidity, are more volatile and, usually, have a narrower earnings base.\nBut in the past quarter, the S&P ASX Small Ords – while still down – is outperforming the S&P ASX 200.\n\"The small cap sector has pockets of growth and that's what the market is desperate for, it's gone off the yield story,\" says Matthew Kidman, chief investment officer at Centennial Asset Management, an Australian small cap fund. Daniel Munoz In the three months to September, the broader index shed 8.01 per cent while the small caps only lost 5.26 per cent. In the past month (which doesn't include the last few days of stronger markets), the S&P ASX 200 is down 3.56 per cent compared with the Small Ords' 1.91 per cent fall.\nWhat's going on?\n\"I don't think it's been panic stations and I don't think we are there in the cycle yet,\" says KIS Capital Partners' Josh Best, who runs who runs a hedge fund which trades local and Asian markets and which has gained 2.61 per cent in September, taking the year to date performance to 9.5 per cent.\n\"If the S&P was to break lower again and ASX200 punch through 5000, we will get to a point where it's sell everything … we haven't stressed the equity markets [that much] yet.\"\nMore than just a re-rating But there's more than just a considered, targeted, if savage re-rating going on.\nSomething else is also at play.\nIn an environment where growth is a rare commodity, small caps offer something large caps can't – revenue and earnings.\n\"The small cap sector has pockets of growth and that's what the market is desperate for, it's gone off the yield story,\" says Matthew Kidman, chief investment officer at Centennial Asset Management, an Australian small cap fund.\nKidman says sectors like telcos, IT and even the agricultural sector all offer growth opportunities that aren't linked directly to concerns about lower economic growth, both locally and offshore.\nKIS Capital's Best also says small caps can offer growth opportunities for investors, noting the fund holds outsourcing company freelancer.com which is growing revenue at about 40 per cent a year..\nSmart Investor made this point a few weeks ago, in an article explaining that big is no longer better and that it's time to look beyond big companies and diversify holdings.\nPut in a longer perspective, Pengana's Ed Prendergast says the small cap volatility hasn't been that remarkable.\n\"We've got memories that go back to 2008, when prices would move 30 per cent in a week,\" he says, adding this is more akin to the market re-ratings when Dubai had its crisis, and even more recently, Spain and Italy.\nCentennial's Kidman agrees.\n\"You don't get crashes like '08 and '87 all the time. You normally have unravelling bear markets that take a while to come through. It took 30 months for the tech crash to come through. That's happening with China.\"\nSo where is all the fear and loathing coming from? By the end of the week, it was noticeably less, despite none of the market's big worries having found obvious solutions.\nGlencore had almost recovered all of its losses by the end of this week, and sharemarkets had also regained some ground.\nBut there's plenty of bears that have been out there for some time. And it's unlikely those fears will just vanish overnight.\n﻿ In recent weeks, short positions in the S&P 500 futures index had hovered around levels not seen since 2006, implying an unusually large number of trades are betting there's more losses to go.\nThat tallies with the overwhelming tendency to focus on the negative stories, which JPMorgan's top Australian economist Stephen Walters says struck him when visiting the bank's northern hemisphere clients in mid September. Walters usually visits offshore clients twice a year, and he says there's never been such doom and gloom in 30 or so visits.\n\"I've never encountered such a negativity extension to Australia from China,\" he says, in typical economist-speak, meaning the gloomy outlook on China is affecting investors' view on Australia's growth prospects. Walters argues that such a downbeat assessment of Australia's economic growth is overblown.\n\"But it wasn't a well-thought-through strategy,\" he told the Weekend AFR . \"Even if China growth is south of 5 per cent, which we don't forecast, on the export volume story we are really well placed. Even the most bearish forecasts on Australia anticipate 2 per cent GDP growth next year.\"\nNational Australia Bank's Ivan Colhoun faced a simarlarly pessimistic audience on trip offshore, writing to clients last week:\n\"I have never experienced such overwhelming negativity on the outlook for the Australian economy and $A in all my years marketing the Australian economy offshore,\" Colhoun wrote. \"To be fair, one investor did say that they were not that negative on Australia. Another described the Australian economy as 'toast'.\"\nFeeding that investor negativity is a number of factors.\nVery little has changed overnight, though the prospect the US Federal Reserve could raise interest rates before the end of the year is increasingly looking more likely.\nThat's of concern because investors are now more worried about deflation, which is when prices fall and everything becomes cheaper, rather than inflation.\nThat's worrying because in the past, interest rate rises have been used to slow growth and curb inflation, so any Fed rate rises will drive lower growth when the market is looking for something to kick-start it.\nThe immediate impact of this is that traders have pulled down asset prices – particularly those in commodities, where the market is also worried about faltering Chinese economic growth and how that could hit global demand.\nAdd into this heady mix the fact that US high-yield issuance has been dominated in the past 18 months by the energy and oil sectors. The combination of rising interest rates and a commodity price collapse has investors pushing up the cost of borrowing for those companies, because they are concerned about whether they will get their money back.\nSo there's reason for the \"buckets of negativity\", as one investor describes it.\nPatches of optimism But, as the end of this week has demonstrated, there may be some patches of optimism – or at least less negativity. Perhaps it's not quite so bad after all.\n\"If you say the trend continues it's easy to be bearish,\" says KIS' Best.\n\"In this business you need to be able to change your mind within 24 hours. But I suspect you are going to see a pick up of confidence in China as some economic data starts to pick up due to monetary and fiscal stimulus filtering through. That could lead to commodity prices finding a low.\"\nHedge fund MST Capital's Gerard Satur expects the equity markets could stage a rally into the end of the year.\n\"We think central banks globally, especially the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and the Peoples Bank of China can do more to foster growth, and that could lead to the last leg of the equity rally,\" Satur says.\n\"The QE trade of the last four years was to be long equities and bonds. However, global liquidity dynamics are now much more mixed, we could see extended periods of poor performance of equities and bonds going forward. We also expect volatility to pick up in line with this.\"\nBut while there may be pockets of improvements, and the potential to keep trading equity markets, the overall view is that the markets won't be booming for some time yet.\n\"We should get used to lower productivity and population growth, so lower potential growth is here to stay. So, things are going to seem a little underwhelming for a while longer yet,\" says JPMorgan's Walters.\nIn a world where global economic growth is being constantly revised down, it may well end up that small caps are the only genuine hope of real growth for many investors.\nOr maybe, there's no such thing as a new paradigm.\n\"Small cap stocks are showing relative strength to the rest of the market, but there's no safe haven in this market we are in. We're not going to end this down cycle until small caps get beaten up. Typically the cycle comes to an end when small caps underperform, and that's yet to happen,\" says Jonathan Horton, founder of hedge fund NWQ Capital Management.\nInstead, he says, managers in which the fund invests are picking through opportunities in the mid- and large-cap sector, where dispersion returns are so high that a long short approach can be fruitful. His fund has returned 11.8 per cent in the year so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:08:46.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
