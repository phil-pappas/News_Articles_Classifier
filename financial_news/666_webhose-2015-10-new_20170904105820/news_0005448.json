Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The Turnbull government will pass legislation before the plebiscite on same-sex marriage is held to guarantee that people know in advance exactly what they will be voting for.\nIf the plebiscite passes, the Marriage Act will be changed automatically to reflect the result.\nAlthough Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised the Nationals and conservatives in his own ranks to adhere to Tony Abbott's timetable of a plebiscite after the next election, gay marriage advocates in the Liberal Party believe this initial legislation should be passed before the election to expedite the whole process afterwards.\nQueensland Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who is discussing the matter with Mr Turnbull and Attorney-General George Brandis, told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday that the legislation would set the time frame for the plebiscite, which he argues should be much less than 100 days after the next federal election. Labor has promised a parliamentary vote within 100 days if it wins the election.\nChange to be defined Mr Entsch said the legislation would define the change to the Marriage Act, and contain a provision to automatically trigger the change should there be a yes vote. If there were a no vote, the act would remain unchanged.\nHe said the legislation should be passed before the election and that this would not contravene the assurances Mr Turnbull has given to the conservatives.\nBut sources close to the Prime Minister indicated a pre-election vote, even if it was not for same-sex marriage per se, could cause internal unrest and Mr Turnbull had not agreed to a pre-election vote.\n In Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Turnbull alluded to the pre-plebiscite legislation when he guaranteed same-sex marriage would become legal in the event of a yes vote.\nConservative NSW Liberal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage, warned that the Liberals would suffer from an ethnic backlash in marginal seats if it endorsed same-sex marriage.\n\"A Coalition policy that directly supports same-sex marriage could place under threat some of our most marginal seats which have disproportionately high religious and migrant communities,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:04:00.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
