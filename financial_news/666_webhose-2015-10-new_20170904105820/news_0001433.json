The dollar weakened after the disappointing data and two Federal Reserve policy makers said they would like to wait before raising interest rates.\nForward dollar premium payable in March slipped to 189-191 from last weekend’s level of 199-201 paise on receipts from exporters and far-forward contracts maturing in September 2016 ended lower at 403-405 paise as against 414.5-416.5 paise previously.\nThe RBI fixed the reference rate for the dollar and euro at 64.9697 and 73.9940, respectively from the last weekend’s level of 64.7848 and 73.0837.\nThe rupee declined against the pound to end the week at 100.16 from the last weekend’s level of 99.34 and also fell against the euro to 73.60 from 73.56.\nThe domestic unit however, gained further against the Japanese currency to finish at 54.45 per 100 yen from the last weekend’s level of 53.59.\n 17, 2015 1:58 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:30:34.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
