But the directionless EMU is still heading nowhere fast \n\"Ever closer union\". It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's this foundational phrase of the European Union that strikes dread into the heart of the Government's Brexit renegotiators. \nAbandoning this now toxic promise - first laid out in the Treaty of Rome in 1957 - is a key plank in prime minister David Cameron's bid to redraw the UK's relationship with Europe. \nBut the teleological Economic and Monetary Union is still on a one-way street towards deeper integration, if Brussels' mantra is to be believed. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) the euro's most ardent critics actively support the drive to \"complete\" economic and monetary union as the best way to shore up the crisis-hit bloc. \nIn fact, a quantum leap towards a full blown EU \"superstate\" would provide the perfect opportunity to re-open the EU's treaties - an opportunity Mr Cameron craves in his bid to formalise a two-speed Europe. \n• France and Germany are the biggest threats to an EU superstate \nWhat the UK fears, however, is the threat of a tightly integrated 19-member bloc riding roughshod over British interests - particularly those that affect the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) . \nThese fears were made vocal in an unusual intervention by the Governor of the Bank of England , Mark Carney, earlier this week. \nThe Bank's ability to preserve financial stability could be compromised unless Britain secured a \"principled\" and \"upfront\" guarantee that the EU is a multi-currency union, he said. \nConveniently, his comments came on the same day the European Commission unveiled its latest plans for a \"deeper and fairer\" eurozone. \nBut contrary to anxiety in Britain, Brussels' visions for the next stage of eurozone reform are simply a case of \"old wine in new skins\", says Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING. \nThe Commission's \"Five President's Report\", which sets out plans for EMU integration, has been accused of showing a poverty of ambition. \n\"Past experience has shown that even these proposals are likely to be watered down in the coming months,\" added Mr Brzeski. \nSo what are the areas that will see the biggest push towards ever-closer union? \n= Spending and competitiveness = \nThe eurozone has been accused of a dangerous disciplinary bias, focusing too heavily on punishing member states who fail to comply with arbitrary economic targets. \nIn this vein, the Commission's latest reforms do little to ease up on belt-tightening. The EU will now establish a \"European Fiscal Board\" to bulk up the surveillance of member states budgets to ensure they meet mandated debt and deficit targets set out in the Fiscal Compact. \nThe board, however, will only have advistory powers, and will not be able to enforce rules or hit countries with financial penalties. It will be composed of \"five renowned international experts\", who will work with existing authorities to make sure government spending falls in to line. \nAccompanying the Fiscal Board will be the creation of new competitiveness authorities in each euro member state. \nThese bodies - which already exist in Belgium, Netherlands and Germany - are designed to \"prevent economic divergence\" by monitoring indicators such as productivity and unemployment. Again, the boards will have no independent power to recommend or discourage policies that fail to bring about convergence. \n= Banking union = \nSteps towards creating a common banking union have proven to be one of the more successful EMU initiatives in the wake of the financial crisis. \nBrussels has set in motion plans to create new rules on winding down failing banks, providing joint deposit guarantees and creating a single supra-national supervisor for lenders across the 19 eurozone member states. \nBut even the banking union - seen as one of the lowest hanging fruits of EMU integration - is set to hit a major snag. \nGermany fiercely opposes paying for a system of common deposit insurance unless it can gain explicit guarantees that Europe's taxpayers will never again foot the bill for billions in bail-outs. \nFor its part, the Commission has already been forced to start legal action against six governments who have failed to introduce these \"bail-in\" laws in their national parliaments. If they fail to do so, deposit insurance and more risk pooling is likely to remain a euro-area pipe dream. \n= More Europe on the international stage = \nThe final leg of the EC's reform drive involves greater representation for the eurozone at the highest levels of international policymaking. Brussels is now pushing for the single currency to have its own seat on the board of the International Monetary Fund, to represent euro-area interests. \nRight now, Germany and France have national representation on the IMF's 24-member executive board, alongside the UK. \n\"Due to the current institutional set-up, the euro-area does not speak with one voice and punches below its weight,\" stated the Commission's latest report. \nIt now envisages that the eurogroup president - a post currently held by Jeroen Dijsselbloem - should act as Brussels' man in Washington. \nBut critics say the Fund is already far too captive to dominant Western interests. Creating a separate seat just for the single currency would risk further alienating emergent powers who feel they are locked out of having a say at the IMF - namely China. \n= What does it all add up to? = \nAll in all, even the most generous observer of EU politicsl will admit the euro's immediate plans for \"ever closer union\" fall far short of a full-blown political and fiscal union . They are largely toothless and cosmetic changes that fail to strike at the heart of the dysfunction that has plagued the euro for the past five years. \nAs ever in Europe, national political constraints rule the day. Under Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's executive arm is trying to become a more political actor, driving home its vision of EU solidarity. \nBut competing visions for the euro's future will not be overcome any time soon. The locus of power continues to lie in Paris and Berlin - rather than Brussels and Frankfurt . The current batch of proposed reforms is meant to be a prelude for more ambitious plans for treaty change after 2017. It is only then British fears about being rail-roaded by the euro may just materialise. \nRight now, Mr Cameron can take succour from a directionless EMU that is still heading nowhere fast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:43:37.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
