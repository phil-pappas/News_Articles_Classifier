PETER MEECHAM/Fairfax NZ by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Woolworths' Masters home improvement chain is considered unsaleable after losing more than $600 million over the last few years, but the same can not be said for Woolworths' Home Timber and Hardware chain, aka Danks.\nWhen Woolworths and its joint venture partner Lowe's bought Danks in 2009 it was half the size of major rival Mitre 10, with sales around $500 million.\nHundreds of independent hardware retailers have quit the sector over the last few years, but HTT's sales have doubled to $937 million, boosted by the acquisition of small chains such as Hudson Timber and Hardware and Belmont Timber.\nWhile Masters lost $245 million last year, HTT earned $20.9 million before interest and tax, almost twice its earnings in 2009.\nIt's no wonder that Mitre 10, which is owned by Metcash, is now taking a look at HTT.\nAccording to some in the industry, Mitre 10, which earned around $30 million last year, has already held informal talks with Woolworths about buying HTT.\nHTT would be worth more than $200 million, based on a multiple of 10 times earnings.\nA merged Mitre 10 and HTT would have annual sales around $2 billion and almost 900 stores, with a combined market share around 5 per cent - one quarter that of market leader Bunnings.\n The big question is whether a deal would get past the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\nAccording to Deutsche Bank, if the ACCC defined the market as the broader $44 billion home improvement market there would be little cause for concern.\nHowever, if the ACCC defined the market as the wholesale market, a merger of the two largest wholesalers would likely raise competition concerns.\nOne option may be for Woolworths and Metcash to sell their respective hardware wholesale operations into a joint venture, which could be subsequently floated.\nElsewhere in the retail space, PAS Group, the company behind brands such as Metalicus, Review and Black Pepper, is expected to update investors on Thursday on a $86 million offer from major shareholder Coliseum Capital Partners.\nPAS has urged shareholders to reject Coliseum Capital's 63 cents a share offer, saying it's opportunistic and materially undervalues the company.\nThe offer values PAS Group at 5.4 times 2015 earnings before interest and tax, well below the median historical EV/EBIT multiple of 8.1.\nBut with Coliseum already holding a 19.4 per cent stake, and with PAS shares trading around 50 cents in the six months before the bid, chairman Rod Walker and CEO Eric Morris may have trouble convincing shareholders to sit tight. The on-market offer is due to close on November 9.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:01:41.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
