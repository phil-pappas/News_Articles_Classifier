Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan Australian shares fell for the third day in a row on Wednesday, held back by faltering sentiment around housing, commodities and the Chinese economy.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.1 per cent, or 5.55 points, at 5197.3, well off the day's low at 5164.2, while the broader All Ordinaries Index ended the day at 5230.4, off 0.1 per cent or 4.2 points.\nThe market has, since Monday, been steadily giving back gains posted last week, which, at 4.5 per cent, was the best result in four years.\nOvernight weakness on Wall Street set the tone on Wednesday's session, after soft import data from China on Tuesday held US shares down across the Dow, S&P500 and the Nasdaq indices.\nOn Wednesday, it was a larger-than-expected drop in China's inflation rate, and continued weakness in producer prices that most rattled sentiment.\nIn local news, the mood took an initial hit from Westpac's decision to make loans to home-buyers other than speculative investors more expensive from November 20.\nThe move, designed to help meet tougher capital adequacy rules while maintaining net interest margins, was also interpreted as a sign that overheated residential property markets in Sydney and Melbourne were cooling.\nThis, in turn, could open the door for the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut the cash rate further, from the current record low of 2 per cent.\n The other three big lenders are expected to follow Westpac's lead, and there was some consequent selling of financial stocks in reaction before buyers moved in.\nTrading in Westpac was halted as the bank also gave details of its long-expected capital raising while announcing 3 per cent profits growth.\nMeanwhile, ANZ Banking Group edged ahead 0.5 per cent to $28.65. National Australia Bank climbed 0.9 per cent to $31.51 and Commonwealth Bank of Australia was up 0.4 per cent to $74.56.\nThis fightback by banks, however, was offset by weakness in energy stocks, which were hit by a further fall in the price of oil overnight and profit-taking after last week's run-up.\nBenchmark Brent crude lost 1.2 per cent, to $US49.24 a barrel overnight after a heavy 5.3 per cent fall on Monday.\nAustralia's biggest oil producer Woodside Petroleum lost 1.6 per cent to $30.86. Santos, meanwhile, dropped 5.2 per cent to $5.18, and Origin lost 7.4 per cent to $5.49, making it the worst performer of the day among the top 200 stocks.\nOil Search also dropped, by 2.9 per cent to $7.14. DrillSearch lost 1.6 per cent to 60 cents, while AWE was also down heavily, by 4.8 per cent to 70 cents.\nTogether, they dragged the energy sub-index down more than 3 per cent to be the worst performer of the day, while discretionary consumer stocks fared the best, up 0.9 per cent.\nPeak Asset Manager executive director Niv Dagan said investors had this week taken a reality check on both the US and Chinese economies after last week's upbeat mood.\n\"Investors pushed back interest rate expectations from the US market following some weak numbers last week, and that pushed commodity prices higher,\" he said.\n\"What we are seeing over the last few days is weakness again in the oil and gas space; iron ore has fallen; copper's off its highs, and we'll probably see another leg down in the Aussie dollar,\" he said.\nHe said Wednesday's surprisingly weak inflation figures from China also raised the possibility of another currency devaluation by the world's second-largest economy.\n\"Coming after the weaker-than-expected trade data from China [on Tuesday], there's a chance of weaker GDP numbers ahead.\nThe flip side of this is the boost to airlines from persistently lower oil prices; Qantas shares ended 1.9 per cent higher at $3.80.\nDomino's Pizza, however, was the outperformer of the day, climbing 6.9 per cent, to $42.52, after announcing it was scouting the world for aquisitions after agreeing the $55 million purchase of France's Pizza Sprint.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:09:04.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
