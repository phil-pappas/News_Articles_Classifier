The partnership will give Innovest clients access to UAP’s “one stop shop” which provides professional trustees and owners with the tools they need to manage unique assets successfully.\nThe ability to support unique assets such as real estate, closely held businesses, mineral interests, and collectibles is an increasingly important capability when banks and trust companies are seeking to attract high net worth individuals. According to a recent survey published in Trusts & Estates, unique assets account for half of the investments owned by wealthy Americans. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity for banks and trust companies.\nGretchen Goode, Innovest’s senior vice president of marketing, said, “Unique Asset Partners is a clear thought leader and expert in the alternative asset market and we are very excited to be working with them to deliver their tools and services to our clients. Competition for trust and investment management services continues to increase and UAP gives banks and trust companies an important advantage in signing new business and for earning more fee income on assets they already hold.”\nBrad Davidson, Unique Asset Partners’ managing director, said, “Unique assets represent a huge overlooked opportunity for firms serving the wealthy. Given how vital they are to their owners, firms offering the services unique asset owners need will be the winners. Thanks to Innovest’s partnership with UAP, Innovest clients now have access to everything they need for unique asset success. UAP is proud to be Innovest’s unique asset partner.”\nAbout Unique Asset Partners LLC\nUnique Asset Partners LLC (UAP) is a “one-stop shop” providing everything professional trustees and owners need to manage unique assets successfully.
