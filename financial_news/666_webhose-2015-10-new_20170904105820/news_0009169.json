Goldman Sachs and Boeing contributing the most to gains. The greatest weight on the index was UnitedHealth, which recovered some losses but remained about 1.5 percent lower. The firm's third-quarter earnings beat but guidance held steady.

I think it's looking at fundamentals more than anything,\" he said. \nRobert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, also noted support for stocks from dovish comments by European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny, who said it was \"obvious\" the bank must search for more ways to stimulate the euro zone economy.\n\n\"It's more of those dovish comments and then it's going to focus on the earnings and a little less about economic data,\" Pavlik said. \"If it weren't for trepidation as far as earnings season is concerned we'd probably see the market higher right now, because people are a little nervous.\" \nThe euro turned lower against the dollar on Nowotny's remarks, before extending losses on U.S. data. \nU.S. CPI declined 0.2 percent in September, matching expectations. Ex-food and energy, the price index rose 0.2 percent for the month, following a 0.1 percent rise in August. \n\n\"Low inflation continues to say the Fed's not in a rush to raise interest rates and investors are taking that as a positive sign,\" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"However, I would point out that a lot of the low inflation (numbers) are due to low oil prices.\"\n\n\"We keep seeing very low inflation numbers. That's certainly good news for consumers, workers whose wages aren't rising very quickly,\" she said. \"But with oil prices flattening, we're not going to see inflation as low as it has been. It will move closer to the Fed's 2 percent number more quickly than people are anticipating and that's a reason the Fed will say there's a reason to raise in 2016.\" \nIn another sign of continued strength in the labor market, weekly jobless claims declined to 255,000, falling back to a 42-year low. \n\nNew York Fed President William Dudley said at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution Wednesday morning he would favor a rate hike this year if the economy performs in line with forecasts. However, he said recent economic news did suggest economic slowdown. \n\n\"Overall his comments that the economy is slowing are consistent with investors' views that the Fed will wait and not raise interest rates in December,\" Warne said. \nAmid the release of consumer inflation data and earnings from big banking names such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs , U.S. stock index futures trimmed gains, with the Dow futures up about 50 points.\n\n\"It's a mixed picture for earnings and economic data,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. It's a \"market that's still searching for direction and that direction is basically being impaired by economic reports.\" \nThe October Empire State Index posted a read of negative 11.36.

If he were to stay on that would make it more likely that a deal will be reached,\" he said. \nIn afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 153 points, or 0.90 percent, at 17,078, with JPMorgan Chase leading advancers and Wal-Mart Stores the greatest decliner. \nThe S&P 500 rose 21 points, or 1.07 percent, at 2,015, with financials leading nine sectors higher and materials the only laggard. \nThe Nasdaq traded up 62 points, or 1.29 percent, at 4,844. \nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded below 17.\n\nAbout three stocks advanced for every decliner on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 469 million and a composite volume of 2.3 billion.\nOn tap this week: \n\nThursday \nEarnings: Schlumberger, Mattel, People's United Fincl., WD-40 \nFriday \nEarnings: GE, Honeywell, Comerica, Kansas City Southern, SunTrust \n9:15 am: Industrial production \n10:00 am: JOLTS \n10:00 am: Consumer sentiment \n10:00 am: Atlanta Fed business inflation expectations \n1:00 pm: Oil rig count \n4:00 pm: Treasury International Capital\nEvelyn Cheng Writer Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change STOXX600 --- C ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:44:28.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
