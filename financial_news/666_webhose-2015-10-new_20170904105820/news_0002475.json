Photo: Supplied\nStart-ups look set to flourish in Australia in the coming months as Malcolm Turnbull puts innovation at the centre of his economic agenda and looks for new ways to support young companies, including tax breaks for investors.\nBut however much the government does, start-ups will still need angel investors to get them off the ground, so here are seven things angel investors are looking for in a business before they'll put in their cash.\nWORLDWIDE POTENTIAL\nInvesting in start-ups is highly risky, so investors want a return of at least 10 times their money, says Nick Abrahams, a corporate lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright, an angel investor and the author of Digital Disruption in Australia: A guide for Entrepreneurs, Investors and Corporates .\nAdvertisement For this reason, investors are looking for a business opportunity with a large potential market, one that extends beyond Australia and is ideally global. \"It's very difficult to get things funded these days which have Australia as their only addressable market,\" says Abrahams.\nA LOGICAL PLAN\nAbrahams is also looking for a logical plan as to how the founders will grow the business, which addresses things like the market and other competitors.\n\"How is the business going to go from a whiteboard to a $20 million a year revenue business?\" he says. \"The reality is that it's not necessarily important that the business execute exactly on that change, but it will reinforce what the addressable market is.\"\nIt gives investors a chance to check the assumptions the founders have made about their business and whether they're realistic. \"That gets the investor comfortable with the business,\" he says.\nTHE FOUNDERS' EXPERTISE\nInvestors are looking for very deep expertise in the industry that a start-up is operating in.\n\"What is the secret sauce that an entrepreneur brings to this business?\" says Abrahams. \"It is very hard for an entrepreneur that has no background in a particular industry to go and pitch to investors and say they'll disrupt this industry.\"\nThey want to see that the entrepreneur knows enough about an industry to completely reshape it.\nTHEIR OWN EXPERTISE\nAlan Jones of incubator Blue Chilli says the most successful angel investors have specialist knowledge of a sector and confine their investment to that.\n\"Investors tend not to take risks with their money unless they really understand that sector, the problem that you're trying to solve and the customers you're solving the problems for and the competitive environment,\" he says. \"There's no point in hinting up an investor who's never invested in your industry before.\"\nAnother reason why investors like to confine themselves to their specialist sector is that they're then able to use their knowledge and experience\nTHE MOTIVATION\nDean McEvoy, an internet entrepreneur who invests in new companies via incubator Startmate, wants to know what motivates the founders to solve the problem they're working on.\n\"If someone comes to me and they're solving a problem in an industry they have no real authentic connection to, that they don't really care about, then that's a bad thing,\" he says.\nThe odds are stacked against most start-ups – only a tiny fraction get funding then go on to make money – so McEvoy says money shouldn't just be the motivation.\n\"A rational, statistical person would look at those numbers and realise that they're better off staying in a job, so they've got to be driven by something greater than money, that you want to have an impact on the world or that you really care about this problem in a way that's really authentic.\nTHE FOUNDERS\nMcEvoy likes to find out how well the founders know each other, whether they've just met at a start-up event or whether they are old school friends or colleagues.\n\"You're sort of backing a marriage here, so you need to make sure they're going to play together in the long run,\" he says.\n\"Being a co-founder, there's good times and there's bad, so you need someone who's going to be in the trenches fighting for you and keep a level head on you when you get too exciting about something.\"\nFOLLOW UP\nMcEvoy says most of the time people don't actually get around to doing what they say they'll do, so when he meets with a start-up founder he'll ask them to achieve a milestone within a month and to get back to him. It's a test of their commitment whether they do get back in touch and whether they've met the milestone or just made excuses about why they couldn't.\n\"That's a way of getting an insight on what they're like and whether they'll make is as an entrepreneur, because it's a lot of hustle and a lot of idea, but it's mostly all execution,\" says McEvoy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:02:08.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
