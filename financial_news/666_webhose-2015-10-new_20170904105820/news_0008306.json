Federal Reserve have weighed on the index for much of the year. \nThe big banks, including National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (Other OTC: CBAUF - news ) and Westpac Banking Corp , skidded more than 1 percent, while Australia & New Zealand Bank eased 0.8 percent. \nMuch of the weakness came after the government accepted most key recommendations of an inquiry on the nation's financial system including one that called for the country's top four banks to increase their capital ratios. \nHealthcare stocks also slipped with Ramsay Health Care (Dusseldorf: RMY.DU - news ) leading losses with a 2 percent drop after a recent rally to a seven-week peak ran out of steam. \nNatural resources shares, however, eased the index pain with miner Fortescue Metals Group up 3.4 percent, nearing a recent four-month peak. \nMining giant BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) edged up 0.2 percent after it maintained full-year guidance of iron ore production. \nRio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) 's shares were up 0.6 percent. \nFor more individual stocks activity click on \nThe rally in New Zealand stocks showed no signs of losing steam with the S&P/NZX (Other OTC: NZSTF - news ) 50 index on track to close higher for a ninth straight session. \nThe benchmark was last 0.2 percent, or 9.84 points, higher at 5,905.33 , having touched a fresh two-month high during the session. The index has amassed gains of over 5 percent in two weeks. \nBuyers appeared to have returned with a vengeance after two disappointing quarters that saw the index shed a total of 4.1 percent - its worst performance since late 2011. \nWith expectations for at least another cut in official interest rates, analysts said there is still value to be found in the stock market. \nAmong the gainers on Wednesday, property developer Fletcher Building climbed 2.1 percent, telecommunications infrastructure company Chorus advanced 1.6 percent and medical device maker Fisher & Paykel Healthcare put on 1.3 percent.
