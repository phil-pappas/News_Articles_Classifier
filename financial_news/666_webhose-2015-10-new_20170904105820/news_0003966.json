EDF plans to take a final investment decision in coming weeks. \nLevy declined to comment on why Chinese nuclear group CNNC - which was part of the Hinkley Point consortium two years ago - had dropped out. \nLevy said in Italy there could be some consolidation around EDF, which is a distant second to Italian utility Enel (Swiss: ENEL.SW - news ) but much larger than the number three and four players.
