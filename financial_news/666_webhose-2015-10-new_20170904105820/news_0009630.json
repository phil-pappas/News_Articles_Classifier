These screenings, which can easily be worked into regular weekend errands, are confidential and available at all Sam’s Club locations with a pharmacy (612 locations) on Saturday, October 10 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. They are valued at $150 2 and include tests for: \nBlood pressure Total cholesterol HDL (high-density lipoprotein or good cholesterol) Glucose Body mass index (BMI) “Many women today are so busy taking care of their family, friends and careers that they unintentionally deprioritize their own health,” said Tara Raddohl, director of corporate communications at Sam’s Club. “With this in mind, we are proud to offer free health screenings as a simple, quick way for women to get a wide range of tests.” \nIn addition to monthly health screenings, Sam’s Club pharmacies provide savings and preventive care to each community they serve, such as year-round immunizations for children and adults.* Licensed pharmacists can administer walk-in flu shots and nine other important immunizations, including the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.
