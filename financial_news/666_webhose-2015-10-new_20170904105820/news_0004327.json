This is not a living wage,\" the report said. \n\"After their long shifts, workers take a 30-minute shuttle bus back to their dorms, where up to 14 people are crammed into a room. Mold grows pervasively along the walls. Bed bugs have spread throughout the dorm and many workers are covered in red bug bites.\" \nThe report said health and safety were major concerns because the facility uses a number of toxic substances, including mercury and arsenic, but that \"no one tells workers anything about the location of these or other substances in the production process or how a person should protect herself from injury.\" \nThe report cited a total of 23 violations, including lack of training and inadequate safety equipment. \n\"Unfortunately, the awful working and living conditions that Pegatron workers face in 2015 are generally no better than those witnessed in 2013,\" the report said. \nThe labor group cited \"limited improvement\" in some areas, saying the average working week dropped from 63 hours to 60 hours. \nBut it noted that half of the workers hired at Pegatron are temporary workers, even though Chinese law allows only 10 percent of a workforce to be temporary labor. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request to comment. \nThe California tech giant has previously faced criticism about conditions at Foxconn, another contract company based in Taiwan. \nAfter at least 13 employees apparently took their lives in 2010 -- not all at plants making Apple products -- Foxconn pledged to improve working conditions and raise salaries (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:10:51.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
