What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Larry had a go at a recent survey on Social Security. We're reprinting his answers and his comments on the questions. Read Larry's original column on the survey here . Question : Once I start collecting Social Security, my benefit payments will never change — true or false? Answer : This is a really bad question. Assuming you don’t keep working, Social Security benefits are CPI indexed, so they will change due to inflation, but not in real terms. So the answer can be true or false. Furthermore, if you collect early and earn enough to lose benefits due to the Earnings Test your benefit will be adjusted upward due to the Adjustment of the Reduction Factor. And if you earn enough after you start collecting to raise the average of your past covered earnings, called the Averaged Indexed Monthly Earnings, your own retirement benefit will be increased under a provision called the Automatic Earnings Reappraisal Operation. So again, the answer can be true or false. And if you are taking one benefit, like a widow(er) benefit, and switch to a different benefit, like a retirement benefit, again the answer can be true or false. Finally, if you took it early, you can suspend your retirement benefit at full retirement age, in which case your benefit will change, but not your full retirement benefit on which the early retirement reduction and delayed retirement credits are calculated.
