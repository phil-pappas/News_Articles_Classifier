U.S. wind projects triple in 2015 By: Bloomberg News October 22, 2015 4:22 pm 0 \nThe U.S. added about 3,600 megawatts of wind power capacity in the first nine months of 2015, almost triple the amount from a year earlier, as businesses and local governments moved to line up their own supplies of electricity. \nThirteen wind farms accounted for 3,596 megawatts installed through September, up from 1,254 megawatts a year earlier, according to a report Thursday from the American Wind Energy Association. The 1,602 megawatts added from July through September were almost four times the total in last year’s third quarter, the Washington-based trade group said. \nThe growth was driven in part by new players joining the utilities that have traditionally been wind developers’ biggest customers. Amazon.com Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Washington, D.C., all signed contracts in the third quarter to purchase wind power. Microsoft Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. announced investments in two wind projects, according to AWEA. Amazon’s 208-megawatt project in North Carolina would be the largest in the southeast. \nWind costs have fallen by more than half over the past five years, said Chris Brown, president of the U.S. unit of Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s biggest turbine supplier. \n“It’s the cheapest new source of renewable energy,” Brown, the trade group’s incoming chairman, said in an interview. “We can beat any new generation on costs in some states like Texas and we’re still driving down costs further.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:40:35.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
