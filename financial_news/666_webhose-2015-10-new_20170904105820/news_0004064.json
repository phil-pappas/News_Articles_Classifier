AP by Spencer Soper Amazon.com will stop selling media- streaming devices from Google and Apple that aren't easily compatible with its video service, the latest example of the company using its clout to promote products that fit with its own retailing strategy.\nThe Seattle-based Web retailer sent an e-mail to its marketplace sellers saying it will stop selling the Apple TV and Google's Chromecast since those devices don't \"interact well\" with its own Prime Video.\nThe move, coming just before the year-end holiday shopping season, shows how Amazon is willing to sacrifice sales of popular brand name products -- Apple and Google have the best- selling media streaming devices generally -- to bolster its own video-streaming service. Amazon has invested heavily in online content, including producing its own exclusive shows such as the award-winning transgender comedy \"Transparent\", as a way to attract new Prime subscribers, who pay $99 a year for speedy shipping and access to video and other services.\n\"This has the potential to hurt Amazon as much as it does Apple and Google,\" said Barbara Kraus, an analyst at Parks Associates. \"As a retailer, I want to give people a reason to come to me. When I take out best-selling brands, I take away those reasons.\"\nTom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. A Google representative also declined to comment.\nThe online retailer used a similar strategy last year in a protracted and dispute with New York-based Hachette Book Group regarding the sale of print and digital books. Amazon blocked pre-orders for some of Hachette's books while the two sides haggled over prices. A coalition of authors accused Amazon of engaging in anti-competitive practices during the conflict.\nNot anti-trust Amazon's decision to limit the sale of Google and Amazon streaming devices probably doesn't rise to the level of an antitrust violation, because consumers will still have options for buying Apple and Google products at other places, according to Allen Grunes, a lawyer at Konkurrenz Group in Washington.\n \"Amazon probably wants to teach Apple and Google a lesson about not making their devices more compatible,\" Grunes said. \"This is one way to do it and it's not likely anticompetitive,\"\nWomackSatariano\nssoper", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:06:39.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
