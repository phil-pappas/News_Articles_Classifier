Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been forced to defend his significant investments in the Cayman Islands in the face of a Labor campaign designed to portray the millionaire Prime Minister as being a tax minimiser and hypocrite.\nAccusing the opposition of playing the politics of envy and failing to understand how managed funds work, Mr Turnbull said he paid the full rate of tax in Australia on all the income he earned from the investments.\nUnder attack in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr Turnbull said after becoming a minister in the Howard government, both his investments and those of his wife Lucy, were put in the managed funds to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\"It means I and Lucy have no say in which company those managed funds are invested,\" he said.\nThe practice was entirely in accordance with the ministerial code of conduct and he was not avoiding paying tax.\n\"Thousands of managed funds with investors outside of the USA are registered in the Cayman Islands with the result that the income of the fund is taxed in the hands of the investors in their own home jurisdictions.\n'Taxed in Australia' \"So all of my income from my investments, including funds registered in the Cayman Islands, is taxed in Australia.\"\n Labor senator Sam Dastyari raised the issue under parliamentary privilege, saying while Mr Turnbull's actions were not illegal, they were inappropriate.\n\"There is one reason I know why people invest in the Cayman Islands, and that is so they do not have to play by the same rules as the rest of us,\" he said.\n\"Every time the Liberal Party votes against tax transparency, just remember that there is a house in the Cayman Islands, a house where Malcolm's money resides.\"\nHe was referring to Ugland House which houses 18,857 companies and has been described by US President Barack Obama as \"either this is the largest building in the world, or the largest tax scam in the world.\"\nIn the House of Representatives, Labor frontbenchers used question time to try and draw a link between Mr Turnbull's use of managed funds, and what the opposition says is the government's weak approach to clamping down on multi-national profit shifting and other forms of corporate tax avoidance.\nCoalition MPs believing the Prime Minster was being smeared for his wealth and falsely accused of wrongdoing, heckled with such words as \"grub\" and \"guttersnipe\" at the Labor MPs .\nS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:26:12.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
