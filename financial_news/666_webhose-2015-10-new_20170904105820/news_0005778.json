According to the latest research, Americans in full time employment are now working an average of 47 hours a week, and increasing numbers of us report taking no vacation days all year. \nThe third annual National Flex Day is mobilizing workers and employers across the U.S. to unite for more flexible work hours and less needless face time in the office. \"We're advocating for the widespread adoption of work flexibility -- because we believe that work flex not only improves employee well-being, but is also a business imperative, \" said Emma Plumb, director of 1 Million for Work Flexibility. \"Work flex contributes to higher productivity, disaster preparedness, and increased retention and employee engagement,\" she added. \n1 Million for Work Flexibility's aim is to educate employers about the benefits of remote working and adjustable hours, and its arguments favor the business case for those benefits: Workers who have more flexibility in their schedules are more productive and will stay in a job longer, the group asserts. Providing companies with an infrastructure to mange the administration of remote and flex-time workers is another challenge the organization is working to tackle.
