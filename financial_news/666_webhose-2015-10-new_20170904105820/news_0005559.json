It had initially targeted a $1.5 billion bond at 9.5 percent and a failure to achieve this has put pressure on the domestic debt market, economists said. \nGhana's currency has fallen more than 50 percent in two years, one example of the fiscal crisis the West African state is attempting to tackle with the help of an International Monetary Fund aid programme. \nGhana was one of Africa's strongest economies for years due to revenues from its exports of gold, cocoa and oil. But the government estimates growth at 3.5 percent this year because of lower global commodities crisis and fiscal problems. \n(Writing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:43:21.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
