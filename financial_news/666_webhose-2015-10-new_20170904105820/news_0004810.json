Such schemes have been replaced with stock-market linked pensions, which tend to offer poorer value. \nPaul Johnson, director of the organisation, also predicted that the Government would be forced to pare back increases to the state pension , which was becoming \"prohibitively expensive\". \n\"We have achieved an astonishing turnaround in the incomes of pensioners over the last three decades, without increasing public spending to levels seen in many other continental European countries,\" Mr Johnson told a conference last night. \n\"But the longer term future looks very uncertain. Those now in their 20s, 30s and 40s may well end up with lower incomes in retirement than their parents.\" \nThe comparisons between working age and pensioner incomes were made after tax, housing costs and benefits such as the state pension. \nMr Johnson urged the Government to abandon its flagship \"triple lock\" that guarantees the state pension rises in value every 12 months . \nIntroduced in 2010, the policy increases the weekly payout, currently £115.95, by the higher of inflation on the consumer prices index, average earnings growth or 2.5 per cent. \nBritain's top pension funds ranked by their place in a study of the world’s 300 largest pension schemes : \nIn January, David Cameron pledged that the Conservatives would keep the measure as it brought \"dignity\" to those in old age. \n\"People who have worked hard, who have done the right thing, who have provided for their families, they should then know they will get a decent state pension and they don't have to worry about it lagging behind prices or earnings and I think that's the right choice for the country,\" he said. \nBut Mr Johnson said the cost of the policy, compared with only uprating pensions in line with the earnings of the wider workforce, would within five decades reach \"well over £20 billion a year\" in today’s terms - equal to 1.3 per cent of GDP. \n\"The triple lock policy needs to end,\" Mr Johnson said. \"At some point it will prove to be prohibitively expensive.\" \nHe said the qualifying age, scheduled to reach 66 for both men and women by 2020, would have to rise significantly, forcing younger people to work longer for the same money as their parents. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was vital, he added, that the Government resisted the urge to conduct a tax raid on pensions as part of a major consultation that began in July. The Treasury has indicated that it could treat money paid into a pension more like an Isa, offering tax free withdrawal. \nThe guaranteed incomes (annuities) savers can buy with private sector pensions are becoming less valuable: \nMr Johnson said savers should continue to be rewarded with tax incentives when they put money into a pension . \n\"There is an urgent need to bring stability and rationality to the taxation of private pensions,\" he said. \"Changes have been made far too frequently, making long-term planning impossible.\" \n\"Its starting point ought to be that providing people with tax relief for pension saving when contributions are made, and charging tax (including National Insurance) on withdrawal, is the efficient, neutral basis for personal taxation.\" \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:25:55.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
