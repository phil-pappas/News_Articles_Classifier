By Roland Head | Fool.co.uk – 3 hours ago Print \nIn 2020, the state pension age for British men and women will rise to 66. Between 2026 and 2028, it's going to increase to 67. \nWe're living longer, so we have to work longer. I understand that. But what if it was possible to retire before reaching state pension age? \nRetiring in 2020 \nI admit that not everyone is going to be in a position to retire in five years' time. But you may be surprised at how close you can get with a few simple changes to your financial lifestyle. \nThe first step is to work out how much you will need to live on. Do you need a pension income for the rest of your life, or a fund to support you for a fixed period until you can claim an occupational or state pension? \nIn either case, you may find you need less to live on than you expect once you've retired, especially if you can pay off your mortgage before you retire. \nFor example, a £750 monthly mortgage payment requires around £11,500 of pre-tax earnings, for a standard rate taxpayer. \nAnother saving is that you won't need to save as much! Saving is vital when you're working, but once you retire, you'll save much less. Indeed, as long as you have a rainy day fund, you may not need to save anything from your retirement income. \nWhatever your situation, there are three things I believe you need to focus on. \n1. Debt is the killer \nI've already discussed the benefits of paying off your mortgage before retiring. The same advantages apply to all forms of debt. \nIf you're aiming to retire early and want to minimise your pension requirements, you need to clear as much debt as possible before you retire. Interest costs on debt will eat into your pension income and make it much harder to live comfortably. \n2. What to do today \nThe simplest way to bring forwards your retirement date is to spend less and save more today! \nMoney works harder for you when it's saved early. \nFor example, if you invested £10,000 today at an interest rate of 5% and reinvested the interest every year for ten years, you'd end up with £16,288. This powerful effect is known as compounding. \n3. You'll need the stock market \nAccording to Barclays, shares have delivered an average annual return after inflation of 5.5% over the last 50 years. \nIn contrast, the average inflation-adjusted return on UK government bonds (known as gilts) over the same period has been just 2.5%. \nFor cash savings, it's even lower. \nAlthough shares can be more volatile than bonds, they do tend to deliver better returns over the long term. \nSo how much will you need? \nThe FTSE 100 currently offers a dividend yield of 3.8%. If you invested your retirement savings in a cheap FTSE 100 tracker fund and aimed to live off the dividends, then my calculations suggest you'd need about £650,000 to generate an annual income of £24,000. \nOf course, this is only a rough estimate. Although dividends tend to rise with inflation, they sometimes fall, too. \nI'd always suggest taking professional advice before making such an important decision. \nHowever, if you'd like to know more about some current stock market opportunities that could speed up your retirement, why not take a look at \" 5 Shares To Retire On \" . \nThis exclusive Motley Fool report contains details of five shares that have been handpicked by the Fool's top experts for retirement investors. \nThey believe that these five companies could form the core of a market-beating retirement portfolio. \nThere's no obligation -- this valuable report is completely FREE .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:08:18.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
