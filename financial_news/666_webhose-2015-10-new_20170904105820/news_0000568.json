In September, clients were given a preview of the new platform in New York. Kevin Henry, Chief Human Resources Officer for Extended Stay America, was impressed with what he saw. \"HR leaders need better tools for driving engagement and validating the business impact in order to plan and scale their investments,\" says Henry. \"Our new name succinctly sums up what we do. We help companies engage employees to drive business results,\" says Phil Stewart, Engage2Excel's president and CEO. Stewart joined the company in March after eight years at IBM/Kenexa, where he served as the chief people officer and president of Kenexa's Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) business unit. \"At IBM/Kenexa, I learned the importance and power of analytics in making HR decisions based on measurable business outcomes.\"\nCompanies spend $46 billion annually on employee recognition programs according to industry analyst Bersin by Deloitte. \"The unfortunate reality,\" Stewart reports, \"is that HR leaders today lack the ROI metrics that IT, manufacturing, marketing, and finance use for managing program investments.\"\nEngage2Excel's ROI-based employee recognition platform gives HR leaders the business metrics they need to plan, analyze, and scale their engagement and recognition programs. Building on the company's long history of providing employee recognition programs for more than 2,500 companies, Engage2Excel has added new services to their portfolio.
