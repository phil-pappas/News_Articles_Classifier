I don’t know how it can continue to rise. The way the real estate market is structured in the UK - there are very few landlords. Sometimes the same one owns a whole street. The rent structure here is unlike anywhere else in the world.” \nCoumont, who is casually dressed and wearing a plastic watch, has years of experience comparing the different business environments in various countries. \nHis restaurant business, Le Pain Quotidien, has more than 250 outlets across 19 countries, with a presence in cities including New York, Mexico City and Paris. \nThe upmarket cafe and bakery, known for its communal tables and sourdough bread, was founded by former chef Coumont 25 years ago, born from frustration at the lack of good bread available in his native Brussels. \nCoumont started baking 2kg sourdough loaves in his garage at home, before opening a small bakery in the Belgian capital with one employee and just a couple of sandwiches and salads on offer. \nOver time the menu expanded, as has the number of stores, and Le Pain Quotidien has become a well-known global restaurant chain. \nThe company, which is privately owned by Coumont and a handful of other individuals, has just opened its first store in Dublin, and is about to sign another lease in the Irish capital. \nIn London, there are now 25 sites, after Le Pain Quotidien opened its first store in Marylebone high street a decade ago. \nThe firm’s newest opening, in affluent Fulham, is expanding beyond the typical breakfast and lunch menus to offer new dinner options alongside evening entertainment such as jazz gigs. \n“When we first came to London, less than 10pc of our sales went on rent. Now (Frankfurt: 11N.F - news ) it’s typically around 17pc. The problem is, you sign a lease for five years, then there is a rent review and landlords will point to other commercial tenants in the street paying more than you, and put the rents up,” says Coumont. \nIn Le Pain’s St Pancras store, the rent bill is always a fifth of annual sales although Coumont says that with annual sales of around £5m, it is the most profitable post in London. \n“Hopefully there is a turn in the rental market. That’s what makes London so expensive for consumers. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) reflects in the price of your coffee, your food and maybe even squeezes labour costs. It’s a vicious circle.” \nThe Government’s new living wage, due to come in next April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , as well as other tax bills such as VAT, are also burdening the restaurant industry, says the Belgian entrepreneur, who now lives in the south of France near Montpellier but travels frequently each month to visit global stores. \nLike pub bosses who have spoken out about the “unfairness” of VAT , Coumont says restaurant owners are not given the same tax breaks enjoyed by supermarkets. \nPubs and restaurants are charged 20pc VAT on food sales, whereas supermarkets pay no VAT on the food they sell. \n“VAT on food in restaurants should be the same as when you buy a salad in the supermarket. The restaurant industry creates so many jobs in Britain it’s not like restaurants are ever going to outsource labour to China.” \nHe adds that organic farmers should be exempt from paying any payroll taxes at all, which would boost the amount of produce grown in Britain and entice more young people to work in the countryside. \nSeparately, the National Farmers’ Union has warned that the UK will import more than half of the food eaten here in the next 25 years. \nDespite Coumont’s frustrations about the cost of doing business, Le Pain’s UK arm is doing well, with sales increasing 10pc last year on turnover of £34m, according to the latest accounts filed to Companies House. \nGross profit margin rose two percentage points to 19.3pc in the year to December, although operating profit almost halved to £537,000 due to costs associated with store expansions. \nThe company, which employs 1,000 staff in the UK, currently has no plans to expand to cities beyond London. The firm favours large cities, where the costs of setting up a central kitchen to deliver fresh bread daily to stores are more justifiable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:57:39.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
