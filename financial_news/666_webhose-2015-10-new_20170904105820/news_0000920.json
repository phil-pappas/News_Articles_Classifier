If we don't act soon it will be beyond repair \nA study last year by the US based think tank, The Commonwealth Fund, f ound Britain’s NHS to be the best healthcare system in the world , outperforming by some margin other advanced economies that spend far more on health. \nOther international studies have not been nearly so flattering, but whether a credible assessment or not, my own recent experience of UK health provision does not chime with this starry eyed view of our “precious” value-for-money NHS. \nEarly last summer, I was stretchered into a London Accident and Emergency unit after being catapulted off my bike and landing at speed on the unforgiving concrete . A few hours later, following a cursory physical examination and a number of X-rays, I was discharged. \nNothing was broken, I was told, and the considerable back pain I was suffering was most likely the result of muscle spasm that would pass within two to three weeks. Somewhat stupidly, I believed them. \nTwo months later, I had lost a stone and a half in weight and was still struggling to stand upright for any length of time. A privately procured MRI revealed a major compression fracture of one of my vertebrae; I had quite literally broken my back. On taking this up with the A&E unit where I was originally seen, they admitted that they had not X-rayed the damaged part of my spine, even though I had been led to believe at the time that they had. \nMistakes are made in all healthcare systems. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) would be wrong and unfair to draw sweeping conclusions from this particular episode. My misdiagnosis was possibly on some level negligent, but I wouldn’t wish to add to the NHS’s burgeoning bill for compensation by suing. I was simply unlucky. Admission to a different hospital would no doubt have resulted in a more accurate appraisal, more appropriate action and therefore a swifter and more complete recovery. \nYet I’m not sure I would be quite so forgiving had this been a private enterprise whose services I was directly paying for. It is part of the downside of public ownership that it makes us grudgingly more tolerant of poor practice and therefore less likely to complain. In any case, my experience can reasonably be seen as evidence of a health service that is struggling with the growing demands put on it and is cutting corners to cope. \nAs if to confirm the point, England’s independent health regulator, the Care Quality Commission, last week found three out of four hospital trusts to be failing their patients . The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was quick to judgment, as though he was somehow an outside observer on a state of affairs for which he is, in fact, directly responsible: it was totally unacceptable, he fumed. Indeed it is, yet it is also a predicament that on the present trajectory is destined only to get worse. \nUniversal health care is one of the great achievements and hallmarks of modern civilisation. It is not just a noble purpose, but an essential prerequisite to sustainable economic growth and success. Democracies endanger it at their peril. \nYet as a pioneer of universal provision, Britain has become locked into a taxpayer funded model which is no longer fit for purpose . \nOn the one hand, the perception that healthcare is in some way “free” creates an insatiable source of demand, made more acute still by growing public awareness of the latest, high tech therapies. But on the other, supply is capped by the competing demands for funding of other public services. The NHS must fight its corner alongside defence, education and policing. As can be seen from this chart above, Britain spends less as a proportion of GDP on healthcare than most other advanced economies. \nIt is often said by way of excuse that the NHS represents exceptional value for money. No other country gets as many bangs for its bucks. Whether true or not — the claim is strongly challenged by some studies — the same might be said of a beat-up old banger. But that’s never going to stop people wanting a brand new car. \nThe challenge for Britain is both to persuade the nation to spend more of its income on healthcare and to better align supply and demand by making patients conscious of its cost. Both aims may be impossible within a taxpayer funded model. On multiple fronts, healthcare in Britain is falling short of the social insurance models practiced in Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands, all of which achieve better outcomes on a number of different measures, particularly cancer survival rates. As a kind of hypothecated tax, social insurance also allows for better recognition of the costs of healthcare and therefore public acquiescence in paying more for it. \nSome day quite soon everyone is going to wake up and find that the NHS is no longer the “envy of the world”. By then it will be too late, and we will be well on the way to a two tier healthcare system. Those who can pay will, leaving the rest with sub-standard, subsistence care. Nostalgic attachment to an out of date method of funding is driving equal, high quality healthcare for all into a brick wall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:40:19.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
