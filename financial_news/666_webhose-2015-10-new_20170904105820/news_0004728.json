Really? TPP: Will the Trans-Pacific Partnership really benefit Australia? TPP: What the trade pact means for Australia Washington: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has announced she opposes the expansive 12-nation Pacific Rim free trade accord finalised by the Obama administration this week, breaking sharply with the president over a deal she had championed while serving as secretary of state.\nMs Clinton said in an interview with PBS that she would not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) based on what she knows of the deal so far. The 30-chapter text of the agreement, which negotiators concluded Monday, has not been made public.\nUS Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds up a doll that was handed to her from the audience on Wednesday.

If he doesn't, she said then, \"there should be no deal.\"\n\"In order to get a deal that meets these high standards, the president should listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who had expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers, to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible,\" Ms Clinton said. \"And if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton brushes off a lady bug on Wednesday. Photo: AP\nShe also drew a particularly sharp contrast with Mr Obama.\n\"No president would be a tougher negotiator on behalf of American workers, either with our trading partners or Republicans on Capitol Hill, than I would be,\" Ms Clinton said.\nThe controversial pact was already expected to face a rocky reception in Washington. Just hours after Mr Obama hailed the TPP, the largest US trade pact in a generation, as an accord that \"reflects America's values,\" the administration had already turned from the negotiating table to selling the agreement on Capitol Hill.\nMr Obama pledged that TPP, the largest free-trade agreement in a generation, would open new markets for US goods and services and establish rules of international commerce that give \"our workers the fair shot at success they deserve.\"\nBut virtually as soon as the deal was announced, there were signs of the tough fight ahead to win final ratification from Congress next year. Lawmakers from both parties criticised the pact as falling short in crucial areas, raising the prospect that the White House could lose the support of allies who had backed the president's trade push earlier this year.\nOn the presidential campaign trail, Senator Bernie Sanders, Ms Clinton's rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, had quickly slammed the pact, saying that \"Wall Street and other big corporations have won again.\" Republican front-runner Donald Trump called TPP \"a terrible deal,\" tweeting that the Obama administration's \"incompetence...is beyond comprehension\".\n\"I'll leave the presidential politics to someone else,\" USTrade Representative Michael Froman said during a Monday news conference in Atlanta. \"Our job is to reach agreement and explain it fully to the American public. Given where we are in the calendar, this really is a 2016 issue for Congress to consider.\"\nWashington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:56:11.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
