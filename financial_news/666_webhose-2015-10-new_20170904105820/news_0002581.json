Last week the earnings releases were largely dominated by the Finance behemoths. Industry challenges and a strained global environment were among the headwinds that the banks needed to overcome. In fact, achieving high revenue growth was a challenge on a strong US dollar and macroeconomic concerns. \nThe Finance sector has already seen how some primes, namely J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America, fared in the quarter. Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and The PNC Financial Services Group have also released their results. Earnings will continue to dominate headlines over some of the next trading days. The Bank of New York Mellon, Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financial are slated to announce results today; while Capital One will report on Oct 22. \nIndication from the finance sector is relatively more positive than certain other sectors. As the banking sector sees such active releases, it will be a prudent move to focus on Finance mutual funds as well. \nFinance Sector Earnings \nIncluding the morning reports as of Oct 19, 63 S&P 500 members had reported results. These account for 18.6% of the index’s total market capitalization. Total earnings for these companies are up 1% from the same period last year on 0.9% lower revenues. While 61.9% beat EPS estimates the revenue beat ratio was 28.6%. \nThe earnings numbers are weaker than the same group of companies’ results in recent seasons. However, it was the banking behemoth Bank of America that aided the growth numbers. Easy comparisons helped the positive earnings growth, but excluding the Finance sector earnings growth dipped to negative 7.4%. \nTill last week, 5.9% of companies from the Finance sector that count for 24.9% of the total market cap had reported results. Earnings growth compared favorably with broader trends at 31.9% with 80% beating EPS estimates. Revenues were however down 1.9% and revenue beat ratio was 40%. \nRead: 5 Funds to Buy as Q3 Earnings Season Heats Up \nRecap of the Major Banks’ Results \nRevenues continue to be weak as the equity market rout and the low rate environment prevail. Demand for loans remained subdued, while provision for loan losses continued to rise mainly due to lower reserve releases and increased provision for energy sector loans. \nHowever, absence of significant legal expenses, coupled with cost-control initiatives (reorganization and streamlining), helped most banks to surpass their respective EPS estimates. But, the estimates were themselves conservative after a number of downward revisions. \nBelow we present a synopsis of earnings results from some of the behemoths: \nJPMorgan Chase & Co missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate though estimates were revised lower in recent days. It reported adjusted earnings of $1.32 per share, delivering a negative surprise of 4.4%. Weak trading activities primarily led to a decline in the overall profit. \nCitigroup beat earnings estimates by 1.6%, primarily on the back of lower legal and repositioning costs. As expected, pressure on revenues owing to a fall in fixed income market revenues was the major undermining factor. \nBank of America comfortably beat the earnings estimate. Weakness in fixed income trading and lower equity investment income were the undermining factors. Lower operating expenses and negligible legal costs raised BofA’s earnings to 37 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 34 cents. \nWells Fargo was able to overcome industry challenges, with its results being driven by revenue growth (up 3.3% year over year). The company’s earnings of $1.05 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Results benefited from organic growth aided by strong loans and deposit balances. \nBank Mutual Funds in Focus \nGoing forward, the Finance sector is expected to see earnings growth of 9.6% on 3.7% lower revenues. These compare favorably with the second quarter actual numbers. In the second quarter, earnings for the Finance sector had improved 7.2% on revenue decline of 14.2%. The Finance sector is placed third, after Autos and Transportation sectors, in terms of best earnings growth forecast. \nOn that note, let’s look at Finance mutual funds that significant exposure to banks.
