The London-listed company said the three holes drilled at the Bay State Silver Project delivered mineralisation of up to 1,460 grams per tonne of silver, with mineralisation reported in all three. \nSunrise (Taiwan OTC: 2720.TWO - news ) added it will now launch a follow-up drilling programme as it aims to allow a quick progression to phase two drilling. \n\"I am pleased to be reporting success in hitting high grades of silver mineralisation in all three drill holes in our first test of the main Chihuahua Vein System,\" said group executive chairman Patrick Cheetham. \n\"So far we have drilled at a wide spacing on only the northern section of the vein, and to a relatively shallow depth. \n\"We need to drill many more holes to get a true picture of the silver mineralisation but this is an excellent start.\" Sunrise Resources was down 15.96% to 0.21p at 1607 BST on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:41:22.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
