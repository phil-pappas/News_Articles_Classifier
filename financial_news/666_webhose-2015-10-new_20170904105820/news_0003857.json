Once again, Harper and the Conservatives have had the most Twitter chatter:\nConservatives - 1.6 million Liberals - 960,000 NDP - 914,000 According to IPG Mediabrands, however, the Conservatives are 60% more likely than the Liberals and 51% more likely than the NDP to get negative tweets. The #StopHarper hashtag, for instance, was used over 30,000 times in Conservative related tweets. There was no equivalent hashtag for Trudeau or Mulcair in the Top-100 used hashtags. \nTop-10 Surprising Twitter Hashtags of the Campaign \n#stopharper - 34,860 #duffy - 29,450 #heavesteve - 11,419 #niqab - 8,715 #peegate - 8,114 #barbaricculturalpractices - 5,409 #votetogether - 4,808 #harperman - 3,906 #oldstockcanadians - 3,606 #bluejays - 3,305 \"Peaks in Twitter conversations occurred during the debates, but volumes have dropped over time,\" explained Cordery. \"Perhaps this is one impact of the long campaign period as Canadians appear to have become less engaged. TV attack ads have also been prolific, which may also be turning people off.\"\nTuning In or Tuning Out? \nSince the election call on August 4 th to September 27 th , Canadian television viewers were targeted with over 9,800 TV political party spots from the Conservatives, Liberals and NDP:\nConservatives - 6,032 TV spots (61%) Liberals - 2,534 TV spots (26%) NDP - 1,249 TV Spots (13%) 66% of all TV spots were attack ads (that's over 6.5k ads) 65% of these attack ads were from the Conservatives targeting Trudeau 15% of attack ads came from the Liberals denouncing Harper 11% of attack ads came from the NDP denouncing Harper 77% of all attack ads were from the Conservatives \" When we look at the timings of the attack ads, you can see that the Conservatives went heavily anti-Trudeau from the beginning,\" said Cordery. \"The Harper attack ads coming from the NDP and Liberals have been predominantly aired throughout September.\"\nThe research and analysis conducted by IPG Mediabrands was based on Numeris (4 th Aug - 27 th Sept), Radtracker (4 th Aug - 20 th Sept), Sysomos (4 th Aug - 11 th Oct) & Macleans.com (6 th Aug, 17 th Sept & 28 th Sept).\nAbout IPG Mediabrands \nIPG Mediabrands was founded by Interpublic Group ( IPG ) in 2007 to manage all of its global media-related assets.
