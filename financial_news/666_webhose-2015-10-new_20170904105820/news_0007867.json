Sullivan also discovers that the “thin green line”, to which the title of the book refers, cuts through every income level from “the teacher with her pension on the right side of the line” to “the high-earning but overleveraged financier on the wrong side”. \nThe book, published earlier this year, is divided into five parts: how we think about money; how we save, spend and give it away; and the science of testing how we think and talk about money under stress.\nSullivan submits his own financial choices to scrutiny and his honesty in discussing his own habits is perhaps one reason why the book is compelling. His writing has a light touch and the book succeeds in being both informative and engaging. \nThe writer has done his research and backs up his observations with facts. \nHe interviews a fantastic selection of people including world-class economists, behavioural psychologists, philanthropists, tech founders and the offspring of the rich and famous – including Randy Fertel, the son of the founder of Ruth’s Chris Steak House who says he’s pretty sure that money ruined his family.\n\nq&a behaviour of the one per cent \n\nLianne Gutcher expands on what Paul Sullivan’s The Thin Green Line offers its readers:\n\nIt seems you liked the book. Any drawbacks? \nI did like the book – to the extent that it’s prompted me to think more carefully about my own financial decision-making. A downside is perhaps that the book is very “American” – there are interviews with obscure (to me) American sports stars and references to elite American prep schools. But this did not put me off. \n\nIf the book is very American, is it relevant to readers in the UAE? \nVery much so. Many people are drawn to working in the UAE with the good intentions of bettering their own financial situation and saving for their future. Despite those good intentions, however, people at every income level may find themselves living beyond their means and “acting rich” by spending extravagantly on fancy cars, clothes and dinners. This book is a reminder why it’s important to be a little more frugal, to save and invest, and to spend in moderation.\n\nWhat did you learn? \nWhen it comes to investing, most of the One Per Cent have a financial adviser as well as an accountant and lawyer. As Sullivan writes: “Just because they successfully managed businesses that sold cars or vinyl siding or computer software didn’t mean they understood how to manage the money made from those decisions.” Also interesting is that members of the One Per Cent are not necessarily any better than the rest of us about making investment decisions. They are often, however, more able to admit the mistakes they make and cut their losses.\nbusiness@thenational.ae \n\nFollow The National’s Business section on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:38:51.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
