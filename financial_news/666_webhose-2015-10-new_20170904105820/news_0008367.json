Sanghee Liu Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro The Chinese government may account for up to one fifth of investment in the Australian bond market, and a third of all foreign buying, according to analysis of data released overnight by the International Monetary Fund.\nAnd as China liquidates its almost $US4 trillion ($5.7 trillion) stockpile of reserves, the Australian dollar might come under more pressure than previously expected.\nThe IMF's quarterly update on foreign exchange reserves included a breakdown of China's \"representative portfolio\", which Royal Bank of Canada's analysts used to surmise that about 3.5 per cent of its $US3.7 billion of foreign exchange reserves were held in Australian dollars. That number is larger than holdings of other central banks, which reported allocations below 2 per cent, the previous estimate for China's allocation.\nExtrapolating those numbers, China may own $US130 billion of Australian dollar assets, a number RBC analyst Michael Turner said was \"well within the bounds of believability, and underscores the importance of China's investment in Australian dollar fixed income\".\nThe Australian dollar's rise and fall has tracked the accumulatin and decumulation of China's foreign currency reserves. Turner conceded that the calculation was \"back of the envelope\" given the uncertainty over how much the partial portfolio represents China's total holdings but said that, even allowing for a large error margin, the data highlight the importance of China to the Australian dollar fixed income market.\"\nChinese reserve managers such as SAFE have long been large and active participants in the Australian bond market, purchasing government bonds, state government bonds and Kangaroo bonds issued by highly rated foreign entities. But the numbers imply China is a bigger investor than originally thought.\nMajor headache As China's foreign currency reserves swelled to over $US4 trillion, they would have accumulated Australian dollar assets putting upward pressure on the currency. Other nations too gravitated towards Australian dollar bonds that offered both high yields and high ratings to diversify their foreign currency assets away from US dollars and euros. This official buying posed a major headache to the Reserve Bank, which hoped for a weaker currency to boost economic activity as the terms of trade declined.\n But now reserve managers and China in particular are selling, not buying, placing downward pressure on the currency. Last month, China revealed the largest single-month decline of foreign exchange reserves on record, at about $US93.9 billion, reducing its balance to $US3.6 trillion.\n\"We don't know what the Chinese are selling because we don't know the composition of their reserve holdings. But it probably involves some US treasuries and other sovereign bonds,\" Reserve Bank assistant governor Guy Debelle said in a speech last month.\n\"Nor do we know what assets the private capital outflow from China is buying. But they are both huge orders of magnitude and are most certainly having a first order influence on financial markets.\"\nDr Debelle explained that the selldown represents a switch in ownership of foreign assets from the Chinese government to its citizens. As China buys back foreign bonds, more Chinese are sending money offshore to buy assets such as property.\nRBCs Turner said that as China's reserves have begun to shrink, \"a key source of demand for $A paper is likely to have been curtailed, and it seems unlikely the private sector flows on the other side of these reserve transactions will seek to find a similar home in Australian dollar fixed income.\"\nTo put this into context, there are around $730 billion of highly rated outstanding Australian dollar bonds, implying China may own just under 20 per cent, and with $400 billion of bonds held offshore, China could represent one third of total foreign holdings, RBC said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-01T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:20.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
