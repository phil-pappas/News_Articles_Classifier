The Summit is believed to bring together major global energy stakeholders to discuss important and current issues revolving around the sector. The free flowing discussions and dialogues on the event pave the way for the formulation and updating of relevant policies and strategies at various levels through the exchange of ideas, experiences and lessons learnt from across the energy world. From this specific juncture, Ethiopia will have ample opportunity to showcase its outstanding achievements in the development of the energy sector in general and to renew its commitment for the achievement renewable energy resources in particular. In addition, the effort being put to rapidly increase access to modern energy to the public and all achievement is gained by massive mobilization of domestic and outside resources of human, finance and technology. The Summit would aim at bringing together political leaders, investors international organization and nongovernmental organization and facilitate for the utilization of various untapped world energy resources such as Hydro,Geothermal, Wind and solar power. Undeniably, energy is key for development as it helps foster the expansion of education, health and other social services. Hence, maximizing the effort to tap this invaluable resource is vital for garnering more energy supply thereby reducing poverty at a higher level. The energy sector can help stimulate other sectors to emerge and attract foreign investment so that the country can boost the whole economy. Ethiopia is keen to invite investors to the investment formulating workable polices. Thus Ethiopia is highly honoured to have been accepted to host this event. We believe that our public and private organization, academic institutions and civil society will gain a lot from the idea exchanged, experiences shared, and new and long lasting partnerships cemented during the course of this week-long event. In the country, it has been realized that renewable energy has to play a much deeper role in achieving energy security in the years ahead and be an integral part of the energy planning process. And there has been a visible impact of renewable energy in the Ethiopian energy scenario over the years. Apart from contributing a lot to the national electricity installed capacity, renewable energy based decentralized and distributed applications have benefited millions of people in various parts of the country by meeting their cooking, lighting and other energy needs in an environment friendly manner. The social and economic benefits include reduction in drudgery among rural women and girls engaged in the collection of fuel wood from long distances and cooking in smoky kitchens, minimization of the risks of contracting lung and eye ailments, employment generation at village level, and ultimately, the improvement in the standard of living and creation of opportunity for economic activities up to the lower structure of the country... kebele. Renewable energy sector landscape in Ethiopia has, for many years, witnessed tremendous changes in the policy framework with accelerated and ambitious plans to increase its contribution. Ethiopia is the continent's third populous country with a fast-growing economy that has led it to be the largest energy consumer and producer. The government is pursuing incremental policy and economic reforms to create more balanced economic growth and to shift away from an economy driven primarily by excessive investments and exports to an economy characterized by greater domestic consumption. In the energy sector, the government is moving toward more market-based pricing schemes, energy efficiency and pollution-controlling measures, and competition among energy firms, as well as making greater investments in more technically challenging upstream hydrocarbon areas and renewable energy projects. The upcoming summit would also contribute a lot to this end. Obviously, renewable energy has a great capacity to usher in universal energy access. In a decentralized or standalone mode, renewable energy is an appropriate, scalable and viable solution for providing power to unelectrified or power deficient villages and localities. Ethiopia has developed extensive data bases for renewable energy resource in the country. That is why the country's renewable energy sector has received wide recognition internationally in the recent years and given chance to host this grand platform. Besides, many countries have evinced interest in cooperation with Ethiopia for promotion of new and renewable energy. It has considerable expertise and experience in promoting renewable energy, both grid interactive and off-grid/stand-along applications for meeting electrical energy needs. The country has been interacting with several developed and developing countries for cooperation in new and renewable energy sector. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks have been established with a number of countries. In sum, the Summit sends a strong signal to the market, encouraging private investment in new pipelines, electricity networks, and low-carbon technology.
