That compared to a loss in the same period last year caused by a writedown on the sale of its stake in wireless business Iusacell.\nAdvertising revenue in the third-quarter fell 9 percent, dragging down results in its largest business, content.\nThose declining revenues have been a key concern for investors, helping to drive Televisa shares about 25 percent lower since its last quarterly report in July.\nOverall revenue rose 12.2 percent to 22.256 billion pesos, driven by new cable businesses it bought in the past year, Cablecom and Telecable.\nLast year, as part of a sweeping reform in telecoms and broadcasting, Televisa was declared dominant in the free-to-air TV market, forcing it to allow pay TV rivals to show its free content, among other measures.\nThe company's pay TV business just avoided being hit with further measures, as the regulator in Mexico decided it did not have market power in the sector, despite its market share of more than 60 percent.\n($1 = 16.933 pesos at end September) (Reporting by Christine Murray ; Editing by Christian Plumb )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:27:42.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
