So it is with tax credits, a form of “welfare” which actually pre-dates Gordon Brown by some years, but was cynically - and presumably deliberately - allowed to spiral out of control under his Chancellorship in pursuit of client state goals. \nBy the time Labour left office in 2010, an astonishing nine out of 10 families in Britain were entitled to have their incomes topped up through a tax credit system which farcically had even begun to reward some MPs. Qualifying incomes would be routinely raised just ahead of elections so as to drag as many as possible into reliance on the Chancellor’s hand-outs. \nThough on some level no doubt well intentioned enough, it was also little more than redistributional vote buying. Certainly, it would have made William Beveridge turn in his grave, for by the end it was so far adrift from the founding principles of the welfare state as to barely qualify for the term \"welfare\" at all. \nFrom an expected original cost of £1.5bn a year, the tax credit bill had grown to £28.9bn annually by the time Labour left office, and would by next financial year have been an eye-popping £40bn had nothing been done address it. \nThe case for reform is therefore both overwhelming and urgent. Unfortunately, that doesn’t make it any less politically toxic, and if it is true that the reforms will make 8.4m working age households an average of £750 a year worse off, as estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , then it plainly has the potential to do the Government considerable damage. Mr Brown has thoughtfully left his successors a ticking time-bomb to defuse. \nUndeterred by the possibility that it will unseat his leadership chances, the Chancellor, George Osborne , has dutifully taken up the challenge. Yet it is not entirely clear that the salami-slicing approach he has adopted - in the hope that people don’t notice too much - is the right one. By hitting the poorest groups hardest, the Government's reforms have also been executed in a particularly insensitive manner. More fundamental, bottom-up reform would have served Britain’s long-term interests better. \nAs I have observed before, the idea of income support has a long pedigree in Britain, which predates the foundation of the modern welfare state by centuries. Its origins can be dated back as far as the Elizabethan Poor Law in 1601. This was later developed into a quite sophisticated form of taxpayer-funded top-up in the late 18th century known as the “Speenhamland System”, under which low rural wages were supplemented to address the problem of high food prices. Interestingly, Speenhamland suffered in its time from many of the same criticisms as the tax credit system today. \nA Poor Law Commissioners’ Report in 1834 condemned Speenhamland as “a universal system of pauperism”, observing that it had become used as a way for rich farmers and industrialists to pay below subsistence wages, knowing that they would be supplemented by the local parish. \nExactly the same problem is manifest in the present system, with the minimum wage perversely established as the going rate in some industries in the certain knowledge that few are actually expected to live on these earnings. Tax credits have in this way encouraged a low wage economy. The Low Pay Commission also points out that tax credits provide an incentive to work part time, as lone parents begin to lose benefits after working more than 16 hours a week, and single adults after thirty hours. \nNonetheless, some degree of income support may indeed be necessary to stop low-earning families falling into poverty. Despite the political mythology around it, the evidence for increased polarisation in incomes between low and high earners is actually not that strong, at least in Britain, where if anything income differentials have narrowed slightly since the onset of the financial crisis. Ironically, however, this may have something to do with the redistributional effects of tax credits. \nIn any case, it would be silly to ignore the possibility of what Keynes called “technological unemployment”, the notion that advances in technology can destroy certain forms of traditional employment or render them unskilled and low paid. We may be seeing quite a bit of that today. In the post-war period, middle income employment has been extensively supported by explosive growth in white collar work. Much of this is now being made redundant by computers. This may over time accentuate the differences between high-skilled, high-paid, and low-skilled, low-paid work. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence threaten to greatly accelerate the process, progressively making some forms of work essentially worthless. \nA number of alternatives to tax credits have been suggested for addressing these trends. One is the idea of negative income tax, originally championed by the British politician Juliet Rhys-Williams in the 1940s and later developed by the American free market economist Milton Friedman. Under such a system, the worker would pay tax above a certain level of income, but receive tax on a sliding scale below it. At a stroke, such a system would remove the need for other, overlapping entitlements and for minimum wages, making both government and the economy run more efficiently. \nA related idea is that of the “Basic Income Guarantee”, under which everyone would be paid a subsistence wage regardless of whether they had other forms of income, rather in the nature of the UK state pension. There are plainly problems of implementation and potential cost with both notions, and it is of course political fantasy to think there is any chance of them being adopted in early twenty first century Britain. All the same, you wouldn’t start from here given a clean slate. \nThe tax credit system is both out of control and is proving politically very difficult to reform. The Chancellor insists he’s not for turning, but there is every possibility, given the slimness of his majority, that he’ll at least have to agree the time honoured climb down of “transitional arrangements” in his Autumn statement if he is not to lose any eventual vote. \nHosting President Xi Jinping in London and Manchester this week, Mr Osborne will have been made doubly aware of democracy’s limitations; it’s obvious what needs to be done, much harder to actually do it unless of course, like President Xi, you don’t have to bother with the niceity of elections (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:37:43.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
