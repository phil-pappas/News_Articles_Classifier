The major indices in the Indian stock markets were moving sideways for much of the day’s trading on Tuesday, and finally closed with marginal losses. The trends in the indices through the day are given in the table below: Caution over quarterly results coupled with profit bookings subdued Indian equity markets on Tuesday and led to a marginal fall in the major indices in the stockmarkets. Initially, both the Sensex and the Nifty opened flat in line with their Asian peers. Further denting sentiments included Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan's comments made on Monday cautioning the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop some countries from initiating policies that might negatively impact global economy. The lacklustre Asian markets also negatively impacted the Indian indices. In Asian markets, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.42%, while Hong Kong's Hang Sang slipped by 0.37%. However, China's Shanghai Composite index increased by 1.11%. Negative European markets on the back of diminishing chances of extension of the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus eroded investors' confidence. Yallen, who is expected to speak later in the day, is expected to give cues on whether or not the US Fed will raise interest rates its October meeting. The US Fed will hold its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet on October 27-28. The FOMC assumes significance as higher interest rates in the US are expected to lead away FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) from emerging markets such as India. The Indian rupee too lost strength in the day's trade. It was down 25 paisa at 65.06 to a US dollar from its previous close of 64.81 to a greenback. The domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net sellers in the day's trade, whereas the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers. According to data with stock exchanges, the DIIs sold stocks worth Rs.354.96 crore and the FIIs picked up stocks worth Rs.523.69 crore on Tuesday. Sector-wise, S&P BSE metal index fell by 136.05 points, oil and gas index was down by 67.31 points and healthcare index declined 60.49 points. The S&P BSE information technology (IT) index rose by 110.98 points, automobile index rose by 55.31 points and consumer durables index gained by 54.40 points. The top gainers and the top losers of the indices are given in the table below: The closing values of the major Asian indices are given in the table below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:44:50.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
