But the bad guys are part of the solution,\" Total's CEO Patrick Pouyanne told a gas and electricity summit in Paris on Thursday. \n\"Whatever people think, we still need fossil fuels. We need to make advocacy for gas. We need to explain to our policy makers that gas has to be encouraged,\" Pouyanne said. \n\"Policy makers are not convinced in many countries that gas is part of the solution for climate change, we in the industry need to speak up.\" \nThe meeting comes shortly before diplomats gather in Bonn from Monday for the last formal session ahead of the Paris climate talks, where negotiators from almost 200 nations will meet to try to forge a global climate change agreement, designed to curb rising greenhouse gas emissions. \nThe International Energy Agency forecasts oil will remain the largest energy source by 2040, although its share will decline while renewable sources of energy will grow. \nAll major emitting countries have now submitted plans to the United Nations detailing how much they plan to curb their emissions. \nMany members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), including leader Saudi Arabia, have yet to submit their plans. \nFor oil executives, pledges by key oil consuming countries including China and India to cut fossil fuel consumption have crystallised their need to act. \nThe World Bank estimates around 300 million tones of carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from gas flaring each year, equivalent to around 77 million cars. \nTotal, Statoil, Shell, Eni and BG are already signed up to a U.N. initiative to stop routine gas flaring by 2030. \nCritics say however that without clear goals to cut their emissions, oil companies' efforts would have little impact. \n\"To determine whether or not this is just greenwash ... you need to look for whether or not the initiative announces concrete, quantitative and measurable targets designed to make the oil and gas industry part of the solution,\" said Anthony Hobley, chief executive of environmental think tank the Carbon Tracker Initiative. \n(Additional reporting by Susanna Twidale in London, Ana Martinez in Mexico; editing by Adrian Croft and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:33:48.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
