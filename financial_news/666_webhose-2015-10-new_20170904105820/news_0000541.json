In 2014, Sanofi reported \"business\" earnings per share, which stripes amortisation, impairment and other costs, of 5.2 euros.\nShares in Sanofi are up around 21 percent so far this year compared with a 14 percent rise in the Stoxx 600 Europe Health Care sector index.\nACQUISITIONS, ASSET SALES\nMorgan Stanley analysts also say the group has the capacity to raise total debt of up to $40 billion for possible acquisitions, four years after buying Genzyme - a Massachusetts-based company which focuses on rare diseases like multiple sclerosis - for $20.1 billion.\n\"Should Sanofi use this firepower to buy a company close to current multiples, we calculate that a theoretical earnings per share accretion of around 20 percent ... in around five years\", they said.\n\"We expect ... Brandicourt to elaborate on how and which types of deals could be done, and envisage a continuation of company's current strategy of mid-size acquisitions rather than one larger acquisition,\" they added.\nBut so far, Brandicourt has kept investors guessing about his exact intentions.\nDuring Sanofi's general meeting in May he said the company needed to remain competitive in the areas where it \"can and must win\" and pledged Sanofi would maintain a broad product portfolio whereas other European competitors such as Switzerland's Roche or Denmark's Novo Nordisk have chosen to specialise.\nBrandicourt also said he would meet with Sanofi's main shareholders - led by French cosmetic giant L'Oreal with a 9 percent stake.\nL'Oreal has said on numerous occasions it considers its holding in Sanofi to be solely \"financial\".\nAnd analysts say while the company wants to remain diversified management could yet decide to sell some non-core businesses such as generics or animal health to help fund expansion in other areas such as oncology, where Sanofi has teamed up with U.S Regeneron.\nWhen working at both Pfizer and at Bayer Brandicourt managed a number of divestments which analysts have described in the past as successful, including Pfizer's sale of animal health unit Zoetis as well as Bayer's blood glucose monitoring business.
