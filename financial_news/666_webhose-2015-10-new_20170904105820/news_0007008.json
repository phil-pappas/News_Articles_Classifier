The next catalyst will have to come from earnings, particularly from financial and technology stocks, he said.\nStephanie Link, portfolio manager at TIAA-CREF, said oil prices don't have to rally in order for stocks to go higher. However, if oil prices and the U.S. dollar can stabilize, it will likely benefit equities going forward. There's a lot of economic data this week, too, which should help paint a clearer picture on the U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve might do when it comes to interest rates. \n\nDan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, made the case that the U.S. dollar is more important than oil prices. The dollar not only impacts other currencies and international economies, but commodity prices and profit margins for U.S. corporations, too. Management will need to assure investors that, in the very least, the current operating environment isn't getting any worse, he added. \nPete Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com and trademonster.com , pointed out how the CBOE Volatility Index ( VIX.X ) has continued to move lower, now below its 200-day moving average. This has allowed stocks to rebound over the past few weeks, albeit on light volume. JPMorgan ( JPM - Get Report ) reports earnings after the close, and could be an important driver of stocks going forward. \nAnton Schutz, who runs the Burnham Financial Long/Short Fund BURFX, a five-star fund rated by Morningstar, says he's not looking for JPMorgan to report a very \"glamorous\" report. In fact, he's not looking for any of the big banks to report very good results. \n\nBut even with poor earnings results, these stocks can go higher simply because there is so much negativity already priced into the sector, Schutz explained. Investors are too bearish at this point. His top big bank picks include Morgan Stanley ( MS - Get Report ) and Bank of America ( BAC - Get Report ) . \n\nThe conversation turned to auto sales. Year-to-date U.S. auto sales are up 5%, and are up 4.2% for General Motors ( GM ) . The auto group has largely underperformed this year, but the stocks have seen a nice rally over the past month, with shares of GM up 13% since late September.\n\nFollowing September's incredibly strong auto sales results -- which pushed the seasonally-adjusted annual rate above 18 million vehicles in the U.S. -- Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors, said the recovery in auto sales has been slow and steady. As a result, it's less likely there will be a fierce downturn in sales in the near future. \nNevertheless, Barra acknowledged that selling cars and trucks is a cyclical business. Because of this, the company is focused on producing high quality vehicles for its customers, improving margins and being a profitable automaker. Add-on services like OnStar, 4G LTE and increased connectivity are also big focuses for General Motors. \nAs for China, Barra said there is still significant growth over the next 10 to 15 years, but the company has to be focused on offering the right products and staying flexible to the current market environment. The troubled South America market has been tough, but GM must remain ready for a turnaround, because when it happens, it happens quick, Barra concluded. \nThere's been no love for auto stocks or the suppliers, as most have done very poorly this year, Terranova said. Link agreed, but said she likes the auto parts supplier companies.\n \nThis article is commentary by an independent contributor.
