Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin The David Paradice-backed listed skydiving company Skydive the Beach will raise $19.6 million in capital to buy New Zealand's largest tandem skydiving company, Nzone, as it expands overseas and pushes to gain a foothold into other adventure and leisure activities.\nChief executive of Skydive the Beach Anthony Boucaut, who founded the business in the NSW coastal city of Wollongong in 1999, said it made sense to expand into New Zealand, which touts itself as the adventure capital of the world, as the lower dollar helped drive international tourism. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows the number of short-term arrivals from China, Hong Kong and India rose by 16 per cent in August and New Zealand had a record 3 million visitors in the last financial year.\n\"The most logical step for us is New Zealand because it is close. We have a lot of business synergies and you have Queenstown, which is widely regarded as the adventure tourism capital of the world,\" Mr Boucaut told The Australian Financial Review . \"November through March is their peak period and with the lower dollar both in Australia and New Zealand that is working extremely well for the company as a whole. We are seeing strong growth in our international market and I dare say that will be replicated in New Zealand.\"\nThe adventure tourism company debuted on the sharemarket in March 2015 after a $25 million initial public offering , which it used to buy out its main Australian competitor Australia Skydive. However, it suffered a setback on the day of the float with the death of two seasoned skydivers when their parachutes became entangled near Byron Bay.\nFund manager David Paradice owns more than 5 per cent of Skydive the Beach. Nic Walker But skydiving continues to hold a special appeal for Australian business high-flyers, with financial system inquiry chairman David Murray a director on the ASX's other listed skydiving company, Indoor Skydive Australia.\nEquity raising Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding to be announced on Monday, Skydive the Beach will acquire 100 per cent of the privately owned Skydive Queenstown, trading as Nzone, for $NZ17 millon ($15.5 million). To fund the proposed acquisition, Skydive the Beach is launching a fully underwritten $19.6 million equity raising.\nNzone controls more than 30 per cent of the New Zealand tandem skydiving market.\n \"We are going to do an accelerated non-renounceable rights entitlement offer, two for nine offer at 30¢ to raise $19.6 million,\" chief financial officer Anthony Ritter said.\nSkydive the Beach, which is backed by vaunted fund manager David Paradice and the IOOF-backed Perennial Investment Partners, is forecast to reach more than 112,000 skydives this financial year (the lion's share of the estimated 160,000 skydives each year in Australia). At an average cost of about $430 each, that's expected to bring in more than $47 million in revenue. The New Zealand acquisition should add an additional 23,000 skydives or boost the company's business by 20 per cent.\nMr Boucaut said the key to the company's rapid growth had been making the thrill-seeking experience more accessible to the 18-to-35-year-olds who dominate the growing market.\nRevolutionised skydiving access \"Traditionally, with skydiving you have to travel out to the bush somewhere. We have revolutionised how consumers access the skydiving market, to bring it to people's front door. So we have a site in St Kilda right in the heart of Melbourne, another one in Wollongong city, in most of the popular tourist areas in Australia, Byron Bay, Mission Beach, Cairns, so it has become highly accessible,\" he said.\nThe death of the two skydivers in March, on the day of the float, who had parachuted with the business Skydive the Beach acquired, was a terrible accident but the sport remained safe, he said.\n\"Any activity there is an inherent degree of risk. We do everything we can to manage that risk but if you look at it statistically, skydiving is a safe activity.\"\nThe business was looking to expand into other adventure and leisure markets, he said.\n\"Basically what we are looking to is any activity which you would fit in the adventure tourism and leisure sector. It could be anything from bungee jumping to white-water rafting to high-speed cars.\"\nShares in Skydive the Beach surged after the Friday float in March, from their issue price of 25¢ to close the day at 39¢. However, after news of the skydivers' deaths the price fell on the Monday, to 33.5¢.\nThe share price closed on Friday at 31.5¢.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:13:06.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
