However, some reports indicated it had no currently intention to mount a takeover.\nKKR told the Australian Securities Exchange it had become a substantial shareholder and said it would lodge further notices. These are expected to give greater clarity to the exact size of its stake but at 10 per cent it will have overtaken institutional investors NAB, Blackrock, JCP Investment Partners, Dimensional and Vinva which hold between 5 per cent and 8 per cent each.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Brett McKay said the move by KKR was “a shot in the arm” for the resources sector where shares have been burdened by low commodity prices.\n“Prominent Hill looks to be over the worst of its problems — the waste stripping that’s been going on for a number of years,” he said.\n“There is a decent free cashflow stream that’s apparent over the next few years.\n“The company has a good balance sheet, a lot of cash, no debt — so I’d guess a combination of those things is what’s attracted private equity to it.”\nOZ’s share price has been hit by the fall in copper in US dollar terms, especially since May this year. However, copper has picked up in the past few days and in Australian dollar terms has been steady most of the past two years because of the effect of the exchange rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:11:51.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
