Business intelligence is no longer seen as too difficult or nice to have. Enterprise management information is the difference between success and failure.” \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:41:34.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
