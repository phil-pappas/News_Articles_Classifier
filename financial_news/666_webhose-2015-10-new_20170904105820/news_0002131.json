He never called it final, and sources familiar with the matter saw that as leaving open the possibility of an improved offer. \nSABMiller on Friday announced an accelerated cost-savings drive, which analysts saw as a defensive move to drive up the offer price. Two of its largest institutional shareholders also came out in support of the board's rejection of AB InBev's bid, saying it was too low. \nAt 43 pounds per share, SABMiller would be worth 69.6 billion pounds ($106.51 billion). \nBoth companies declined to comment. \n($1 = 0.6535 pounds) (Reporting by Martinne Geller in London, editing by William Hardy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:04:29.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
