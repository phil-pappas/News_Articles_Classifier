The bulk of the money is expected to be raised from increased water sales proposed to rake in $139,6 million and property tax for domestic, industrial and commercial at $118,1 million, while refuse collection will chip in with $26,8 million. Finance and revenue collection is expected to contribute $4,3 million, the Zimbabwe National Roads Administration and billboards $4 million, administration and city architect $7,6 million, clamping and towing $5,6 million, health fees $7,4 million, rentals, leases and markets $15,1 million. Estates are expected to contribute $8,6 million, public safety $4,6 million, while other sources will contribute under $1 million. Salaries and allowances will pick up 29,8 percent ($114, 3 million), while service delivery expenditure will account for the remaining 70,1 percent.

The budget approved by the full council saw the city setting aside $2,7 million to replace the refuse collection fleet, $20 million for the purchase of road maintenance equipment and $24 million for water distribution network, including smart meters.
