Three others \nexpect a slope reduction and re-centering, while one analyst \nexpects a zero slope and band widening. \n\"If they just lower the slope to neutral, the rally in \nUSD/SGD will be capped at around 1.4075 which is where I \nestimate the lower bound is,\" ANZ's Goh said. \n\"A re-centering will see a much larger rally possibly \ntowards 1.4150 in the first instance.\" \nSingapore economy was expected to have shrunk 0.1 percent in \nthe third quarter from the previous three months on an \nannualised and seasonally adjusted basis after a 4.0 percent \ncontraction, a separate Reuters poll showed. \nThat would meet the definition of a technical recession, the \nfirst for Singapore since the depths of the financial crisis in \n2008-early 2009 when the economy contracted for four consecutive \nquarters. \nMost emerging Asian currencies slid as a sharp fall in oil \nprices triggered profit-taking, especially in commodity \ncurrencies. \nThe rupiah slumped more than 1 percent as Jakarta shares \nlost over 3 percent. The currency lost ground in \nnon-deliverable forwards markets. \nExpectations for rising dollar demand from Indonesian \ncompanies also hurt sentiment on the rupiah. \nThe ringgit fell as lower oil prices bolstered concerns over \nMalaysia's overseas earnings from oil and gas sales. The country \nis a major exporter of palm oil and natural liquefied gas. \nOil prices tumbled overnight Monday as traders took profits \nafter last week's surge to an 11-week high, and on a report that \nOPEC continued to boost crude production despite a persistent \nglut.
