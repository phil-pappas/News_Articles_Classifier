The countries in the region only act when they're in crisis,\" said economist Pedro Tuesta, a Latin America specialist at Washington-based consultancy 4CAST. \n- Worst in six years - \nLatin America's growth will come in at 0.5 percent this year, its lowest in six years, led by contractions of 1.5 percent in Brazil and 5.5 percent in Venezuela, predicts the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, a United Nations panel. \n\"Smaller economies in the region like Peru, Colombia and Chile are more resilient, but not immune, because they are slowing and are also dependent on commodities,\" said Alberto Ramos, Latin America research chief at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) . \nChile, the world's top copper producer, is particularly exposed to the slowdown in China, the destination for 25 percent of its copper output. \nWith the region in slowdown and the United States poised to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006, Latin American currencies have taken a beating in recent months, making imports more expensive and fueling inflation. \nThe worst case is Venezuela, which has not published its official inflation statistics in months, but where experts say the annual figure is likely more than 100 percent, which would be the highest in the world. \nVenezuela, which holds the world's largest proven oil reserves, has been devastated by crude prices that have plunged from around $120 a barrel in June last year to less than $50 now. \nOther Latin American oil producers like Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador are also being pummeled. \nThe region \"needs to launch a transition toward a new growth model that depends less on commodities and more on other sectors of the economy, such as productivity and investment,\" said Alejandro Werner, director of the IMF's Western Hemisphere department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:31:59.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
