GST regime once introduced will also be a landmark step in this direction.\n“Thus for commodities like gold where the initial purchase by the exporter is after the payment of custom duty, the subsequent transactions which are mostly in cash, can easily be found out,” Jaitley said.\nIn 2015-16 Budget, the Finance Minister had proposed making quoting of Permanent Account Number (PAN) mandatory for all sale and purchase of over Rs 1 lakh.\n“Quoting of PAN is being made mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of Rs 1 lakh. The third party reporting entities would be required to furnish information about foreign currency sales and cross border transactions,” Jaitley had said.\nThereafter, the government had received representations from various persons, including MPs, MLAs, trade and industry associations among others, against the proposed mandatory quoting of PAN for sale or purchase in excess of Rs 1 lakh.\nStressing that bulk of black money is still within India, Jaitley said there was a need to change the national attitude so that plastic currency becomes the norm and cash an exception and the government is working with various authorities to incentivise this change.\n 04, 2015 3:16 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:35:10.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
