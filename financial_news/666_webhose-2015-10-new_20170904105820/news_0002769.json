Nomura too, is said to exit its joint venture with LIC. Foreign players are again calling it quits \nReliance Capital Asset Management (RCAM) will take over Goldman Sachs' mutual fund business in India for Rs243 crore. RCAM will acquire all 12 mutual fund schemes of Goldman Sachs Asset Management India. Goldman Sachs, which does not have a strong retail focus, had surprisingly decided to enter the Indian mutual fund industry in 2011, by acquiring Benchmark Mutual Fund for Rs120 crore. The fund has a total asset under management (AUM) of Rs7,132 crore. Frustrated by poor market prospects after 2009, a number of global players like Fidelity, Daiwa, Morgan Stanley, ING, PineBridge and Deutsche have already exited the Indian mutual fund business over the past few years. According to newspaper reports, Nomura too plans to sell its 35% stake in LIC Nomura Mutual Fund. Nomura had entered India just four years ago. In 2012, Fidelity’s business was taken over by L&T Finance, while last year Morgan Stanley was bought by HDFC Mutual Fund. Other smaller foreign players too, called it quits in the recent past, finding it increasingly difficult to stay afloat in the highly concentrated Indian mutual fund industry. While there are more than 40 fund houses in the country with total AUM of over Rs133 lakh crore, the bulk of the assets are skewed towards the big players. Naturally, the profits too are skewed towards the top AMCs. The large asset management companies making super profits and the smaller players struggle to survive. The 21 profit makers in industry made Rs1,567 crore while the 20 loss makers lost Rs303 crore. The profits of the top seven fund houses grew in the range of 12% to 82% in FY13-14 year-on-year. The top three fund houses account for 42% of the total equity AUM of the 40 mutual fund houses. The top 10 fund houses account for nearly 83% of the total assets. The top 10 fund houses have equity assets of over Rs10,000 crore. In comparison, Goldman Sachs has an equity AUM of just Rs107 crore. This continuous string of exits reflects that sorry state of India’s mutual fund industry. Over the past year the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) came out with a slew of reforms in order to drive more retail participation. However, only the large fund houses seemed to have benefited. While mutual fund inflows over the past year may have increased only the big players with a strong distributorship seemed to have gained the maximum inflows. The top fund houses have the strong distribution network of large banks or financial institutions, giving them reach and are able to drive more inflows. The data clearly shows that that for banks, a high concentration of in-house mutual fund sales is to their asset management companies (AMCs). Based on the distributor commissions of FY2014-15, more than 1/3rd of the commission pay-outs to banks are sourced from its in-house AMC. HDFC MF and ICICI MF, contributed to 35% and 68% of their bank’s mutual fund commissions. HDFC Bank and Axis Bank drew the highest MF commissions. Canara Bank, State Bank of India and Union Bank of India earn over 90% of their commissions from their in-house AMCs. Large fund houses could afford to pay high upfront commissions and advance trail commissions to distributors. It is only now that commissions caps have been put in place. As the large fund houses grow bigger and bigger, we may see many more exits in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:46:24.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
