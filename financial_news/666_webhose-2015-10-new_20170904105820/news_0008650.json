Nicole Allen, the Student Public Interest Group's affordable text book advocate, says $200 is the going rate for texts in entry-level science courses . \nTextbook costs are both down-in-the-weeds and top-of-mind --they can be a substantial barrier to attaining a college education. According to The College Board, the average student budget for college books and supplies during the 2014-2015 academic year was $1,225. \nThe Affordable College Textbook Act, introduced in the Senate last Thursday, would fund the support of open college textbooks--they'd live on the rough equivalent of an Open Source platform--that would be available under an open license, allowing professors, students, researchers and others in academia to have unlimited, free access to these materials. The Act comes with companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:12:29.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
