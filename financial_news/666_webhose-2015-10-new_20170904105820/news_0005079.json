The official rate Monday was 1,283 to the dollar. \nThe central bank said affected businesses would have until November 30 to hand back their licences. \nThose include hotels, restaurants, airlines and duty-free shops, meaning tourists may soon have to carry wads of local notes. \nMyanmar, which in 2011 shrugged off the isolation and economic hardships of military rule, has won praise for reforms in recent years, including giving autonomy to the central bank and adopting a floating rate for the kyat. \nThe first handful of foreign banks permitted to operate in Myanmar in decades opened in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) . \nMyanmar also hopes to open a long-awaited stock exchange by the end of this year. \nSean Turnell, an expert on Myanmar's economy, criticised the central bank's decision for what he called \"policy on a whim\". \nHe said many tourism-related businesses would still have costs in dollars and would \"presumably try to achieve this by an ever-fluctuating kyat price\". \n\"According to my reading, every tourist will now have to exchange foreign currency for kyat cash and hand over the resulting brick,\" he told AFP. \nOne foreign restaurateur, who currently charges in dollars and asked not to be named, said he was planning to switch to kyat payments when his business moves to another premises where rent would be paid in the local currency. \nBut in a city where most commercial rents are charged in dollars, businesses could struggle to find the cash to pay their landlords, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:52:38.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
