However, rumors about the next generation version of the device, the Samsung Galaxy S7 have already started to come in. The latest rumor comes via the Chinese social networking website, Weibo which is like Twitter for China. A new leak reveals that the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S7 could come with Apple’s 3D touch like feature. This will most likely be possible because of the new ClearForce pressure sensitive touch solution from Synaptics that was announced last week. Sponsored Links \nAfter the launch of the Pressure sensitive touch solution from a renowned company like Synaptics, it’s quite likely that this tech will end up on upcoming Android smartphones. The leak from Weibo says that Samsung has partnered up with Synaptics for using their ClearForce technology. There’s even a picture which reveals a few details about the hardware which may be used by the solution, but unfortunately, the details are given out in Chinese. \nAs for the ClearForce Touch Solution, it will offer pretty much the same features as any other pressure sensitive touch tech. For example, the company says that the interface allows the phone to differentiate between things like photo editing, speed scrolling, zooming, gaming, texting etc. Different functions use different levels of touch sensitivity which can be analyzed by this technology. For example, while editing a picture, the user can vary the force used to touch the screen using his finger or stylus to perform different functions. As for the release, at the time of announcement, Synaptics had said that the first smartphone with this solution can be expected by early 2016. \nWhile pressure sensitive touch technology is still in its nascent stages, there are a couple of smartphones in the market that already feature similar solutions. For example, the Huawei Mate S was the first smartphone to feature pressure sensitive tech aka Force Touch. This was followed by Apple’s own 3D Touch solution. There are a number of other smartphone manufacturers interested in this technology. For example, ZTE Axon Mini is confirmed to feature pressure sensitive tech. \nWith the release of the Synaptics ClearForce Touch Solution, it will only be a matter of time, most devices start coming with this feature. Although it’s possible that the Samsung Galaxy S7 comes with pressure sensitive screen, it’s still early to make conclusions. So fans better watch out for more information before getting too excited.
