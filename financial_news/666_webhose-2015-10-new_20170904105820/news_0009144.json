Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The announcement on Thursday of Brian Loughnane's much anticipated departure as federal director of the Liberal Party after a marathon 12 years in the job had the feeling of yet another door closing on a particularly tumultuous period in Australian politics.\nIt's not that Loughnane was single-handedly responsible for that tumult of course. He was the ultimate political operative delivering campaigning success to his parliamentary leaders and party. But think about the period in which he has led the Liberal machine: the 2004, 2007, 2010 and 2013 elections; half his time in the job coincided with the leadership of Tony Abbott. It's all been pretty colourful one way and another.\nAs the new Turnbull administration settles in, and Abbott seems to exhaust his first round of interviews agreeing with the Labor Party that the Turnbull government is exactly the same as his, it is worth contemplating how the 2016 federal election is currently shaping up as potentially a very different one to all those we have seen since 2001.\nThis stark contrast is not due to the change of Coalition leadership alone. Yes, the current mood of politics suggests a decline in three word slogans and negative campaigning. But effective bipartisanship on asylum seeker policy flowing out of Labor's July national conference, and a refusal by Labor to really engage in any sort of debate on national security had already moved the play significantly; a trend only made clearer when a new Coalition leadership stopped uttering the \"stop the boats\" mantra like some demented parrot.\nBrian Loughnane, outgoing Federal Director of the Liberal Party. AFR 24-10-2013 Alex Ellinghausen Equally, the debate about the economy and the budget has also gradually morphed as a slowing economy, rising unemployment and budgetary dilemmas have ensnared both sides of politics. Past Coalition attacks on Labor for not meeting budget surplus forecasts have become more complicated. And of course the tax cut largesse and budget surplus politics of earlier campaigns seem like a very distant memory.\nAs things stand, the Coalition goes into the election with a vastly more popular leader than Labor, but as a government it is weighed down with policies that were political disasters in the 2014 budget still to be resolved (but with little money to do it) and the sullen distrust of an electorate that had been told in 2013 that nothing was more important than not breaking promises.\nPlenty of issues for Labor to tackle government with\nSome of the issues that are emerging would, on the face of it, also give Labor more of a leg-up than the polls might suggest. That is, issues of tax, penalty rates, climate change, infrastructure, education, innovation, and at some point, health are traditionally comfortable turf for the opposition.\n If you think about the election in terms of what the two major parties have going for them - or that they have to navigate through - in these policy areas, rather than the popularity of the leaders, both sides have both positives and negatives going for them.\nOn tax, the Coalition's move to put everything back on the table gives it the opportunity to develop a significant \"tax mix switch\" package that addresses the need for income tax cuts to address bracket creep as well as dealing with problems in the rest of the tax structure, and political issues about equity. Labor's flat rejection of a lift in the goods and services tax gives it much less room to manoeuvre - in terms of revenue raising options to fund tax cuts - even if it does have the advantage of a more simple tax message.\nLabor is confident that penalty rates are another simple message that helps it, and Bill Shorten, define their base. But if the Coalition can quarantine the industrial relations debate to the question of penalty rates and link changes to tax reform, it could effectively be able to borrow some of Labor's own social wage strategy from the 1980s and 1990s.\nClimate change is another area where both sides have advantages and disadvantages against the backdrop of a rapidly changing international debate but also shifting voter views. Labor's commitment to an emissions trading scheme has political risks (though not as many as it might have if Tony Abbott was still in the job and had any credibility with voters).\nThe opposition's much clearer stance in support of renewable energy directly reflects its popularity with voters. Turnbull's elevation helps kill the Coalition's problem with climate change scepticism. But even with eye-watering shifts in rhetoric by Environment Minister Greg Hunt over the past fortnight, it is not clear that the Coalition will be able to shift actual policy far enough to give itself space for a simple message on this issue.\nEnvironment Minister hits ground running\nHunt has had a busy week this week. He's finally appointed board members to the Climate Change Authority (which suggests it might survive after Abbott's attempts to kill it). There have been announcements about maps of the electricity grid designed to pinpoint spots where the efficiency of renewable energy investments can be maximised, and a review aimed at further reducing ozone and hydroflurocarbon emissions. There have been reassuring noises about the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency being brought back in to the Environment Department's fold. But the conflicting signals are illustrated by the fact legislation to abolish both agencies is still in the Senate, and on the agenda for debate.\nThe capacity for the Coalition to shift climate policy significantly may have to await an already scheduled 2017 review.\nTalking about renewable energy this week, Bill Shorten observed that if \"both sides of Australian politics are now willing to say they support renewable energy, then the test is no longer a matter of competing rhetoric\".\n\"Instead it becomes a policy contest, a battle of ideas\", he said. \"A referendum as to which party has the best plans for a low pollution economy.\"\n\"I'm hopeful our Parliament, our politics, can move past the basic, binary argument of whether renewable energy is 'good' or 'bad'.\"\nAnd in talking about infrastructure on Thursday, Shorten said \"Let's give the Australian people credit for understanding that not every revenue measure is a 'great big new tax' and not every spending decision is a wasteful 'black hole'.\n\"Let's bring on a bigger and better debate about the future of infrastructure, the role of government and the need for investment in the productive capacity of our economy.\"\nOf course, Bill Shorten has not been afraid to set up the odd \"binary\", good/bad argument himself.\nBut circumstances suggest the next 12 months offer the best opportunity in years for self-interest to align with the need to look both reasonable and as if you are engaged in a battle of ideas rather than rhetoric.\nLaura Tingle is The Australian Financial Review's political editor", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:50.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
