It has been widely reported that the star, Idris Elba , almost fell off a cliff but Mr. Fukunaga calls that “dramatic writing.”\nThe film, which was made for $6.3 million, was sold to Netflix NFLX 1.70 % for $12 million. “Beasts” is the first original feature for Netflix, which will begin streaming it on Oct. 16. The film will be released that day in theaters across the U.S. by the distribution company Bleecker Street.\nWatch the trailer for ‘Beasts of No Nation’ The vivid production problems and the Netflix deal have almost overshadowed the film. “Beasts” follows a boy named Agu (played by 15-year-old Abraham Attah, who isn’t a professional actor) whose village is overrun by rebel fighters. Mr. Elba plays the charismatic but ruthless leader of an opposing ragtag militia that takes the boy in and teaches him to kill in cold blood. At the start, Agu is an innocent child. Before long he is smoking cigarettes and carrying a gun.\nFor more than a decade, Mr. Fukunaga, 38, had a project about Africa in mind. Early in the previous decade, he visited Sierra Leone and talked to former combatants, he says, but couldn’t pull a story together. He went on to make “Sin Nombre,” (2009) about Mexican gangs and Honduran immigrants, another film that explores the theme of children initiated into violence. Moving in the opposite direction, he next made a classical, widely acclaimed version of “Jane Eyre” (2011) with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. He also directed the first season of HBO’s “True Detective ”—that is, the well-regarded cinematic, ambitious season with Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, not the recent second season that was universally panned.\nWhile working on “Sin Nombre,” Mr. Fukunaga was given Uzodinma Iweala’s 2006 novel “Beasts of No Nation,” and found the way into his African story. “There was such a contrast to what I’d been trying to do, which was much more geopolitical and ensemble-based,” he says. “The book was really just one kid’s voice, one kid’s very emotionally impactful experience.” He now sees the political situation as context rather than the point. “It’s not a political film, it’s a human film about one child’s loss of innocence.”\nENLARGE With Idris Elba’s role in ‘Beasts of No Nation,’ director Cary Fukunaga, right, created a character who has to appear villainous to the audience while seeming to be a protector to the child, at least for a time. Photo: Netflix Mr. Fukunaga and his team found Abraham while casting locals in Ghana for the film. The director says Abraham and his family are unhappy that he has been described in some news reports as a street urchin. His parents are shopkeepers and he was in school when he was cast. But many other players, children and adults, came from rougher backgrounds. One adult cast member, Mr. Fukunaga says, “was a child soldier under [Liberian dictator] Charles Taylor. He killed his first man when he was 10 years old. He’s a religious man now.”\nIn the novel, Mr. Elba’s character had a much smaller role. Enhancing it for the actor, Mr. Fukunaga created a character who has to appear villainous to the audience while seeming a protector to Agu, at least for a time.\nThe film has a few explosive battles but Mr. Fukunaga says he had to drop some big set pieces for budgetary reasons. His characteristic look is evident, though: the camera moving into the midst of a violent situation as well as editing that uses close-ups to dramatic effect. Asked if he would have shot the film differently had he known it was going to Netflix, he says no. He points to the cinematic quality of his television work. “Before we shot ‘True Detective,’ I asked HBO, ‘Do you want me to shoot this for television, because I don’t want to be fighting with you on the shots I want.’ They said, ‘Shoot it as you see it.’”\nHe did, however, insist that Netflix include theatrical distribution in the deal. “I only wish it was going to be in more territories,” he says. The film also will be released in theaters in the U.K.\nIn his work, he has experienced the difference that comes from watching with an audience. “When I saw ‘Sin Nombre’ at Sundance in a 1,500-seat theater, it was the first time I realized the film was violent. I was so far removed at that point that I wasn’t feeling it any more. I was embarrassed, like, ‘Oh my God, I made this terribly violent movie.’”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL039_BEAST_M_20151008113829.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL039_BEAST_P_20151008113829.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:29:36.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
