( http://on.ft.com/1VtU6kC )\nReuters reported last month that the EPA and California officials would test other vehicles for possible \"defeat devices\" after announcing that Volkswagen uses software that turns off emissions controls in cars when driving normally and turns them on during emissions tests.\nThe scandal has prompted the EPA to toughen and broaden emissions tests for all automakers in an effort to thwart any other cheating activities, a move that could add to industry costs and higher regulatory hurdles.\nThe EPA will initially test one used vehicle of each model and then widen the probe if it uncovers anything suspicious, the newspaper said, citing a senior agency official close to the investigation.\nThe agency is hiring cars from rental agencies or borrowing them from owners it identifies via vehicle registration databases, the newspaper said.\nThe EPA is targeting most of the diesel vehicles on U.S. roads, including BMW's X3, Chrysler's Grand Cherokee, GM's Chevrolet Colorado, the Range Rover TDV6 and the Mercedes-Benz E250 BlueTec, the FT said.\nReuters could not immediately reach the EPA for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.\n(Reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru; Editing by Anupama Dwivedi)\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Volkswagen Mercedes-Benz Chrysler BMW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:57:07.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
