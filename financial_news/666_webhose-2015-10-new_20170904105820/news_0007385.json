Konekt is doing very well nationally and we saw the opportunity to bring our business to SA.”\nThe consolidation will make Konekt the largest state rehabilitation provider he said with the match-up a perfect fit.\n“The symbiosis of the three businesses allows for a complementary business that does not overlap.”\nAIS and Insite have a strong standing with ReturnToWorkSA while Konekt has a reputation in the self-insured and government markets in SA Mr Banks said.\nThere will be no immediate change of name said Mr Banks.\n“It’s business as usual for staff and customers. The businesses will operate in their own names initially so we will have four brands in SA.”\nThere may be a small number of administrative job losses he said but as a professional services firm that charges hourly, fee charging consultants roles will remain unchanged he said.\n“We are not trying to shrink our way to glory.”\n“This sale offers an opportunity for us to grow, yet recognises our strong history,” said Insite CEO Leah Brown.\nThe deals should be completed by next month and Mr Banks expects the acquisitions to contribute around $2.8 million in revenues this financial year.\nBoth sale prices are confidential.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:47:41.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
