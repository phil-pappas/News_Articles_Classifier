But here's the lowdown on how to apply and what to expect if you are selected.\nLocation: There are technically three Ideas Islands but mainly one is available for guests. The first island, Palawan, in the Philippines, was destroyed by a typhoon. Ideas Island founder and Swedish creativity speaker and author Fredrik Haren has no plans to rebuild on it. The second and third are near Stockholm. The main one used for guests, Vifarnaholme, which is where I stayed can accommodate up to six. The other, Svanholmen, is used by Haren more like a retreat center where he hosts corporate teams for the day.\n[caption id=\"attachment_7061\" align=\"\" width=\"800\"] Svanholmen (Courtesy of Fredrik Haren)[/caption] The Forbes eBook To Succeed In A Brutal Job Market Don’t let a rotten economy spoil your goals. Use the career and money advice in The Millennial Game Plan to get and stay ahead for good. How to apply: The application is simple and somewhat informal. The website says, “Tell us 1) Who you are (briefly), 2) what ideas/projects you are going to work on 3) why we should pick you and 4) if you are ok to give some money to charity and if not why not.”\nApplication criteria: Just that you be working on an idea or ideas and not taking a vacation.\nDates: June 1 to September 30, for a week at a time. Guests typically leave and arrive every Saturday.\nNumber of guests: As many as six people can sleep on Vifarnaholme, as long as two people are willing to sleep in the little shed near the dock, which is where Haren normally sleeps; it apparently has the best mattress. (There are spots for four in the main house.) I didn't try sleeping in the shed because after I expressed interest in doing so, Sofia looked me in the eye and said there were a lot of spiders. But I think it would still be a lovely place for rest.\nCosts: Lodging is free, though Haren does request you make a $1,000 donation to a charity of his choosing though he is open to the guests' suggestions. I split my donation between two organizations -- Liberty in North Korea and the Malala Fund — that I thought, in their own way, promote the spread of ideas in the world. My groceries for the week cost about $68 at the local store and then I spent an additional $15 when I went back in the middle of the week.\nTransportation: Haren gives extensive directions on how to drive or take the subway and bus out the island. He also lists local phone numbers for taxis. When I went to the grocery mid-week, I had planned to walk to a bus stop that was an hour away on foot but a driver passing by gave me a ride. Getting to the grocer so early knocked me off my plan a little so I would have had to wait another hour before the next bus back so I ended up calling a cab using the local grocery's wifi and the Skype app on my phone. It was $30 for the ride back.\nAmenities: There's a 4G wifi modem. The TV does not work. You need to bring your own freshwater to drink, as the water is not potable. I recommend bringing flip-flops for the shower.\n [gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://ideasisland.com/", "http://www.libertyinnorthkorea.org/", "https://www.malala.org/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00K6KOK0K", "http://ideasisland.com/how-to-stay-at-ideas-island/", "http://fredrikharen.com/"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:17:53.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
