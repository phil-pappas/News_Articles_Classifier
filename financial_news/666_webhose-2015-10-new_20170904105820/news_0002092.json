This is a persistent problem. Approximately 30 per cent of young people are not in employment, training or education, and around the world, young women are worse off.' \n'We need to act now, and we need to act together if we are going to realise the significant opportunities presented by this many young people today.\" \nIt said while circumstances differ in various regions, the issues remain the same - the world's youth are unable to find sustainable productive work. \nThe statement said this contributes to inequality, spurs social tension, and poses a risk to present and future national and global prosperity and security. \nThe report provides a baseline of trends, identifies constraints, and provides potential solutions to the youth employment crisis based on knowledge of successful and promising programs. \nIt also highlights specific population - young women, youth in conflict-affected and fragile states, as well as rural and urban youth - that requires dedicated attention. \nIt said Africa and Asia are urbanising faster than the rest of the world and are projected to become 56 and 64 per cent urban, by 2050. \nThe United Nations expects continuing population growth and urbanisation to add 2.5 billion people to the world's urban population by 2050 with nearly 90 per cent of the increases concentrated in Africa and Asia. \nNicole Goldin, lead author said: 'Success, sustainability and scale in all these pursuits will not be possible without collaboration involving governments and public institutions at all levels to strengthen capacity and policies that foster an environment to enable growth and allow proven interventions to succeed at a greater scale.' \n'In today's young generation, these baselines- context, inclusion, evidence and knowledge- signals the road ahead.' \nOver the next 15 years, S4YE would increase the number of young people engaged in productive work in a world, when all youth have access to job opportunities that empower them to escape extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity worldwide based on the SDGs. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:07:52.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
