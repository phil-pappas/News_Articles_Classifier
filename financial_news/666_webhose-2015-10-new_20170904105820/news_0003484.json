Miner Anglo American PLC AAL, +2.18% and iron ore heavyweight BHP Billiton PLC BLT, +2.15% both finished 2.2% higher. \nBritish blue chips rallied to intraday highs after the People’s Bank of China cut its one-year deposit rate by 25 basis points to 1.5%, and its one-year lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.35%. It also relaxed reserve requirements for banks. The PBOC had previously cut interest rates in August and in June.\nThe FTSE 100 had been modestly higher following indications Thursday from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi the bank may expand stimulus measures for the eurozone, the U.K.’s largest trading partner. But the index’s advance was limited in part by declines for some commodity shares. \n“First, Super Mario (Draghi) came to the rescue. Now the People’s Bank of China has eased its policy further…This is music to the ears of stock market bulls,” said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com, in a note. \nThe FTSE 100 scored a weekly rise of 1%, marking its second weekly advance in three weeks. \nAmong the session’s relatively few decliners was Pearson PLC PSON, -5.21% The education specialist’s shares slumped 5.2% in the wake of a plunge by rival firm Apollo Education Group Inc. APOL, +3.27% on Thursday, as Apollo swung to a quarterly loss. Pearson on Wednesday tumbled 16%, logging its biggest one-day drop on record after cutting its full-year forecast . \nOn the FTSE 250 midcap index MCX, +1.15% TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC TALK, -4.36% shares finished down 4.4% after the website for the provider of broadband and mobile services underwent a “significant and sustained” cyberattack . TalkTalk warned of a chance that data from its four million customers has been stolen. British police are investigating the breach. \nWilliam Hill PLC WMH, -7.93% shares skidded 7.9% after the betting firm posted a 39% drop in third-quarter adjusted operating profit, in part because of higher gambling duties. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:22:31.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
