But, times have changed. Generating ideas throughout the organisation is the way to go now. That’s according to International Speaker and Thought-Innovator Neil Pflaeging. \nHe tells JOY BUSINESS organisations that refuse to adopt the new management concept called ‘SCRUM' are likely to fail. For him, getting rid of bureaucracies, hierarchies and barriers to performance, with the idea that managers are the only ones who can plan, and think for the business is not the way to go. \nThe phenomenon according to him creates a culture that suggests that “some people are supposed to think and others are not to.” \nThis he says has to change “and Scrum is the idea of introducing radically thoughtful and mindful project work across the organisation, instead of having a few project managers thinking.” \nWhen management and social technology was invented “we had powerful managers at the top who do the thinking and ‘non-thinking’ workers who just execute. That idea was born a hundred years ago in the United States and it ultimately was such a successful model at the time to operate organisations simply by liberating the workers from the thinking, which is kind of a nasty idea, but worked perfectly in the industrial age” he noted. \nManagement and the social technology concept where businesses are managed from the top, he says, died 40 year ago because it is a zombie technology from the industrial age and what would be created if the concept is continued would be ‘dumb organisations’. Complexities, Mr. Pflaeging says, have caused organisations today to deal not only with really competitive markets, but really dense competition as well as surprises, “and managers cannot control these from the top.” \nScrum promotes self-managing teams, transparency, frequent inspection and adaptation. Agile projects are more likely to succeed and currently scoring higher project success rates than many traditional project management methods around the World. Agile and Scrum can help Ghana and the rest of Africa to transform into new Hubs for greater social and economic advancement. Africa is the 2nd fastest growing economy in the World and is becoming a global player in the market place. Agile will not only sustain the pace of change but more importantly improve the lives of people on this beautiful and amazing continent. Exponential growth is however, being predicted for Africa if Agile and Scrum is adopted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:28:13.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
