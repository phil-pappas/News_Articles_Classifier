Supplied by Lucille Keen The Fair Work Commission vice-president, who is in a relationship with disgraced unionist Kathy Jackson, admits he worked on her legal defence while on paid sick leave.\nMichael Lawler told ABC's Four Corners he did nothing wrong by taking leave from the workplace tribunal for nine months of the past year, receiving more than $17,000 a month in pay.\n\"There is absolutely nothing wrong with taking leave to help your partner defend herself against unjust attacks; in fact I would have thought most Australians would regard that as an honourable and decent thing to do,\" he told the program, which aired on Monday night.\n\"She blew the whistle because I urged her and encouraged her to do so and reminded her that it was her duty to do so. And really this for her is a case of redemption.\"\nOn Monday, just hours before the program went to air, Employment Minister Michaelia Cash announced Federal Court Judge, the Hon Peter Heerey AM QC, would head an investigation into Mr Lawler's conduct including his leave and any conflicts of interest.\nHe shared snippets of a five-hour video diary with the show. \"I am going to make some allegations that are properly described as sensational,\" he told the program.\nMr Lawler said he was aware of the impact of the controversy on his reputation but he stood by Ms Jackson.\n\"I'll be characterised as that scumbag, crook, fraudster and at the very best somebody who's been bewitched by an evil harridan, namely Kathy,\" he said.\n Mr Lawler described the start of his relationship with Ms Jackson in 2008 as a \"significant accident\" that occurred in his life.\n\"And by significant accident I don't mean a mistake; by accident I mean something coincidental,\" he said. \"I meet and formed a relationship with Katherine Jackson, the national secretary of the Health Services Union.\"\nMs Jackson appears on the program and said for her partner to \"be removed from office because he's done the right thing and supported me, then there's something wrong with this country, something seriously wrong with our political system and the judicial system\".\n\"I just can't believe that it just ended up like this,\" Ms Jackson said.\nNSW Police raided the couple's home earlier this month as part of Taskforce Heracles, which was formed to investigate union corruption in conjunction with the Federal Police.\nIn August, Ms Jackson was found by the Federal Court to have misused $1.4 million of union funds on personal dining, shopping and holidays.\nMr Lawler told the program any suggestion he benefited from this was \"bullshit\".\nAt the beginning of the civil trial Ms Jackson declared bankruptcy and did not fight the case.\nShe has been attempting to transferring the title to the $1.3 million house on the NSW south coast she shares with Mr Lawler into his name.\nIn a statement to the Federal Court, Mr Lawler said he wanted to return to his role at the Fair Work Commission but said he had been under attack by members within the body. He said he had been debilitated by his own mental health and was suffering stress.\nFair Work commissioners can only be removed by the agreement of both houses of Parliament, meaning the Coalition would have to vote in support of any such motion for it to pass.\nThe last person who was removed from such a position was Jim Staples, who was not reappointed by the Hawke government in 1989 when it replaced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:03:54.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
