The ringgit has soared about eight percent this week, its best five-day run in 17 years. \nTalk of a Fed rate rise has hurt emerging markets -- particularly struggling Malaysia and Indonesia -- as dealers have for months been withdrawing cash to the United States looking for better, safer returns. \n- Energy firms climb - \n\"The latest minutes clearly suggest that international factors are an unusually large determinant of US policy deliberations,\" Matthew Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual Ltd. in Sydney, wrote in an email to clients. \n\"This, combined with the weak September US nonfarm payrolls report indicate that the hurdle for a US rate hike has increased further, which was music to the ears of investors.\" \nThe South Korean won climbed almost one percent, the Australian dollar was 0.12 percent higher, the Thai baht edged up 0.30 percent and the Taiwan dollar gained 1.0 percent. \nShare (LSE: SHRE.L - news ) markets also extended a run of gains as confidence returns to trading floors. Tokyo was up 0.78 percent by lunch while Hong Kong rose 1.6 percent in the morning, Sydney added 0.81 percent and Singapore gained 1.3 percent. \nMarkets have been rallying for years on the back of loose monetary policies introduced by central banks during the global financial crisis and economists fear any tightening will cut off the money tap, halting a stuttering recovery and lead to another downturn. \nAmong the stand-out winners on equities markets were energy companies, made more attractive by the advance in crude prices. \nSydney-listed Santos (Dusseldorf: STS1.DU - news ) surged more than five percent while in Hong Kong CNOOC was almost seven percent higher and PetroChina (HKSE: 0857-OL.HK - news ) added 4.5 percent. Inpex and JX Holdings (Other OTC: JXHGF - news ) in Tokyo also rallied. \nCrude prices have seen healthy advances in the past week, surging more than 10 percent to multi-month highs as worries about a stronger dollar, a supply glut and weak demand ease. \nThe market got a shot in the arm Thursday when the head of the OPEC cartel of crude producers -- which represents almost half of output -- said demand will rise more than projected this year. \nOn Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up 0.50 percent and Brent was 0.53 percent higher, with continuing strife across the oil-rich Middle East providing support. \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this story --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:55:12.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
