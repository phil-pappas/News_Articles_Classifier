That is much better than the previous guidance, which suggested 120,000 tonnes was the best possible result.\nThe extra output will lower OZ's cost guidance too, and the strong performance is just rewards for long-term shareholders, who suffered through two years of significant waste movements in 2013 and 2014.\nAdvertisement OZ chief Andrew Cole made reference to that difficult period in today's results statement.\n\"Production is higher while the amount of waste being moved is over 40 per cent less than the same period last year,\" he said.\n\"We are exceeding the targets that we set earlier this year, but believe we can do even better.\"\nMr Cole said all parts of the company would aim to reduce costs by 15 per cent during next year to try to secure the company as a \"first quartile\" copper producer.\nOZ shares have given back some of the gains that followed news of KKR's entry onto the register and closed on Thursday at $3.95.\nKKR declined to comment when approached by Fairfax Media on Thursday.\nCopper was fetching $US2.37 a pound on Friday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:11:36.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
