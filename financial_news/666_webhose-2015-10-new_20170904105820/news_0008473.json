Although external risks continue to overshadow any growth model based on net exports, Spain has a strong track record of gaining international market share in goods and services,\" the ratings agency said. \nStandard & Poor's predicted exports will represent about 34 percent of Spain's GDP by the end of 2015, up from 25 percent in 2008. \nThe collapse of a decade-long property bubble in 2008 plunged the Spanish economy, the eurozone's fourth largest, into its worst economic downturn since Spain returned to democracy following the death of longtime dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975. \nThe country returned to growth in 2014 with an expansion of 1.4 percent -- the first year since 2008 in which there has been full-year growth -- although the unemployment rate stood at 22.4 percent in the second quarter, the highest level in the European Union after Greece's. \nThe government predicts the economy will expand by 3.3 percent this year and by 3.0 percent in 2016. \n- 'Sign of confidence' - \nEconomy Minister Luis de Guindos said Standard & Poor's decision to raise Spain's debt rating \"was a sign of confidence in the Spanish economy and its future.\" \nWhile Standard & Poor's said employment growth should continue to boost consumer spending, thus tax receipts, it said \"further budgetary tightening will likely be necessary\" if Spain is to meet its target of a public deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP by 2018. \nThe Spanish government's forecast for the public deficit -- a key indicator of financial stability that measures how much spending exceeds income -- stands at 4.2 percent of GDP for this year. \nPolls suggest Rajoy's conservative Popular Party may win most seats but will likely lose the majority it secured in 2011. \nRajoy won a resounding victory in 2011 as voters turned against the ruling Socialists for their management of the financial crisis that rocked the country in 2008. \nCatalan demands for independence will likely loom large over the upcoming polls after separatist parties on Sunday won Catalonia's regional election, a vote they had billed as a de facto referendum on breaking away from Spain. \nStandard & Poor's said it believed that \"tensions between the central government and regional authorities will gradually subside, and that the region of Catalonia will remain part of Spain.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:46:50.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
