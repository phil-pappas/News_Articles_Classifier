Photo: Louie Douvis\nAustralia's biggest insurer is turning a new page in its corporate history as incoming boss Peter Harmer prepares to take the top seat at Insurance Australia Group. But pressure is mounting for the new CEO to tackle the biggest thorn currently in the business – its controversial expansion into China.\nHarmer, a technology enthusiast who turned around IAG's underperforming CGU business, will take over from respected insurance veteran Mike Wilkins in October.\nCan IAG afford to miss the Asian boom that has proved so elusive – but may become incredibly lucrative – to Australian companies?\nThe former boss of broking giant Aon in the UK has been quick to outline his priorities, and one of the top items on Harmer's agenda is growing the group's most unpopular division: Asia.\nIAG's 10-year quota share deal with Berkshire Hathaway in June saw the insurer pocket a $500 million capital injection from the Warren Buffett-controlled company. Together with its own bank of capital, speculation is rife the insurer could pump up to $1 billion into China as it seeks a national licence in the world's second-largest economy.\nAdvertisement Sources say making a play for one of the top five biggest insurers in China, such as The People's Insurance Co of China and Ping An Insurance Co, will be out of IAG's league, but the Australian insurer could still make a move on one of the top 10.\nBut it is a strategy proving increasingly out of favour among its shareholders, who were told in August that IAG had to take a $60 million write-down on the company's existing $100 million investment into Chinese motor insurer, Bohai.\nTwo key reasons why IAG should not invest in China is its overseas expansion record, which has not been kind to the insurer, and the risks of entering a market riddled with business and regulatory hurdles.\n Pain of ill-fated UK expansion plans Investors remember the pain of IAG sinking $1.75 billion into its ill-fated UK expansion plans in the mid 2000s under the watch of former CEO, Michael Hawker. Some shareholders and analysts pleaded with IAG to abandon its overseas foray, but their cries were ignored.\nIn 2013, IAG sold its troubled Equity Red Star business in Britain, suffering a $240 million loss on the sale and reflecting the knock-down prices for assets there.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia estimated IAG's net profits would have increased 21 per cent and its earnings per share would have climbed 31 per cent in the past 10 years had the company opted to return capital to shareholders , instead of expanding into Asia and Britain.\nRoss Curran, insurance analyst at CBA, said shareholders would also have benefited from a 19 per cent boost in dividend per share, had IAG returned capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks.\n\"In hindsight, our analysis suggests IAG would have provided greater value to shareholders by returning excess capital, as opposed to investing in Asia or the UK. We believe that this should be considered as the group decides how to best deploy any excess capital,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nThe other reason cited by detractors of IAG's China strategy is the risk of entering a developing market that is mired with red tape and regulatory hurdles.\nThe China-Australia Free-Trade Agreement, which was signed in June, will allow Australian insurers access to the Asian giant's statutory third-party liability motor insurance market.\nMotor the largest class According to figures from CLSA, motor insurance made up the largest class of property and casualty insurance in China – and motor is the market that IAG is trying to target.\nBut the risks remain that regulations could change, and a slowing economy in China could result in uncertain business conditions as consumer demand slows.\nThe long time frame and patience required to reap returns from the region has also seen the retreat of companies such as Foster's of China, when it sold its Shanghai brewery to Japanese beverage group Suntory in 2006.\nANZ Bank has yet to reap the full results of its foray into China, while billionaire James Packer's move into Macau through Crown has been suffering falling gambling revenues.\n\"We've made it clear to IAG we are against any major investments in Asia and while we understand they need to grow in the long term, we're concerned they will overspend,\" Anton Tagliaferro, investment director of Investors Mutual, said. He argued that IAG did not appear to be heeding investors' concerns.\n\"They have $900 million invested in Asia now, generating very little return. We'd rather they concentrate on parts of the insurance market, like travel insurance, pet insurance … [which] are areas that seem to be quite lucrative but they [IAG] don't have much representation. What they're doing is very risky in China. It's not simple to make good returns there – look at companies like ANZ and Crown.\"\nMr Tagliaferro's concerns are echoed by fellow fund manager Jason Kim from Nikko Asset Management, who previously argued that \"everyone has their eye on getting something in China because it's such a big market, but there are a lot of strong incumbents.\nBe patient, find the right way \"You have to be very patient and come up with a right way of doing it – I'm not sure if they [IAG] are going to be executing properly on that,\" he said.\nIAG is now at a turning point in its $12 billion business. A new CEO would mean IAG has a chance to rewrite the direction of the company, listen to major shareholders' laments about the group's Asia strategy and turn its attention to growing in the local market.\nBut one key question remains: can IAG afford to miss the Asian boom that has proved so elusive – but may become incredibly lucrative – to Australian companies?\nThe biggest problem facing IAG's core businesses of personal and commercial insurance in Australia and New Zealand is stagnant growth. IAG owns RACV and NRMA, two of the largest brands in insurance in the country.\nSuncorp Group and IAG control more than 60 per cent of Australia's personal lines market including motor and home – but face increasingly aggressive competition from competitors. Just two years ago, the two insurance giants controlled about 70 per cent of the market.\nIAG's commercial business has also been feeling intense heat from falling premium rates as an abundance of capacity flooded the market in the past 18 months. This puts further pressure on IAG to diversify their business and seek growth outside of its local borders.\nInsurance penetration rate According to CLSA insurance analyst Jan van der Schalk, China's insurance penetration rate (or how well people are insured) is about 0.9 to 1 per cent across the country. Out of 31 Chinese provinces, only 10 have penetration rates greater than 1 per cent.\nIt is estimated that Asia's middle class will grow to eight times that of North America, and household wealth be nearly double the size of the United States by 2025. As wealth continues to accumulate and living standards improve, the need for insurance will be more prevalent. Given the growth potential of the market, China represented an opportunity that is \"hard to ignore\" Mr van der Schalk argued.\n\"IAG, if its belief that being a regional player is the correct strategy, is hard pushed to ignore the metrics surrounding the growth of the Chinese motor market,\" he argued in a note to clients.\nIt is also important to note that IAG's foray into Asia has been measured. Asia contributed $21 million in earnings to the group last financial year, with its Thailand and Malaysia businesses performing well. The overall group produced $1.1 billion in insurance profits and gross written premiums of $11.4 billion during fiscal 2015.\nIAG spends years combing its target markets in Asia – Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, India and China – for the right partners to grow. IAG typically lends its underwriting expertise and capital, while accessing its local partners' distribution strength and brands.\nIAG cannot be faulted for rushing into snapping up stakes in insurers for the sake of expansion, having eyed Asia since the early 2000s. Indonesia for example had been on IAG's expansion list for the past five years, before the company finally made a move when it bought a stake in motor and commercial insurer, PT Asuransi Parolamas in May.\nCertain key attributes IAG had been looking at India since 2003 but only completed its deal with the State Bank of India in 2009.\nAccording to Credit Suisse, IAG adheres to certain key attributes when expanding in Asia. This included selecting a market with good growth potential, longer-term stable environment, one where foreigners can be successful and where the right partners can be found. Critical to the company's strategy was also aspiring to be one of the top three players in each market.\n\"IAG spent a lot of time looking for the right partner in each of the markets they have entered, performing a lot of due diligence on each prospective partner,\" Credit Suisse insurance analyst Andrew Adams said.\nWhether or not Harmer's level of enthusiasm for IAG's expansion into Asia will match Wilkins' in the longer term remains to be seen.\nBut for now, Harmer appears to be echoing Wilkins' belief that Asia, and in particular China, is a jewel that needs to be mined for the long-term growth of IAG.\n\"I've been part of Mike's team for five years now and that's the majority of time that we've been in Asia – I'm deeply committed to continuing to find the right opportunities to invest there,\" Mr Harmer said.\nRuth Liew", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:05:08.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
