Donoghue S&P Dow Jones Indices 58 minutes ago  Content preferences Done \nNEW YORK, Oct. 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- W.E. Donoghue & Co., Inc. (WEDCO), an independent wealth advisor, has selected S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) to be the custom calculation agent for two new custom hybrid indices - W.E. Donoghue's Power Dividend Developed International Index and W.E. Donoghue's Power Dividend Mid-Cap Index . Custom hybrid indices are client-owned, white label custom indices that use an S&P Dow Jones Indices index to screen for constituents and/or as an actual constituent of their index. \nAccording to W.E. Donoghue, The Power Dividend Developed International Index is a rules based index that measures high yielding dividend paying stocks in the developed international markets when in a bullish position. The index utilizes mechanical trend following techniques to de-risk from broad international stock market declines by tactically shifting to short-term treasuries when in a bearish position. The Power Dividend Mid-Cap Index is a rules based index that calculates high yielding dividend paying stocks in the mid-cap asset class when in a bullish position. The index utilizes mechanical trend following techniques to de-risk from broad mid-cap stock market declines by tactically shifting to short-term treasuries when in a bearish position. \n\"We have seen a growing trend among Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) to develop and maintain customized, transparent benchmarks that cater to their investment strategies,\" says Michael Mell, Director of Custom Indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices . \"We are pleased that WEDCO has selected S&P DJI as the calculation agent for their two new indices and are committed to leverage our custom capabilities to advance innovation within the RIA community.\" \n\"In a world of historically low interest rates, investors are seeking solutions to capture income and or a total return with a means of de-risking,\" comments Jeffrey R. Thompson, President, W.E. Donoghue & Co., Inc. \"In order to address this demand WEDCO is expanding its Power Dividend Index suite in the tactical dividend and yield space.\" \nS&P Dow Jones Indices is an acknowledged global leader in the calculation of custom indices, providing unparalleled services in the design, construction, management and distribution of custom indices.
