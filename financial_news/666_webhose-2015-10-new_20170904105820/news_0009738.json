Justin McManus Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston Thursday was one of those increasingly common days in Australia where close proximity to a radio or television guaranteed the vaguely politically aware citizen an abundance of sound bites at which to disbelievingly shake their head.\nWhile PM Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison were in the Cabinet room negotiating our utopian future with national leaders of industry and labour, two of their parliamentary colleagues got things started.\nFirstly, dumped Cabinet minister Eric Abetz (who until now had maintained an uncharacteristically dignified silence) wrote to the members of his local Liberal branches in sunny Tasmania, his heart breaking at the \"hundreds of resignations from the Liberal Party\", modestly conceding that, given his own demotion, and that of Kevin Andrews (no joke!), the mass desertion of supporters was \"understandable\".\nA short time later, the Liberal Party's state office issued a statement confirming that seven members have resigned since Tony Abbott 's ousting, outnumbered by the eight new people who've joined the party. And the seven were all Schwarzkopf agents seeking new frontiers for semi-permanent blue/black man dye.\nCan't count real good: former Cabinet minister Eric Abetz. Alex Ellinghausen Abetz has not demonstrated such mastery of the facts since the last time he played any major part in the national political conversation: Utegate. Under his leadership, no wonder Abbott's government floundered so badly in the house of review. Then there was Abbott himself, who not so long ago promised \"no wrecking, no undermining and no sniping\" from him. If only he hadn't said that, nobody would really begrudge him the wholesale wrecking, undermining and sniping he's now full- throatedly engaging in.\nHe started this week accusing Morrison of \"badly misleading people\" and not warning him of Turnbull's impending coup.\nAnd back in his final speech as PM , he blamed \"a febrile media culture… that rewards treachery\" (funny, he wasn't complaining about that in opposition when Labor was knifing itself to death).\nWell, on Thursday morning in Melbourne, in an interview with 3AW radio host Neil Mitchell , Abbott blamed that febrile organ The Australian , it of the \"constant drumbeat… that we need economic reform\".\nNot happy with PM's reform meeting on Thursday: Naked CEO Alex Malley Louise Kennerley \"Frankly, I'm disappointed Neil, that more of the people saying that we needed reform… did not get behind the 2014 Budget.\"\nSeriously? Abbott could barely have asked for more support from that quarter if he'd written the whole newspaper himself. In the words of Tom Selleck : \"What a crock!\"\nAnd the third and final dummy spit of Grand Final week came by way of Alex Malley , the outlandishly self-promoted head of a professional standards body for some-but-not-all accountants, and certainly the first one to ever put himself on billboards.\nHe hit the airwaves to express his dissatisfaction that \"no expertise\" on \"taxation and superannuation\" had been invited into the room\" for Turnbull's reform consultations, and that \"small business is not well-represented\". Sure, the peak small business chamber ACCI was there, and the BCA and AIG know a thing or two about tax, but how dare the PM not invite the Naked CEO?!\nMalley has form, having spat the dummy at Joe Hockey when his department inadvertently excluded his standards body (or as he self-describes, \"the peak finance body in Australia\") from the Budget lock-up in May.\nUnfortunately, there are some serious gatherings in this country where you can't buy a seat at the table. But Malley still has a free run of the rest of them.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:12:19.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
