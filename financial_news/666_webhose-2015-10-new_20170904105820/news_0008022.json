Though Moody's statement doesn't indicate a change in Illinois' rating, it could be a factor in future action. \nThe lower a state's credit rating, the tougher — and more expensive — it is to borrow money. \nGOP Gov. Bruce Rauner and the Democrat-controlled Legislature haven't agreed on a budget for the July 1 fiscal year. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:50:59.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
