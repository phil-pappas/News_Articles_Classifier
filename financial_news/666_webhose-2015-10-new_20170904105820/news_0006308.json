It is crucial that competition from new and smaller banks is not unnecessarily impeded by prudential regulation,\" said Tyrie. \nThe regulator has already eased capital requirements for new banks and streamlined the process for obtaining a banking licence but smaller banks say they still operate at a disadvantage to larger rivals. \nA group of new and smaller British banks have set out proposals aimed at offsetting the new tax, including an arrangement that would mean small banks would not have to set aside more capital against loans than larger rivals. \nThe group includes TSB, Secure Trust, Aldermore , Shawbrook, Tesco Bank, Sainsbury Bank , Close Brothers (LSE: CBG.L - news ) , Paragon (LSE: 0NFG.L - news ) and Metro (Dusseldorf: 62M.DU - news ) Bank. \nBritain's competition watchdog is due to publish the provisional findings of an investigation into the market for personal current accounts and small business banking services later this month. \n($1 = 0.6551 pounds) (Editing by Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:57:23.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
