Ratings are BB+/BB+. \nMexican real-estate investment trust Fibra Uno (Other OTC: FBASF - news ) has completed meetings with investors through Bank of America, Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) , HSBC and Santander. \nTerrafina (Other OTC: CBAOF - news ) , another Mexican REIT, has finished meeting accounts as it markets a potential US$400m-$500m bond offering.
