Nic Walker Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak Royal Bank of Scotland analysts have foreshadowed a world of \"QE infinity\", where the quantitative easing, or monetary stimulus, conducted by central banks goes on seemingly forever and low returns dominate investor expectations.\nThe analysts, led by head of macro credit research Alberto Gallo, highlighted the calls for fiscal and structural responses that came out of the International Monetary Fund's meeting in Peru at the weekend . In new research, they said such calls would probably go unheeded and economies would continue to count solely on the monetary stimulus, or quantitative easing, they had grown accustomed to.\n\"Against this backdrop, the probability of QE infinity, an environment where central banks continue QE [perhaps after a few rate hikes in the US], is becoming more likely,\" RBS said.\n\"The prospect of prolonged QE entails a variety of consequences for investors, which will see central banks increasingly be asset owners, with lower expected returns.\"\nThe only central banks using QE now are the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. The US Federal Reserve finished four rounds of stimulus but retains its expanded balance sheet, even though it has stopped printing money and buying securities to keep rates low.\nThe Federal Reserve did not raise interest rates in September, citing global turmoil, but the weakness in US economic data since then suggests the central bank might have no ability to do so in 2015. Some experts have flagged the idea of the Federal Reserve returning to stimulatory settings if a rate rise becomes untenable.\nThe ECB's €1.1 trillion ($1.74 trillion) stimulus program has been effective in reducing the value of the euro and propping up asset prices but it was resisted by the Bundesbank, which advocated for fiscal reform instead.\n\"It also has consequences on the economy, risk taking and potentially on politics, given the impact of QE on the relative distribution of wealth,\" Mr Gallo says in his report. \"There are chances that none of this will matter, and that financial markets will continue to sleep well with 'bad news is good news'.\n \"But as we saw with last month's Fed hold decision, the chances of a policy mistake – or of something perceived as such – are rising,\" the analysts say. \"Perhaps, a frank approach to central bank communications would be best.\"\nCentral bank policy language has become more confusing. Under Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen, the US central bank has started linking its guidance to the behaviour of the market, UBS says.\nThis \"means tying yourself to market volatility, which intrinsically makes it trickier to implement a stable policy path.\"\nMr Gallo suggests that central bankers are spending too much time talking about subjects they cannot fix.\n\"Labour market slack, job and wage polarisation, stagnant demographics, and the resulting lack of inflation are structural challenges, which cyclical stimulus cannot solve.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:09:15.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
