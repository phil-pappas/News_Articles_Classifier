This year's goal was 9.1 million paying customers, and the administration has said it's on track to meet that. \nThe health care law has reduced the share of Americans without coverage to historic lows by offering a combination of subsidized private insurance and expanded Medicaid. \nBut officials say finding new private insurance customers is getting harder, partly because the most eager ones have already enrolled. The new sign-up season starts Nov. 1. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:33:31.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
