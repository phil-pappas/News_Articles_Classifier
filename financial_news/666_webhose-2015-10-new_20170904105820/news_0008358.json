Bloomberg by Leslie Hook\nUber started out with an upmarket limousine service, but the insurgent ride-hailing group has recently been moving in an altogether different direction: carpooling.\n\"We are trying to induce the carpooling thing,\" Travis Kalanick, chief executive, said earlier this month, pedalling his hands in front of him as if to illustrate people sharing a taxi. \"That is exciting, that's two cars becoming one.\"\nThe service has the potential to transform urban transportation, but only if the company and its rivals can make the algorithms work.\nAlready in its home city of San Francisco, the UberPool service accounts for nearly half of journeys with Uber and is profitable one year after it was launched. Mr Kalanick was referring to shared-taxi services, the latest battleground between Uber and its rivals such as Lyft and China's Didi Kuaidi.\nLyft, which grew out of a start-up offering city-to-city ride-sharing, has its own such service, Line, that accounts for more than half of journeys taken with it in San Francisco.\nOn the other side of the world, Hitch, Didi Kuaidi's commuter carpooling service in China, is organising up to 700,000 trips a day, just three months after launch.\nIt is little wonder that mastering the algorithms of carpooling - and attracting enough customers - has become a top priority for each company.\n UberPool, Lyft Line and Didi's Hitch turn a private car service into something more like a shuttle bus. A driver is able to make multiple stops and pick up different passengers going in the same direction. The customers pay less than they would for a regular journey, to compensate for the extra stops, which could mean it takes longer for them to reach their final destination.\nThough UberPool is a relatively new service that operates in five cities in the US, the company is pushing it overseas. Last month UberPool launched in Bangalore, India; and a commuter car-sharing service, Uber Commute, was rolled out in Chengdu, China.\n\"India is a top global priority for Uber, along with China and UberPool,\" said Bhavik Rathod, Uber's general manager, Bangalore, when the trial was launched.\nBut engineering the underlying technology to make the service work well has been a challenge. In the days after UberPool's San Francisco launch last year - timed to coincide with the release of Lyft Line - many users complained about inefficient routes.\nChris Lambert, chief technology officer of Lyft, says that success hinges on attracting enough drivers and passengers so customers can be \"matched\" with others going the same way.\nPassengers always pay less for a shared trip but if they are not matched with another traveller during their journey, the company incurs the loss. It is only once enough people use the service that the companies are able to use car fleets more efficiently.\nAcademics who study transportation and cities say that the popularity of these services is changing the debate about urban transport.\n\"The car is a piece of infrastructure which is not very well used,\" says Carlo Ratti, a professor at MIT. \"Every car is used around 5 per cent of the time.\"\nHe thinks taxi-sharing could change this in three stages: when passengers start to share cars, such as UberPool and Lyft Line; when drivers start to share cars; and when shared, self-driving cars prowl the streets, picking up and dropping off passengers in perfect efficiency.\n\"You could potentially have a city where you run the whole city - you take everyone to their destination at the time that they want - with 20 per cent of the cars we have today,\" he says. \"Imagine how different cities would be.\"\nGauging the extent of the impact on transport systems is challenging. Susan Shaheen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, conducted an exploratory study in 2012 that showed that 30 per cent of carpoolers might have otherwise used public transit, while 40 per cent might have otherwise used taxis. \"It's very difficult to assess what the impact is on our transportation system,\" she says. \"The market is evolving before our eyes.\"\nOther companies are testing different approaches to smart carpooling, from France's BlaBlaCar, which specialises in ride-sharing between cities, to Via, a commuter shuttle fleet in Manhattan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:19:58.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
