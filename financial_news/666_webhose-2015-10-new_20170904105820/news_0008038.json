Photo: Andrew Meares\nKnown as the 'iron lady' and boasting a public reputation that leaves little to be desired, Australia's richest person Gina Rinehart has revealed a rare glimpse into her softer side.\nRadio 6PR on Thursday discovered the often polarising mining magnate donates luxury linen gift packs to cancer patients in Perth hospitals.\nThe top-of-the-range gifts are estimated to be valued at $1500 each and are dropped off at hospitals including Hollywood Private Hospital, Bethesda Health Care and St John of God Hospital weekly for patients in palliative care.\nRadio 6PR listener Rhianna said her great-grandmother, who recently had an operation at Hollywood Private Hospital, \"really appreciated\" the gift.\nAdvertisement She said she discovered Ms Rinehart's foundation was the mystery donor after quizzing the hospital's nurses.\n\"I know [Ms Rinehart] sometimes gets a bit of grief in our community and often her wealth is the source of some derision,\" she said.\n\"She [donates the gift packs] without wanting any praise and it is done on the quiet...at quite a considerable cost according to the hospital staff that I spoke to.\"\nCaller Margaret said she was in hospital getting treatment for breast cancer when she too received the linen gifts.\n\"The present was just overwhelming,\" she said.\n\"Not only does she do that for women, but I was told when I asked the question that she gives them to men with prostate cancer too.\"\nAnother caller said one of the pillows he received had a $280 price tag left on it.\nAlthough assumedly a considerable cost to most, the outlays for the linen gifts are unlikely to put a dent in Ms Rinehart's estimated $20 billion dollar fortune but they may help to repair her battered reputation.\nFamily feuds, attempts to control the media and calls to lower the nation's minimum wage have kept the usually private Ms Rinehart in the media spotlight for all the wrong reasons, while her philanthropic efforts go widely unnoticed.\nBut it seems that may be the way Ms Rinehart wants it.\nIn 2012, Hancock Prospecting information manager Mark Bickerton told GiveNow.com.au that Ms Rinehart preferred to keep her philanthropic endeavours private.\n\"It has already been published that she does help women's and children's charitable interests, and medical causes such as cancer and heart health. However, her philanthropy is not limited to that,\" he said.\nPerhaps there is more to Ms Rinehart than meets the public eye.\n Follow WAtoday on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/#!/WAtoday"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:38:47.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
