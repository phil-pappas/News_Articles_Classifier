Bloomberg Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak China's policy easing underscores that global central banks are still firmly in the mood for lowering interest rates where they can and boosting monetary stimulus, meaning all eyes are now on the Bank of Japan and its appetite to do more at this week's policy meeting.\nOn Friday, the People's Bank of China lowered the cost of borrowing for the sixth time since November last year, reduced reserve requirements for bank lending and removed controls on deposit rates. This followed the European Central Bank's willingness on Thursday to extend its €1.1 trillion ($1.7 trillion) bond purchasing program and discussion around deepening the negative rates applied to deposits.\nThe Bank of Japan could be next. A scheduled board meeting this Friday means an opportunity for its policymakers to pre-empt any yen appreciation , especially against the euro, with a revamped version of its quantitative easing strategy. The United States Federal Reserve meets too, but with no expectations of a policy shift, given its inaction on rates in September and downgrades to global growth.\nCredit Suisse Tokyo economist Hiromichi Shirakawa says there is a 50-50 chance that the BoJ will decide on additional easing on Friday.\nHe says there appears to be no shortage of justification for further monetary stimulus, with the headline inflation rate in negative territory, export volumes declining, industrial production weak and growth in the working population decelerating.\nAnd he warns that if the Japanese central bank maintains its wait-and-see stance, it may only back itself into a more difficult corner by creating even greater attention over what extraordinary loosening move it will consider next in response to the weak economy.\nGeneral trend down Shane Oliver, AMP's chief economist, said China's easing \"reinforces the general trend in interest rates across the region has been down.\" But China's action in isolation is not enough to force other central banks into action.\n \"Normally when a large country cuts their interest rates the currency falls,\" he said. That's not necessarily true in China's case because the currency is still heavily managed, lending less urgency to the need for other central banks to counter the PBoC's decisions.\nMr Oliver observed a pattern emerging in the PBoC's pace of easing, coming almost every two months. The Chinese central bank does not have scheduled policy meetings that dominate the global economic calendar.\n\"Monetary policy in China is just too tight. If you're a small, medium-sized business your borrowing costs in China are still high single digits,\" he said. \"The Chinese still have plenty of flexibility; it's the one with the most flexibility in terms of conventional policy tools.\"\nHe is not counting on further devaluation of the yuan this year within official channels and believes targeted monetary policy will be more effective in stimulating the economy anyway.\n\"Real rates are too high,\" the AMP economist argued. \"There's an argument that interest rates and monetary policy in China have been too tight. It's not as if Chinese exports have been losing market share globally [because of yuan appreciation].\"\nANZ economists highlighted that although the monthly purchasing managers index surveys show China's manufacturing activity has not recovered yet, the property sector is experiencing improved demand.\nThe drag created by China's slowdown across Asia was clear: Taiwan is poised to record its first contraction in growth year-on-year since 2009 when it reports third-quarter gross domestic product, and Hong Kong's exports are forecast to contract again.\nIn China, the issue of capital outflows won't go away. \"With last Friday's rate cut, outflow pressures could pick up, and renewed depreciation pressure emerge,\" warned Khoon Goh, senior foreign exchange strategist at ANZ.\nSociété Générale is counting on the BoJ to lift global stimulus, as well as further easing in Russia. The Japanese central bank will increase its annual target for the monetary base to ¥85 trillion ($970 billion) from ¥80 trillion and lower its projection for inflation, SocGen predicts.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-10-26T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:04:51.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
