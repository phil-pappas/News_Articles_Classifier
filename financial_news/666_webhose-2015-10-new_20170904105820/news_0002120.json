But the overall picture is not so good even with viewing from DVRs and video-on-demand factored into the mix. According to Nielsen, the combined premiere week prime-time audience including seven days of recorded viewing and four days of video-on-demand for the five broadcast networks – ABC, CBS , CBS.A -0.08 % NBC, Fox and CW – averaged 9.1 million viewers, a 9% drop from last year’s 10 million viewers.\nWalt Disney Co. DIS -0.49 % ’s ABC and 21st Century Fox FOX -0.14 % ’s Fox have endured the steepest declines so far. ABC averaged 9.2 million viewers during the first week, down 11% from last year’s 10.3 million viewers. Fox tumbled 15% to 5.7 million viewers, compared to 6.8 million last year. Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.23 % ’s NBC fell 12% to 10.7 million from 12.1 million while CBS was off 2% to 13.1 million from 13.2 million.\nIt is worth noting that CBS benefited from a highly rated NFL game leading into the premiere of its Sunday lineup while NBC had a weak game this season compared to last season.\nAll of the big four networks were also down in the demographic of adults 18 to 49 versus the first week of last season.\nThe CW, a joint-venture between Time Warner Inc. TWX -1.15 % and CBS Corp., is the only network to enjoy big gains. In viewers, The CW was up 25% in premiere week to 1.2 million viewers versus 980,000 last season. In adults 18 to 49, The CW improved by 12%.\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:32:24.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
