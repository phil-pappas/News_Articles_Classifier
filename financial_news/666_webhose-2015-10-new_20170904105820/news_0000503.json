It will also include an electric bicycle that the company expects to be sold in densely populated global cities.\nBarra said GM executives will update investors on its plans in China and India later on Thursday.\nGM plans for 39 percent of its global sales to come from new or refreshed vehicles, up from 26 percent this year. Further, it said that the share of those new vehicles will be 40 percent of its total sales in 2017, 31 percent in 2018, and 40 percent in both 2019 and 2020.\nGM said it would increase its earnings per share, but did not give specifics. The company's share prices has recently fallen below $30 per share and has been trading below its $33 IPO price.\nBarra said she has not had any further contact with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV . Several months ago, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne sent Barra an email saying he wanted the two companies to merge, a notion Barra has consistently said she and the company's board of directors are not interested in.\n\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\nGM Mary Barra", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:53:58.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
