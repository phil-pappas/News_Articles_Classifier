View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151022006267/en/ Misfit's Shine 2. (Photo: Business Wire) Shine 2 tracks activity and sleep more accurately with a 3-axis accelerometer and newly added 3-axis magnetometer . Users can now easily see progress and tell time in a halo of rainbow-colored lights, or get motivated with Misfit Move, a feature that encourages you to be active with a vibrational nudge. Text and call notifications and a silent vibe alarm are also new with Shine 2. Shine 2 incorporates more advanced hardware and firmware — which means dramatically improved touch responsiveness with capacitive sensing technology, faster syncing, and extended Bluetooth range. Its 12 lights display over 16 million colors and are bright enough to be seen in direct sunlight. Compatible with Misfit Link, the groundbreaking software experience, Shine 2 is more than just an activity tracker — it’s now a remote to connect with the world around you. Communicate with friends, turn your lights on, change your music, take a selfie, and more, all with a triple tap. Shine 2 references Shine’s original iconic design but features an even thinner aircraft-grade aluminum body, while retaining its signature 6-month battery life, 50 meters water resistance, and modular shape. Wear it anywhere, all the time, without having to charge it. “We’ve packed a lot into Shine 2, adding more functionality into an even smaller form factor with the same battery life,” said Adam Mack, Misfit’s Director of Mechanical Design. “We didn’t compromise on craftsmanship or the user experience.” Shine 2 comes in Rose Gold and Carbon Black, is now available for purchase on misfit.com, and will be available in retail locations in November for a suggested retail price of ₹ 7999 INR.
