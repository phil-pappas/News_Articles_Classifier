A mixture of tax cuts and fiscal rectitude have made the Kiwi Prime Minister very popular. Matt Duncan Share on twitter by Tony Walker\nLate this week Australians will have had an opportunity to gauge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull against a gold standard of regional leaders, and to address the question of just what sort of leader Turnbull will prove to be.\nSo far we've had a lot of waffle about the need to be \"agile\" and other such bromides. Turnbull might be said to have displayed considerable agility in managing a bloodless coup against a first-term prime minister, but whether this will translate into effective government is another matter.\nTurnbull's meeting with New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key will be a more than usually significant moment for the new incumbent, given Key's successes as a centre-right leader who has a reputation for plain speaking, and who has delivered commendable outcomes in tax and welfare reform.\nAmong early remarks after seizing the Liberal leadership, Turnbull asserted that if there was to be a model for the Turnbull era it would be Key.\nWhat this tells us in part is that for much of the past decade Australian governments have been so inept that a reasonably performing New Zealand administration looks stellar by comparison.\n\"My firm belief is that to be a successful leader … you have to be able to bring people with you by respecting their intelligence in the manner you explain things. John Key has been able to achieve significant economic reform in New Zealand by doing just that,\" Turnbull said at his first press conference.\nFrom the beginning, Key recognised New Zealand had an expenditure and tax problem, with taxes having risen quite a bit under his predecessor Helen Clark. While he raised New Zealand's GST in his first term to 15 per cent from 12.5 per cent, he offset these increases by reducing marginal income tax rates and company tax, so that most people would not feel out of pocket.\n Returned to surplus Key ran a slightly bigger deficit in his first years, but this week it was confirmed that New Zealand returned to surplus in the June quarter. This represents quite an achievement over the past seven years.\nTurnbull will be judged by his ability to frame an economic debate around tax and welfare reform, allied with a pressing need to engage in budget repair. Boldness is required, as demonstrated by Key.\nIn a speech to the Liberal Party's think tank, the Menzies Research Centre, earlier in 2015, New Zealand's Finance Minister Bill English used the phrase \"incremental radicalism\" to describe English-Key economic reforms.\nTurnbull could do worse than adopt this approach, and even the New Zealand phraseology.\nAt the end of his first month in office the Prime Minister remains very much a work in progress, striving to avoid missteps that might enable his critics inside and outside Parliament to pounce – and pounce they will if he yields to his progressive heart.\nOne of the parliamentary party's more literate members, who resides on its conservative flank but is a Turnbull supporter, says the new Prime Minister \"remains a work on notice\".\nThe honeymoon continues, thanks partly to a lacklustre alternative, but such a happy state of affairs will not be open-ended. In his quest for role models Turnbull might look beyond Key to Britain's David Cameron and his Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne.\nUnaccountable surrender In its first term the Cameron government set about budget repair with conviction, but at the same time cleaved as much as possible to the moderate middle ground. Tony Abbott's unaccountable surrender of that terrain and thus his leadership will be debated by historians long into the future.\nBefore the end of 2015 Turnbull will have plenty of opportunities to get the measure of fellow world leaders of relatively like mind, including US President Barak Obama and probable new Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau's Liberals appear headed for election victory on October 19.\nTrudeau's liberalism will sit comfortably with Turnbull's, in contrast to the conservatism of probable outgoing Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who shares Abbott's resistance to the idea of man-made climate change.\nTurnbull will attend a slew of international gatherings by the end of 2015, including a meeting of the G20 scheduled for November in Atalya, south-western Turkey, in the lead-up to the Paris conference on climate change in December.\nThese gatherings will enable us to get a fix on where he stands on the political spectrum relative to his peers. But none of this will amount to much if he squibs the need for a good dose of Keysian incremental radicalism on the economy.\nTony Walker is the AFR's international editor", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@tonywalker1"], "published": "2015-10-16T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:04:09.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
