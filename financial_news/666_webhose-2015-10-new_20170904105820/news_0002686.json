I worked part time while going to school, and used my parents' credit card. I think I can get a credit card on my own, but my folks will guarantee the card if necessary. The trouble is that I'm snowed with all the literature that I have accumulated in my search for the best card for me. I need the card for all the many little things that I buy. I don't need a lot of credit - $2,500 will do nicely. I don't need a bunch of airplane miles, because I won't be traveling any long distances. I don't care about interest rates because I'll be paying my balance in full each month. Any suggestions on where to go?\nWHAT HARRY SAYS: There are almost as many outfits that recommend cards as there are issuers. I have a friend who is constantly looking for cards that give him a signing bonus of airline miles. Once he fulfills the card's requirements (usually a minimum amount of charges), he cancels the card. But you're looking for the best possible card for you.\nRemember, you may not qualify for all the cards because of your lack of a credit history. Some creditors won't accept guarantees. CitiCards has a Double Cash card that gives you a 2 percent rebate on all purchases.\nIf you do a lot of shopping at Target, they have a store card that gives you back 5 percent of all store purchases. You may have seen ads for even better deals.
