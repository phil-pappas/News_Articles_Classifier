The proposed changes are detailed in a citywide zoning plan currently making its way through the public-review process.The reforms are geared toward tackling a fundamental problem facing the city: too many singles; not enough singles' apartments. Nearly half of the city's population is estimated to be unmarried, spanning a wide range of ages and demographics. Yet only about 7% of the city's housing stock is studios, and about 35% are one-bedrooms.\"You can't deny the data,\" said Sarah Watson, deputy director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, which has been pushing for more flexibility in unit sizes. \"This mismatch causes all sorts of economic distortions.\"The city hopes to eliminate the current 400-square-foot minimum apartment size regulation that still applies to some housing types, but is seen as outdated. In fact, there has been an industry consensus that smaller units easily can provide desirable living conditions. One alternative is playing out in Kips Bay on East 27th Street, where 65 units of modular micro-apartments are being stacked one on top of another (pictured). In addition to market-rate units, the building will offer simple living for veterans and low-income residents. Cuomo vs. de Blasio: Uber edition \nGov. Andrew Cuomo expressed sup-port for a registry to license drivers using apps like Uber, a move that would limit the city's ability to regulate such services and possibly allow Uber to expand statewide. Israel and New York \nNew York and Jerusalem will partner to develop cybersecurity programs aimed at protecting city water supplies from terrorists. The U.S. reported a 50% increase in cyberattacks on infrastructure since 2012. Nonunion car washes foaming at the mouth \nA group of car-wash owners sued the city over a policy requiring nonunionized car washes to put up $150,000 wage bonds before getting their licenses, while union shops have to post only $30,000. The group said the policy is illegal; the city's Law Department said the rule protects low-wage workers. Gun laws constitutional DATA POINT Randolph Holder was the fourth NYPD police officer shot and killed since December, compared with eight in the last decade \nA federal appeals court upheld core parts of gun-control laws passed by New York and Connecticut in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy. Judges ruled that a ban on semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines did not violate the Second Amendment, but struck down a provision banning gun owners with 10-round magazines from loading them with more than seven bullets. Time Inc. Ripped \nAll You will be the first magazine at Time Inc. to fold during the tenure of CEO Joe Ripp. Though the 11-year-old title once had the ninth-largest readership in the U.S., the New York Post reported that with declining circulation and revenue, it was costing Time $5 million a year. Hamptons demand takes a dip \nThird-quarter sales of luxury homes in the Hamptons dropped 16% from the same period last year. The real estate market there had been hot during the past several years, as Wall Street profits began climbing back to prerecession levels. Pier deal \nMayor Bill de Blasio announced a deal, to be approved by the City Council, to sell Pier 40's development rights to turn a three-block stretch of dilapidated buildings in the West Village into a housing complex, with almost a third of its units set aside as affordable. The sale would generate $100 million for the Hudson River Park Trust to fix the rundown pier. K2 criminalized \nThe mayor signed into law regulations that criminalize the sale and production of the \"synthetic marijuana\" K2, also known as \"spice.\" K2 has caused at least one death in New York City and has ravaged a community of homeless youths in East Harlem. Wolfgang Puck's first New York restaurant \nCelebrity chef Wolfgang Puck announced the opening of his first New York eatery.
