ADVERTISEMENT “So I'm convinced as the people sit down and take the time to go through it in detail, that they'll come to a positive judgment,” he said on \"CNN’S Fareed Zakaria GPS.\"\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last week in an interview with PBS \"NewsHour\" host Judy Woodruff that, from what she's learned about it, she is not in favor of TPP. \nZakaria pointed out that the Democratic front-runner has publicly supported the TPP 45 times and backed the agreement while part of the Obama administration. \n“I think the key thing is to focus on having the deal on the table, having people have a chance to read it, to get into the details, so that they can make a judgment about it,” Froman said. \n“We're convinced it's a very high standard deal,” he said. \nFroman pushed back against arguments from other presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump who say the TPP will ship U.S. jobs overseas. \n“The Asia-Pacific region will have 3 billion middle-class consumers in the next 15 years, and for us to be successful, for us to keep businesses here, to manufacture, to grow things here and ship them abroad, we need access to those markets,” he said. \n“That's how we're going to grow good paying jobs here in the United States.” \nPresident Obama has a thin margin of support in Congress and will need to work over the next several months to convince wary lawmakers, especially congressional Democrats, that TPP is a deal worth supporting even in an election year. \nFroman, who said the deal is aimed at knocking down trade barriers across the Asia-Pacific where some of the world’s fastest growing economies are emerging, isn't intended to contain China. \nThe TPP deal is a “key part of the rebalancing towards Asia strategy” and it is not directed against any country, including China, he said. \n“It's one of the most concrete manifestations of that policy,” he said. \n“And it underscores that the United States is a Pacific power, that we’re going to be involved in the region, and that our partners in the region very much want us to be embedded with them, economically and strategically.” \nInstead, he said “TPP is directed at establishing high standards for the region, rules of the road that reflect our interests and our values.” \n“And it's meant to encourage other countries to raise their game as well.\" \nThere are a handful of other countries, including South Korea, that have expressed interest in eventually joining the deal. \nFroman also countered arguments that the TPP talks between the United States and 11 other nations were mostly done in secret, a chief complaint of Democrats and labor unions opposed to the agreement. \nIt is \"not all secret,\" he said. \nHe said that the TPP, which was completed in Atlanta last Monday, is an international negotiation \"and you've got to have some ability to negotiate discreetly with other parties to get to the best possible outcome.\" \n\"We've put out a lot of information about it along the way, and we're looking forward to getting the text released as soon as possible,\" Froman said. \n\"We hope to get it out within the next 30 days.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:27:05.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
