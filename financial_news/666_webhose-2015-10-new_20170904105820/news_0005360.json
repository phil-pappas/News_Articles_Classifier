Earlier this month, Ford said it will invest $1.8 billion over the next five years to research autonomous driving and other smart-car features for the China market. \n\"I do think that industry is at an inflection point for massive change, not just evolutionary change,\" Cook said at the the Wall Street Journal's WSJDLive technology conference.

Consensus is for the No. 1 U.S. carmaker to report a 23% jump in earnings per share to $1.19 on a 1% drop in revenue to $38.8 billion. \nGM shares were up 0.9% on the stock market today . Ford rallied 0.5%, and Apple gained 1.8%. Mobileye was down 3%. \nTesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) are also developing autonomous car technology. Tesla last Thursday rolled out its latest software download, which included Autopilot , a capability that lets the flagship Model S steer within a lane and change lanes with the tap of a turn signal, among other features. \nBoston Consulting Group earlier this year forecast that self-driving features could represent a $42 billion market by 2025. It also predicted that partly autonomous vehicles, \"powered by surprisingly strong consumer interest,\" are likely to hit the road in large numbers by 2017. \nFollow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:32:55.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
