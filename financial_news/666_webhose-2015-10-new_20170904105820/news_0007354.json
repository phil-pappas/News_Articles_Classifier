He will be sentenced next month. \nHis plea comes after Andrew Robinson, a former director of Strategic Planning Group jailed in July for six years over a $2.7 million fraud, pleaded guilty to charges of providing a broking service without being registered, knowingly making a false statement in his application to become an authorised financial adviser and two charges under the Financial Reporting Act of making false statements in the SPGI financial statements. He previously owned SPGI. \nRobinson was jailed after pleading guilty to Serious Fraud Office charges that he stole $2.7 million of investor funds to repay other investors and cover various business and personal expenses, then made false statements in investment reports to hide the picture from investors. \nThe charges followed investigations by the Financial Markets Authority and the Serious Fraud Office into the activities of SPG and SPGI that began in 2012. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:32:40.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
