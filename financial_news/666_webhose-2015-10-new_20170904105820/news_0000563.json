Lawmakers, who meet every two years, aren't due back in Bismarck until January 2017 — unless called back by the governor. \n\"I think that is highly, highly unlikely,\" Gov. Jack Dalrymple told The Associated Press. \nNorth Dakota's surplus stash of cash, largely from past oil bounty, \"would certainly carry us through anything that would come along,\" he said. \nThe Republican governor said there is no need to call for a revised revenue forecast or budget rejiggering anytime soon. \n\"We're not really going to spend much time on it until we see a chronic trend going on,\" Dalrymple said. \"Missing monthly forecasts is not that unusual. We have before and recovered it completely later.\" \nNorth Dakota ended its last two-year budget cycle with $130 million more than expected due largely to an unforeseen uptick in oil development earlier this year, Sharp said. \nThe Legislature's spending plan for the 2015-17 budget cycle that began July 1 is a record $14.4 billion, up from $13.7 billion in the previous two-year budget cycle. \nSlumping oil prices prompted the Republican-led Legislature to re-evaluate spending plans throughout this year's session, though it did not dampen spending greatly, with lawmakers giving the nod to such things as a new $5 million governor's residence and $1.5 million to purchase a rare mummified dinosaur. \nThe Legislature planned its budget on analysts' projections that assumed North Dakota oil will fetch between $45 to $65 per barrel in the 2015-17 biennium, based on prices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. North Dakota sweet crude was bringing about $46 a barrel Friday but has lingered at or below the lower end of the threshold since the budget cycle began, Sharp said. \nLow oil prices mean fewer drill rigs operating in western North Dakota's oil patch. The state's budget assumed that the number of oil rigs could drop to as low as 90 to 95 during the next two budget years, before rebounding. \nNorth Dakota had 66 rigs operating on Friday, down from 189 a year ago. Oil production, however, has remained stable at about 1.1 million barrels daily, second only to Texas. \nEach active drill rig represents about 170 jobs in the oil patch, said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. \nSharp, the state's budget director, said the $60 million drop in forecast tax revenue from July through September comes almost entirely from weakened sales tax revenue, which provides the biggest share of the budget for North Dakota government. And the decline in sales tax revenue is directly related to the decrease in oil rigs in the state, she said. \nDalrymple said the drop in state revenue \"appears very traceable to sales tax in western North Dakota because there is a lot less material being purchased and lot less services being rendered because of the slowdown.\" FILE - This June 12, 2014 file photo shows four pumps at an oil production facility in Watford City, N.D.
