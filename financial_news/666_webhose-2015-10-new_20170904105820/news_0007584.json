Michele Mossop But the bank kept it brief and simply noted that \"equity market volatility has continued, but the functioning of financial markets generally has not, to date, been impaired\".\nLikewise, when it came to the Federal Reserve, and the first rate hike in more than a decade that seems to be causing so much angst, the RBA just noted that the Fed is expected to raise rates \"over the period ahead, but some other major central banks are continuing to ease policy\".\nBusiness as usual. At around 400 words, the statement was brief although not quite as short as the 316 words that were used in June 2008 and April 2009 during the wild days of the financial crisis.\n Indeed, some of the longest RBA statements have contained more than 700 words, but maybe the bank took notice of the latest piece of research from Christopher Neely, the assistant vice-president and economist at the St Louis branch of the US Federal Reserve.\nIn trying to work out why the S&P 500 sold off so much after the Federal Reserve didn't hike rates in September, Neely's bank did its own research and came up with a very simple answer.\nAfter dismissing the idea that the Fed had \"significantly superior information about the economy\" that seemed to spook investors and started the selling, the bank pointed out that instead the sell-off might have been kick-started by the lofty valuation levels of the S&P 500.\nA 'fairly unremarkable event' After all, at around a multiple of 20-times, the price-earnings ratio of the index was still fairly high when compared with the historical average of about 15.5-times earnings.\nBut that didn't seem to convince Neely either.\nInstead, he pointed out that the 1.6 per cent fall in the S&P 500, after the Fed kept rates steady, was a \"fairly unremarkable event\" for the index given that it \"rose or fell by at least 1.6 per cent on about 14 per cent of days from 2005 to 2015\".\nNo, his take on it all implies that perhaps no one should have read too much into the sell-off because really as the old saying goes, \" markets go up, and markets go down.\"\nSimple, really.\nNeely, however, didn't mention the other option: that sometimes they stay the same.\nBut that's a rare event in financial markets and almost on cue it seemed that traders were happy to bet the next move by the RBA might just be a hike.\nAnd if that's the case – and the Federal Reserve isn't in a position to hike even if they want to – then it can mean only one thing.\nBuy the Australian dollar.\nAnd so of course it went to above US71¢ for the first time in about a month .\nThe local sharemarket didn't take kindly to the whole idea and although the major S&P ASX 200 index closed in the black, it couldn't manage to hold on to the big gains it made during the early part of the session on Tuesday.\nMaybe investors should ready themselves for some more volatility. The fear index, or the Vix, which measures volatility in the S&P index through options, is now at 24 points.\nThat compares with its average level of 14 in 2014 and around 17 so far this year although according to Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to Allianz, the index has spent twice as many days above 20 so far in 2015 than it has in the past two years put together.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:12:02.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
