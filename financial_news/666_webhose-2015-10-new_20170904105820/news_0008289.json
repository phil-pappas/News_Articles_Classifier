The Korean won was 0.39 percent lower, the Thai baht eased 0.22 percent and Singapore's dollar was down 0.13percent. \nThe also greenback rose to 119.18 yen from 118.88 yen in New York as pick-up in confidence on trading floors saw dealers move out of safer assets. \nThe euro was at $1.1369 compared with $1.1376 in US trade and well down from $1.1480 earlier Thursday in Asia with after a European Central Bank board member said eurozone inflation was undershooting its target. \nThe comments led the speculation the ECB will widen its already huge stimulus programme. \nOn share markets, expectations the Bank of Japan will soon increase its own monetary easing scheme helped the Nikkei to close the morning session 1.36 percent higher. \nHong Kong added 0.79 percent and Sydney gained 0.89 percent. \nShanghai was 1.20 percent higher, with dealers betting on China's leaders announcing a new round of measures to shore up the stuttering economy. \nWhile weak readings this week on trade and inflation initially sent stocks lower, investors now see the possibility of another interest rate cut -- after five since November -- or other monetary loosening. \nThis week the government announced plans to reform the country's sprawling state-owned enterprises in the telecoms and utilities sectors as it looks to improve efficiency. \n\"The central bank has loosened its tap on liquidity and the SOE reform will continue through the year,\" said Wei Wei, an analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. in Shanghai. \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) ?s a good time window for stocks now and the rebound will probably carry on.\" \nHowever, analysts are pessimistic about the release of July-September economic growth figures Monday, with a survey. \nA survey of 19 economists by AFP found a median forecast of expansion of 6.8 percent, which would be the worst since early 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:09:28.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
