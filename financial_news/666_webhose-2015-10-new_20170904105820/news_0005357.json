Treasuries and German government bonds since September, particularly in the run-up to the syndication. \n\"The demand is pretty strong. We were sort of expecting that because the sector had cheapened quite a lot and there are plenty of reasons why one should be involved at the long end of the curve,\" said Vatsala Datta, UK rate strategist at RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) . \n\"By any measure, this is a pretty big book size and unsurprisingly the DMO (Debt Management Office) has upped the target as well.\" \nThe syndication needed to raise around 4.5 billion pounds to meet the debt agency's target for conventional bond issuance via syndication for the 2015/16 financial year. \nThe bookrunners on the deal are BofA Merrill Lynch, JPMorgan, RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Santander. \n($1 = 0.6456 pounds) (Reporting by Ana Nicolaci da Costa; editing by William Schomberg)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:38:04.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
