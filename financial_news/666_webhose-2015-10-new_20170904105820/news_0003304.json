The company has introduced another top-of-the-line tour – the Reality Show Tour, where a camera crew films clients while they see all the best sights of LA, filming their reactions and taking their interviews just like on their favorite reality shows.\nIt’s an exclusive opportunity only offered by LA Insider Tours, and it gives an unprecedented behind-the-scenes view of a true reality show production. In addition clients will find that they are treated just like celebrities as they travel the streets of LA with camera crew in tow. “We were surprised and amused by how people on the streets gawked at our family while we were filming,” said Steve Kasher, owner of LA Insider Tours, referring to a test run they did with a real family. “People really thought they were celebrities. The family loved it.”\nClients may choose a four-hour or an eight-hour option for their reality show tour. Every tour is completely customisable which means they get to make the day – and their show – their own. From the beaches to the Hollywood Sign to Downtown LA, all of LA is theirs to explore. The best part is, they will get a copy of their reality show, complete with opening credits, name graphics, music tracks and more after heading home. It’s a real piece of Hollywood they can share with friends and relive over and over again.\nIn addition to the Reality Show Tour, LA Insider Tours offers a variety of tours to meet anyone’s needs. Totally private and customisable, each tour is designed to maximise the LA experience and create a fun and memorable day for everyone. Other tours include the All LA in a Day Tour, The Hollywood Experience Tour and the family favorite, the Teens and ‘Tweeners Tour.\n 09, 2015 5:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:33:19.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
