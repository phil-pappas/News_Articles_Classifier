ADVERTISEMENT The Kentucky Republican has previously waded into the fray to stop the nation from defaulting. But now protecting a narrow majority, McConnell doesn’t seem inclined to take the lead with only two weeks left before the debt-ceiling deadline.\nThe GOP-led House, meanwhile, is struggling to find a Speaker to succeed Boehner and there is little to no consensus on how to pass a debt bill. \nGOP senators say there is no point in passing a clean debt-limit bill and taking fire from conservatives while it remains unclear what can pass the House. \nWhile a clean extension of borrowing authority, with no policy amendments, would likely pass the Senate, it would be a tough vote for many Republicans. \nAllowing Boehner to move a clean debt-limit bill first would give political cover to Senate Republicans facing tough reelections. Boehner is aiming to leave the House later this month, though speculation is rampant that he will be forced to stay into November as he tries to find a successor. \nBoehner told Fox News on Tuesday afternoon that he is weighing several options for raising the debt limit. \n“I’ve made clear we’re not going to default on our debt. There are several paths forward that we’re going to lay out for the members, but we’re going to find some path forward here in the next few days, so we’re going to move,” he said. \nHe added that passing a clean debt-limit measure “would be difficult.” \n“We’re going to wait and see what the House does on the subject,” McConnell told reporters. He said the Senate would “respond accordingly.” \nThe tight-lipped GOP leader has kept his plans secret, even from fellow Republican senators, who say they are ignorant of what the game plan is to avoid a federal default after the Nov. 3 deadline set by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. \nThe debt limit did not come up for discussion during a GOP conference lunch meeting Tuesday, according to Senate sources. \nSome Republicans raised doubts about whether Nov. 3 is a drop-dead deadline or just a somewhat arbitrary date selected to ratchet up pressure on Republicans. They speculated Lew could still use budget maneuvers to buy more time. \nLew has said the U.S. will only have whatever cash is on hand to pay its bills after that date. \nMcConnell declined to say at Tuesday’s press conference if anything other than a clean debt-limit increase could pass the Senate or to comment on whether Boehner has privately discussed a timeline for House action. \nThe debt-limit showdown could have a significant affect on the 2016 elections. Faced with a daunting electoral map, Republicans are battling challengers in blue and swing states, and McConnell is hoping to retain the Senate majority by protecting his vulnerable incumbents. \nSenate Republican Whip John Cornyn (Texas) said there is no backup plan to move clean debt-ceiling increase in the next two weeks if the House fails to act. \n“We’re waiting on the House,” he said. “That’s the plan.” \nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) argued the plan to let the House proceed first is motivated by constitutional principle, not political pragmatism. \nHe said “money does have to originate in the House,” referencing Article I of the Constitution, which states all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House. \n“There are ways around that, but basically I think that’s a good way to start,” he added. \nThe Senate last passed a clean debt-limit bill in February 2014, when 12 Republicans voted with every Democrat to end a filibuster. Eleven of those Republicans, including McConnell, still serve in Congress. \nCornyn, Hatch, and Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), Susan Collins (Maine), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Mark Kirk (Ill.), John McCain (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John Thune (S.D.) also voted to advance the clean debt-limit increase last year. \nNo Republican voted for the measure on final passage, however. \nSo far, only Kirk, who is facing a tough reelection in President Obama’s home state, has called for moving debt-limit legislation without add-ons. \n“We need to do a clean debt limit and make sure that we run the government in a very orderly fashion,” he said. “When we’re given the honor of having a majority, then we need to govern well.” \n“A vote on a clean debt limit is a very tough vote. I’ve never voted for a clean debt-limit increase,” said a GOP senator who requested anonymity. “We’re not going to do what we did in the past if we don’t know if it can pass the House. We’re going to let the House go first. It may be a simple plan, but it’s our plan.” \nIf a clean debt-limit increase becomes the fallback, as many expect, McConnell could risk missing the deadline if he waits too long for the House to act. \nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a Tea Party favorite who has repeatedly accused GOP leaders of not driving a harder bargain on government funding and debt-limit legislation, declined to say whether he would agree to waive procedural requirements that can take days. \n“It is not my practice to disclose what procedural tools I will use on each legislative fight ahead of time,” the 2016 presidential candidate said. \nLew told Republican and Democratic members of the Finance Committee on Tuesday morning that the administration does not plan to negotiate any fiscal reforms in exchange for increased borrowing authority. \n“He’s made it very clear that they have no interest in doing anything on entitlements,” Thune, the third-ranking member of Senate Republican leadership, told reporters. “He just said that they don’t think there are the votes up here to do anything on any of the stuff that they’ve suggested in the past or that has been mutually discussed between Republicans and Democrats in the past. \n“They can’t get that through the House, can’t get it through the Senate,” Thune added. \nLew noted that Obama twice tried to negotiate a grand bargain with Boehner, proposing a new formula for lowering Social Security payments and increasing the eligibility age for Medicare, but the Speaker couldn’t deliver enough votes in the House. \nSome Republican senators on Tuesday privately acknowledged there is virtually no chance of getting fiscal reforms attached to debt-limit legislation in part because GOP leaders still have not made any clear fiscal demands. They say those demands should have been laid out weeks or months ago. \nOthers say the White House obviously has no interest in negotiating. \nSen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), a former House member, said, “I know Boehner has been talking to the White House. Boehner would like to have a big deal, but the White House right now is playing small ball.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:08:21.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
