At a time when investors were fleeing the market Sowerby was ploughing money in via his Blue Sky Alternative Investments fund, which funded small to medium firms.\nGetting his company off the ground during the chaos of the financial crisis led to many sleepless nights, but Brisbane-based Sowerby, says that self-belief is in his DNA.\n“It’s a question of backing yourself and your own ability,” he says, although he also credits the support of his “smarter and stronger” wife Heidi.\nSowerby is also a firm believer of crashing through your comfort zones – repeatedly. His most recent “grand final” of a challenge was completing a swim of the English Channel.\nMark Sowerby had to swim through the busiest shipping lane in the world.

And that is right,” he says.\nTowards the end of his 14-hour swim, it was essential to sprint for at least 45 minutes or else risk being swept off course and not finishing. Sowerby managed to sprint.\nSowerby had to sprint the final 45 minutes of his 14 hour swim to avoid being swept off course.

Things do go wrong, but you use that experience to see how things might work next time.”\nSowerby found that controlling the mind was key to processing the fears that kept him awake at night during the nerve-racking early years of starting his company. By breaking challenges down into ‘bite-sized’ chunks and resisting looking too far into the future he managed keep his nerve and avoid a crisis of confidence while investing his own and other people’s money successfully. Blue Sky grew its market capitalisation by 216 per cent in 2013 to $90 million and is expected to have $2 billion under management, giving an annual compounded return of 20 per cent to investors by 2017.\nFace up to your fears: Dr Barbara Grace, of the School of Modern Psychology, also uses a water analogy to explain self-belief – imagining the choices a sailor is faced with when a smooth sail suddenly becomes rough and difficult.\n“The sailor has two options,” she says. “Change course to somewhere that’s easier to get to, or carry on. Most people change course, head for a safe harbour and tell themselves it was just bad luck or poor conditions.”\nThe temptation is to believe the problem is external. What sets apart those who are able to conquer challenges of self-belief is a willingness to face up to fear and the possibility of failure, she says.\nGet comfortable with feeling uncomfortable: “The emotions that arise when facing something really scary – like bungy jumping – trigger a complex domino-effect of hormone production that releases cortisol into the blood stream, raising blood pressure and heart rate. Usually, we equate this feeling with fear and we naturally want to retreat.”\nHowever, some people, including extreme sports enthusiasts, equate this rush of hormones with joy and excitement rather than fear – managing to ‘re-frame’ the feeling.\n“To get around the flight response it’s important to become comfortable with feeling uncomfortable,” Grace adds. “Breaking patterns around how we code these emotions is key to altering perception and ultimately breaking limiting beliefs,” Grace adds.\nTakeaways\nJack Delosa, founder of the entrepreneur community Entourage, has three top tips for avoiding a crisis of confidence:\n● The early days of any business are going to be a rollercoaster ride , recognise that one minute you will be up and confident, the next you will be challenged and feeling down. The bad times will pass.\n● Don’t compare yourself to others. Whether you’re Richard Branson or someone on their first day in business - we’re all making it up as we go along.\n● Emotional fortitude is something that develops like a muscle. The more you carry, the stronger you become. Take each challenge as it comes and pick up the wisdom in every crisis.\nMark Sowerby after his 14 hour swim across the English Channel.
