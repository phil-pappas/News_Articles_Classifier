Toyota fell 1.7% and VW ended 3.9% lower. Tesla finished 1.7% higher, and Apple rallied 0.2%. Mobileye dipped 0.1%.\nKelley Blue Book Senior Vehicle Evaluations Editor Richard Homan called the Volt a \"a completely useable hybrid\" because it can go all electric or run on gasoline. He also noted the Volt's all-electric range has increased to 50 miles from 34 miles last year, while the price has come down.\nHoman said the Mirai is \"kind of like driving a possible future,\" adding that more fuel cell infrastructure could be built in the future.\n\"Whether it's EVs or fuel cell cars, all the manufacturers have big plans for future cars,\" he told IBD.\nIn Kelley Blue Book's luxury category, finalists were winnowed down to the Acura ILX, Lexus GS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. In the performance category, the revamped Chevrolet Camaro, Chevrolet Corvette, Ford (NYSE: F ) GT350, Mazda MX-5 Miata and Scion FR-S are finalists.\nAmong pickup trucks, Ford's F-150, the best selling vehicle of any type in the U.S. for more than three decades running, made the finalist list.
