That is not the case with this find, which is remarkably complete.\nThe skull, from a titanosaur, a type of sauropod, was found at a dig site in eastern Spain in 2007 and experts have spent the last few years studying it, ‘mirror.co.uk’ reported.\n“This is such a rare finding that is why it is so exciting. Usually we find vertebrae or other bones, very rarely the braincase and this one is complete,” Knoll said.\n“Currently we know very little about the brain of dinosaurs. Research such as this is fundamental if we want to get an idea about the cognitive skills of these animals or if they had keen hearing or good eyesight and plenty of other information,” Knoll said.\nThe titanosaur lived about 72 million years ago. Like all sauropods it was four-legged with a long neck and a long tail and herbivorous.\nIt was a distant relative of Diplodocus but, with about 14m in length, was only half its size. The study shows that its brain fitted in a diminutive cavity of only 6.3 cm in length.\nKnoll, who made the first digital reconstruction of a dinosaur endocranial cavity in the late 1990s, said: “In a few years’ time if more finds like this come to light and, above all, if they are studied with the modern imaging technologies then we could really start to understand more about dinosaur brains.”\n 12, 2015 5:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:16:13.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
