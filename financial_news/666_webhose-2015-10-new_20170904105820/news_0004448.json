For India, affordable healthcare is a challenge and for that access to medicines is important,” said an industry expert.\nAs per the current policy, 100 per cent FDI is permitted in the existing pharma companies through the approval route.\nThe Committee had said that the government should impose a blanket ban on any FDI in brown field pharma projects.\nIt had also suggested for measures to stop any further takeover/acquisition of domestic pharma units.\nIndia is recognised as a major generic medicine hub of the world. The market size of the country’s pharma industry is estimated at over USD 20 billion.\nIn 2008, Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo had bought out the country’s largest drug maker Ranbaxy for USD 4.6 billion.\nUS-based Abbot Laboratories had acquired Piramal Health Care’s domestic business for USD 3.7 billion. Another US company Mylan bought Matrix Lab while Dabur Pharma was acquired by Singapore’s Fresenius and France’s Sanofi Aventis purchased Shanta Biotech and Orchid Chemicals by US-based Hospira.\nAs per estimates, over 96 per cent of the total FDI in the sector between April 2012 and April 2013 came into the brownfield pharma.\n 11, 2015 11:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:49:53.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
