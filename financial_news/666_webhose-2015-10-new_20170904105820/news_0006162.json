Thereafter, in a relatively short time frame, engineering designs of the CSRV system parts to match the 5.9 liter gen set engine will be developed and manufactured. Then the unit will be reassembled with the CSRV system incorporated. Cummins is to deliver to the Company two more generator sets. One industrial 250KW natural gas and one 35KW diesel unit. These power units will also be retrofitted with the Coates CSRV system. \nCompany President and CEO, Mr. George J.
