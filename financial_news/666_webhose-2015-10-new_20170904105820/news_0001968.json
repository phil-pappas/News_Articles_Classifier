Local Measure founder Jonathan Barouch had to admit he had been heading down the wrong path and change his company's focus. Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Jonathan Barouch was so confident about his social media startup he managed to ignore his clients for months before he had to face the fact that no one was going to pay for it.\nBarouch launched Roamz, a mobile app that gathered and showcased tweets and Facebook messages sent out in the same area, in 2011. But he would be forced to completely change the idea within 24 months.\n\"It was like the moment you realise your baby is ugly. You don't want to see it but after hundreds of comments you realise you can't lie to yourself about it any more. To be honest, it felt like I had been punched repeatedly in the guts,\" Barouch told Fairfax Media.\nInitially it had all the superficial characteristics of a winning idea: it attracted a quarter of a million users, the team raised $3.5 million in venture capital and it was covered by media sites from TechCrunch to Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal.\nBack in 2011 Jonathan Barouch was convinced he was on to a big thing with Roamz. Michele Mossop Business fundamentals But the real mechanics of a business â€“ keeping customers happy while making money, were lagging. The software was exciting. It collected social media posts and the team sold packages of this content to retailers, hospitality venues and events to promote their products or services.\nRoamz was getting meetings and running tens of demos every week, but few were resulting in sales. They were meeting with big brands such as Qantas and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, but many were already exhausted by the pace of change and pressure to embrace social media.\nAfter months of increasingly stressed meetings with his sales team and investors, Barouch realised his company was running out potential clients, and money.\nAround the Local Measure office, messages remind staff of the company's near failure. Supplied \"What we were offering just wasn't resonating. No one needed it. We just kept getting the same feedback, they wanted to use the data we were collecting in a different way,\" Barouch says.\nWhat customers wanted The breakthrough came after one of the United States largest retailers flew him over, listened to the pitch and said they were more interested in the anonymised data set and the insights into their clients and their feedback. Roamz's potential clients wanted a customer satisfaction tool, not another promotional one.\n\"I realised I had kept hearing it and just wasn't listening. It didn't fit everything we were talking about so we didn't realise how valuable it was,\" Barouch says.\nThe Roamz promotional strategy didn't help. The constant pursuit of media attention in lieu of customer validation produced an echo chamber of congratulatory hype that was hard to discount, even in the face of dwindling cash and clear customer feedback.\nPivot point \"I hate the word pivoting but we did. We took the technology, the team and completely changed the platform,\" Barouch says.\nAfter a few months in development, the sales team hit the streets again and the user base has exploded ever since. The newly rebranded Local Measure now counts six of the eight largest global hotel groups as clients, one of the western world's biggest shopping mall chains as well as Qantas and Dubai's government owned tourism company.\nThe team has doubled to 22 and expanded with offices in Sydney, Singapore, London and the east coast of the United States and Barouch says they are still very early in their development.\n\"We are starting to get the customer spread and volume of data that will make it possible to identify industry wide trends and benchmarks, which will be another service we can offer to our existing clients as we continue to grow.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:10:44.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
