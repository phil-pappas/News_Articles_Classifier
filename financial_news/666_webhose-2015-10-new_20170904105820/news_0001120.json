About Masimo Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) is the global leader in innovative noninvasive monitoring technologies. Our mission is to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care by taking noninvasive monitoring to new sites and applications. In 1995, the company debuted Masimo SET® Measure-through-Motion and Low Perfusion ™ pulse oximetry, which has been shown in multiple studies to significantly reduce false alarms and accurately monitor for true alarms.
