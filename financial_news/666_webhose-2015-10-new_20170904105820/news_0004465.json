Photo: The Awl screenshot As the digital publishing industry wrestles with the rise of ad blocking, one popular notion is that native ads will be the answer to the industry’s ills. Even Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has championed native ads as having the potential to make the Web more inviting for consumers.\nBut the big catch for publishers is that native ads are not necessarily immune to ad-blocking software.\nNative digital ads, while their execution varies across different websites, are typically designed to blend in with a site’s editorial look and feel. The ad units usually feature content paid for by a sponsor, rather than more overt ad messaging.\nIn many cases, such sponsored content ads are produced specifically for a website like BuzzFeed or Forbes. But as marketers and publishers have become more interested in this tactic, software and technology is increasingly being used to deliver native ads to multiple sites.\nThe fact that these ads are “served” across many sites using ad technology—instead of being “published” using an individual site’s editorial technology—leaves them vulnerable to ad blocking, say industry insiders.\n“A lot of people are calling for the adoption of more unobtrusive native advertising in place of standard network ads,” said Michael Macher, publisher at the culture-centric site TheAwl. “But native advertising companies that many indie publishers work with are increasingly using easy-to-block code snippets in order to operate at scale across the Web.”\nIn 2014, 95% of TheAwl’s native ad revenue came from custom content that was produced for advertisers and published directly on TheAwl, Mr. Macher said. However, this year, 95% of the company’s native ad revenue comes third-party native ad companies like Sharethrough and TripleLift, which can be susceptible to ad blocking, he said.\nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for what will trigger a native ad to get blocked by software that prevents ads from rendering. In some cases, sponsored content can be blocked on sites like BuzzFeed even if that content is displayed using BuzzFeed’s publishing technology.\nSimilarly, sponsored posts on Yahoo, which are displayed in the same stream of content where Yahoo distributes articles from the likes of Business Insider and Us Weekly, can be partially wiped out by ad-blocking software, found CMO Today. For example, a sponsored post on Yahoo from the publisher Buzzlie had its headline blocked by Adblock Plus, one of the more popular ad-blocking tools. In another case, the text of that sponsored post was blocked out, while the headline was still displayed.\nA sponsored post on Yahoo Sports Photo: Yahoo screenshot Yahoo and BuzzFeed declined to comment. An official from Buzzlie said he was concerned about ad blocking but hadn’t noticed an impact on Yahoo.\nOf course, both Yahoo and BuzzFeed are increasingly seeing their audiences grow on mobile apps, which are so far unscathed by ad blockers—unlike Web browsers on desktops and smartphones.\nStill, publishers are concerned about the financial impact from the growth of ad blocking on desktops and more recently the mobile Web. The fact that even native ads aren’t immune only increases their fears and raises more questions about how publishers will be able to afford to create content in a digital world.\nThe irony is that native ad companies say their products are designed to improve the online experience for consumers.\n“We started the business to make ads more respectful,” said Ari Lewine, co-founder of the native ad company TripleLift.\nMr. Lewine said that his business has yet to be hurt by ad blocking and continues to grow rapidly.\nBut some native ad network companies say they are hearing from their clients on this issue.\n“There is absolutely a lot of concern among publishers,” said Michael Russo, chief technology officer at Polar, which delivers native ads to media companies like The Washington Post. Some publishers are likely feeling the impact of ad blocking, while others are reading lots of headlines about the issue and wondering what it means for them, he said.\nA native ad on TheKnot.com Photo: TheKnot.com screenshot Jennifer Garrett, executive vice president of national sales at XO Group, which publishes sites like the wedding-focused The Knot and the pregnancy-centric The Bump, said so much content on her company’s sites falls into a gray area that she’s not sure what to watch for as ad blocking looms. Not only does the company work with TripleLift, but it also publishes sponsored articles and features thousands of wedding gowns and strollers that can be purchased.\n“It’s hard to tell what is happening [with ad blocking] from a technical standpoint,” she said. So far, the company’s ads haven’t been impacted, but “we’re definitely watching.”\nJustin Choi, chief executive at Nativo, which helps deliver native ads to numerous websites , said there’s been a spike in concern among his partners, which include Hearst Corp.’s newspapers and Time Inc. But few are reporting major declines in ad delivery. He’s working on a technical solution, though he declined to reveal too much about how it will work so as not to tip off ad-blocking companies.\nSeveral native ad companies are having conversations with major ad blockers about potentially paying to have their ads not be blocked, according to people familiar with the matter.\nBen Williams, head of operations and communications at Adblock Plus, said that native ads can indeed be blocked, but native advertising—if executed well—is generally preferable to other forms or online ads, in his opinion.\n“Native ads are very promising because their raison d’être is to not intrude,” he said. “But they must be labeled properly as an ad. If they’re just dressed up as editorial, that’s completely deceptive and completely unacceptable. However, labeled correctly, they can provide value for users and publishers.”\nHe said that some native ad companies that have gone through Adblock Plus’s process of ‘whitelisting,” joining a list of 700 companies that meet its criteria for “acceptable ads” and, therefore, don’t have their ads blocked.\nThe hope among some publishers is that more companies’ native ad products will be deemed acceptable. But others believe that the very concept of delivering supposedly “native” ads across hundreds of disparate sites using automated technology runs contrary to the whole point of native advertising.\n“It is insane to me that any publisher is doing programmatic in a native way,” said Mike Dyer, co-managing director and chief product and strategy officer for The Daily Beast.\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP171_awl_P_20151002135838.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP171_awl_J_20151002135838.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP348_knotad_F_20151002181451.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP165_Yahoos_F_20151002135439.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:47:45.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
