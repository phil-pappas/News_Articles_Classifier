The poor are getting relentlessly poorer. The regions are being left behind. The male working class are being tossed onto the scrapheap. \nThe private sector could never make up for the jobs lost in the public sector, and even if it could, the work created would be zero-hours , minimum wage, dead-end employment that was little better than slavery. \nThe Left, and indeed much of the centre, has elaborately created a whole series of arguments over the last few years about why the economy isn’t working for ordinary people anymore. \nThere is a problem, however, and it is becoming more and more glaringly obvious with every month that passes. \nNone of it is true. \nOne by one, the actual statistics are exposing each and every one of those charges as a myth. Real wages? Growing robustly. Employment? Going up all the time, and especially in the regions, and among men, who had been suffering the most. Full-time jobs? Those are rising as well. \nIn reality, all that has been happening is that a flexible labour market has been working just as it is meant to. In a recession, wages fall. In a recovery, they start to rise again. \nThat is going to be challenging for companies, who will find it a bit harder to keep profits rising. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will mean more automation , as workers become more expensive. But most of all it will be challenging for all the people who told us the system no longer worked because it seems to be doing just fine at the moment. \nRe-wind a few years, and there were dire warnings that the poor were getting relentlessly poorer. \nIn a speech in July last year, Ed Balls (remember him) laid into the coalition government for presiding over the steepest fall in real wages since Disraeli was Prime Minister. \n“By 2015 working people will have seen the biggest fall in wages of any Parliament since 1874,” he thundered. \nIn 2011, his boss Ed Miliband warned of a “quiet crisis” as families struggled to keep with the rising cost of living, and argued that the “squeezed middle” was losing out as only the rich got richer. \nIn 2013, the TUC launched a ‘Britain Needs A Pay Rise’ campaign , arguing that the ordinary workers had suffered a 7.5pc pay cut since the recession. \nA whole parade of left-leaning economists and think tanks queued up to explain why a broken system meant that wages were likely to stagnate, as company profits rose and greedy plutocrats sucked what wealth there was out of the system. \nNone of those predictions look so clever now. On Wednesday, employment and earning figures showed once again how robust the UK’s recovery has become . Year on year, wages are now rising by 3pc annually, including bonuses - and by 2.8pc if those are excluded. \nIn total, there are more than 31 million people in work, a record figure, and 359,000 more than a year ago. The employment rate that is the percentage of people who could work who are in jobs hit 73.6pc, the highest since records began in 1971, and one of the highest rates in the developed world. Figures don’t get much stronger than that. \nIt is not just the headline numbers that count. There are two ways of improving your living standards. One is to get a pay rise, and the other is for prices to fall. And guess what? This week, we also learned that deflation is back, with prices falling by 0.1pc. \nWithin that, there are some genuinely significant falls. Take the cost of eating out, which is fast emerging as the nation’s favourite past-time (alongside watching cookery shows on TV). An average meal at JD Wetherspoon now costs £13.62 compared with £14.20 last year, and if you feel like pushing the boat out and heading down to Frankie & Benny’s, an average meal this year will cost £20.89 compared with £24.15 in 2014 (just typing the numbers is making me feel hungry). \nThe cost of filling up the average car has dropped by three pounds in the last month alone, and by far more over the last year. These are the kind of price falls that make a real difference to living standards. \nIt is not just in wages where the myths are being exploded. For all the talk about how London is sucking the life out of the economy, employment is growing strongly right across the country. \nThe numbers in full-time employment are rising at stronger rate than self-employment. The ‘precariat’, the trendy term coined to describe a class of self-employed freelancers struggling to make a living in the 'gig' economy, is in retreat. \nLikewise, male employment, especially for blue-collar workers, had been a real problem. Manual workers were hit by both the recession, and by changes in the structure of the economy which meant that the jobs that were being created suited women far better. But even that is starting to turn around. \nOver the past year, slightly more men found jobs than women 163,000 full time jobs for men were created, compared with 128,000 for women. The overall male employment rate has not quite recovered its levels from before the recession. \nIt peaked at 79.1 pc in late 2007, but it has climbed back to 78.4pc, and could soon be hitting fresh highs. The ‘man-cession’, the phrase coined to describe the disappearance of blue-collar jobs , is coming to an end. \nOverall, the most interesting thing about the labour market right now is how traditional it looks. Lots of full-time, salaried jobs, with regular pay rises if it were not for the fact that women, and young women in particular, are doing slightly better than men, we could be back in the 1950s. \nIn reality, none of that should be very surprising. It is just what the textbooks say should happen. In a flexible, well-functioning labour market, wages fall in a recession. \nThat is very tough for a lot of people, but it is better than mass unemployment, which is what happens in economies where regulations make that impossible. For evidence of that just take a look at the eurozone, where jobless totals have soared even while jobs and wages are protected. \nSince the 2008-2009 recession was the deepest since the 1930s, wages fell by a lot. But now that the recovery is underway, wages are rising again, and that is likely to accelerate as the labour market gets even tighter, and as companies compete with one another for staff. \nThat may prove tough for companies. Profits will be under pressure, especially in sectors such as hospitality that relied on lots of cheap staff. Expect to see a lot more automation. \nIf you don’t like automatic scanners at the supermarket of pay-at-the-pump filling stations, get over it. There will be a lot more of them in the next few years. But it will be more damaging for all the people who argued the economy had stopped working for ordinary people. \nThey have been proved decisively wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:34:28.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
