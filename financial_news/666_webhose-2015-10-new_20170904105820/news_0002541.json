The decision could augur well for other law suits against other servicers. \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., ruled on October 21 that the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Authority, or PHEAA, a state guaranty agency that collects student loan payments and is not \"an arm of the state\" since it makes its on policy decisions and generates its own revenue. \nCreated by the Pennsylvania legislature in 1963, PHEAA stopped making loans directed to students in 2008 and is independent of the state of Pennsylvania. PHEAA is also one the Federal Department of Education's four main student loan servicers.
