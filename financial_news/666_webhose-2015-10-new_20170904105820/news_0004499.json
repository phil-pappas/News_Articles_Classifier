Morgan Securities was 5.4 times oversubscribed, attracting orders totaling $10.4 billion, according to city officials. The deal resulted in a present value savings of $223.5 million from the refunding of $1.6 billion of outstanding bonds.\nUnlike Chicago's sagging general obligation credit, ratings for the new and refunding airport bonds improved heading into the sale. Standard & Poor's boosted the airport's rating by one notch to A, while Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on O'Hare's A-minus rating to positive from stable.\nChicago GO bonds due in around 20 years were trading 250 basis points over Municipal Market Data's benchmark triple-A yield curve. The spread for bonds with comparable maturities in the O'Hare deal was just 95 basis points, according to Randy Smolik, an analyst at MMD, a unit of Thomson Reuters.\nO'Hare is the world's busiest airport in terms of takeoffs and landings.
