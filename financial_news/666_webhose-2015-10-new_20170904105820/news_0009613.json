The euro was flat at $1.1191, having drifted down from this week's peak of $1.1282 struck on Tuesday.\n\"Fed Chair Yellen has already mentioned that labour conditions are improving and hinted that developments overseas, notably in China, and prices were chief concerns,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\n\"A very bullish report would of course have a big impact. But the Fed may not make its rates decision on employment data alone,\" he said.\nThe Canadian dollar hovered near two-week highs scaled overnight thanks to a surge in prices of crude, a major export commodity for Canada.\nThe loonie fetched C$1.3242 per dollar after hitting the two-week high of C$1.3219. The Canadian dollar fell to an 11-year low of C$1.3457 early this week when commodities including crude took heavy hits amid jitters over slowing global growth.\nThe Australian dollar was nearly flat at $0.7036, nudged off a 1-week high of $0.7085 scaled the previous day when a release of Chinese manufacturing activity was not as bad as feared.
