Well, he was, until they forced him out . \nMr Godfrey’s mistake? In short, standing up for the little guy and campaigning for greater transparency on fees and charges. This, his detractors said, was not how a trade body should function. Oh no. The head of a trade body should uphold the self-interested agenda of all the members of the club, not hound them to reveal more information to customers than regulators have deemed necessary. Two of the IA’s most influential members — Schroders and M&G — threatened to leave , and thus claimed their scalp. \nSome quarters of the fund management industry may be feeling pretty smug that Mr Godfrey has gone, but I think they will come to look back on this sorry episode as a public relations disaster. Why? To make my point, I’m going to take you on a little diversion involving 1) millennials and their tech habits, 2) people spitting out their tea, and 3) tins of tuna. So bear with me. \nLots of our readers are obsessed with fintech — the buzzword for new financial technology companies — both as an investment proposition and as customers. These new companies use digital services to cut costs and improve efficiency. I chaired a fringe meeting at the Conservative party Conference in Manchester this week with a group of them. The event was entitled Financial Fairness, which pretty much sums up how they intend to win custom from the incumbents. \nOne of these digital disrupters was TransferWise, the international money transfer service that claims to be “the cheapest way of transferring money globally”. Its biggest marketing ruse? Transparency. You’ve probably seen its adverts, emblazoned with Britons spitting out their tea when they discover their bank’s hidden charges. One ad that was nearly banned spells out “F¥€K — Your bank is overcharging you.” \nInvestors in fintech companies might be old and rich, but this is in contrast to the consumer group that’s driving their investment decisions — millennials \nEye-catching, yes. But this is a powerful message for consumers, who are sick of being ripped off in one mis-selling scandal after another. Estonian co-founder Taavet Hinrikus (who started the company after he became irate at paying high charges) says it now processes £500m a month and has grown fourfold this year. \n“Banks have focused on building services for themselves, rather than the consumer,” he told me. “When banks think about their pricing, it’s really about how high can we put the price and still get away with it.” And he’s not just winning customers — this week, the FT revealed that Vikram Pandit , former chief executive of Citigroup, has become its latest high-profile investor. \nInvestors in fintech companies might be old and rich, but this is in contrast to the consumer group that’s driving their investment decisions — millennials. \nToday’s twenty-somethings have little respect for established brands they deem untrustworthy. Eileen Burbidge , who is not only a fintech investor but also a special envoy to the Treasury on the subject, argues that today’s young people “trust Apple before any of the retail banking brands, and would rather have their money go through Facebook than a bank”. \nRead more columns by Claer Barrett, the FT’s personal finance editor \nShe believes that social messaging apps will in time command enough currency as brands to move into financial services — ably demonstrated by the success of ApplePay — noting that millennials value brands which are “trustworthy and recommended to them by their friends” over those which have been around for decades. Platforms like Trustpilot — where consumers share their views on big corporations — are also gaining currency. \nThe disruptive power of fintech prompted McKinsey to issue a warning note last week, saying global bank profits will be hammered over the next decade as banks are forced to cut their charges to compete with nimbler and cheaper tech competitors. (If you’re thinking about participating in the great Lloyds Bank share bonanza , this is something to ponder, especially if you plan on holding those shares after the one-year bonus has been paid). \nThe 25 investment firms that signed up to Mr Godfrey’s statement of principles are: \nAlliance Trust Investments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:35:31.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
