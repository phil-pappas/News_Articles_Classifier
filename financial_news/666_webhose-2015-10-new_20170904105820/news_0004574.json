I was told by my employer that I would be given at least two weeks of training but my immediate manager refuses to train me and doesn’t treat me well. When I phoned my employer and explained this he didn’t seem to believe me, so I carried on and had a bit of training but things didn’t get better. I was then told by my manager either to leave or to agree to a very low salary and live with several other women in a hostel. This is not in my contract. The employer then sent me an email terminating my contract, saying I am not up to standard. Please help me, I don’t know what to do about this unfair dismissal. I feel hurt and humiliated and want to go back home. UP, Dubai\n\nBecause UP is in her probation period the employer may terminate her employment at any time without having to give any reason. This is included in article 37 of UAE Labour Law as it states “the employer may terminate the services of the employee during this period without giving a notice or end of service remuneration …” This is not classed as unfair dismissal and the employee has no option but to accept the termination, especially after such a short period of time, no matter how unfortunate the situation. Because UP worked for the company, albeit for a short period, she is still entitled to receive salary and relevant benefits for the days she was with them and the employer is also liable to cover repatriation costs.\n\nKeren Bobker is an independent financial adviser with Holborn Assets in Dubai, with over 20 years’ experience.
