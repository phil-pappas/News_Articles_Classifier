But like Zuckerberg, there have been claims that he stole the idea. \nHe has attracted the wrath of other players in the world of extreme sports - reportedly there have even been death threats. \n“There’s not a person on this planet I despise more than Will Dean,” the creator of a rival extreme sports company said three years ago. \nThe controversy centres on claims that 35-year-old Dean, from Sheffield, stole the idea for his obstacle challenge from a rival Briton while studying for an MBA at Harvard. Soon after Tough Mudder launched in 2010, former soldier Billy Wilson claimed that Dean had copied the plans behind Tough Guy, an obstacle contest he had run since 1987. A lawsuit brought by Wilson (Oslo: WILS.OL - news ) was settled out of court in 2011. \nDean doesn’t deny the claims, but argues there are “hundreds” of companies now putting on similar extreme obstacle events and says no company has the sole rights to running an extreme sports event. \n“How can anyone claim to invent the mud runner or an obstacle course? There are hundreds of similar companies doing it now, should I be suing them? Tough Mudder is based on a bunch of obstacles we built ourselves. We’ve clearly been successful and it’s inevitable that some people will knock down others,” says Dean. \nTough Mudder has indeed been an enormous success. More than two million people have participated in a Tough Mudder course across the eight countries in which the business operates, including the UK, US Australia and Germany. \nThe New York-based company, which is still majority-owned by Dean, had a turnover of more than $100m last year. The firm is now planning to enter Mexico and Indonesia, targeting emerging markets for the first time. \n“Twice as many people in the UK did a Tough Mudder this year as ran a marathon. Think of us as like a travelling circus. I really do think we’re making a difference in the world. People are getting into shape because of our events,” says Dean, who has just become a father for the first time and has been afflicted with sleep deprivation. \nHe is now setting his sights on further global growth. \n• How tough is Tough Mudder really? \nIn the past year, Tough Mudder has signed lucrative deals with a number of sponsors, and the company is now an official gym partner of Virgin Active in the UK, where it has developed a Mudder Maker programme for people wanting to get in shape for one of Tough Mudder’s 12-mile courses. \nDean says there are also plans to create a TV series next year that focuses on the journey of some of the participants doing a Tough Mudder. \n“We have some people who have come through imaginably tough things in life - recovering alcoholics, amputees. They do a Tough Mudder because it’s something they can focus on,” he explains. The company supports veteran charities across the world, and participants have raised more than £2.5m for Help the Heroes in the UK. \nThe term “accidental entrepreneur” has become a clichéd phrase, but Dean has more claim to the title than most business owners. After graduating from Bristol University, he spent five years working for the Foreign Office on the counter terrorism desk in London before he got itchy feet and decided to set up his own business. \nUnsure about what his business could be, he applied, and was accepted, to join the MBA programme at Harvard University in 2007. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was during the course that he came up with the idea for an military-style obstacle course based on team work and camaraderie. The emphasis of Tough Mudder is on finishing rather than winning, and the average participant will complete the event in four hours, moving at 2.5 miles an hour around the 10 to 12 mile course. \nTough Mudder hosts eight events in the UK every year, with each attracting up to 20,000 people over a weekend. Prices range from less than £100 if booking months ahead, to around £200 if booking at the last minute. The company says about a third of participants are women, and 80pc of participants aren’t professional athletes. \nStill, taking part is not for the faint-hearted . Potential participants should be prepared to wrestle through clouds of tear gas, swim through iced water, crawl through barbed wire charged with 10,000 volts of electricity, and wade through miles of mud. \nEach obstacle requires some help from other participants, whether it’s scaling a 12-foot wall by standing on someone’s head or gripping a hand to be yanked out of sticky mud. \nDean, who has completed 14 Tough Mudders, says he was inspired to create something where teamwork was more important than winning following his experience of participating in a triathlon, when the zipper on his wetsuit got stuck and racers around him weren’t willing to sacrifice the time it would have cost to stop and help. \nAfter completing his Harvard studies, Dean moved to New York and launched the first Tough Mudder a year later with the help of a friend from home, Guy Livingstone, who remains a partner in the business. The pair used around £17,000 from their own savings to build the Tough Mudder website and market the event. \nThey hoped for around 500 participants, but take-up was much bigger than they anticipated, and they attracted almost 5,000 people. Word of mouth, on top of a clever social media marketing strategy, has meant numbers have continued to outpace company expectations. \nWhile Dean employs 30 people in the UK office in London, most of the company’s staff are based in Brooklyn, New York. \nDean says although the US immigration process is extremely hard for entrepreneurs to navigate, he believes the attitude is more positive towards business owners than in the UK. \n“In the US, if you tell people you’re starting a business, they say: ‘Good for you. I hope it works out.’ In the UK, you’ll hear them say: ‘Oh that’s a big risk.’ But I do think attitudes are getting better here.” \nHe adds that London is benefiting from the fact it is hard to get into the States, as it is encouraging more entrepreneurs to come to the UK capital. However, he is concerned by recent government rhetoric of an immigration crackdown. \n“The politics of immigration are complicated, but London, New York and San Francisco are the most pre-eminent cities in the world for entrepreneurship. It should be exciting for British people that we are up there with the top and our country’s doing better than all of Europe. In no small part that’s because a lot of bright, ambitious people are moving here and I hope we don’t mess that up for ourselves.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:24:08.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
