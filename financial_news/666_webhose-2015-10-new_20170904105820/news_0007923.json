This correction that we've seen has let off some of the steam in the markets,\" said Philip Petursson, managing director for capital markets and strategy at Manulife Asset Management.\n\"Now we can re-evaluate on somewhat better valuations, more realistic earnings expectations, and a more favorable outlook over the next 12 months,\" he said.\nHeavily-weighted Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc also boosted the index, jumping 2.1 percent to C$227.56.\nWith oil prices little changed in choppy trade, investors limited their positions ahead of the weekend, extended in Canada by Thanksgiving on Monday.\nSuncor Energy Inc lost 1.3 percent to C$36.67 and TransCanada Corp fell 1.7 percent to C$45.05. Overall, energy stocks eased 1.3 percent, while the financials group slipped 0.6 percent.\nU.S. crude prices were up 0.1 percent to $49.50 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 1.1 percent to $52.48. Gold futures rose 1.1 percent to $1,157.1 an ounce.\nThe materials group, where miners and other non-energy resource names reside, jumped 1.8 percent.\nToronto-Dominion Bank led the financials retreat, dipping 0.9 percent to C$53.05, while Royal Bank of Canada was off 0.7 percent at C$73.90.
