Oct 14th 2015 Tweet \nTHE battle lasted one tumultuous month. In September SABMiller, the world’s second-largest brewer, said it was the target of a takeover by its bigger rival, AB InBev. Then came a volley of bids, skirmishes in the press and tense private talks: the firms’ main shareholders include a huge tobacco company, the dashing scion of Colombia’s richest family and three Brazilian billionaires, not to mention South Africa’s public investment fund. On October 13th, one day before a deadline mandated by British takeover rules (SABMiller is listed in London), the companies announced a tentative deal. \nIf it is completed, the £69 billion ($106 billion) merger would be the third-largest in history. The combined brewer would earn about half the industry’s profits, sell one in three pints worldwide and earn about 50% more revenue than Coca-Cola. But agreeing on a deal price was, in relative terms, straightforward. Executing the merger, let alone running the resulting behemoth, will be more difficult. Related topics Breweries \nIt is little surprise that AB InBev got an agreement. It is one of the world’s most acquisitive companies. In 1989 the three founders of 3G, a private-equity outfit, invested in a middling Brazilian brewer. That firm then guzzled bigger competitors on three continents to become the world’s largest beer company. \nIn addition, AB InBev has been feeling parched recently. Consumers in many big markets are switching to other beverages. When they do drink beer, they are increasingly choosing “craft” brewers. Last year American beer volumes stayed flat, but craft brewers saw volume hop up by 18%. AB InBev’s share of America’s beer market sank from 50% to 45% over the past five years, according to Euromonitor, a research firm. Brazil’s slumping economy has also depressed sales. \nLook yeast The acquisition of SABMiller offers a quick way to reach new markets: the firm earns 29% of its profits in Africa, for instance, where AB InBev does little business. An acquisition would also let the famously frugal AB InBev unleash its cost-cutters on another company. \nMany steps remain before the takeover is a done deal, however. The tentative bid would pay a mix of cash and shares to SABMiller’s biggest stockholders—Altria, a tobacco firm, and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family—to help them avoid a hefty tax bill. Other investors would receive £44 a share, 50% more than they were worth a month ago. AB InBev now has until October 28th to pore over SABMiller’s books and finalise its bid. \nIt will take much longer to win regulators’ approval. Antitrust concerns may force AB InBev to sell SABMiller’s stake in MillerCoors, in America, and in CR Snow, China’s biggest brewer. SABMiller’s other partners may present their own complications. Some may have the right to dissolve their agreements if SABMiller is acquired. The company is an important bottler for Coca-Cola in Africa. The soda giant is unlikely to want a big partner to be controlled by AB InBev, itself a bottler for PepsiCo in Latin America. \nIf or when the deal does close, AB InBev faces the daunting task of making the acquisition worth it. Becoming a bigger company will not immediately solve its problems—it will not deter craft brewers or convince oenophiles to buy beer instead. AB InBev’s undoubted talent for cutting costs may not be as useful in this instance. SABMiller is already lean. It also has geographically scattered operations, which will make it harder to find redundant factories and workers. \nSo, AB InBev has its work cut out. But Trevor Stirling of Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, is among those who wonder if the company’s biggest deal may still be to come. Before the takeover announcement, some had murmured that 3G or AB InBev might try to buy Coca-Cola, a company with fat to trim. Soft drinks comprise about one-fifth of SABMiller’s volumes. Acquiring Coca-Cola would create a leviathan with a huge global infrastructure of bottlers and other production assets. Marketing could be kept separate, if need be. The idea is, on its face, so bold as to seem absurd. But if recent decades of beer deals are any indication, it is not impossible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:33:25.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
