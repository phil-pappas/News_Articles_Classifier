U.S. crude for December was down 10 cents at $45.28 a barrel, having risen 18 cents on Thursday. \nECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that new euro zone initiatives could be unveiled as soon as December to stoke the economy. \nThe euro saw its largest one-day percentage drop against the dollar in nine months on Thursday, a move that might have been expected to depress oil, which is traded internationally in the U.S. currency. [FRX/] \nBut Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO Bank, said hopes that European economic stimulus measures would boost oil demand were supporting fuel globally. \n\"Draghi's comments are supportive,\" van Cleef said. \"Nevertheless, with the dollar finding support, the upside for oil prices will be limited.\" \nJonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance, said markets had decided governments would not allow economies to falter. \n\"These expectations suggest more active economic development will force consumption to go up,\" Barratt added. \nData from the United States on Thursday showed a strong rebound in home resales in September and new applications for unemployment benefit hovering around 42-year lows. \nEuropean stock markets joined a global share surge that buoyed overall sentiment. [MKTS/GLOB] \nAdding further support to an outlook shaken in recent months by weaker growth in key emerging economies including China, Japanese manufacturing expanded in October at what could be its fastest pace in 19 months, according to Markit/Nikkei Japan Flash Manufacturing PMI data. \nChina's commercial crude oil stocks at the end of September rose 2.38 percent from August, while diesel stocks saw a record 15.68 percent drawdown and refined fuel stocks overall dropped 7.46 percent, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday without giving actual volumes. \nRising U.S. oil inventories, which climbed by a larger-than-expected 8 million barrels to 476.6 million last week, were a potential headwind to oil prices, helping to fuel concern over global oversupply. [EIA/S] \nInvestors also awaited rig data on Friday for guidance on how U.S. oil production has responded to recent price falls. \n(Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Keith Wallis in Singapore; Editing by David Evans and Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:39:41.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
