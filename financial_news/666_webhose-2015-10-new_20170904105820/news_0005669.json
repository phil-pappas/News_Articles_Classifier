European shares back in the red as US jobs data disappoints By Tara Cunningham | Telegraph – 28 minutes ago 51.55 -1.07 \nDespite making gains of 1.7pc in early trade, US jobs data dragged European shares into negative territory \nEuropean shares dipped into negative territory after official data from the US showed a less-than-expected rise in non-farm payrolls. \nHaving climbed by as much as 1.7pc in intraday trading ahead of the jobs data release, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 swiftly tumbled into the red, down 0.3pc, after figures disappointed. \nNon-farm payrolls increased by 142,000 last month, higher than the August figure of 136,000, but well below expectations of more than 200,000. \nMike McCudden, of Interactive Investor, warned of a \"turbulent afternoon ahead\" across global financial markets. \n\"Given recent economic data and raft of bullish comments on the health of the US economy, nobody expected the jobs figure to come in this far below expectation. If anything, the expectation was for a blockbuster number. \n\"Traders and investors alike will be scratching their heads regarding the direction equities will take in the coming sessions and thoughts of a rate rise this year may have just gone out the window. Once the market opens in the US, investors should wait for the dust to settle before making their next move,” Mr McCudden added. FTSEurofirst 300 Index 1-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nBritain’s benchmark index, which had leapt by 1.7pc, was soon trading at 6,092.61, a mere 0.3pc higher than Thursday’s close, raising concerns about whether the US economy is strong enough to allow for a Fed interest rate rise by the end of the year. \nJoshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “With the Bank of England expected to follow the Fed, any delay to the Fed’s first hike will in turn delay UK rates. The fact that markets are being sold despite that fact is worrying for the FTSE.” * Interest rates predictions on the move: 'First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) rise in December 2016' Elsewhere, the CAC in Paris quickly fell into negative territory, down 0.1pc, and the German DAX lost 0.3pc. \nThe opening bell on Wall Street triggered another sea of red, as US equities fell sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Index and the S&P 500 opened 1pc lower, while the Nasdaq (NasdaqGS: NDAQ - news ) was off by 1.3pc. \nMeanwhile after a volatile week across financial markets, overnight Asian stocks ended the week higher. The Shanghai Composite Index inched 0.5pc higher, while Japan’s Nikkei closed up 0.02pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:15:36.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
