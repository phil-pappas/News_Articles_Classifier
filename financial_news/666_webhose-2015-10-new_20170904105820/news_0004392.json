The widely spread growth momentum we saw in the first quarter continues, and we recorded triple-digit year-on-year growth in revenue in nine cities outside Beijing. Additionally, we are very pleased that our targeted summer class promotion in Beijing has begun to regenerate enrollment-driven growth for the fall term. We expect our organic business momentum to remain robust in the third quarter, mostly driven by enrollments, through our offline learning center network and deeper online engagement,\" said Mr. Rong Luo, TAL's Chief Financial Officer.\n\"We believe that in addition to our solid organic business development, we have made sound third-party investments and acquisitions in recent months, which will bring long-term value to our shareholders. These investments and acquisitions have been well coordinated and aligned with our overall strategic plan of being strongly leveraged in future education business models. All of these investments and acquisitions share a common focus on education in the K-12 segment, which is complementary to our organic growth,\" Mr. Luo added.\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2016\nNet Revenues\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, TAL reported net revenues of US$173.3 million, representing a 41.6% increase from US$122.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly driven by an increase in total student enrollments, which increased by 54.8% to approximately 631,430 from approximately 407,970 in the same period of the prior year. The increase in total student enrollments was driven primarily by increases of enrollments in the small class offerings and online courses, as well as more offering of the small-group class as a supplement to one-on-one tutoring. Average selling price (ASP) decreased by 8.5% from US$300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 to US$275 in the same quarter of fiscal year 2016. The decrease in ASP was mainly attributable to our small class summer promotion in Beijing, more offering of the small-group class and more enrollment contribution from online courses, and was partially offset by the increase in the hourly rate of the small class course offerings. \nOperating Costs and Expenses\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, operating costs and expenses were US$136.7 million, a 48.8% increase from US$91.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were US$131.1 million, a 49.4% increase from US$87.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nCost of revenues increased by 51.1% to US$80.5 million from US$53.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase in cost of revenues was mainly due to an increase in teacher compensation and rental costs, as well as increases in wages and teacher fees. Non-GAAP cost of revenues, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 51.1% to US$80.4 million, from US$53.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased by 42.8% to US$18.8 million from US$13.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 45.1% to US$18.2 million from US$12.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase of selling and marketing expenses in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in compensation to sales and marketing staff to support a greater number of programs and service offerings versus the year-ago period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 46.9% to US$37.5 million from US$25.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in the number of our general and administrative personnel compared to the year-ago period and an increase in compensation to our general and administrative personnel, in particular such personnel supporting our online education initiatives among other new programs and service offerings. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 47.7% to US$32.4 million, from US$21.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nTotal share-based compensation expenses allocated to the related operating costs and expenses increased by 35.4% to US$5.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 from US$4.2 million in the same period of fiscal year 2015.\nGross Profit \nGross profit increased by 34.3% to US$92.9 million from US$69.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased by 28.5% to US$39.2 million from US$30.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP income from operations, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 29.3% to US$44.9 million from US$34.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nOther Income / (Expense)\nOther expense was US$4.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, compared to other income of US$1.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Other expense in this quarter was mainly due to exchange losses. As the Company holds a significant portion of cash balance in RMB and reports in U.S. Dollars, it benefits from exchange gains in times of relative strength of the RMB and incurs exchange losses in times of relative strength of the U.S. Dollar.\nImpairment loss on long-term investments\nImpairment loss on long-term investments was $7.5 million, mainly because there were other-than-temporary declines in the value of long-term investments in several investees, primarily due to significant deteriorations in their operations, earnings performance and abilities to continue as a going concern.\nGain from disposal of a component\nGain from disposal of a component was $50.0 million, which was derived from a transaction in which the Company transferred its one-on-one business component in Guangzhou in exchange for noncontrolling equity interest in a third party.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was US$17.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, compared to US$5.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly due to the increase in income before tax and estimated annual effective income tax rate. The estimated annual effective income tax rate increased mainly because one of TAL's subsidiaries was entitled to a two-year exemption from enterprise income tax for calendar years 2013 and 2014 as a Newly Established Software Enterprise, and enjoys preferential tax rate of 12.5% for calendar years 2015 through 2017.\nNet Income Attributable to TAL Education Group\nNet income attributable to TAL increased by 118.0% to US$63.5 million from US$29.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP net income attributable to TAL, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 107.6% to US$69.2 million from US$33.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income per ADS\nBasic and diluted net income per ADS were US$0.79 and US$0.72 respectively in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Non-GAAP basic and Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were US$0.87 and US$0.78, respectively.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 were US$10.8 million, representing an increase of US$2.2 million from US$8.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly due to leasehold improvements, expenditures on mobile network research and development, and the purchase of servers, computers, software systems and other hardware, for the Company's teaching facilities.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Term Deposits\nAs of August 31, 2015, the Company had US$513.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and US$24.6 million of term deposits, compared to US$470.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and US$21.2 million of term deposits as of February 28, 2015.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of August 31, 2015, the Company's deferred revenue balance was US$239.0 million, compared to US$177.9 million as of August 31, 2014, representing an increase of 34.4%.\nFinancial Results for the First Six Months of Fiscal Year 2016\nNet Revenues\nFor the first six months of fiscal year 2016, TAL reported net revenues of US$302.7 million, representing a 43.2% increase from US$211.4 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly driven by an increase in total student enrollments, which increased by 51.9% to approximately 1,043,550 from approximately 687,170 in the same period of the prior year. The increase in total student enrollments was driven primarily by increases of enrollments in the small class offerings and online courses, as well as more offering of the small-group class as a supplement to one-on-one tutoring. ASP decreased by 5.7% from US$308 in the first six months of fiscal year 2015 to US$290 in the first six months of fiscal year 2016. The decrease in ASP was mainly attributable to our small class summer promotion in Beijing, more offering of the small-group class and more enrollment contribution from online courses, and was partially offset by the increase in the hourly rate of the small class course offerings.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nIn the first six months of fiscal year 2016, operating costs and expenses were US$246.5 million, a 47.3% increase from US$167.4 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were US$235.8 million, a 48.1% increase from US$159.2 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015.\nCost of revenues increased by 49.0% to US$141.4 million from US$94.9 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. The increase in cost of revenues was mainly due to an increase in teacher compensation and rental costs, as well as increases in wages and teacher fees. Non-GAAP cost of revenues, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 49.0% to US$141.4 million from US$94.9 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased by 38.8% to US$34.0 million from US$24.5 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 40.6% to US$33.0 million from US$23.5 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. The increase of selling and marketing expenses in the first six months of fiscal year 2016 was primarily a result of an increase in compensation to sales and marketing staff to support a greater number of programs and service offerings versus the year-ago period.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 48.3% to US$71.1 million from US$47.9 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in the number of our general and administrative personnel compared to the year-ago period and an increase in compensation to our general and administrative personnel, in particular such personnel supporting our online education initiatives among other new programs and service offerings. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, increased by 50.5% to US$61.4 million from US$40.8 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015.\nTotal share-based compensation expenses allocated to the related operating costs and expenses increased by 30.5% to US$10.7 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2016 from US$8.2 million in the same period of fiscal year 2015.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased by 38.5% to US$161.3 million from US$116.5 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased by 33.1% to US$58.8 million from US$44.2 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015.

As the Company holds a significant portion of cash balance in RMB and reports in U.S. Dollars, it benefits from exchange gains in times of relative strength of the RMB and incurs exchange losses in times of relative strength of the U.S. Dollar.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was US$22.6 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2016, compared to US$7.8 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly due to the increase in income before tax and estimated annual effective income tax rate.

We also operate www.jzb.com , a leading online education platform in China. Our ADSs trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"XRS.\"\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn evaluating its business, TAL considers and uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as supplemental metrics to review and assess its operating performance: non-GAAP operating costs and expenses, non-GAAP cost of revenues, non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income attributable to TAL, non-GAAP basic and non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS. To present each of these non-GAAP measures, the Company excludes share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this release.\nTAL believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. TAL believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to TAL's historical performance and liquidity. TAL computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and from period to period.TAL believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation charges that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company's business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nFor further information, please
