That could be because the United States is the most overworked nation compared to other advanced economies in the world. According to Gallup , American adults employed full time report working 47 hours each week on average – that’s nearly a full 9-to-5 work day longer than a standard 40-hour workweek requires. \nEmployees working longer hours is not just the average, but it's becoming the norm: half of full time workers say they work more than 40 hours, and one in four work more than 50 hours each week. \nBeyond those who work full time, the average U.S. resident works for nearly 1,790 hours each year, which is higher than the average number of hours employees in many other developed countries work per year .

The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world that does not provide national paid parental leave benefits . The average in many other countries is over twelve weeks of paid leave, and in Europe, the average is over 20 weeks. \nSweden recently announced its interest in switching to a six-hour workday , hoping that shorter workdays would increase productivity. Additionally, less time at work would allow workers to spend more time with their families. Many other countries help workers to achieve these same benefits by establishing federally mandated vacation days and holidays for employees. \nThe United States is also the only developed country with no federal law requiring annual leave, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research's No-Vacation National Revisited Report from 2013. In fact, the paid vacation and holiday laws in 20 of the richest countries in the world put those of the U.S. to shame. \nOn average, workers in these countries enjoy a total of about 20 days of paid vacation each year. For some, paid holidays allow for even more days off of work. \nSo, where can workers live in order to receive legally mandated paid vacation days each year? Click through the list to find out. \n20.
