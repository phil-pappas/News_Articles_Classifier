He said Aerojet was also making \"very good progress\" on its rival AR-1 engine, but it lagged the BE-4 program by 16 months.\n\"They're a great company. They have awesome people. We continue to need them to build the rockets,\" Bruno said.\nBruno also rejected concerns raised by some analysts that ULA was taking on too much risk by switching to Orbital as its solid rocket booster supplier, noting that the company already made large boosters for NASA, and accounted for 95 percent of the overall U.S. production of solid rocket boosters.
