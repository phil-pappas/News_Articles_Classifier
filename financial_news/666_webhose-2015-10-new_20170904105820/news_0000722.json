Take back your time\nAdvertisement When I first started out, I worked in the same way as when I was in full-time employment. I worked pretty much nine-to-five, took a break for lunch and really failed to take advantage of the freelance life. However, I have changed my ways.\nAs I've written about before , now I do about an hour of work at about 5am, take a break to go for a surf, then work from 8ish to around 4.30pm, when I generally stop and go to yoga. When I'm arranging meetings I'm clear about my preferred work times and nine times out of 10, clients are happy for me to work the hours I choose. In saying that, when times get busy, I often work seven days a week, sometimes for weeks at a time. However, I don't begrudge it, because the harder I work, the more I earn.\n2. Don't work for idiots\nThe beauty of freelancing is that you can choose your clients. Sure, it's taken me this long to build up a great bank of clients I absolutely love working for. However, these days as soon as a new client demonstrates rogue characteristics – like making unreasonable demands on my time or patronising me – I'll make myself unavailable. It's that easy.\nThere are plenty of fantastic clients out there who genuinely want to work in a collaborative way. If you work for numbnuts, you're reducing the time you have to work for the great clients. It takes a leap of faith to say \"no\" to work, but that's the only way you'll build a portfolio of clients for whom you really want to work.\n3. Don't panic when things slow down\nFrom time to time, I get a period when things are not crazy busy – for example, I might actually have time for lunch rather than just grabbing something on the hop – and when this happens, what I generally do is panic, drum up a huge amount of new work, and end up in a situation where I'm overworked and stressed.\nA much better approach is to enjoy the downtime and use it as a chance to learn a new skill or just take a breather, rather than run around like a headless chook and wind up working yourself into an early grave.\n4. Keep on top of your tax\nBecause I am paranoid and obsessive compulsive, I always, always, always put enough money aside to pay my tax on time. However, I have watched many other freelancers get themselves into trouble by not putting enough in the kitty to pay the tax man. The old adage used to be pay yourself first, but I'd rather pay the tax man first and know that my obligations in this regard have been met.\n5. Chase invoices when they fall due\nIt's easy to get swept up in your work as a freelancer and forget to chase up your overdue accounts; a big mistake and a great way to end up with no cash. Follow up your invoices as soon as they fall due and build relationships with your clients' accounts teams to give your business the best chance of being on the top of the pile when it comes to settling accounts.\nI'm keen to hear other freelancers' tips on how to be a success so please share your comments below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:39:07.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
