But of the people who fail to obtain asylum or residency in the 28-nation EU, less than 40 percent actually go back, and all agree that should change quickly.\n\"We need to see Europe upping its game,\" Britain's interior minister, Theresa May, said.\n\"If there is no return policy there is no basis for the refugee policy,\" said French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, adding agreements should be quickly made with many of the developing nations from where tens of thousands of economic migrants leave in desperation for a better life in Europe.\nAt the same time, he put to the EU nations a far-reaching plan to beef up the external borders by committing member states to contribute more personnel to the EU's border agency and eventually set up a largely autonomous international \"corps\" that could intervene wherever a crisis appears.\nFrench officials said that in the short term, member states would be obliged to contribute more personnel to the Frontex border agency based on their population, wealth and other criteria.\nLast week, Frontex appealed for 775 additional staff to deal with the migrant crisis in Greece and Italy. It would roughly double the staff the agency has there now, mainly on some 30 vessels in the Mediterranean.\nIn the long term, France proposes a multinational European border guard corps which would have much more autonomy to act and contain crises.\nOn Thurdsay, the EU also earmarked more than 400 million euros ($451 million) in additional funding to tackle the refugee emergency.\nMost of the money - 300 million euros - will be used to help Syrian refugees in countries outside the EU, including Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.\nIt will also fund the creation of 120 jobs in the three key European agencies working on the migration frontline; Frontex, the EASO asylum support office and the policy agency Europol.\nSome 56 million euros will be devoted to humanitarian aid.\n___\nLorne Cook wrote from Brussels.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:16:05.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
