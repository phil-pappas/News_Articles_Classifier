The firm makes paper for consumer packaging, corrugated board and industrial uses. \nThe FTSE 100 company said it expects to lose €90m of underlying profits as a result of shutdowns this year, in line with previous forecasts. Mondi, which is dual-listed in London and Johannesburg, is spending up to €1.1bn during this year and 2016 on upgrading its production facilities to match growing competition. \nMondi also flagged that recycling costs in Europe had jumped 13pc in the past three months, although price rises have offset some of this extra expense and other costs such as wood and chemicals were broadly stable in local currencies. \nSack kraft paper, which is used in food bags and cement packaging, was the exception in the group's growing sales. Mondi said export volumes were under pressure \"due to a combination of political instability in the Middle East and North Africa and a slowdown in demand in certain south-east Asian markets\". \nForeign exchange fluctuations during the quarter had a mixed effect on the company, which said its South African operations benefited from the weakening rand while the Russian rouble’s drop meant fine paper sales in the country were relatively less valuable. \n“The group continues to deliver strongly, benefiting from stable to higher selling prices in a number of key grades and the contributions from its capital investment programme. Currency volatility has had a limited impact on the group, while costs remain generally stable,” Mondi said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:40:50.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
