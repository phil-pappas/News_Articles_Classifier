Photo: Nic Walker\nQantas Airways will consider flying Boeing 787-9s from Dubai to destinations in mainland Europe and Emirates could begin flying to cities like Darwin and Cairns as part of their partnership over the next three to five years, Emirates president Tim Clark says.\nMr Clark and Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce met last week to discuss the future of the alliance. Afterward, Mr Clark told reporters in Dubai that he was bullish on expanding the partnership, despite the fall in the Australian dollar .\nAsked if Emirates could fly to secondary cities in Australia, Clark said: \"Darwin, Cairns, Broome, Alice Springs. Look, there are lots [of possibilities],\" according to Gulf News .\nHe also said there was potential to expand its offering in Australia's major cities. Emirates has already announced plans to upgrade its Melbourne-Singapore-Dubai flight to its flagship A380 from a smaller Boeing 777 from March .\nAdvertisement At present, Qantas offers one daily A380 flight from Sydney to London via Dubai and another from Melbourne to London via Dubai as part of its partnership with Emirates in the European market. However, Mr Clark pointed to the potential for Qantas to resume flying to European cities like Frankfurt, Paris and Rome once it begins receiving eight Boeing 787-9s from late 2017 .\nFive of those aircraft will be used to replace ageing Boeing 747s used currently on its routes to the United States, Japan and South Africa, but the remaining three could potentially be used on new routes. However, Qantas hasn't ruled out ordering more of the planes in the future as it has 15 options with guaranteed delivery dates and a further 30 purchase rights.\n\"The range and the economics of the 787-9 open up a lot of route opportunities, so we'll be looking at those as the delivery of our first aircraft gets closer,\" a senior Qantas spokesman said on Tuesday. \"Naturally, our alliance partners form part of that thinking, in terms of offering the best joint network that we can.\"\nQantas and Emirates began their partnership in 2013 and they have regulatory approvals for it to continue until 2018, but both carriers have indicated they want to extend it past that date.\nSeparately, Qantas's low-cost arm, Jetstar, on Tuesday signed a codeshare agreement with Chilean carrier LAN.\nThe deal will offer LAN customers the opportunity to book Jetstar flights in Australia and New Zealand and receive frequent flyer points for doing so. LAN flies from Santiago to Sydney via Auckland, and the deal will give its customers access to destinations including Melbourne, Byron Bay, Cairns, Darwin, Hobart, and the Sunshine Coast in Australia, and Wellington, Dunedin, Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand.â€‹", "external_links": ["http://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/emirates-qantas-mapping-out-next-stage-of-partnership-1.1595486", "http://www.traveller.com.au/qantas-boeing-7879-dreamliner-routes-what-qantas-has-planned-for-new-planes-gj3tdb", "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/business/aviation/emirates-scales-up-to-a380-for-melbournesingapore-flights-20150811-giwo9z.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:12:18.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
