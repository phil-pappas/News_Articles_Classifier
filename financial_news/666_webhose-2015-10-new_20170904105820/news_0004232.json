ECOWAS Commissioner for Mines and EnergyRepresentative of the Hon. Minister of Energy and MinesMembers of the Diplomatic CorpsMembers of the MediaDistinguished GuestsLadies and Gentlemen It is my honour to accept the Chairmanship of this Press Conference Launch of ECOMOF 2015. ECOMOF 2015 is the 1st ECOWAS Mining and Petroleum Forum and Exhibition. It is an initiative of the ECOWAS Commission which, on 8th October, 2010, at a meeting of ECOWAS Ministers responsible for Mineral Resources Development in Monrovia, Liberia, recommended the organization of a regional mining and petroleum forum, as part of activities to promote and develop the mining and oil potentials of Member States. At the request of ECOWAS, therefore, the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources and the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum agreed to host this Forum, “ECOMOF 2015”, on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Ghana. The Forum which is the inaugural edition is expected to take place at the Accra International Conference Centre from 6 – 8 October, 2015 and has, as its theme, ‘Valorising West Africa’s Mineral and Petroleum Resources through Regional Cooperation’. This theme ties in very well with the objectives of the Government of Ghana to ensure our natural resources are not just get be exploited, but that they create additional value which would result in the sustainable development of our country. All the countries of the sub-region should expect similar outcomes. This is what the current Africa Mining Vision adopted by the AU seeks to achieve. The timing of the forum is therefore very apt. As we launch ECOMOF today, therefore, it is my expectation that it would champion such development. Thank you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:12:05.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
