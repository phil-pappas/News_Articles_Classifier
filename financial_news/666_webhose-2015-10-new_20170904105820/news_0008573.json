Telecoms executive Jamie Romanin, 38, thinks so. A frequent player at business golf days and on weekends in younger years, he's now a passionate cyclist and triathlon competitor with no desire to pull out the clubs more than once or twice a year.\n\"The days of golf are dying off,\" Romanin says.\n \"Similar to the day of the long lunch … it died off some time ago. Everyone's time poor, we live frenzied lives … we're squeezing much more into our lives. I don't know many executives who can take five hours out for a game of golf.\"\nCycling, which blends business and pleasure more time efficiently, has become the favoured alternative, both for his demographic and a growing number of executives in their 40s and 50s.\nRomanin believes the networking opportunities are just as good – both puffing up hills and enjoying après-ride lattes in the coffee shop – and they don't make such a dent in the workday or weekend schedule.\nJumping the Shark Would jazzing things up on the course as per the Great White Shark's suggestions entice Romanin and his fellow pedallers back on a regular basis?\nUnlikely, he says.\n\"These days executives are more conscious of their health and fitness…they gravitate to activities that meet this need,\" he says.\n\"It's still missing that edge … I still don't think it's hitting the right spot for what executives are looking for in today's world…For me, it's not about having to wear a polo shirt, it's a time factor.\"\nNot enough hours in the week is a common refrain for time-poor, 30-somethings whose careers are on the rise.\nChanging fortunes Whether it's for business or pleasure, it's tough to find a window to don special clothes and drive to a course for a round when the business calendar is bulging and there's a young family at home.\nA regular player in his former role as a relationship manager with ANZ Bank, financial services software entrepreneur Bart Jesman, 36, has relegated his clubs to the garage since founding his own firm, FinSuite, five years ago.\nLong weeks in the office, a young child at home and a client base that doesn't want to spend half a day trudging round the course with him means they're likely to remain there.\nSame here, says Zoom2u's 35-year-old founder Steve Orenstein who prefers snowboarding or floorball, a form of indoor hockey, to eighteen holes.\nA sizeable handicap The time factor and stuffy rules combo has helped push golf down in the popularity stakes and even with an image overhaul it's unlikely to see a major resurgence with the under-40s crowd, he believes.\n\"I have played but I definitely don't think it will continue to be an area where deals are done, on the golf course,\" Orenstein says.\n\"There are so many sports out there the younger generation are going after than the game of golf, especially with the dress code and formality.\n'There's a place for golf and I do enjoy when I play, the social aspect. What I don't like is the formality, having to wear certain clothing, shorts with socks pulled up …\" But while the younger set may be less than enthusiastic, corporate golf days still attract plenty of takers, according to International Speakers Group managing director Rod Loader, who does brisk business supplying retired cricketers to play with executives and their guests.\nNot dead yet \"Guys that are keen on their golf are still out there and active … it's still an easy sell to get guys to come and play in a golf event,\" Loader says.\nHe believes an image upgrade may make the game more accessible to rookie players who are put off by its old school etiquette.\n\"Especially guys who don't play too often, they can be intimidated walking into the old high-end golf courses and [staff] pulling them up on the way they're dressed,\" Loader says.\n\"You don't need people telling your clients they're wearing the wrong socks.\"\nShortening the game could also increase its appeal, he adds.\n\"There's merit in shorter games from a time point of view because that does put people off,\" he says.\nDoes golf still appeal to you, for leisure or networking?
