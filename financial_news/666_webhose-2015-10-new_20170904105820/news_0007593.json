President Barack Obama last week said he would pressure Congress to enact legislation that would curb firearms violence after a gunman killed nine people in Oregon.\n“There’s a joke in the firearms industry that President Obama is the world’s best gun salesman and there is data to support increased purchases of firearms heading into the 2008 and 2012 elections,” said Andrea James, an analyst with Dougherty & Co. “Of course, Hillary Clinton is vying for the same job.”\nSmith & Wesson, whose brands also include M&P and Thompson/Center Arms, surged 5.4 percent to $17.49 at 12:49 p.m. New York time, after climbing as much as 5.8 percent, the most intraday since Aug. 28. Sturm Ruger, maker of Ruger American, Gunsite Scout and Hawkeye weapons, increased 2.8 percent to $58.01.\nRetailers that sell firearms also benefited. Cabela’s Inc. gained 2.1 percent to $45.05, while Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. increased 1.3 percent to $51.68.\nPast Surges The gunmakers’ shares have seen gains in recent years in the wake of mass shootings that have led to increased calls for gun-ownership restrictions. Both companies also have seen sales rise in response to the politicians’ demands for tougher legislation. Those efforts have all fizzled.\n“The threat of legislation can cause temporary buying surges,” said James, who has a buy rating on both gunmakers. “The best thing for firearms demand is to have the constant threat of legislation without ever actually having the legislation.”\nJames estimated that firearms sales will rise at about two times the U.S. gross domestic product, as more women, young people, and urban dwellers want personal protection and as target shooting increases in popularity.\n“Target shooting is basically the new bowling,” James said.\nThe Oregon mass shooting occurred Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg. The gunman then killed himself, authorities said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:25:39.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
