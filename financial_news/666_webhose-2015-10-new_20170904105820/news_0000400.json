This lovely object is called, using IRS terminology that by tradition includes at least one vacuous word, a \"qualified longevity annuity contract,\" or QLAC. So, should we all be snapping up QLACs?Being allowed to do something doesn't necessarily make it smart. Maybe non-IRA assets should cover the tab.The rule allows a saver to burn as much as $125,000 (but no more than 25% of total tax-deferred savings) on a longevity annuity that starts as late as age 85. The sum diverted is then out of the IRA, reducing the balance that must be paid out beginning at age 70&frac12;.If you have ample resources outside your IRA, you might welcome a strategy that reduces those compulsory withdrawals. Moving $125,000 off to the side cuts your taxable income by a sum that starts out at $4,560 the first year and goes up from there.But the IRS is not giving you a free ride. If you make it to the annuity start date without getting run over by a taxicab, you will get those annuity payments, they will be fully taxable and they will be a lot higher than $4,560. They might kick you into a higher tax bracket.Plan A: Invest $125,000 from your IRA in a longevity bet. Plan B: Use $125,000 that is just sitting around in a taxable account. If you have only nonspouse heirs, Plan A is better. If you die young, you leave behind that much more in non-IRA assets on which those heirs won't owe an income tax and that much less in IRA assets on which they will pay income tax.If, however, you have a younger spouse who is likely to survive you, Plan B could make sense. In the event of your untimely demise, the survivor claims a deduction for your investment loss and marries that writeoff to a Roth conversion of an equal amount of IRA money.When the dust settles on Plan B, the family is left with a tax-free Roth account, which is more valuable than either an IRA or a plain old brokerage account. The Roth can be stretched out to provide tax-free compounding for years.Why can't children or grandchildren use Plan B? Because a key element is a joint return in the year of your death. Your spouse can file that return. They can't.The marrying of an annuity deduction to an IRA conversion is an example of what I call a \"strategic Roth.\" The same technique can apply to an outsized medical deduction (such as for a nursing home).
