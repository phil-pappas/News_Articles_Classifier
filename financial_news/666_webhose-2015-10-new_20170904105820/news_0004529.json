With his 2009 debut “Psychic Chasms,” group mastermind Alan Palomo was a pioneer of the throwback indie movement known as chillwave, which made lo-fi approximations of new-wave classics. But the new Neon Indian album, “Vega Intl. Night School,” swells in terms of scale, moving more toward danceability. Reference points from the ‘80s remain—everything from UB40 to Men at Work—but the crispness and clarity help keep the sound current. Tamaryn and Hannah Cohen open for a show that is part of the CMJ Music Marathon.\nENLARGE Mercury Rev Photo: Andrew Benge/Redferns/Getty Images Mercury Rev\nLe Poisson Rouge\n158 Bleecker St.\n(212) 505-3474\nThursday\nMercury Rev started out as a wildly strange psychedelic rock band before moving to rural upstate New York and mellowing out considerably. Albums in the early ’90s shared affinities with experimental noise-rock bands like Sonic Youth, but 1998’s “Deserter’s Songs” sounded like the workings of an entirely new and more serene group, with downshifted speeds that suited paeans to spacey relaxation. The band’s new album, “The Light In You,” is their first in seven years; the lyrics signal the experience of life challenges weathered and overcome, but the music remains unswervingly idyllic and beautiful.\nSundara All-Star Band\nDream House—Dia: Chelsea\n545 W. 22nd St.\n(212) 989-5566\nThursday\nSince June, the Dream House installation for sound and light has drawn a mix of close listeners and idle curiosity-seekers to the unusual musical world of La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela and Jung Hee Choi. Mr. Young and Ms. Zazeela have legacies going back to the beginnings of minimalism in the ’60s, while Ms. Choi, a younger disciple of their raga-studying ways, stands to carry on the tradition. Here, before the Dream House installation closes later this month, a concert (to be presented again Oct. 23) features the three main artists singing raga over an electronic drone composition by Ms. Choi, with extra embellishment by fretless guitar and bass as well as tabla drums.\nRoscoe Mitchell in Celebration of AACM\nPioneer Works\n159 Pioneer St., Brooklyn\n(718) 596-3001\nFriday\nSince forming in 1965, the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) has been revered for the work it has done to push the jazz forward and farther out. Based in Chicago—where a widely praised AACM-inspired exhibition is now on show at the Museum of Contemporary Art—the collective orbited around the ever-adventurous Art Ensemble of Chicago, of which Roscoe Mitchell was a fiery sax-blowing founding member. Here, at a spacious arts space in the industrial neighborhood of Red Hook, Mr. Mitchell will lead a 50th-anniversary AACM tribute with a quintet including Scott Robinson on woodwinds, Tani Tabba on drums, Gerald Cleaver on bass marimba and baritone vocalist Thomas Buckner. The program calls for a night of “compositions and improvisations,” which in the AACM realm tend to blend fruitfully together.\nENLARGE Joe Jackson Photo: Jacob Blickenstaff Joe Jackson\nTown Hall\n123 W. 43rd St.\n(212) 997-1003\nOct. 20\nJoe Jackson had an elegance about him even in his early “angry young man” phase. His first hit came in 1979 in the form of “Is She Really Going Out With Him?” Others, especially the snappy 1982 single “Steppin’ Out,” showcased an unusual sense of musicality that has grown more sophisticated in the decades since. In 2012, he released an impressive and unusual tribute to Duke Ellington in “The Duke,” and his new album “Fast Forward” draws from studio sessions in four cities close to Mr. Jackson’s musical heart: New York, Berlin, Amsterdam and New Orleans. Each song was recorded with musicians from the locale in question, and the nativist elements mesh well with Mr. Jackson’s urbane, cosmopolitan pop.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS894_NYPOP1_8S_20151013133019.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS894_NYPOP1_12S_20151013133019.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS869_NYPOP1_M_20151013125855.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS869_NYPOP1_P_20151013125855.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:29:50.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
