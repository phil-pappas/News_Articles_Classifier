Instead it suggests a mix of factors offer clues as to why there aren't more women at the top. Here are just three: \n1. Fewer women tend to be in roles that lead to the C-suite. Women are more likely to occupy staff roles, which don't produce revenue. Think administration, HR, legal and IT. By contrast, men disproportionately fill positions that are core to major operations and the bottom line -- the pipeline jobs that leads to the C-suite. \n2. Women express less eagerness than men to ascend to a top executive spot. \n3. Women's professional networks tend to be all-female or mixed gender. Men tend to network just with other men. \"Given that men are more likely to hold leadership positions, women may end up with less access to senior-level sponsorship,\" the report noted. \nRelated: Japan's program to boost senior women at work is a dud \nWhen it comes to perceptions of gender discrimination, there's a wide gap. \nWomen are four times more likely than men to think they have fewer opportunities to advance because of their gender. And they're more likely to say they missed out on an assignment, promotion or raise for the same reason. They also report being consulted less on important decisions. \nBy contrast, 70% of men say gender diversity is important, but only 12% think women have fewer opportunities than they do. \nAnd among all respondents, only a third think gender diversity is a top priority for their direct manager. \nThe study doesn't assert a causal link between the views held by respondents and the underrepresentation of women at the top. But it does provide \"signals\" to companies concerned about gender diversity, the report's authors told CNNMoney. \nFor instance, a company may say gender diversity is important, but it needs to do more to foster it. \nThat means tracking key metrics over time -- such as promotion rates and attrition rates. It might mean beefing up professional development programs that better direct women to senior roles. And it might mean getting a better beat on employee perceptions, such as where women feel barriers to advancement or why they are drawn to staff roles.
