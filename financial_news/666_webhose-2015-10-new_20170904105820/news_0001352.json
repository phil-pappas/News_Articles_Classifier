Known best for its popular animated feature films and tourist-favorite theme parks and resorts, Disney has held a major piece of America’s media identity since its founding in 1923. The corporation has grown enormously since its humble beginnings as a cartoon studio, amassing well-known film, radio, music, television, and other various assets.\n\n\n\nSo what companies, exactly, does Disney operate? Here’s a breakdown of the companies by industry that the media conglomerate owns.\n\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios \n\n\n\nView gallery\n. \nImage via flickreel.com \n\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios is home to four major film studios: Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Lucasfilm Ltd, and Marvel Studios. The company’s animation studio has produced an impressive 54 animated feature films, beginning with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937. Pixar, who received funding from late Apple (AAPL) co-founder Steve Jobs (he was also the studio’s majority shareholder before Disney bought the company in 2006), has produced 15 films. Together, these films have earned 15 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and 11 Grammy Awards. Seven of these films won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature; Up and Toy Story 3 were even nominated for the prestigious Best Picture Oscar.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Studios, which has produced many movies based on Marvel comic book characters: The Avengers , X-Men , Spider-man , and Guardians of the Galaxy are just the beginning in a long list of successful Marvel superhero franchises. And in 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm Ltd, the studio best known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises.\n\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios also dabbles in music production, controlling the record label Hollywood Records. Notable artists on the label include Queen, Zendaya, and Demi Lovato.\n\n\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Interactive Media \n\n\n\nView gallery\n. \nDisney Store in Paris.

It also operates The Muppets Studio, which produces Muppet-themed movies and television specials, and Disney Publishing Worldwide, a subsidiary that publishes the popular young adult franchises Star Darling and Waterfire Saga , as well as Hyperion Books for children.\n\n\n\nWalt Disney Parks and Resorts \n\n\n\nView gallery\n. \nWalt Disney World Resort, Florida. Image via disneyworld.com \n\n\n\nAside from its animated movies, Disney’s Walt Disney Parks and Resorts are the corporation’s most well-known attractions. Disneyland Park, one of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, was Disney’s first major theme park. It first opened back in 1955, and is known for its iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle. The other Anaheim-located park is Disney California, which opened in 2001 and is dedicated to the state of California.  \n\n\n\nArguably Disney’s most popular theme park is Walt Disney World Resort, located in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando. Attractions include four major parks: Magic Kingdom Park, home to a life-size version of Cinderella’s castle, the company’s most recognizable landmark; Epcot; Hollywood Studios; and Animal Kingdom Park. The resort is also home to two water parks.\n\n\n\nWalt Disney Parks and Resorts are not limited to just the U.S. The corporation operates the successful Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, as well as Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which opened its doors in 2005. Disney has plans to open Shanghai Disney Resort in China, with a slated spring 2016 launch. Disney also operates a popular cruise line.\n\n\n\nThinking of visiting?

It’s biggest subsidiary under Disney Media Networks is ABC, which produces hit network shows Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder and its flagship evening news program ABC World News Tonight . Disney also owns part of Hulu, an Internet streaming video service, along with 21 st Century Fox (FOXA) (under FOX Broadcasting Company) and Comcast (CMCSA) (under NBCUniversal Television Group).\n\n\n\nDisney also operates A&E Networks, in a joint venture with Hearst Corporation, whose popular television channels include A&E, home to Storage Wars , The First 48 , Duck Dynasty , and the scripted series Bates Motel , as well as The History Channel.
