Initially, 100 cases for e-hearing will be identified in each of these charges and the major part of assessment processing will be conducted in an electronic mode. \nThe move, CBDT said, \"would eliminate the necessity of visiting income-tax offices by taxpayers, particularly in smaller cases, involving limited issues and where taxpayer is able to provide details required by the Assessing Officer without necessitating his physical presence\". \nCases covered under the pilot project would be those which have been selected for scrutiny on the basis of AIR/CIB information or non-matching with 26AS-data. \nAIR is Annual Information Return and CIB is Credit Information Bureau while Form 26AS contains details of tax deducted on behalf of the taxpayer by deductors. \n\"Consent of taxpayers should also be obtained in the beginning and cases of only willing taxpayers be considered under the pilot project,\" the order said. I-T officers will use their official e-mail IDs to interact with the taxpayers at the e-mails mentioned in their respective returns of income. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:20:31.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
