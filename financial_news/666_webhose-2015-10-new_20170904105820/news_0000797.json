Work on the passenger terminal-II at AAKIA was progressing and expected to be ready by the end of 2016. \"The government is determined to improve its infrastructure. It is a continuation of good work done in the past five years as per Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) manifesto,\" Dr Shein said adding, \"We have successfully expanded the runway and built an apron, which were opened last January. We have also improved security at the airport including stopping stray animals and children,\" Dr Shein said after inspecting different sections of the new building.
