In turn, investors are snapping up the bricks and mortar as well as the management.\nAccording to agents there has been more than $2.5 billion in transactions completed in the first half of 2015, the second largest transaction pipeline across the Asia Pacific region.\nCBRE's 2015 Asia Pacific Hotel MarketView report shows robust appetite for hotel property across the country, with Australia ranking second behind Hong Kong in terms of transaction activity.\nEarlier this month, an offshore Chinese buyer scooped the Pensione Hotel in Melbourne for circa $26 million, while a number of other sales are preparing to conclude over the coming weeks, including the 225-room Tune Hotel in Melbourne, the Wyndham TRYP Hotel in Brisbane's Fortitude Valley, the Ibis Styles Cairns and the Crowne Plaza Terrigal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:43:17.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
