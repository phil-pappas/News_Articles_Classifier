More Backlash over ousting of fund body chief \nLendInvest is seeking to raise £150m for the float of the London-listed fund, according to people familiar with the launch. \nIt will target an eight per cent annual yield, mainly through loans made on the LendInvest platform, which currently consist of bridging loans of up to 36 months secured against residential properties. \nIt will also hold equity in the platform itself, which hopes to list on the main London market and originated £250m of loans in the financial year 2014-15. \nLendInvest aims to launch the fund early next year, depending on market conditions. \n“A listed fund is an attractive proposition and one that would make a lot of sense for our business,” the company said. \nLendInvest lends to professional landlords and says it currently commands 10 per cent of the UK short-term mortgage market, with average loan terms of seven to eight months. \nLendInvest was spun out of the real estate investment business Montello Capital Management, which already runs two unlisted funds investing in its bridging loans. \nFunding Circle, the largest P2P platform for business lending, is also raising money for its own listed fund. \nChina’s Beijing Kunlun backs UK peer-to-peer lender LendInvest \nChinese investors are turning to international peer-to-peer lending platforms in search of higher returns, as competition in the fast-growing alternative finance sector heats up. Beijing Kunlun, a Chinese-listed technology company, has struck a deal to back British P2P platform LendInvest with a £22m investment. \nRead more \nThe existing alternative lending investment trusts — P2P Global Investments, VPC Specialty Lending, and Ranger Direct Lending — are all trading at premiums; the largest, P2P Global Investments, is currently yielding 4.6 per cent. Lendinvest has not so far given these funds access to its platform. \nProperty loans are one of the fastest-growing segments in the booming lending industry, which has originated almost £2bn of loans in the year to date. \nBut some commentators have cautioned over the speed of its expansion. John Spiers, who founded the online investment supermarket Bestinvest, warned this week that the sector’s credit standards needed to be tested through a full market cycle. \n“Peer-to-peer is fundamentally a great idea, but it would be good for it to evolve a bit more slowly. It hasn’t got that history through a crisis period,” he said. \nLendInvest, which is itself profitable and closed a £22m Series A funding round in June, has experienced bad debt but has carried out successful recoveries of the underlying assets on behalf of investors.
