This is the question posed by Youthonomics, a new Paris based think tank dedicated to elevating the young. This query is perhaps extreme. However, in a paper introducing their initiative Youthonomics founders José Ramos-Horta and Felix Marquardt raise a number of pressing questions about young people's economic prospects.They ask: \"What might happen when, for the first time, a generation opts not to transmit anything to the next? What might happen when millennials understand just how badly their parents and grandparents jeopardized their future?\"In addition to a dwindling global net generational transfer of wealth Ramos-Horta, former president of East Timor and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Marquardt, an activist and former head of communications for the International Herald Tribune, cite increasing responsibility for older generations' retirement and decreasing confidence about their own golden years as major economic issues facing youth.To gauge how the young are managing around the globe Youthonomics recently released a ranking of 64 countries according to the potential for youth to prosper within their borders. They define youth as people ages 15 to 29. The index is based on 59 criteria including: youth unemployment rates, quality and cost of education, housing affordability, public deficit, access to technology, political and religious freedom and average age of elected officials.The index only includes countries for which all 59 data points could be collected. This means many of the smallest and poorest countries are not represented. Neither are countries like Syria or North Korea, which war and authoritarian regimes have made terrible places to live at any age. Marquardt said in an interview that they hope to add more countries each year.At the top of the list is Norway. The Scandinavian country, Marquardt points out, demonstrates a number of best practices including a flexible labor market. Making it easy to hire and fire people generally bodes well for young people, he says. Norway and Sweden (ranked fourth) even share employment data, so when there is no job for a young person in one country the government will fund their trip to interview for an open position in the other. Likely not coincidentally Norway also frequently scores highly in happiness rankings .On the other end of the spectrum, Côte d'Ivoire ranked 64th of 64 in the index, with low scores on early education, university completion, working and living conditions, and health. The West African nation has struggled with bouts of violence since civil war broke out in 2002, including a clash that killed more than 3,000 people when the country last attempted to hold a democratic election in 2010. The first presidential election since then is scheduled for this month.What about the United States? The U.S. ranked 13th, behind some developed nations including Australia, German and Canada but ahead others like the United Kingdom, France and Japan. A few facts that contributed to America's rank:\nThe United States ranks 18th for the quality of the early education t The U.S. ranks 53rd in student debt t The U.S. ranks 27th for youth unemployment t American youth ranks 31st in terms of access to mortgages t The U.S. ranks 46th for youth suicide t The average age of a congressman is over 60 To see the full list of The Best And Worst Countries To Be Young, click here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:14:27.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
