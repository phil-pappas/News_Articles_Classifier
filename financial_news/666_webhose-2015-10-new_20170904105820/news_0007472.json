The IMF said that fighting in Iraq, Libya, and Yemen could spillover into neighbouring countries. \nApart from Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, most countries will find that oil is nowhere near the “break-even” levels they require to balance their books. “Oil exporters will need to adjust their spending and revenue policies to secure fiscal sustainability,” the fund said. \nMany economies will find themselves reliant on whatever financial assets they have left - their “fiscal buffers” - in order to survive after the sharp falls in income they now face. Yemen, Libya, and Bahrain are among those set to run out of room within the next five years. \nThe outlook for the MENAP region “is dominated by geopolitical and oil price developments”, the IMF said in a report . The fund predicts that the area’s oil exporters will see GDP rise by 2.5pc this year, lower than the 3pc it had pencilled in in May. \n“There is considerable uncertainty about next year’s projections,” the IMF said, highlighting that raising the region’s longer-term prospects would “require extensive structural reforms”. \nThe fund acknowledged that growing risks to global growth could further imperil the fiscal footing of economies in the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:43:42.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
