The dynamic security code solution replaces the 3-digit static code located on the back of the card, used to confirm online payments. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151001006062/en/ (Photo: Business Wire) The dynamic security code is designed to effectively combat payment card fraud, in which hackers obtain the payment information used when consumers make purchases online. The dynamic code changes regularly, meaning that it is impossible to reuse. To carry out the trial, BNP Paribas chose Oberthur Technologies’ OT MOTION CODE™ solution. The payment cards have a screen on their back displaying a security code that is regularly refreshed. This dynamic security code strengthens the security of online payments for BNP Paribas customers, without the slightest change to their customer experience. Marc Espagnon, Head of Payment and Cash Management at BNP Paribas said: “ The trial is fully in line with BNP Paribas’ desire to constantly improve our customer experience. By testing this solution with our customers in France, we believe that we will increase their confidence in online payments through increased security ”. “ At OT, our priority is to constantly adapt to new consumer purchasing habits and provide payment solutions that guarantee both maximum security and optimum user-friendliness . With MOTION CODE™, OT is offering a fully integrated solution, from production of the card to installation of authentication servers ”, said Eric Duforest, Managing Director of the Financial Services Institutions at OT. “ More than 90% of online transactions in France are made using payment cards. The dynamic security code will improve the security of purchases made online and is compatible with all e-commerce websites. We are glad to have supported BNP Paribas and OT in this innovative move”, said Gilbert Arira, Groupement CB CEO. BNP Paribas regularly rolls out improvements to its payment cards with new features that provide its customers with increasingly individualized and secure ways to use their cards, such as choosing the card design, a revolving credit option, and a 24/7 alert service for suspected fraud. This innovative new development completes our portfolio of solutions offering daily support to our customers.
