India is following a similar trend and slowly making its mark as a premier ‘Land of Festivals’. In a nation as diverse as India, several cultures have, over the centuries, made India a land of everlasting festivals. Every small occasion, from welcoming the spring or rain and the harvesting of crops, to seeing the full moon, lends itself to joyous celebrations splashed with colours, music, folk dances and songs. Festivals in India will take you for a holy dip in one of its numerous rivers, or cover you with scented colour, swing you sky high, give you elephant or camel rides, and invite you to joyous day and night-long singing, dancing and feasting.\nRealising the potential of festivals and learning from the achievements of world renowned festivals such as the Rio Carnival in Brazil, La Tomatina in Spain and St Patrick’s Day Festivities in Ireland, even state tourism ministries have, in recent times, shifted their focus to promoting and showcasing Indian festivals to the world, as well as upping their marketing initiatives for increased domestic footfall.\nThe Navratri festival, Diwali and the Rann Utsav of Kutch are the most significant and internationally renowned festivals and India witnesses’ major inbound traffic during these. This is a major attraction for international tourists, who want to explore these festivals and experience a cultural extravaganza. Hotels.com introduces seasonal sales and deals to promote the festive season. In fact with the on-going festival sale one can avail upto 50 per cent discount on hotel accommodation. Every year new and attractive deals designed around the festival circuit for both inbound and domestic tourists are introduced.\n 13, 2015 5:26 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:59:28.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
