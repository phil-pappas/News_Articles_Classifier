Bloomberg by Christopher Niesche For many investors the steep decline in global equity markets over the past three months has been an unnerving experience.\nFor others it represents an opportunity to buy new stocks or top up existing positions.\nGlobal stocks lost ground as China's currency devaluation and the US Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates raised concerns about the health of those economies and the implications for global growth.\nThe US S&P 500 index fell 12 per cent from its peak in July, although it has recovered about half those losses, while London's FTSE 100 is down more than 10 per cent from 2015's high and the Shanghai market is down about a third from its peak.\nThe volatility might continue, with ongoing uncertainty about the timing of a US rate rise and the strength of the Chinse economy.\nKevin Bertoli, portfolio manager Asia at PM Capital, says the sell-off of quality stocks along with the underperformers is not all bad news. \"Now is a great opportunity to buy because everything's been sold off – everything gets tarred with the same brush when you have these sell-offs,\" he says.\nPM Capital is tapping into the trend of increasing consumption by Asia's middle class with stocks including Baidu and Pax Global.\nShares have plunged Baidu is the dominant internet search engine in China. Its shares are listed on the US Nasdaq technology exchange and have plunged about 30 per cent since June. Pax Global makes point-of-sale terminals for credit cards and is one of the top three global players. Its Hong Kong-listed shares are down about 35 per cent since June.\n\"Despite the fact that their Chinese business might be slowing down, they've got significant growth potential outside of China as they take share from Verifone, which is one of the big global players,\" Bertoli says.\nThough he doesn't generally take broad-brush views of markets or particular sectors, Chris Demasi, of Montgomery Investment Management, notes that the US healthcare sector has declined more than 10 per cent from its highs in August. Healthcare services in the US are set to expand, thanks to the ageing population and Obamacare providing an additional 30 million people with healthcare coverage, Demasi says.\n\"That's a really interesting fundamental space and when you combine that with stock prices trading lower almost in unison with each other across the sector, that provides interesting hunting ground in terms of looking for bargains,\" he says.\nHe highlights CVS Health, which owns one of the largest networks of retail pharmacies across the country and is one of the largest pharmaceutical benefits recipients across the US, and so can negotiate the best prices from drug companies and other providers.\nLike the healthcare sector, the stock has fallen about 10 per cent over the past few months.\nDragged down Montgomery has also added recently to its position in Apple, because the stock has been dragged down by concerns about the smartphone market, which Demasi says isn't reflective of Apple's potential. While smartphone sales have declined in China over the past year for the first time, iPhone sales and App Store sales there doubled.\n\"If you combine that with the current stock price and the valuation, and we think there's a great margin of safety, there is a lot of upside still,\" Demasi says.\nThe stock is down about a 20 per cent from its high of more than $US132 in July.\nNathan Bell, research director at Peters MacGregor Capital Management, says the firm is a value investor but has nonetheless used the sell-off as an opportunity to increase its holdings in Rolls Royce and i Liberty Media.\nBritish-listed Rolls Royce makes jet engines for wide-bodied aircraft – the car division was sold several decades ago – and has a record order book for jet engines for the coming years.\nSets company up While Rolls Royce doesn't actually make profit from selling engines, that order book sets up the company for strong earnings in the next couple of decades because it makes most of its profit from the maintenance contracts that go with engine sales.\n\"The financials at the moment look pretty poor because they've been selling their engines at a discount to get more customers to buy them,\" Bell says. \"Over the next five or 10 years you'll start to see all the money come in from those maintenance contracts.\"\nShares in the company have performed poorly in 2015, dropping from a high of 1061 pence in April to about 710 pence last week.\nPeters MacGregor has also topped up its holding in Liberty Media, whose biggest asset is its holding in SiriusXM, which provides 160 channels of satellite radio to US motorists, for up to $US13 a month.\nThe business is essentially a monopoly. SiriusXM doesn't compete on music, yet spends about $US300 million a year on content. In the years to come about 80 per cent of cars in North America will have the capability to receive the service, effectively locking out anyone who wants to introduce an alternative service. There is also a shortage of digital spectrum.\nLiberty Media has dropped from its recent high of more than $US31 in August to as low as $US26 and was trading recently at less than $US28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:40:51.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
