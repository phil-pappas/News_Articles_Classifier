Some have even called the current system a \"cartel\". \nGerman lender Fidor Bank even had to delay its UK launch because it could not strike a deal with one of the four big banks which offer access to the payments infrastructure. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) can be expensive to set up the systems necessary to access the payments infrastructure, preventing small banks from joining up directly. \n“If you are a large player, those fixed costs are spread over a large number of payments, and they become pretty much invisible” said Craig Tillotson, chief executive of Faster Payments. \n“If you are a very small player, or a current small player but plan to become a big player, those costs can be quite significant in the early days and if your volumes are low. The time has come to open this up.” \nThe new idea from Faster Payments is to allow fintech companies to access the system in the same way that the big banks do, then to sell access to the challenger banks. \nThis should offer a lower cost per transaction to the challenger banks, then when they grow to a larger scale around 13m transactions per year the price per transaction is expected to hit roughly the same level that big banks pay for direct access. \n“As a new challenger bank or payment service provider, you recognise that real-time, 24/7 payments are an important part of your enterprise, and if you have a choice of vendors you can essentially do a competitive tender for who will provide access into the Faster Payments service,” said Mr Tillotson. \nCurrently 10 large players plug directly into the system, and around 400 smaller firms pay them for indirect access. \nSo far 10 fintech firms have signed letters of intent to say they want to create the systems giving access to smaller banks, which include ACI Worldwide, Bottomline Technologies, FIS, Fiserv (NasdaqGS: FISV - news ) , Fundtech. \nThree are almost ready to launch, with only final technology and reliability testing to take place in the coming weeks, while another three hope to join them soon. \nMr Tillotson hopes to launch the scheme with several tech firms so there is immediately a range of providers on offer. \nHe expects as many as 50 of the firms currently gaining access through the big banks could end up switching to the new providers. \nOnce this system is established, he expects the fintech firms will look to move on to providing the same service for the BACS and CHAPS payments systems, and potentially processing cheque payments too, once the mobile cheque imaging system is adopted across the banking sector next year. \nAs a result he expects there could be room for as many as six fintech firms to turn this into a long-term, profitable business. \nThey could even expand internationally. \n“Europe is looking at realtime payments, the US and the Australians are looking at it. So there is a strategic advantage to fintech firms, which is that if you are a UK Faster Payments accredited aggregator, that has value to you for bidding for future contracts in the US and Europe,” Mr Tillotson said. \n“It reinforces the UK and London as the heart of fintech at the moment .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:54:56.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
