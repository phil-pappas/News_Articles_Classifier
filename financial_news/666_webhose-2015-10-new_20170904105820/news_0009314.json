FB 2.11 % and Google GOOGL 0.00 % that are funneled to tax havens such as Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. The rules could also hasten structural change at some of the world’s biggest technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 2.09 % and Apple Inc. AAPL 0.36 %\nExecutives at several tech companies say they are already considering relying less on some offshore tax havens, while declaring more income in countries such as France, Germany and the U.K.\n“We’re seeing the beginning of the end of structures that are deemed artificial,” one of the tech executives said.\nENLARGE A YouTube area at Google’s Paris offices.

They have all said in the past they pay the tax they owe.\nWhile the new rules don’t explicitly target tech firms, the companies have come in for special scrutiny because they generate significant revenue in many European countries but pay relatively little income tax in them. Even though tech companies have lobbied hard to push back new rules that would have targeted them specifically, many of the broader recommendations will have an impact on taxation in the digital economy.\nHow broad an impact the new rules will have on companies and how much tax they will pay remains unclear. While the recommendations represent a consensus view among OECD member countries, they will need to be enacted through tax treaties. National tax authorities will then need to interpret the new rules.\nSeveral tech executives say they worry that the new rules might be implemented differently by countries and companies. That could lead to new disputes among countries over how to allocate revenue, and legal wrangling between companies and tax authorities over how much to pay whom.\n“It will be a period of increased compliance costs and increased controversy,” said Manal Corwin, head of the international tax practice of KPMG LLP in Washington, D.C.\nEarlier this year, for instance, the U.K. implemented what it calls a diverted profit tax , in anticipation of the new OECD recommendations. Proponents say it is in line with where the think tank was heading, but an OECD official warned at the time that the U.K.’s approach could undermine its multilateral plan.\nIreland also said it would, by 2020, phase out one of the most widely used tax loopholes, dubbed the double Irish , in anticipation of the new rules. Indeed, Monday’s recommendations include changes to certain types of national legislation like that in Ireland that made the loophole possible.\nChanges to a legal concept called permanent establishment could also lead more money to be taxed in countries where companies do business than had previously been the case. Under tax treaties, the profit of a foreign company is usually only taxable in a country if it has a permanent establishment there.\nThe concept has helped shape corporate structures across Europe. Many tech companies, such as Google, maintain a single headquarters in a tax-advantaged country where they collect all their revenue from external clients. The companies don’t declare external revenue in other countries because they claim various exceptions to the permanent-establishment definition under current tax treaties. It is exactly that kind of structure that has led to a fight between Google and France .\nAmazon, which is facing a tax inquiry at the European Union, is the first tech giant to change its structure. Earlier this year, it started collecting revenue from customers in several European countries , including the U.K., Germany and France, rather than funneling all of its sales through low-tax Luxembourg.\nBut it is unclear how much more—if any—taxes Amazon will pay under the plan because it attributes costs, such as the wholesale purchase of books, to individual countries as well, according to a person familiar with Amazon’s vendor contracts. That could largely offset the new revenue, given Amazon’s razor-thin margins.\n—Paul Hannon in London contributed to this article.\nWrite to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP941_TECHTA_M_20151005160751.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KP941_TECHTA_P_20151005160751.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:57:35.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
