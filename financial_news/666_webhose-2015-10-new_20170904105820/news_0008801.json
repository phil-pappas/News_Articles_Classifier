Among the provisions in the law, enacted in 2012, was transferring hiring and firing decisions from the hands of school boards to superintendents. Following the enactment of the law, Cooper and the School Board were frequently at odds over personnel and management decisions, which ultimately led to Cooper's termination hearing. \nThe board upheld four charges brought against Cooper: two related to the employment and payment of Thad Welch, a special assistant to the superintendent, who continued to work for the district after the board removed funding for his position; the principal pay issue; and payment of Roy's legal services in 2013. \nDuring a two-day hearing last month, Michot found the board erred in its interpretation of state law related to Roy's legal bill and the Welch issue, but said it acted within its authority related to its decision to fire Cooper on the principal pay issue. \nIn a memo to support the motion for a new trial, Roy wrote: \"If the court believes that the issue of the hiring of the principals involved was a matter that should have not taken place, it can certainly indicate that. The argument we have is that it is not a grounds for termination of anyone, and we believe that the court should so recognize and indicate.\" \nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com \nThink your friends should see this?
