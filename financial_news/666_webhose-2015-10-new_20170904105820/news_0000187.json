In the past few days there have been three clear indications that George Osborne’s Mansion House speech in June, at which he signalled the end of the persecutory phase in regulatory attitudes towards the nation’s lenders, might be more than just words. \nFirst (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , there was the news that Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) is lining up Jes Staley to be its next chief executive. The American investment banker was thought to have been the board’s favoured choice to replace Bob Diamond in 2012. But in the poisonous political climate following the fallout from the Libor scandal and the breakdown in relations between Barclays and the Bank of England, Antony Jenkins was deemed a more palatable choice. That the UK bank can now revert to Plan A suggests the times they are a-changing. \nSecond, the Bank of England has dropped the most controversial aspect of its Senior Managers Regime the “reversal of the burden of proof”. As the draft rules stood up until Wednesday night, if you were a senior manager at a financial institution and there was a failure in your area, you would have had to prove that you took “all reasonable steps” to prevent the problem. In other words, the onus was on you to prove your innocence rather than on regulators to prove your guilt. \nHowever, the watchdog has now decided not to overturn one of the central tenets of UK law the presumption of innocence just for bankers. \nThe Bank of England and financial services bill will include a statutory duty for all senior managers to make every effort to ensure that rules aren’t broken. But it will be down to the regulators to prove some degree of negligence before they can fine or ban miscreants. \nThird, banks will be able to transfer capital between different parts of the business under new ringfencing rules. This is, arguably, the biggest development of all. But there is a big “but”. \nThe move to force banks to separate their retail arms into separate subsidiaries from their investment banks and international operations is the key plank of the UK government’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. The theory is that, if the retail deposits and payment systems are ring-fenced (with their own funding, liquidity, corporate structure and even board), then they can live on even if the rest of the bank goes bust. \nThe principle here is absolutely sound. The rules should ensure that investors won’t recklessly lend money to banks believing that the government will step in if things go wrong; this removes so-called “moral hazard” from the system, allowing capitalism to operate as it should rewarding success and punishing failure. \nThere have been a variety of responses from the different banks to these proposals. That’s because UK lenders all have very different business models. The rules will have a limited impact on Lloyds, Santander UK (LSE: 44RS.L - news ) and now that it is a much smaller and simpler institution than it once was the Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) ; they are a real headache for HSBC and Barclays, which are larger and more complex beasts. \nThe Treasury has estimated that it will cost the UK banks around £3.5bn to put the ringfences in place and another £4bn a year to maintain them. The credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s has suggested, not unreasonably, that these costs will likely be passed on to bank customers in one way or another. But these are all guesses because the rules have yet to be finalised. \nThere has, however, been some progress. Until yesterday, banks also didn’t know whether the retail bank would be able to provide funding to the corporate and investment banking operations. Without this, there was a good chance that the parts of the bank outside the ringfence might have lost their investment grade credit ratings and therefore their ability to operate in some areas. The biggest banks would have had to completely rip up their business models. \nThe rules set out yesterday by the Bank of England remove this worst-case scenario. The ring-fenced retail operation will be able to pay dividends to the parent group as long as it has met its own capital requirements and subject to getting the nod from the Bank. \nThere’s still a problem though. There are a variety of strands to the new rule such as what exactly will and won’t be inside the ringfence and the corporate structure of the separated entities. But the capital, liquidity and funding requirements are the most important. Few would argue with the Prudential Regulatory Authority’s belief that the retail arms of UK banks need “sufficient capital resources”. But what’s sufficient? \nThe PRA has yet to say how much capital the ring-fenced part of the bank must hold. So, banks know that the retail arm will be able to pass capital to the rest of the bank once it has passed a certain threshold. But they don’t yet know what that threshold will be. Nor do they know how the regulators will calibrate other measures of safety like leverage and funding ratios; these will depend on international financial rules which are also still works in progress. \nUntil all these wrinkles are ironed out, UK banks won’t know whether the rules might handicap them relative to their international rivals. \nIt looks like the era of bank bashing might be drawing to an end but not yet the regulatory uncertainty. \n• Banks are a buy, investment advice from Kyle Caudwell \nben.wright@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:27:02.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
