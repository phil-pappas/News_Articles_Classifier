Michael Regan by Vesna Poljak Ajax, Arsenal and Bayern Munich won just two trophies between them last season, but in the eyes of credit analysts, they are the real champions of Europe.\nThe ratings agency Standard & Poor's has ranked the financial metrics of some of the world's top clubs to assemble a virtual football league of the credit world where the term clean sheet takes on new meaning and possession is a borrower's worst nightmare.\nThe top two, Ajax and Arsenal, are unchanged from 2014 while Bayern rose to third from eighth having won the Bundesliga and advancing to the final four of the Champions League competition.\nA strong showing in Europe's most prestigious club tournament has a huge impact on club revenues and accounts for the biggest moves in table positions.\nS&P Capital\n\"This is illustrated by Roma's rise (16 places) and the falls of Manchester United and Valencia (both dropping 12 places),\" author Pavle Sabic said in a new report.\nLure of the Champions League Roma finished third in a tough group during the 2014-15 tournament, while Manchester United and Valencia did not compete. However, they both qualified for the 2015-16 competition currently underway.\n\"What this demonstrates is that the lure of the Champions League, from both a sporting and financial perspective, is so great that clubs might forgo other tournaments (and potential trophies) to prioritise it,\" Mr Sabic said.\n The reliance of football clubs on debt funding to stay alive lends itself to credit analysis where EBITDA interest coverage ratios could mean the difference between big spending in the transfer market, or talent fire sales and relegation.\nS&P's sample is made-up of 44 European clubs. Those that do not not disclose enough information to make an informed analysis, such as those with sole owners, were not awarded a ranking within the league table but given a separate probability of default credit score.\nThis is a figure estimating the chance of collapse within the next 12 months. Financial ruin has gutted some of the most storied clubs in Europe since the global financial crisis and the region's sovereign debt crisis.\nChelsea on top Chelsea boasts the most attractive default score of 0.5066 per cent, which earns the club the equivalent of a triple-B-minus rating, the lowest level considered investment grade. Non-investment grade ratings are known as junk, or more politely, high-yield.\nEven though it generates a fraction of the revenue of Chelsea ($US9 million versus $US489 million), Scotland's Dundee United is close to investment grade territory with a score of 0.56 per cent, equivalent to a rating of double-b-plus.\nIn Spain, Real Madrid boasted a better assessment than Barcelona despite trailing its La Liga counterpart in on-field results - Barcelona won the 2014-15 Champions League, Real Madrid were knocked out in the semi-finals. Barcelona's probability of default score is 2.237 per cent; Real Madrid 0.711 per cent.\nLiverpool is estimated at 9.6205 per cent and Paris Saint-Germain 16.62 per cent.\nAs it does with corporate credits, the ratings group blended its club-specific analysis with sovereign scores that account for country risk. This penalises emerging markets clubs, including in Brazil, where the economy has ground to a halt from the collapse in commodity prices and its currency. Brazil on ratings watch, risking a downgrade to junk.\nAustralian clubs would likely struggle in S&P's league table. According to a new book by The Australian Financial Review 's John Stensholt and co-author Shaun Mooney , Nathan Tinkler accumulated debts of more than $22 million by the end of his period as owner of Newcastle Jets.", "external_links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3281576/Arsenal-2-0-Bayern-Munich-Olivier-Giroud-Mesut-Ozil-Champions-League-hopes-alive-late-goal-Arsene-Wenger-s-produce-brilliant-counter-attacking-display-beat-Germans.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/bayern-munich-goalkeeper-manuel-neuer-pulls-off-wonder-save-against-arsenal-in-20-loss-20151020-gke7ja.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:02:45.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
