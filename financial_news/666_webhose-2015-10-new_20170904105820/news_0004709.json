Based on that, he said, the U.S. central bank should be able to keep on track with an initial rate hike expected in October or December.\nBut he also cautioned the group that the United States is now more exposed than ever to international events and that developments in China and elsewhere had already influenced the Fed to delay a widely expected rate increase in September.\n\"We do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,\" he said. \"That said, recent employment reports have been somewhat disappointing and, as always, we are closely monitoring developments that could affect our sense of the economic outlook and the risks surrounding that outlook.\"\nFischer was speaking on the sidelines of an IMF meeting where some other central bankers were encouraging the Fed to eliminate uncertainty and move forward with their rate \"lift-off.\"\nBut Fischer said the implications of a global slowdown were to0 serious to ignore and would not let the Fed overcommit on its plans.\nEven though uncertainty about the Fed's intentions might itself roil global markets, \"We remain committed to communicating our intentions as clearly as possible - but not more than the facts warrant,\" he said.
