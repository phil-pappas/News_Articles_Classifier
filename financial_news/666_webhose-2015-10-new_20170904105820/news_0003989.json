We trust them, they trust us.\" \nMr de Rivaz added that UK customers would save £30-a-year on their bills compared with an energy mix that did not include nuclear, and said it was \"good for the environment\" to have \"reliable, low-carbon, secure energy for decades to come\". \nThe construction costs of the Hinkley plant is forecast to total £18bn and it should start generating power in 2025. \nSome 25,000 jobs will be created during the building phase of the plant, while it will support 900 direct jobs during its 60-year lifespan. \nThe scheme also aims to create 1,000 apprenticeships along with £14m of investment in education and training. \nHe Yu, chairman of China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) said: \"Entering the UK's nuclear market marks a new phase for CGN. \n\"CGN is highly committed to delivering safe, cost efficient, and sustainable energy and to supporting the UK's goal of becoming a low-carbon society.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:21:18.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
