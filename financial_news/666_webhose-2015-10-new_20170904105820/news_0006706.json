Do you want State of the Nation delivered to your inbox every morning at 9.30am? Sign-up to our email alert at the bottom of this story. \nEveryone’s talking about… \nIT PROBABLY DOESN’T help perceptions around Nama’s secretive dealings that they are named like some sort of villainous plot from a James Bond movie. \nBut today the Public Accounts Committee will question the agency’s top executives about ‘Project Eagle’ and the the sale of an 800 property loanbook worth €1.6 billion. \nThe controversy has been brought to the fore by Mick Wallace TD who says that the portfolio was worth €4.5 billion. \nDuring the summer, the Wexford deputy claimed that an audit of a legal firm involved in the sale process revealed that £7 million ended up in an Isle of Man bank account and this was “reportedly earmarked for a Northern Ireland politician”. \nPeople of both political and and business hues had been pushing a somewhat partitionist approach to the issues, essentially that it’s a Northern problem. \nBut today the it comes south when, as well as those Nama officials, the chair of the Northern Ireland finance committee Daithi McKay will brief TDs and Senators. That committee has been carrying out its own inquiries. \nSpeaking this morning on Morning Ireland, PAC member Shane Ross said that it was “utterly absurd” of Nama to attempt to make these problems about Northern Ireland alone. \nHe added that he felt it was it a perfect opportunity for politicians both north and south to work together in an inquiry. \nThe agenda Facing questions in the Dáil first thing this morning will be Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin. The deaths of babies at the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise have led to a meeting on Ireland’s maternity services with some top health officials in from 9.30am. As mentioned above, Nama’s top brass are at the Public Accounts Committee from 10am. Ireland’s decision to opt-in to a EU’s relocation programme for migrants is to be meted out in the Dáil at 10.45 am. High noon for Leaders Questions. Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald and her Northern counterpart David Ford are at a seminar on cross-border organised crime in Sligo. In the Seanad, they’ll also be discussing the migration crisis from 1pm. A new law that seeks to change how people can make taxation appeals is to be debated this morning. \n\nInside Leinster House \nWhile everyone may speculate all they want about the date of the general election, a senior government source was last night unequivocal in their response. \n“Anybody who says they know Enda Kenny’s thinking on the date of the general election is lying.” \n\nWhat the others are saying The managing director of Volkswagen Ireland has been invited before the Oireachtas transport committee to discuss the emissions scandal, reports the Irish Examiner. Fine Gale’s Patrick O’Donnell wants the licence fee cut by €60 because RTÉ has failed to fully reveal their salaries and expeses, says the Irish Independent. Alan Shatter TD has tabled a bill that seeks to stop delays in putting referendum changes into effect, reports the Irish Times. \n\nIn case you missed it… As expected, former Fianna Fáil minister Mary Hanfin was added to the electoral ticket in Dun Laoghaire. The Taoiseach was urged to get involved in the case of Dublin residents being forced to pay for fire-safety repairs in their apartments. Jobs Minster Richard Bruton announced 200 jobs at Accenture in Dublin. In the the UK, things took a turn for the bizarre for Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking of bizarre, Enda Kenny insisted he was serious about high-speed burglars wearing night-vision goggles. Political pressure (and a Supreme Court ruling) means that an LGBT rights group will march in the New York St Patrick’s Day parade next year. Oh, and of course everyone is still trying to read Enda’s mind on the date of the general election. November or February is the question Enda Kenny he’s pondering. \n\nGood day for… Fine Gael insiders. Whether the election is in November or February, they have the media talking about what they want them to talk about. \nBad day for… The ‘old boys’ (and girls). The addition of former minister Mary Hanafin to the ticket in Dún Laoghaire was labelled as a ‘complete joke’ from within her own party. It certainly doesn’t help perceptions after Seán Haughey was added to the ticket in Dublin Bay North alongside Deidre Heney. \nOn the Twitter machine… \nGetting students to your stall on clubs and socs day in college is always a dog eat dog challenge, but a cardboard cut out of Willie O’Dea certainly helps .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:22:19.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
