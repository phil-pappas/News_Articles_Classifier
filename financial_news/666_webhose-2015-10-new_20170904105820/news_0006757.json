The first-place award of USD 25,000 went to Team Space Exploration Architecture and Clouds Architecture Office for their design, Mars Ice House.\n“Given the predicted abundance of water in certain areas on Mars, our approach takes full advantage of its properties as an indigenous material that acts both as a life-force to sustain a human and plant ecosystem, and, when 3D printed, as our primary fabrication material,” the team said.\nAs water is a means of sustaining life and ice a potential building material, the team opted to locate at Alba Mons in Mars’ northern hemisphere, where it is believed sub-surface water ice is plentiful.\nThe proposal uses a lander as the basis of the shelter, containing both private and communal interior spaces. Once in situ, it would deploy an inflatable membrane to create an interstitial environment between the outside of the capsule and the Mars atmosphere.\nRovers would then extract water from the ice below the surface at Alba Mons and apply it to form a protective skin on the inside of the inflatable environment.\nThe layer of ice would provide protection from radiation in the outside atmosphere, and it would also be translucent and allow light into the habitat, ‘Gizmag’ reported.\nBy conditioning the environment within the inflatable section, it is proposed that the ice be kept frozen indefinitely and vegetation could be grown, which would help to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen.\nThe second place award of USD 15,000 went to Team Gamma, from architecture firm Foster + Partners. Its concept proposes using semi-autonomous robots to build a shelter using regolith (the loose soil and rocks found on the surface of Mars).\n 04, 2015 9:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:23:13.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
