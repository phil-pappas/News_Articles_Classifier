There were 31.09 million people in work, 42,000 more than for February to April 2015 and 413,000 more when compared with a year earlier. \nThis is the highest rate of employment since the Office for National Statistics started keeping records in 1973. \nThe double-edged sword \nAs qualified employees become more scarce it is not surprising that wages have started creeping up. \nBoth total pay, including bonuses, and regular pay, excluding bonuses, for employees in the UK increased by 2.9% from May to July 2015 compared with a year earlier, according to the ONS. \nThis is both good and bad for businesses. With more people earning higher wages there is a potentially larger amount of money to be spent. However, the downside is that the competition to attract and retain qualified candidates can become increasingly more difficult. \nMiles MacInnes, sales and marketing director at Jascots Wine Merchants, said: “It is certainly a competitive market now for employers. We work very hard to find great people who we know will love the environment we have at Jascots.” \nBut retaining employees is equally important and one of the best ways to do that is to offer them opportunities to grow within the business. \nMacInnes said: “It is important to provide competitive remuneration and equally if not more important is that we take care to support people in the development of their careers. \n“We make every effort to understand the ambitions of our colleagues and support them in reaching their goals through training. I started at Jascots in 2006 as a customer service executive and it is because I was always given the opportunity to take on a new challenge that I am still here today.” \nEmployee loyalty \nThe Wine & Spirit Trade Association’s annual conference held last month focused on building brand loyalty with consumers, however, the role that employees play in the brand equation is becoming ever larger. \nKaren Jones CBE, who runs her own restaurant group Food & Fuel, believes staff should be the biggest fans and advocates of a brand. \nShe said: “The people who work for you – if they are not your advocates and they aren’t the most loyal people that you are talking to, then you have lost it completely. They are the ones who should be out there waving the flag.” \nMcInnes agreed a company’s employees make the company. He said: “We prioritise the people in our business because they are Jascots. Recruitment and retention is an even more critical issue in the sector that we supply – restaurants, hotels and caterers, and we are in the process of redeveloping our wine and wine service training offer to help our clients to attract and retain great people.” \nJon Forsyth, founder and chief communications strategy officer at adam&eveDDB, also said employees can be a source of great ideas, that ultimately will benefit the business. \nHe said: “Some of the best campaigns we have ever worked on have not come from going out to the customers and getting research from them, but from going out and talking to staff.” \nFor Kristof de Wulf, co-founder and chief executive of InSites Consulting, said that as more of our lives are lived out digitally, the need for the human element will be in greater demand. \nDe Wulf said: “Because the world is shifting so strongly towards digital there will be a renewed attention towards the human element.” \nThe employees of any organisation are quite literally the human element of it. Although it may be more expensive currently, the investment a business makes in its human capital today is most likely its greatest potential for return in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:59:40.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
