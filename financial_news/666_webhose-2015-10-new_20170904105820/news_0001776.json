Linamar has manufacturing plants in China.\nMagnan has 11.69 percent of the company while executive managing directors Marc Majus and Didier Crozet, aged 67 and 66, respectively, own a combined 20.49 percent of the company.\nLinamar, with a market capitalisation of about $3.7 billion, has often used mergers and acquisitions to boost its international footprint. Last year, it acquired a majority stake in Germany's auto-parts supplier Seissenschmidt.\n($1 = 0.8744 euros) (Additional reporting by Allison Martell and Euan Rocha in Toronto, Emiliano Mellino in London and Matthieu Protard in Paris; Editing by Diane Craft , Andrew Callus and Adrian Croft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:24:24.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
