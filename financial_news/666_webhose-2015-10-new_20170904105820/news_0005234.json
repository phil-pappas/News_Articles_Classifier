In that address he will portray the Tories as the “real workers’ party” and announce the creation of a new national infrastructure commission led by Lord Adonis, who was a policy chief under Tony Blair.\nThe chancellor said: “The typical family with someone working full-time on the minimum wage will be better off, not just a little bit better off but £2,000 a year better off, if you include the lower taxes we are providing through the personal allowance, the childcare for three- and four-year-olds. That family is supported.”\nHe added that nine out of 10 families would be better off once the whole budget was considered.\nOsborne was challenged on House of Commons library figures arguing the overall impact of the tax credit and budget changes, such as the minimum wage, on the average family was £1,300.\nSimilar figures have been produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation. According to the IFS, the average loss among those affected by such changes is £750 a year. Those in the second decile income group (ie, just above the bottom) will lose £1,340.\nOsborne has also been under pressure from Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions select committee, to rejig the changes so that a new sharper tax credit taper is introduced for those earning more while those earning less are kept on the current taper.\nThere is concern among Tory ranks that once the changes are introduced in April the typical “Tory-voting striver” in work will see their income dramatically cut back, especially if they are already on the minimum wage and do not have children of an age who need free childcare.\nOsborne said: “It is part of a new settlement for this country in which we move away from from low wages and high welfare to lower welfare, lower taxes and higher wages. We cannot afford a welfare system that grows and grows and becomes unsustainable given the size of our economy.”\nHe added: “If the country did not sort out its public finances then low-income families will lose work and find themselves unemployed because of the mistakes made by those in the Treasury. I am not prepared to do that. We do not live in a vacuum. Working people of this country want economic security. The worst possible thing you can do for working families is to bust the public finances and have a welfare system the country cannot afford, including a tax credit bill that has gone up from £1bn to £30bn today. They are the people that will suffer.”\nThe chancellor said Britain spends 7% of the world’s total welfare spending, and he would not consign Britain to the back row of history.", "external_links": ["http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/7980"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:36:16.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
