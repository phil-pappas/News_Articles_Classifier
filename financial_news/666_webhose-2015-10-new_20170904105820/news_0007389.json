The European Central Bank has cut the amount of emergency support it is providing to the country’s banks by €1bn, to €87.9bn. \nThat’s at the request of the Bank of Greece. \nThe reduction of €1.0bn in the ceiling reflects an improvement of the liquidity situation of Greek banks, amid a reduction of uncertainty and the stabilization of private sector deposits flows. 10.09am BST \nBritain’s factories posted a 1.0% rise in industrial output in August, beating Germany and Spain. Manufacturing output increased by 0.5% in August – unlike to be enough to halt a 3rd consecutive quarter of contraction however #ukmfg \nAugust’s rebound in industrial production means that the sector may have managed to eke out marginal growth in the third quarter rather than contracting as had previously looked likely. \nEven so, industrial production was still only up 0.1% in the three months to August compared to the three months to May. 9.44am BST \nBrewing giant SABMiller has just issued a lukewarm, borderline chilly, response to AB InBev’s new £68bn takeover offer . \nIn a statement to the City , SAB points out that the new proposal, at £42.15 per share, is only 15p higher than the previous proposal which was rejected on Monday. \n“SABMiller is the crown jewel of the global brewing industry, uniquely positioned to continue to generate decades of standalone future volume and value growth for all SABMiller shareholders from highly attractive markets. \nAB InBev needs SABMiller but has made opportunistic and highly conditional proposals, elements of which have been deliberately designed to be unattractive to many of our shareholders.

Rather than responding to very serious concerns from their customers, they are providing the minimal information. \n“The latest lamentable statement, given today to a German newspaper, does reveal that some customers will need serious interventions to parts of their vehicle. Which cars and what interventions? 9.31am BST \nVolkswagen shares have jumped by 5% this morning after the German carmaker coughed up its plan to fix the emissions scandal. \n“If everything goes as planned, we can start the recall in January…All the cars should be in order by the end of 2016.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:54:42.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
