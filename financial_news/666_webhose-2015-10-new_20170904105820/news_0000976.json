The value of the dollar's net long position dropped to $18.97 billion in the week ended Oct. 13, from $20.89 billion the week before. That was the smallest net long position since the week of July 22, 2014. This was also the first time in 15 months that net dollar longs came in below $20 billion. To be long a currency is to make a bet it will rise, while being short is a bet its value will decline. The dollar's outlook has darkened following a downbeat September U.S. non-farm payrolls report and a decision by the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady last month. Interest rate futures are now banking on the Fed raising rates in March next year, with a 52 percent chance, according to the CME Group FedWatch. For the month of October, the dollar index so far was down 1.7 percent, although year to date, the greenback was still up 4.9 percent. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
