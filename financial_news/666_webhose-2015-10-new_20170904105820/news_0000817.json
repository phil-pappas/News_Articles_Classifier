It's not one of those rhetorical questions that journos like to ask then single-handedly and comprehensively answer. We're genuinely wondering if this is the last generation of PC users that will mainly rely on locally installed apps.\nWindows 10 has launched to widespread approval , including its upgraded technology for Universal apps that play nicely on desktops, tablets, Windows phones and, ultimately, its gaming console Xbox. But developers have proven reluctant to create products for the new online store.\nSure, it's early days but that's exactly when fortunes can be made, before the marketplace is overcrowded. Where are the first movers here?\nA visit to the Microsoft store and a search for the top-rated PC business apps produce just five results. There's getHired, a tool for searching multiple US job seeker sites, a document viewer called Document Viewer, three remote access apps from Citrix, Splashtop and GoToMeeting, and one for cloud storage service Box.\nSlim pickings indeed compared to Apple's vast App Store. Other categories are likewise sparse, relatively speaking.\nBig money apps But comparing product volumes doesn't tell the full story. Even in Apple land, very few app developers are making a return on their investment of time, skill and cash. One estimate is that the average app generates around $4000 in revenues, but that's heavily skewed towards a small number of very successful offerings.\nMaking a living from developing mass market software is harder than ever.\n Of course, the enabler for a move away from installed programs is the availability of cloud-based alternatives, typically accessed via web browsers, and the industry sector leading the race in that migration is SME accounting software.\nWith Xero, MYOB and Quickbooks all online, who can imagine anyone bothering to develop a new, locally installed accounting product? Even traditionally conservative industries such as the law are getting on board, with outfits such as Actionstep, a New Zealand-based provider of cloud practice management systems for lawyers, attracting plenty of attention.\nWith a lot of programs, users have worked out that they really don't need the extensive functionality that local software can offer. For instance, do you know that MS Word, local edition, can merge multiple copies of a document that have been independently edited and marked up by several reviewers? Do you care? No to both questions? We're not surprised.\nSimple cloud options Mega-suites such as Office do heaps of things that few people need, and Google Docs does almost everything that many folks require. So why not use the cloud-based alternative?\nThe trend to online also sits well with the inexorable shrinking of hard drives we've witnessed over the past decade. If the explosive growth in disk drive volumes between 1995 and 2005 had continued, hardly a personal computer sold today would sport a drive under 10 terabytes.\nBut the public wants its technology to get thinner and lighter, so Macbook Airs sell with a tiny 256GB as standard, and even Apple's fire-breathing top-of-the-line iMac offers a modest 3TB.\nWindows machines are also getting slimmer. Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 runs a full desktop operating system and can be optioned with a potent i7 processor that can run any program you care to throw at it, but the biggest drive in its range is just half a terabyte.\nClearly, Apple and Microsoft both assume that the days of program folders bulging with a terabyte or more of installed applications are behind us.\nMinimising the number of installed apps has another welcome side effect. It keeps machines operating more smoothly.\nSimpler computing Every personal computer user has seen what happens to a machine after dozens of applications have been installed, updated and removed over a year or two. Inevitably, speed and stability plummet until the day comes when wiping the drive and starting over is the only way to restore snappy performance.\nOf course, most of us wimp out on that exercise and buy a new computer. Expect longer life and better reliability from devices that aren't gravid with local applications.\nMaybe the best way to predict where we'll be tomorrow is to look where our kids are today.\nChromebooks, powered by Google's ChromeOS, are basically a life support system for a web browser. Almost everything a user does happens in the cloud and is stored in the cloud, and no wonder Chromebooks are taking schools by storm.\nThey're also producing a generation that won't have a clue what your pile of installer disks were ever used for.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer with Cooper Mills. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:09.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
