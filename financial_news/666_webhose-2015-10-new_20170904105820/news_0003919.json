Prices on Friday, October 9, 2015, were ~$1.4 per gallon.\nUS gasoline prices mainly fell on expectations of lower demand. Demand usually starts slowing down in the fall as the weather starts cooling and drivers take lesser vacations. The increase at the end of the week was likely the result of a larger-than-expected fall in gasoline inventories, as reported by the EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration.)\n\nWhy gasoline prices matter Lower US gasoline prices may dissuade refiners like Tesoro (TSO), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Valero Energy (VLO) from producing more gasoline. However, the price of crude oil is also a consideration when refiners determine their production levels.\nGasoline prices loosely track changes in crude oil prices (USO), usually Brent crude oil prices, the international benchmark. Combined, Tesoro, Valero Energy, and Marathon Petroleum account for ~8.6% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nWhen gasoline prices fall, refiners could choose to lower production, provided that nothing else, mainly crude oil prices, changes. Lower production levels would mean lower volumes for MLPs like Tesoro Logistics (TLLP), MPLX (MPLX), and Valero Energy Partners (VLP) to transport. This could be negative for their revenues.\nUS gasoline price forecasts According to the EIAâ€™s STEO (Short-Term Energy Outlook) report released on October 6, the monthly average gasoline retail prices reached $2.37 per gallon in September. This is $0.27 less than the August average. Retail prices differ from the futures prices that we mentioned above. They include the added costs of taxes, distribution, and marketing.\nThe EIA expects the monthly average to average $2.03 per gallon in December 2015 and $2.38 per gallon in 2016. Prices averaged $3.36 per gallon in 2014.\nThe EIA also forecast that gasoline consumption will remain flat compared to the consumption figures in 2015.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Insight: Crude Oil Prices Were on a Downtrend Part 2 - XOP Trades Better than USO in Week Ended October 16 Part 3 - Why Did the WTI-Brent Spread Widen Last Week?
