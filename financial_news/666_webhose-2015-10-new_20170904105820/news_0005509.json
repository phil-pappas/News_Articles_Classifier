The WSJ’s Costas Paris reports that China Ocean Shipping Co. and China Shipping Group Co. are in advanced talks toward building a single carrier with business ranging from $15 billion to more than $20 billion , and focusing on the companies’ container lines. A merger would have a seismic impact on global shipping, creating the world’s fourth-biggest container operator with 8% of total capacity. A tie-up could also touch off a new wave of consolidation, a step many in the shipping industry believe is long overdue as it would make it easier to reduce capacity and lift rates from rock-bottom levels. It could also spark a game of musical chairs among members of the big shipping alliances, as Cosco and China Shipping belong to rival groups.\nA high-stakes battle is underway inside the Apple Inc. AAPL -1.41 % supply chain . Two of Apple’s biggest suppliers— Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. ASX 3.05 % and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. 2317 0.70 % , known as Foxconn—are fighting for control of a third company that is developing a a key technology used in the latest iPhones and smartwatches . The WSJ’s Lorraine Luk writes that billions of dollars in potential revenue and new orders from Apple hang in the balance as shareholders of Siliconware Precision Industries Co. SPIL 2.41 % , or SPIL, consider competing offers. ASE and Foxconn already are major suppliers to Apple, and their conflict underscores the big weight Apple’s business carries in their current operations and their plans. Apple probably will end up the real winner no matter which company works with SPIL since any tie-up is likely to drive down production costs and give Apple more supplier options.\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT -10.04 % is betting big on the future of e-commerce , but the present is looking increasingly ugly. The retail giant predicted a sharp drop in earnings next year, largely due to plans to raise wages for U.S. workers but also because of major outlays to boost the company’s online presence , the WSJ’s Sarah Nassauer and Lisa Beilfuss report. Wal-Mart is well-positioned to compete with Amazon.com AMZN -0.74 % and other online retailers because of its size and global footprint, but building the logistics infrastructure takes time and money. The WSJ’s Kim S. Nash reports the retailer will spend $2 billion over the next two years on work that will include the addition of four dedicated fulfillment centers aimed at serving online customers while keeping the supply chain for brick-and-mortar stores running.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES ENLARGE Federal-Mogul says a more efficient supply chain can be a boon to the inventory-heavy auto parts industry. Photo: Federal-Mogul Motorparts The auto-parts business used to be all about efficient production , but Federal-Mogul Holdings Corp. FDML 0.75 % says the supply chain now is the difference-maker. The WSJ’s Jeff Bennett reports that the motor parts giant has overhauled its operations to respond to changes in the automobile industry , highlighting the dramatic shifts that competition is triggering in a seemingly unbending industrial business. A proliferation of car models has created a ”complex jungle” of an auto market and the push by owners to keep cars on the road longer means more new parts are needed for repairs. Federal-Mogul is bringing in new technology, both to face customers and to better manage its sprawling inventory. The business will add two warehouses to the four it already runs, but they’ll operate those more efficiently and even add the robotic handling systems pioneered by Amazon.com.\nUber Technologies Inc. now is officially in the delivery business , and not just testing the waters. But the impact of the courier service called UberRush is far from certain. The WSJ’s Douglas MacMillan writes that the smartphone-enabled courier service that was tested in New York also will be available to local merchants in Chicago and San Francisco , building out what Uber calls its “urban logistics network.” Uber has discovered, however, that moving goods like flowers and food can be more complex and costly than moving passengers that, after all, can get themselves to and from vehicles. The WSJ’s Laura Stevens writes that FedEx Corp. FDX -0.50 % and United Parcel Service Inc. aren’t likely to see much threat to their sprawling operations that handle some 25 million parcels each day.\nDelta Air Lines Inc. gave a grim view of the air freight market as the carrier kicked off airline earnings season. Delta’s cargo revenue fell 20% in the third quarter , reports the WSJ’s Doug Cameron, as West Coast ports bounced back from slowdowns earlier in the year. By now it’s clear that ports will mount a near-total recovery after losing business during the worst of the congestion at the start of 2015. Alternative carriers, ranging from airlines to trucking companies to railroads, are giving back ground they had hoped to have permanently gained. Airlines can only hope that the U.S. economy picks up, increasing freight volumes for all.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ You have to have the right part at the right place at the right time or you lose the sale. We have to make sure they never lose the sale. ’\n—Dan Ninivaggi, Federal-Mogul Holdings.\nAN INVITATION The WSJ Logistics Report’s Robbie Whelan and Brian Baskin will have a live Q&A on the trucking industry and their recent story on driver recruiting on Thursday at 2 p.m. Eastern time.
