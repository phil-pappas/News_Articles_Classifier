A few months later, when he started receiving the balance of his $85,000 insurance-claim payment, his wife took a claims check from his insurance company to their local TD Bank, so they could afford to begin the actual repairs on the first floor of their house. But the check had not only his name on it, but also the name of his mortgage holder, Weichert Financial Services. \nThat’s when, in his words, “things got ugly.” \n“My wife called to tell me that TD Bank would not accept the check as it had to be endorsed by a Weichert Financial representative,” he said. Moreover, walking into a local Weichert Financial branch office in Morris Plains, N.J., to have the $7,500 check endorsed wouldn’t work either. \n“I had to send it to the Lake Zurich, Illinois, mailing address where our mortgage correspondence comes from,” he recounted. When no endorsed check was returned, he called and found out that, yes, the bank had received his check, but wouldn’t return it to him until they got an estimate for the repairs, and even then wouldn’t return more than one-third of the remaining amount to start. A Weichert Financial representative did not respond to emailed requests for comment. \nKono, along with many other Hurricane Sandy victims, had been tripped up by the mortgagee clause, says Mark Romano, claims project director at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer watchdog group based in Washington, D.C. With a “mortgagee clause,” the bank that holds your mortgage can take over control of the insurance cash by requiring its representatives review and sign any insurance company claim checks, or even put the rest of the money in an escrow account until the repairs are finished, he says. “This is a common practice,” Romano says. “The threshold as to when and why an insurer will put a mortgage holder on a claim check varies from company to company,” he adds. “(It’s) a big hassle.” \nKono says he was completely taken by surprise, since he assumed he would have access to his insurance cash as needed. “Not having any idea this would happen in a crisis was my biggest frustration,” says Kono. “It was a bureaucratic nightmare.” Hurricane Joaquin gains strength near the Bahamas (22:02) \nTanya Rivero and Joe Bastardi discuss the latest on Hurricane Joaquin. \nFor Julie Reynolds, a homeowner in Southern California whose Westlake Village house was flooded when a toilet overflowed, the headache was even worse. Even though she incurred more than $42,000 in damages from the flood, her insurance company never sent her any money directly after an initial $8,000 emergency payment. Instead, she said, the insurance company sent the checks straight to the bank, where they were held in escrow. “It was like pulling teeth to get my money,” she said. \nShe was able to cover the initial repairs to her house with her savings and later get reimbursed from her mortgage bank, but she worries what might have happened had she not had the cash in her bank to pay the costs up front. “You could get wiped out financially before you got a dime from the bank,” she said. “How do they expect you to pay the mortgage when you’re pulling money from your own pocket for the repairs and then hoping to get reimbursed?” Prev Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:50:45.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
