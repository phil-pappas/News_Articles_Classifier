Quentin Jones Share on twitter by Joanna Mather BHP Billiton director Carolyn Hewson wants Parliament to set quotas for women on government boards, contradicting the Australian Institute of Company Directors, which is pushing for the removal of mandatory targets in a proposed law that would require 40 per cent of the positions filled by women.\n\"There are no longer any valid excuses,\" she told a parliamentary inquiry on Monday. \"There are so many capable, experienced and well qualified women to comprise at least 40 per cent of our decision-making capacity in Australia.\"\nThe Institute of Company Directors supports a voluntary target of 30 per cent by 2018.\n\"The legislation ... requires mandatory adherence, that is no longer a target,\" AICD chief executive John Brogden said. \"We've always believed in targets. We've seen, for instance, in the ASX 200 companies their number of female directors more than double from 9 per cent six years ago to 20 per cent today.\"\nClaire Braund, one of the founders of Women on Boards, which started as an informal network in 2001 and was incorporated in 2006, criticised the AICD target.\n\"The AICD remains stuck on a 'timid little target of 30 per cent' and opposing a key reform which could have flow on ramifications for the corporate sector in terms of broadening the candidate pool of women for ASX boards,\" she said.\nThe legislation is sponsored by independents Nick Xenophon, Jacqui Lambie and Glenn Lazarus, and Greens senator Larissa Waters.\nNo penalties imposed It would not impose penalties on non-compliant portfolios, but would ask why targets were missed. Latest figures show the proportion of women on government boards fell from a high of 41.3 per cent in 2013 to 39.1 per cent at present.\nThe committee held a public hearing on Monday.\n\"For such a long time I've made excuses about the lack of balance in our corporate boards, government boards and many of our civil society boards, thinking change was just a matter of time,\" Ms Hewson told the hearing. \"Yet, after over 30 years of expecting the trend towards diverse representation to accelerate, we see only slow progress in so many of these areas.\"\nThe corporate world was clearly not going to act first, which is \"why we now look to government to lead and to influence\", Ms Hewson said.\nShe also rejected the argument that women should get there on merit. \"Increasingly, I am aware that the system of meritocracy is a system that has largely been designed by men, for men.\"\nAt present, there is bipartisan support for a policy that government boards have 40 per cent men, 40 per cent women and the rest of either gender. The bill goes further to entrench the requirement in law.\nInstitute of Public Affairs senior fellow Mikayla Novaktold the committee the legislation was a precursor to quotas and could prompt other minority groups to demand similar treatment.\n\"There is no doubt in my mind this edges towards hard quotas [and] if that becomes part of the policy firmament there will naturally be demands for similar actions in similar areas,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:16:32.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
