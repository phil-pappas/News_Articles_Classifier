It also reduced the Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) by 25 basis points from 14.15 per cent to 13.90 per cent.\nOriental Bank of Commerce said it has slashed its base rate by 20 basis points to 9.70 per cent with effect from today itself.\nAxis Bank announced a cut of 0.35 per cent in base rate to 9.50 per cent.\nWith the proposed rate reduction of 0.40 per cent, SBI’s minimum lending rate would come down to 9.30 per cent — the most competitive in the market at present.\nBank of India has reduced its base rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.70 per cent, while Andhra Bank has announced a similar cut.\nIDBI Bank cut its base rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.75 per cent, which would be effective from October 5.\n“The reduction in interest rate is expected to positively encourage loan growth, both in the retail consumer segment, as also revitalise fixed capital formation through higher corporate sector lending, thereby supporting the growth impulses in the economy,” the bank said in a statement.\nIDBI Bank has also reduced the retail term deposit rates in select buckets by 25-50 basis points with effect from October 5.\nLater, Punjab and Sind Bank also said in a statement that it reduced its ‘Base Rate’ by 25 basis points to 9.75 per cent. Besides, it has also reduced its ‘Benchmark Prime Lending Rate’ (BPLR) by 25 basis points to 14.75 per cent, effective from October 5, 2015.\nAt least six banks announced their rate cuts today itself, in addition to announcements made by four banks earlier yesterday.\nSoon after the RBI’s rate cut yesterday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said, “We are looking forward now to the transmission of these cuts which will effectively help to boost confidence and investment. They will also help to realise the economy’s medium term potential growth rate.”\nFirst Published on September 30, 2015 9:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:43:40.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
