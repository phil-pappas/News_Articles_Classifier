PORTLAND, OR, October 18,   Solomon Exam Prep is pleased to announce publication of The Solomon Exam Prep Guide: Series 51 MSRB Municipal Fund Securities Limited Principal Qualification Examination, 2nd Edition (https://solomonexamprep.com/series51/exam-study-guide). Written in clear English with practice questions, exercises and visual aids sprinkled throughout, the comprehensive Solomon Exam Prep Guide will get you on track to passing the Series 51 Municipal Fund Securities Limited Principal exam. According to Solomon Exam Prep President Jeremy Solomon, many underestimate the Series 51 exam because it's only 60 questions long. Says Solomon: \"The good thing about a shorter exam like the Series 51 is that it's only 60 questions and it doesn't cover as much material as other securities exams, such as the Series 7 or the Series 65. The bad thing about the Series 51 is that it's only 60 questions and there's less margin for error. What makes the Series 51 particularly challenging is that it covers topics that most individuals, even securities professionals, have little knowledge of: the supervision of municipal fund securities activities. Topics include LGIPs, arbitrage bonds, qualified tuition plans and the regulation of political contributions. That's why a good text and putting in enough study time are absolutely necessary if you want to pass the Series 51 exam and achieve the Municipal Fund Limited Principal registration.\" The Solomon Exam Prep Guide to the Series 51 Exam, 2nd edition includes:  New and updated MSRB rules, per the latest MSRB exam outline  Expanded arbitrage rebate section  Discussion of A, B, and C shares and breakpoint sales in relation to 529 plans  Expanded sections on transferring funds from other savings vehicles into 529 plans  Expanded discussion of municipal fund securities principal responsibilities  Expanded discussion and examples of the pay-to-play rule  Expanded discussion of out-of-state disclosure rules for 529 plans  Updated suitability section based on new suitability rule and its application  More examples, tables, figures, exercises and practice questions For more information, or to order The Solomon Exam Prep Guide: Series 51 MSRB Municipal Fund Securities Limited Principal Qualification Examination, 2nd Edition please go to: https://solomonexamprep.com/series51/exam-study-guide.Solomon Exam Prep has helped thousands of financial professionals pass their FINRA, MSRB, and NASAA securities regulatory exams including the Series 6, 7, 24, 26, 27, 28, 51, 52, 53, 55, 62, 63, 65, 66, 79, 82, and 99.
