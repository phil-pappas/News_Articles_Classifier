It could attempt to sell the bonds at a later date, the person said. The company’s press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe cancellation marks a fresh blow to Petrobras, which is already suffering from a tumble in crude prices and a wide-ranging investigation into alleged kickback schemes. The Rio de Janeiro-based company’s shares have tumbled 63 percent in the past year and its bonds are trading at distressed levels. S&P downgraded the issuer on Sept. 10 and global demand for Petrobras securities is also being sapped by the real’s 30 percent plunge against the dollar this year and efforts to impeach President Dilma Rousseff.\n\"Uncertainty is still high because of a lingering political dispute in Brazil,\" said Kim Jin Ha, the Seoul-based head of fixed income at Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., which oversees the equivalent of $69 billion. \"We’re still very cautious on whether the real’s volatility will subside. For offshore investors, now doesn’t look like an appropriate time to have exposure to Petrobras bonds issued in local currency.\"\nThis month, the company cut its 2015 investment plan to $25 billion from $28 billion and slashed its forecast for 2016 expenditures by $8 billion. This year, the company reduced its production growth estimates by more than a third.\nFitch Ratings, which classifies Petrobras at the lowest level of investment grade, has said the company is one of the Brazilian issuers most vulnerable to the effects of a selloff in the local currency. This year’s slide in the real has made it the worst performer in emerging markets.\nOnce valued at $310 billion at its peak in 2008, making it the world’s fifth-largest company, Petrobras is currently worth $31 billion in the stock market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:05:05.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
