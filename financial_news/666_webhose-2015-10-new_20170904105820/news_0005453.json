Picture: REUTERS/ARND WIEGMANN Related articles Barclays likely to be led by an American investment banker again Credit Suisse CEO warns on African debt ‘madness’ Top bankers have jobs cut out for them Foreign banks find corporate niche in SA ZURICH — Credit Suisse has set out plans to raise Sf6bn ($6.3bn) from investors, slim down its investment bank and cut jobs as new chief Tidjane Thiam detailed the biggest overhaul in almost a decade at the Swiss bank.\nCredit Suisse is emphasising wealth management and growing in Asia, echoing moves by rival UBS, and joins rivals including Barclays and Deutsche Bank as well as UBS in scaling back investment banking as tougher regulations squeeze profitability.\nMr Thiam, hired from insurer Prudential in March and who officially joined in July, also said he would float shares in its domestic Swiss bank, as he set out his vision for Switzerland’s second-biggest bank almost four months into the job.\nChairman Urs Rohner said in March that Mr Thiam’s appointment did not signal a major shift in strategy.\nBut the new CEO, a former Ivorian government minister who replaced American Brady Dougan, said weak quarterly results underscored the Zurich-based bank’s need for change.\nThird-quarter pretax income fell 34% to Sf861m, primarily reflecting an 8% drop in net revenue.\n\"That should validate in a way the strategy and confirms some of the insights that have guided us,\" Mr Thiam told reporters.\n\"The ambition in this strategy is to grow fundamentally. To grow and to resolve the capital issue for good.\"\nAnalysts noted the cash call was in line with expectations, but was countered by the weak results.\n\"We see today’s announcement to shrink the investment bank, attack the cost base in earnest and simplify group structure will, over time, drive value creation,\" said Huw van Steenis at Morgan Stanley. \"But a weak third quarter in FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) and heavier costs will clearly drag before Credit Suisse puts flesh on the skeletal new plan.\"\nCredit Suisse shares fell as much as 4.5% in early trade. Year to date the stock has dropped nearly 4% against a rise of more than 11% for UBS, Reuters data show.\nMore focus\nMr Thiam said Credit Suisse would put more focus on managing the fortunes of the world’s wealthy, especially in emerging markets, will reduce the size of its investment bank and cut Sf2bn in annual costs.\nMr Thiam, who spearheaded strong growth in Asia in his previous job at Prudential, said he wanted to more than double Credit Suisse’s income from Asia to Sf2.1bn by 2018.\nHe also aims to increase the bank’s international wealth management income by 62% to Sf2.1bn by 2018, and grow income in Switzerland by 44% to Sf2.3bn.\nHe plans to cut gross costs by Sf3.5bn by end-2018 and will invest Sf1.5bn in growth initiatives, to reduce the cost base to between Sf18.5bn and Sf19bn.\n\"The new strategy is very comprehensive and probably more than anticipated,\" said one of the bank’s 20 biggest investors, who asked not to be named.\nBut the investor said there was a lack of detail on revenue growth plans and said Mr Thiam needed to show how he would achieve his targets.\nThe bank will reduce the number of its staff in Switzerland by a net 1,600 over the next three years, and will cut the number of its investment bank staff in London.\nMr Thiam estimated 1,800 of its London-based staff did not need to be in such a costly location.\nIt also aims to raise Sf1.35bn from selling shares to a number of investors at 5.5% below their price on Tuesday, and to raise a further Sf4.7bn via a rights issue to existing investors.\nThe bank had been widely expected to raise between Sf5bn and Sf10bn as it tackles a capital position that trails rivals’ and has been a persistent concern for investors.\nMr Thiam said the bank’s common equity capital adequacy ratio should rise to 12.2% of risk-adjusted assets, and the bank aims to keep that ratio above 12%. By comparison, UBS is one of the strongest capitalised banks in the world, with a common equity ratio of 14.4% at the end of June. The average for Europe’s 24 biggest banks was 13.2%, lifted by high levels at Nordic lenders.\nMr Thiam also aims to streamline the bank by creating three geographic divisions: a Swiss universal bank, Asia Pacific, and international wealth management; and two investment bank units: global markets, and investment banking and capital markets.\nHe intends to reduce capital used by the investment bank, mainly in its \"macro\" businesses, which include foreign exchange and rates trading products, and where the bank plans to reduce risk-weighted assets by 72% by year-end.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:00:30.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
