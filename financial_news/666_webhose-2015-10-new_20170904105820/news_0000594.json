It's a spin effort worthy of House of Cards' Frank Underwood, but maybe it no longer works. Netflix Share on twitter by John McDuling Netflix aims to pass 70 million subscribers, raise capital Optus signs new Netflix deal for Christmas shopping season As far as attempts at corporate obfuscation go, this one is pretty audacious.\nNetflix, the US streaming video giant that has taken Australia by storm in recent months, reported its quarterly results in the US this morning.\nThe numbers were announced, as per usual, in a letter to shareholders , which contained lots of exciting information about the incredibly fast-growing business. More subscribers! (Netflix added 3.6 million of them during the quarter). More content! (Netflix is releasing its first original feature length film this month). More countries! (Netflix will expand to new parts of Europe and Asia in coming weeks).\nBut arguably the most important information contained in the letter from chief executive Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells to shareholders was buried in the very last line of the document: \"We are likely to raise additional capital next year to fund our continued content investments,\" it reads.\nNetflix doesn't plan to make profits until 2016, and since content is such an expensive business, the fact that it needs to raise capital to fund it should not be a huge surprise.\nStill, it's the first time (that we are aware of) that Netflix has openly admitted that. Raising new capital (by issuing new shares or borrowing money) could weigh on the company's share price significantly. Which might explain why the company buried this news at the end of its news release.\nRemember, companies (and politicians) try to do this all the time. The late-Friday news dump is a long and undistinguished tradition in corporate and political circles. Public relations operatives are always trying to release damaging information when the media is distracted. But maybe it no longer works.\n Netflix shares have fallen about 3 per cent in after-hours trading, but people seem to be more focused on weak subscriber growth than a looming capital raising. Earlier this week Twitter's recently returned CEO, Jack Dorsey, was admirably short and to the point in his letter to staff, which revealed his company would axe more than 300 jobs. So maybe the tide is starting to turn on these types of shenanigans.", "external_links": ["http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/860911701x0x854558/9B28F30F-BF2F-4C5D-AAFF-AA9AA8F4779D/FINAL_Q3_15_Letter_to_Shareholders_With_Tables_.pdf", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:04:00.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
