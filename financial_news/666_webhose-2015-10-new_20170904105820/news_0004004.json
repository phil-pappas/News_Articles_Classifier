Through Thursday, the shares had advanced 6.8 percent in 2015.\nThe California Coastal Commission, which regulates construction activity along the state’s shoreline, approved the company’s plan to build an expanded habitat for killer whales at its San Diego theme park, SeaWorld said Friday in a statement. The commission attached conditions that included a ban on breeding the animals within the company’s facilities.\n“We are disappointed with the conditions they have placed on their approval,” Chief Executive Officer Joel Manby said in the statement. “Depriving these social animals of the natural and fundamental right to reproduce is inhumane and we do not support this condition.”\nSeaWorld Intraday Chart\nThe Orlando, Florida-based company has faced ongoing pressure from animal activists since the release of the 2013 documentary “Blackfish,” which argued that killer whales shouldn’t be kept in captivity. In August 2014, the company unveiled a plan to spend several hundred million dollars to expand the tanks at parks in California, Texas and Florida, in part to placate activists who say the whales don’t have enough room to swim, and turn angry because of the close quarters.\nThe San Diego enclosure was to open in 2018, the company said at the time. SeaWorld hasn’t broken ground on any of the new habitats, according to Fred Jacobs, a spokesman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:21:33.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
