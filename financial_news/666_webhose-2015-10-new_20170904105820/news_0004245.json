[tweet_Quote: display=\"With some thriftiness, smart planning and the benefit of time, having a million in retirement accounts is possible.\"]With some thriftiness, smart planning and the benefit of time, having a million in retirement accounts is more than possible[/tweet_Quote: ] , even if you aren’t earning a million a year. In a study in 2014, Fidelity Investments looked at the habits of 1,000 clients who had more than $1 million in their Fidelity-managed 401(k)s—and earned less than $150,000. With the advice of two other personal finance experts, here are nine ways to become a retirement millionaire.[gallery2012] Save “The only thing all [the 401(k) millionaires] have in common is that they save at a higher amount,” says Katie Taylor, Director of Thought Leadership at Fidelity Investments. “Start early in your career path, whatever your salary is.”Although millennials often have a competing priority with paying down debt , it is still important to make sure some of your money is going towards retirement . Live like a college student Even if you are earning peanuts LaTisha Styles, founder of Young Finances advises to “ mind the gap ” or make sure that there is a gap between what you are spending and earning.“Keep your expenses low. Continue living like a college student when you get your first salary,” says Styles. Track and evaluate If saving seems like an insurmountable task, Vicki Robin, co-author of Your Money or Your Life , advises to look where your money is going. Take a three-month period, which gives enough time to even out the ups-and-downs, and track all your spending. Use a tool like Quickbooks, Quicken, Mint or, if that isn’t appealing, use a debit card for all expenditures during that time so that your finances are automatically tracked.“Keep track of everything you spend money on. Not in a spirit of pinching pennies, but in curiosity,” advises Robin, who says people always wonder where their money went. She continues, “With that data, categorize things.” Make practical spending categories Instead of having a big category like entertainment, Robin advises to break expenditures into smaller categories that are more manageable and can provide more insight into spending habits. So instead of food, have categories like snacking, lunch out, groceries and restaurant meals.“One insight that you may have is that you are spending more on snacking, nickel and diming $5 here, $10 there, than on groceries,” says Robin.Once you see where your money is going, then you can think about the motivation behind it and see if you want to change it. For example, instead of spending $300 a month on coffee, snacking and lunches out, you can organize yourself to bring your own lunch every day, which over 40 years of work could potentially buy you two years of freedom in retirement, says Robin. Slowly build up your contribution rate Using data garnered from their 401(k) millionaires, Fidelity recommends that by the age of 25, you should be contributing a minimum of 10 to 15 percent, a number that can include the employer match.In order to work up to that contribution amount, personal finance blogger Styles advises to start small, around 6 percent if you can swing it and then increase that percentage every six months.“You likely won't notice a large difference in your take home pay, so it's an easy way to save for retirement painlessly,” says Styles. Match…no, but really Contributing enough to your 401(k) to snag your employer’s full match is one of the most touted personal finance rules. But just in case you had any doubt, Fidelity crunched the numbers and found that of their 401(k) millionaires, 28 percent of contributions in their retirement accounts were actually from employers.Annually, that translated to $4,600 per year. So, make sure you match. Really. Roll over Another interesting data point from Fidelity’s study was that retirement millionaires had long tenures – an average of 30 years on the job. While job-hopping is something that younger workers are more likely to do, it doesn’t have to negatively impact your retirement goals if you make sure to roll over your workplace retirement assets into an IRA.Try not to take money out before retirement, but if you must (say, to go to grad school) make sure you use one of the exceptions to avoid a 10 percent penalty. Check your vest If you have been collecting an employer match, check your company’s vesting schedule. While all of the money you put into your retirement account is yours, you can’t keep all of your employer’s contributions until you are fully vested. Vesting schedules vary widely between companies, so it is important to do your homework.“As an employee, you need to think about that,” says Taylor. “If you are close [to becoming fully vested], it might be worth it to stay for six more months.” Talk to an expert No matter how financially savvy you are, it helps to speak with an expert. All retirement account providers offer some sort of advice, whether it is on the phone, in person or over the computer.One usually cheaper option for getting help is investing through a target-date fund, something that is increasingly popular with millennials , according to a recent survey by Vanguard.“When you are 25, it is really hard to predict what you want in retirement,” says Fidelity’s Taylor. She says becoming a retirement millionaire doesn't have to be the end goal, “it is a personal choice.”The most important thing is to start saving early, as Taylor says, “you can take out loans for your home, you can’t really take out a loan against retirement.” Alexandra Talty is a journalist living in Southampton, New York.
