Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nWelcome to your new portfolio, Treasurer. You've taken hold of the country's purse-strings at a difficult time. The mining boom is done. China's growth is slowing. The tax base has been eroded by short-term thinking and political opportunism over the past 15 years. And speaking of political reality, you well know that giving is easy, but taking away is potentially politically costly.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nTreasurer, you and the Prime Minister have a clear choice. You can choose political expediency or you can focus on the long-term interests of the country. Sensible, intelligent people can disagree about what specific actions you take, but it's incumbent on you and your government to put Australia's long-term interests first. That's a standing obligation which some governments have faithfully delivered on. Others haven't.\nBut right now – at something of an economic crossroads, thanks to the changing local and global economic circumstances – you must take the right road. And here are an even 10 decisions that we need you to make.\nAdvertisement 1. Please try to leave ideology at the door. Not because yours is wrong or right, but because economic reality and pragmatism should be your guide.\n2. Commit to retaining the current level of investor protections, when it comes to the conduct of those providing financial advice. Australian investors deserve it.\n3. Recognise and admit there's a structural budget imbalance that requires some hard decisions. Also that previous governments (of both stripes) provided permanent tax cuts from temporary revenue. You might have to roll some of them back.\n4. Aggressively address tax loopholes that are distorting the government's revenue base. Start first with deductions that have no clear economic benefit and work backwards from there. Car, work and self-education are three good places to start.\n5. Speaking of loopholes, it's time to cut back on the concessional treatment for superannuation. Once a super balance is sufficient to replace the pension, higher taxes should kick in.\n6. Focus cuts in those areas that are least likely to result in reduced economic activity. Note: pensions and welfare payments aren't on that list. Almost every dollar of those payments is spent immediately – cut back there and you're directly hurting economic growth.\n7. Thank lobby groups – from all walks of life – for their submissions, but don't let them put pressure on you, politically or otherwise.\n8. Listen to Treasury. They're the experts. They won't always be right, but they'll give you the best advice they can. Ditto the RBA.\n9. Strike a balance between cutting red tape and protecting businesses and individuals from abuses of market power. Do more of both.\n10. Remember, the economy is there to serve, not to be served, and the goal is to have the best possible society (not just economy) we can.\nFoolish takeaway Treasurer, I appreciate your desire to serve our country. I think our politicians as a whole get a pretty bad rap, but your hearts are in the right place. Avoid being weighed down and misdirected by special interest groups and the rarified air breathed by those in power.\nI hope you get good advice and you have the wisdom and ability to suppress the widespread tendency for political expediency. Our country needs wise economic leadership if we are to successfully navigate the challenges before us.\nInvestors, don't miss out: Low interest rates mean dividend-paying shares are very attractive, compared to term deposits.
