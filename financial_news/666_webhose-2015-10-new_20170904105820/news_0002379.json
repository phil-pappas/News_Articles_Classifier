There's a lot of it around in the tech market, what with Apple being the biggest company in the world and the likes of Bill Gates and Larry Ellison regularly gracing lists of the world's wealthiest. \nMoney dominated the headlines again this week when Dell agreed a frankly obscene $67bn deal for EMC and its various component parts, in a move that will see the company become something of a tech behemoth to rival IBM, HP and Cisco. \nTo mark this historic occasion, V3 has considered some of the other epic tech deals to have taken place over the past few years, and where they rank in the money charts. \n10. Lenovo buys IBM's server business, then Motorola \nNot content with buying IBM's PC operation in 2005, Lenovo returned in 2014 to snap up the US firm's x86 server business for $2.3bn in cash and stock. \nThat's small change compared with some of the other deals in this list, but it did did allow Lenovo, already the world's largest PC manufacturer, to potentially strengthen its position in the enterprise IT market by selling servers and PCs in package deals, something its competitors couldn't. \nMotorola smartphones joined those packages when, later in the same year, Lenovo finalised a $2.91bn purchase of the mobile makers from Google. Lenovo immediately took third place in global smartphone market share, behind Apple and Samsung. \nHowever, neither merger has saved Lenovo from plunging profits . The firm cut 3,200 jobs in August after suffering multi-million dollar losses in its mobile division, which includes Motorola, and Enterprise Business Group, which includes the former IBM server business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:26:07.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
