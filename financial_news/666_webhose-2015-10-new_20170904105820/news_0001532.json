They define youth as people ages 15 to 29.\nThe index is based on 59 criteria including: youth unemployment rates, quality and cost of education, housing affordability, public deficit, access to technology, political and religious freedom and average age of elected officials.\nThe index only includes countries for which all 59 data points could be collected. This means many of the smallest and poorest countries are not represented. Neither are countries like Syria or North Korea, which war and authoritarian regimes have made terrible places to live at any age.\nClick here for the full story.\nPhoto: Krister Soerboe/Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:13:22.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
