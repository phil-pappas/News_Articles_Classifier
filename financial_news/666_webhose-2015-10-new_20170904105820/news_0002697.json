Further talking to his official blog, Amitabh shared that to make performance look genuine one should feel the character as your own. “Live not the thought and feel of performance...live the thought and feel as your own...that would be the greatest compliment for any art or artistic rendition...not all shall have the capacity to tune to notes that find expression...expressions that identify with feelings of my own creation... “Seldom would they depict the other...the other would be blessed if it did...for then they have linked themselves to the ultimate connect,” he wrote. Amitabh will next be seen in “Wazir” along with actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar.
