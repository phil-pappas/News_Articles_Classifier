(“comScore”). \nClick here to learn more about the investigation http://brodsky-smith.com/984-rent-rentrak-corporation.html , or call: 877-534-2590. There is no cost or obligation to you. \nUnder the terms of the transaction, Rentrak shareholders will receive only 1.15 shares of comScore stock for each share of Rentrak stock they own. The transaction values Rentrak stock at only approximately $49.62 per share. The investigation concerns whether the Board of Rentrak breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders and whether comScore is underpaying for Rentrak. The transaction may undervalue Rentrak and will result in a substantial loss for many Rentrak shareholders. For example, an analyst has set a price target for Rentrak stock at $100.00 per share and Rentrak stock traded at $71.26 per share as recently as August 4, 2015. \nIf you own shares of Rentrak and wish to discuss the legal ramifications of the investigation, or have any questions, you may e-mail or call the law office of Brodsky & Smith, LLC who will, without obligation or cost to you, attempt to answer your questions.
