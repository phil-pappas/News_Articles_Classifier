Jennifer Soo by Sam Henderson It's worth getting a private ruling on whether you can be defined as a professional investor and thus get more into your super fund, writes Sam Henderson, who answers your questions on superannuation.\nQ: Is it possible to satisfy the work test with time spent on managing personal investments? I've read that the Australian Tax Office does not regard management of your own investments as self-employment for the purposes of the work test. Is this correct? I have recently turned 65. I still have substantial investments outside super â€“ in shares, fixed income securities and cash. I manage these very actively to maximise income. I operate an investment company and a family trust as well as private investments and prepare financial statements and tax returns myself. Up until now, I have been able to claim the maximum concessional deduction against personal income. I would have no difficulty in keeping a log book to justify 30 hours in a four-week period.\nA: The Superannuation Industry Supervision Act (SIS Act) defines gainful employment as working at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days in the financial year. It goes on to elaborate that full-time work is greater than 30 hours a week and part-time falls under the previous definition of at least 40 hours in 30 consecutive days. Gainfully employed, according to the SIS Regulations 1994, means employed or self-employed for gain or reward in any business, trade, profession, vocation, calling, occupation or employment.\nUnder normal circumstances, I'd categorically say that you would not satisfy the requirements of self-employment if you were simply managing your self-managed super fund investments. That's what a SMSF is supposed to do and you cannot be remunerated for that.\nWhat raises my interest in your question is that you may fall into the professional investor category and thus be able to satisfy the work test by managing your own assets under the self-employment definition. My reasoning is that you have stated that you have a professional investment \"company\" (I assume a Pty Ltd company) and a family trust. The ATO, for example, may classify a professional investor with 20 residential properties as self-employed and may also class these residential properties as \"business real property\" to allow them to be transferred into a SMSF in specie (albeit with capital gains tax events, stamp duty and within the contribution laws). In this situation, the owner is a professional investor, much like you may be.\nThe best and most accurate way to find out is to ask for a private ruling from the ATO to assess your situation. It seems like it would be worth doing because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain in the form of another 10 years of $35,000 concessional contributions (under current laws). I'd suggest that if you have evidence to substantiate that you pay income tax in a corporate entity or trust, have a quarterly BAS, instalment tax notices or operate just like a business, then you may well be classified as a business. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, the ATO may think you're a duck!\nQ: In a situation where a SMSF has two members in \"accumulation\" mode and two members in \"pension\" mode and there are fully segregated accounts within the fund, what kind of discretion has the trustee of the fund in \"distributing\" ATO yearly refunds between the members? Possible solutions could be:\na distribution made proportionally to the value of each member's balance for the year to which the refund relates; a distribution made proportionally to the \"actual\" tax charged for specific members accounts (excluding, of course, members in \"pension\" mode); a distribution made proportionally to the franking credit that relates either to each member (both \"accumulation\" and \"pension\") for the year in question or only to the \"accumulation\" mode members' franking credits; or any other method at the total discretion of the trustee, ie credit only one member or two members based on the premise that their balances are low and they could do with a \"boost\". A: Neither trustees, their accountants nor SMSF administrators have discretion as to how the franking credits can be distributed. Franking credits must be distributed based on the proportion of each trustee/member balance in the fund. Clearly, members in pension mode benefit more from franking credits as they do not pay tax if they are over 60. But you cannot choose to crank up their benefits because of the tax advantages afforded to them and thus lower the overall tax of the fund.\nWhile you sound like you have a solid grasp of SMSF issues, one thing many DIY super trustees don't fully understand is the member statements at the back of their tax returns. In fact, most people don't even read them. I'd suggest readers have a look at these and check the pension amounts, taxable portions and member balances to fully understand how much of the fund each member actually owns.\nFinancial planner Sam Henderson is chief executive of Henderson Maxwell.
