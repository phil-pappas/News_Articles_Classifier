PUBLISHED: 18:27, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:44, Tue, Oct 20, 2015 GETTY Waitrose managing director Mark Price is apparently headed to Channel 4 Waitrose boss ‘heading to C4’ \nPrice, who is also deputy chairman of the partnership, will step down on April 3, 2016. \nIt has been reported that Price is being lined up to become the interim chairman of Channel 4 when the incumbent Lord Burns ends his term in January. \nWaitrose’s retail director Rob Collins has been appointed to take over as managing director when Price steps down. \nPrice became managing director of Waitrose in 2007, and over that time the supermarket’s annual gross sales grew 65 per cent to £6.5billion to March of this year. \nHe used celebrity chefs such as Delia Smith and Heston Blumenthal to help market the business. GETTY Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee shops, faces a £20m wage hike due to the living wage increase Whitbread costs to soar \nCosta Coffee and Premier Inn owner Whitbread unveiled a hike in half-year profits, but warned it will face up to an extra £20million a year in staff costs from the new national living wage. \nThe group, which is one of the UK’s biggest employers with around 48,000 staff, said it had already increased pay for baristas in its Costa Coffee chain by about 10 per cent this month to take pay above the incoming national living wage. \nThis will cost it about £5million over the second half of its financial year, while wider wage hikes across the group to meet the new minimum pay rules and its own pay plans will add £15million to £20million a year to annual costs. \nThe group said it cannot rule out price rises as it looks to offset the higher wage bill, but stressed it hoped to make savings in other ways, such as better staff rostering. \nIts first-half results showed a 13.8 per cent jump in underlying pre-tax profits to £291.3million for the six months to August 27. \nWhitbread, which also owns restaurant brands including Brewers Fayre, saw shares lift more than 3 per cent, up 157p at 4882p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:24:04.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
