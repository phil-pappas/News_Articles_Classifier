AP by Leo Lewis\nThe initial public offerings of Japan Post and its two subsidiaries are already as much as five times oversubscribed after less than a week of bookbuilding, as individual Japanese investors place orders for the country's biggest state asset sale in decades.\nPeople close to the deal said orders for the estimated $US11 billion share sale had been placed with \"surprising enthusiasm\" given the heavy sell-off of Tokyo-listed shares in August and the Nikkei 225's recent dip below 18,000 points.\nThe three-way IPO , due to take place on November 4 after more than a decade of preparations, will see the simultaneous listing of Japan Post Holdings, Japan Post Bank and Japan Post Insurance.\nAs the order book stands, shares in the insurance company, which may benefit from deregulation in coming years, are 5.6 times oversubscribed, said brokers from among the 60 companies involved in sales to individuals.\nShares in both the holdings company and the bank are both 1.5 times oversubscribed, according to brokers at two of the domestic Japanese securities houses involved in the deal.\nThe share sale, a process fraught with political wrangling and a low rumble of objection from many of Japan Post's 200,000 permanent employees, has been pitched squarely at individual investors.\nThe administration of Shinzo Abe, prime minister, is keen to convince Japanese individuals to rotate more of their bank savings into investment, and sees the Japan Post IPO as a significant opportunity to draw as many as 500,000 people into stock investment for the first time.\n Some 80 per cent of the shares being sold have been allocated to domestic investors, and of that, about 90 per cent has been earmarked for individuals, say people familiar with the IPO process.\nThe apparent success of the bookbuilding could allow Japan Post to price the sale closer to the top end of the price ranges revealed last week.\nPricing at the top end of the range would raise roughly Y1.4 trillion ($US11.7 billion), making the flotation the biggest in the world this year and Japan's largest privatisation since the late 1980s.\nFinal prices for the bank and insurance company IPOs will be revealed on October 19, with the main holdings company priced a week later.\nBecause of the low growth prospects of the mainstay postal delivery service and insurance business, brokers commenting ahead of the bookbuilding process had expected shares in Japan Post Bank to be the most popular among both private and institutional investors.\nThe banking arm of Japan Post shares its network with the main postal business and as such has 24,000 branches - more than the rest of Japan's national banks put together.\nThe bank also has been heaping pressure on the government to allow it to raise the deposit limit on accounts from the current level of Y10 million - a change that if enacted would create potentially destructive competition for Japan's regional banks, which have strongly resisted the proposal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:53:36.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
