There's been a long-held notion that it's not going to happen to us, that it's not going to happen here. Well, the fact is that it is happening here, it's happening to corporations and to governments, and the need to invest and the need to be vigilant is just increasing.\"\n Traditional network security software companies such as McAfee also offer cyber security products.\n'Honey traps' hook in threats KPMG was attracted to Norse Corp because it has its own telecommunications network. This allows the company to lay \"honey traps\" on the network, see how the \"bad guys\" respond and feed the intelligence back to clients.\n\"We see it as a great opportunity for us to invest in a company that has got a world-class technology,\" KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash said.\nNorse Corp also has sensors and \"intelligent agents\" littered around its network to monitor traffic, identify suspicious activity or traffic from suspect sources, and advise clients if they are likely being attacked and how they should respond in \"near real time\".\nDepending on the time of day the company's \" threat map \" may show thousands of cyber threats emanating from China and hundreds emanating from Saudi Arabia, the US, India, Germany, Armenia or Bulgaria.\nThe attacks are overwhelmingly directed at the US, followed by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and unidentified \"military/government\" targets.\nKPMG will offer Norse Corp products and services via its network of more than 162,000 advisers across more than 150 countries.\nKPMG Capital Fund 1 has invested in five \"disruptive\" other start-ups. They include companies that monitor and report on social media and public record information on corporations and their suppliers, or dig into an organisation's disparate legacy information systems to track customer engagement and identify where things go wrong.\nThe fund is now closed, and KPMG Capital is aiming to raise $US200 million ($272 million) to $US300 million from KPMG firms for a second fund to invest in disruptive technologies.", "external_links": ["http://map.norsecorp.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:19.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
