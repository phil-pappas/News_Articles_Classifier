View photo\nValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. signage is displayed outside of the company's headquarters … \n\"I used to think if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or a .400 baseball hitter. But now I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody,\" political strategist James Carville is said to have quipped in the early 1990s. Valeant is about to find out just what a bully bond investors can be.\nThe link between capital markets and short-sellers is laid bare in the latest leg of the Valeant saga, where the Canadian pharmaceuticals company now stands accused by short-sellers and stock analysts including Citron Research of an Enron-like accounting and distributions fraud . Shares of Valeant, already in the midst of intense political pressure over the way it prices its drugs, dropped 40 percent after Citron published its note on Wednesday, ending the day down 19 percent. \nMore from Bloomberg.com: OPEC Is About to Crush the U.S. Oil Boom \nYet Canada's only large-cap growth stock was in trouble even before the Citron hit \"sent\" on its report, and not for its controversial drug pricing -- which has caught the eye of U.S. politicians and prosecutors -- either. Instead, it had to do with the massive debt-load taken on by the company to fund its many acquisitions . \nThat weakness was underscored earlier this week when Valeant announced better-than-expected third quarter earnings, plus a pivot away from its long-time strategy of buying drugmakers and then raising the prices of their products.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: The Strongest El Nino in Decades Is Going to Mess With Everything \n\"Valeant is changing its business model, including emphasizing research and development, which implies the prior business model was unsustainable,\" Morgan Stanley analysts led by David Risinger wrote on Tuesday, following Valeant's results. \nA growth stock without access to the capital it needs to fund its growth will rapidly find itself classified as something else altogether, and uncertainty is a detested thing for credit investors.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: A Lot of Cheap Housing Is About to Get Very Expensive \n\"Even where fraud did not exist (Tyco back in 2002), the lack of clarity is usually a major mistake,\" CreditSights analysts Eric Axon and Chris Snow wrote on Thursday. \"In an [over-the-counter] market such as high-yield bonds and in a market where the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a close eye on loan risk and reserving at the banks, the stakes are high.\"\nValeant's most actively traded bonds due in 2025 fell off a cliff on Wednesday, and JPMorgan credit analysts have subsequently cut their rating on the company's debt: \"We have to admit we underestimated the degree to which Valeant developed into a lightning rod for controversy,\" they deadpanned.\nThe good news here is that Valeant does not have any bonds coming due until 2018. The bad news is that it now needs to prove it can transition to a growth-oriented business that can exist without the backing of cheap access to capital. And it must do all this while fighting off politicians, prosecutors and a new crop of short-sellers.\nCarville is famous for another quip from the early 1990s. In the case of Valeant, we could aptly say; it's the debt stupid!\nThe truth here is that companies reliant on continuous access to the capital markets to fund their growth make easy feasting for short-sellers. Regardless of the truth of Citron's and others' hefty assertions, Valeant was and remains very vulnerable.\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nThe 401(k) Crisis Is Getting Worse Tesla Loses Consumer Reports Recommendation Amid Rise in Sales How Could Volkswagen’s Top Engineers Not Have Known?
