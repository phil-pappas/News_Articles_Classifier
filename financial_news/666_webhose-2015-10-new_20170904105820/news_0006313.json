We have a lot of migration there.\" \nThe two worked together at the hackathon earlier this month on My Refuge, with Koutsos lending his skills and experience and Loewenthal bringing his idea to a wider audience. \nAs well as connecting people with ideas to others with the skills to enact them, the hackathon had another function - to identify existing problems and brainstorm possible solutions. \nFor example, a major problem refugees face is keeping in touch with family and friends while crossing borders. Many do not have internet-enabled smartphones, and, if they do, the signal is patchy so mobile apps are of limited use. \nIn response, one group at the hackathon was working on an SMS network in which people could send text messages to several people, like the group messaging function served by apps like WhatsApp and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) , but with simpler, cheaper technology. \nOther people were trying to find ways for refugees to record crimes they face on their journeys, while another group was looking for ways to help Syrian refugees have a voice in countries to which they have fled. \nMigreat, a website showing people what visas or permits are needed to move from one country to another, was also present. \nThe site currently supports people migrating to join their family, to work, to study or to find a visa after graduation, listing the thousands of possible visa permutations depending on age, family, income and other factors. \nBut staff at the London hackathon were seeking to add a new strand - advising those wishing to move to another country because they are fleeing war or persecution. \nMigreat spokeswoman Josephine Goube said not all information on how to apply for asylum status is public knowledge. For instance in her native France refugees who apply for asylum have a better chance of success if they speak French, she said. \nMigreat intends to show people the way to get accepted as a refugee, not the way written on the government's website, \"but the real way\", said Goube.
