Some did not appreciate the politics of pink and the way the breast is sexualised as a marketing tool, with attractive young women used to attract funds when most women develop the cancer in their 60s.\nExploitation concerns Some were concerned about the potential for commercial exploitation of pink and the lack of transparency about the percentage of funds donated and how these were used in research.\nSome felt the colour had been hijacked.\nOn Breast Cancer Network Australia's website, Mr Ritchie recently posted about how it was time for Pinktober, to include the male minority. His post received positive comments.\nThe idea of a bit of blue is not new. When pink ribbons first appeared en masse in the United States in the 1990s, one woman whose father had died of breast cancer created a pink and blue ribbon to raise awareness that men also got it.\nThe concept never took hold although now, some organisations abroad, such as The DIPEx Charity in Oxfordshire, were also suggesting it.\nThe website of the Male Breast Cancer Coalition, a collection of foundations and male survivors sharing their journeys, displays a half-pink, half-blue ribbon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:21.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
