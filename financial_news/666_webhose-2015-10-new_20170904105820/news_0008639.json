Share on twitter by Jacob Greber At first glance, it looks like a nerdy Treasury official’s wet dream, which is lucky, as the department is responsible for its creation.\nA critical part of Treasury’s submission to the tax white paper Re:Think , the chart illustrates the effect on the economy of different types of taxes – also known as the “marginal excess burden” – of differing imposts. It’s based on the simple idea that all taxes are a dead weight on economic growth and jobs, but some are worse than others.\nFor instance, among the worst are property stamp duties, which impose a cost of about 70¢ for every dollar raised. At the other end of the scale are broad-based land taxes and rates, which may even be so effective they actually contribute to activity.\nIn the middle are the taxes at the heart of the September national tax summit – co-sponsored by The Australian Financial Review and KPMG. Two days of debate from business groups, tax experts and welfare advocates circled around the challenging question of whether it’s worth the political effort of hiking the low-impact GST to fund reductions in higher-drag imposts including income and company taxes.\nSupplied Treasury’s chart leaves no doubt company taxes need to be part of that adjustment, with a deadweight cost of just under 50¢ – more than double that of the GST. But, as many in business increasingly recognise, any plan that hikes the GST to only pay for corporate tax cuts is likely to fail at the ballot box. “There is a drag on company tax and it’s worth doing something about that,” says Frank Drenth, from the Business Coalition for Tax Reform – a group set up topromote tax reform.\n“But business recognises it’s naive to do a straight GST swap for company tax because most of the community think a company tax cut will go to fat old men who smoke cigars.”\nAs is clear to most serious commentators, including shadow Labor Treasurer Chris Bowen, workers are just as likely to win from any reduction in corporate tax.\nHowever, for any corporate tax reform to win, many of the tax summiteers argued, there will also need to be compensation and income tax cuts as a way of maintaining the sacred political cow of fairness. Which is why income tax cuts – along with compensation to low-income earners – will need to be part of the mix.\n Yet Treasury’s chart has muddied the water on this point. According to its analysis, labour income taxes are on the same low level of inefficiency as the GST. As a result, according to voices such as Australian Council of Social Service senior policy adviser Peter Davidson, the switch from income tax to the GST would “not be worth the candle”.\nBy extension, it would seem, neither is broader reform, which to be fair, is not ACOSS’s position. But many, including Chris Richardson from Deloitte Access Economics, have been forced to challenge this defeatist notion: that there’s no point addressing the income tax system. He says the Treasury chart doesn’t take into account the negative effect of income taxes on people who face higher marginal tax rates. Treasury makes this clear in the footnotes of Re:Think .\n“The nasty bit of the personal tax system is where it interacts with pensions and benefits getting withdrawn,” Richardson says.\n“Broadly, mum has the opportunity to work an extra day, but doesn’t because of the combination of moving up through the marginal tax bracket and the loss of benefits. The people who face the highest marginal tax rates are low-income earners with the opportunity to work more. It’s downright dumb that we have parts of our tax transfer system that positively beg our people to stay home.”\nTreasury’s research was widely debated at the two-day tax summit, which saw further momentum for a broad package of tax reform covering the GST, lower income taxes, company tax cuts and a compensation package for low-income households.\nReading the research correctly means digging into the footnotes. The prize is a national system, as former Victorian premier John Brumby has suggested, one that sees “taxes up for some people; improved benefits for the majority”.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:04:40.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
