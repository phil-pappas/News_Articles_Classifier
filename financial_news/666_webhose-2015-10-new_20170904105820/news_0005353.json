Photo: Peter Rae\nA stellar performance from the Papua New Guinea LNG project and progress on a wealth of gas development opportunities have given weight to Oil Search's blunt rejection of Woodside Petroleum's $11.6 billion takeover approach, although managing director Peter Botten has left the door open to better offers that reflect \"compelling value\".\nSpeaking to Fairfax Media on Tuesday, Mr Botten also said fears that landowner unrest over unpaid revenues could disrupt the PNG LNG venture were \"very much overblown\" and said there was a \"constructive dialogue\" under way to resolve the remaining issues rapidly.\nIn a quarterly report, Mr Botten signalled Oil Search had no need to merge with Woodside, pointing to the company's \"robust\" finances and its highly regarded partners for its LNG ventures in PNG, ExxonMobil and French oil major Total.\nWoodside's one-for-four scrip approach to Oil Search last month was roundly dismissed by the PNG player's board as \"highly opportunistic\". The board said it \"grossly undervalues\" Oil Search and would dilute growth for shareholders.\nAdvertisement Woodside chief executive Peter Coleman last week reiterated he regarded the approach as \"fully priced\".\nBut the September-quarter performance supported Oil Search's position, with record three-month output of 7.42 million barrels of oil equivalent, putting the company on track to deliver full-year production at the upper end of its 27 million to 29 million BOE guidance.\nDrilling at the Antelope gasfield with Total and InterOil, which would feed the proposed new Papua LNG venture, found gas 32 metres above target, signalling a larger than expected resource. Mr Botten also voiced confidence in a likely resource upgrade at the P'nyang field, due to supply an expansion of PNG LNG. Another well at Antelope is to be drilled this December quarter, while drilling at the \"multi-tcf [trillion cubic feet]\" Muruk prospect is due to start by March, among 12 exploration and appraisal wells pencilled in for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\"When you look at that exploration and appraisal pipeline, that to me underlines the Woodside interest in Oil Search,\" said Gareth Hulbert, senior portfolio manager at Harper Bernays, an investor in the PNG-based company.\n\"It shows they have realistic production growth prospects in the medium term which will translate into higher value for shareholders. Also most importantly, those production prospects are still valid at current oil prices.\"\nBernstein Research analyst Neil Beveridge said Oil Search had \"a plethora\" of growth options, with the potential for a further three LNG trains, on top of the two producing within the ExxonMobil-led PNG LNG venture.\nOil Search shares still slid 1.75 per cent to $7.30, but easily outperformed the broader energy index, which dropped 3.25 per cent after crude oil prices fell.\nMeanwhile, Mr Botten rejected worries about a threat of disruption to production at PNG LNG from local landowners, who, as reported by Fairfax Media last week, are not receiving the full benefits from their 2.78 per cent share in the $US19 billion project.\n\"I don't think there's a well of ill will towards the project; there is clearly a desire by all concerned to resolve the outstanding issues and there is dialogue ongoing to do that,\" he said.\n\"I genuinely think there is a substantial well of good will to get this done and get this done in a professional reasonable way. On that basis I don't see that there's a particular risk to project operations.\"\nMr Botten said it was \"business as usual\" at Oil Search following the rebuttal Woodside. The two companies have, however, since had \"a number of discussions at high level as part of the normal business process,\" he said.\n\"Everything is for sale at the right price, there's no doubt about it, and we'll properly engage as and when the relative merits of a proposal make it appropriate,\" Mr Botten said.\nOIl Search's revenues in the quarter fell to $US379 million ($523 million) from $US391.5 million in the previous three months and dived almost 30 per cent from a year earlier because of the slump in prices.\nPNG LNG operated at an annualised rate of about 7.4 million tonnes a year in the quarter, higher than its rated capacity of 6.9 million, and Mr Botten anticipates production of at least 7.3 million tonnes a year through 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/energy/gas/exxonmobil-concerned-png-landowners-missing-out-on-lng-benefits-20151011-gk6l0p"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:41:36.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
