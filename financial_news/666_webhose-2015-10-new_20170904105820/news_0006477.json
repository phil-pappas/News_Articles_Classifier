Michele Mossop Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl The golden entrance to Martin Place's newest office tower is getting a lot of attention. But don't fooled – it is the big tinted cast glass blocks that make it appear to be made of real gold.\nStripped back to its steel frame only a year ago, 20 Martin Place is now completely refurbished. With its shingled glass façade it gives Sydney's pedestrian boulevard a contemporary new look. The project complements a broader revival happening along Martin Place, with landlords taking the opportunity to sensationally redevelop the strip's historic buildings.\nPembroke Real Estate bought the building in 2011 for $95 million. Formerly the headquarters of ANZ Bank, it was run down and in need of refurbishment. After Pembroke's $100 million redevelopment, it is now ready for tenants.\n\"It's a unique building, but we tried to keep it sympathetic to the surrounding sandstone buildings at Martin Place,\" Pembroke's Asia Pacific head, Jack Clark, said.\nThe building is already 75 per cent leased to companies Hogan Lovells, REGUS, Acadian Asset Management and Providence Wealth Advisory Group. The anchor tenant has not been officially confirmed, but it is well known a tech company is moving its headquarters to the building next year.\nMr Clark declined to comment on Apple but said the diversity of the tenants coming to 20 Martin Place speaks volumes about the property and the future of the precinct.\nThe building has three levels of retail, including ANZ's new flagship CBD branch. There will also be a restaurant backing on to Hosking Place, part of a push by the City of Sydney council and owners to activate laneways. Tesla Motors will also open a vast showroom at the building. However, both Pembroke and leasing agent CBRE declined to comment on speculation. It leaves one retail spot free.\n\"It's one of the last remaining retail spaces along Martin Place right now, so we want to be patient and make sure we get the right tenant,\" Mr Clark said.\n Pembroke worked with local architects Crone Partners and the international team of James Carpenter Design Associates, and Australian construction company Built led construction of the 19,000-square-metre building.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:02:25.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
