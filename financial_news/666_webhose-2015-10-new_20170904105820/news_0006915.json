Supplied Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby The residential market is running out of puff, with house prices in Sydney growing at less than half the rate of three months ago, the latest Domain House Price Report shows.\nThe NSW capital chalked up a new record median house price of $1,032,433 in September, up 3.2 per cent from June but well down on the 7.7 per cent quarterly increase in June.\nSydney apartments showed an even greater deceleration, slowing to quarterly growth of just 1.5 per cent from 7.4 per cent in June.\n\"The great Sydney house price boom has ended, with house price growth tracking back sharply over the September quarter,\" the report said.\nHouse price growth also slowed in Melbourne, rising 2.8 per cent to a median price of $707,415, down from June's 6 per cent increase. Unit price growth picked up to 1.9 per cent from 0.3 per cent.\nSedate period Steady borrowing costs – prior to Westpac rate rise last week – and weak incomes growth are the reasons for the slowdown in the two largest cities, which in turn has pulled back the national rates of house-price growth. This doesn't mean prices will fall – Sydney and Melbourne will continue to increase – but with lacklustre performance at best in the other cities, Australian housing looks to be in for a much more sedate period.\n\"The general outlook for housing markets across Australia is moderate to modest growth (at best) over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016,\" Domain Group senior economist Andrew Wilson said. \"Despite slowing, Sydney and Melbourne will continue to lead the pack on price growth with Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra remaining solid. Brisbane, Perth and Darwin, however, will remain relatively subdued.\"\n Domain is owned by Fairfax Media, publisher of The Australian Financial Review .\nApartments in Brisbane continued to fall in price, as the predicted glut plays through into the market.\n\"This was the fifth consecutive quarter of falling unit prices in Brisbane,\" Dr Wilson said. \"With high levels of new apartment construction entering the market over the past year, supply has pushed well ahead of demand.\"\nFrom a year ago, Brisbane apartment prices have fallen 5.6 per cent. Houses, which are up 3.6 per cent year on year, rose 0.8 per cent from the previous quarter.\nHouses in Hobart posted a similarly modest growth of 0.9 per cent, but units took a leap in the three months to September, jumping 8.5 per cent after a 4.5 per cent decline in June. The Hobart median unit price is at $269,302, up 6.1 per cent from a year ago.\nCanberra is mixed. Houses gained 2.3 per cent over the quarter, putting them up 7.8 per cent year on year – the fastest annual pace since September 2010. The quarterly decline in apartment prices sped up to 4.7 per cent from 3.7 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:04:21.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
