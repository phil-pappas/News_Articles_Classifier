Section 4(b) of the Amendment Act reworks section 12 of the Labour Act by adding a section 12 (4) (a) which provides that: \n\"No employer shall terminate a contract of employment on notice unless (a) the termination is in terms of an employment code or in the absence of an employment code, in terms of the model code made under section109 (9); or (b) the employer and employee mutually agree in writing to the termination of the contract or (c) the employee was engaged for a period of a fixed duration or (d) pursuant to retrenchment in accordance with section 12C.\" \nThe provision modifies the common law right of an employer to terminate an employment contract on notice. \nThey also want Section 18 of the Amendment Act to be declared unconstitutional because it provides for workers fired before the amendment of the law to be given retrenchment packages. \n\"The principle of law states that no law can retrospectively take away rights granted at the time the new law was absent,\" said Mr Mufukare. \nThe Supreme Court ruling sparked a widespread of dismissals, which saw close to 30 000 workers being left jobless. \nGovernment intervened with a cocktail of reforms to the Labour Act to halt the employment haemorrhage. \nEmcoz cited Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira as the respondent in its application. Minister Mupfumira has 10 days to respond to the application.
