The no tipping movement is picking up some momentum in New York City. \nThe Union Square Hospitality Group, which operates 13 restaurants, including Manhattan's Union Square Caf√© and Gramercy Tavern, announced Wednesday it is eliminating tipping from all its establishments. \nDanny Meyer, CEO of USHG, said the move allows more career advancement for its 1,800 workers. \n\"By eliminating tipping, our employees who want to grow financially and professionally will be able to earn those opportunities based on the merit of their work,\" Meyer said in a letter posted online. \nTipping regulations can create pay discrepancies between workers at the front of the house and those in the kitchen. \nThe Modern, located at the Museum of Modern Art, will be the first to get rid of tips in November. The change will happen at the rest of the businesses throughout 2016. \nMeyer told Eater that some menu prices will rise to cover the compensation shift, but in his letter he said the impact on diners won't be significant. \"Once these changes are implemented, the total cost you pay to dine with us won't differ much from what you pay now.\" \nUSHG did not immediately return calls for comment. \nRelated: Could this mean the end of tipping? \nEliminating the end of dinner ritual of trying to figure how much gratuity to leave has been gaining traction, but still has a ways to go from being a common practice. \nLast month, chef Tom Colicchio launched a lunch service at his flagship restaurant Craft in New York City that eliminated tipping. Since the service is new to the restaurant, it was easier to introduce the concept to patrons. \n\"I just think that the idea of working for gratuity is really a thing of the past,\" Colicchio recently told CNNMoney. \"Why leave it up to that? [Staff] come in and work hard. You have to know the menu, wine list .. this is a skill.\" \nColicchio opened Gramercy Tavern with Danny Meyer in 1994.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:43:27.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
