For decades, Brazilian companies large and small have been hooked on cheap credit from BNDES.\nBNDES is gradually slowing lending as part of efforts by President Dilma Rousseff to narrow a mounting budget deficit and the crowding-out of banks and debt markets from credit markets.\nBNDES' balance sheet grew at a record pace during Rousseff's first term, which started in January 2011 and ended last December, and credit rating firms have urged her to downsize it as a condition to maintain the nation's investment-grade status.\n($1 = 4.0397 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal Editing by W Simon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:52:40.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
