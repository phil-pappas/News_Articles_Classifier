Combining the two companies will create an operator with around 20 percent of the private beds in the region, analysts said. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will also be the biggest player in Switzerland, the third largest in South Africa, and will have a 29.9 percent stake in Britain's Spire Healthcare Group. \nThe deal, structured as a reverse takeover of Al Noor by Mediclinic, will create a London-listed group with a turnover exceeding $4 billion operating 73 hospitals and 35 clinics. \nNMC Health, which is also listed in London, said it had made an informal cash-and-shares offer to buy Al Noor on Oct. 9, days after Al Noor and Mediclinic said they were in talks. \nAl Noor Chief Executive Ronald Lavater said there was a \"compelling strategic fit\" with Mediclinic, and together they could expand coverage and service delivery in the region. \nHe said the board had considered the NMC Health proposal and had concluded it was \"inferior both on the value and on the deal certainty\". \nThe tie-up with Mediclinic is backed by the two major shareholders in Al Noor, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed and Kassem Alom, who combined hold 34.3 percent, the companies said. \nNMC (Other OTC: NMCX - news ) , however, was undeterred. \"This confirms our belief in the competitiveness of our initial possible offer and that the combination of NMC and Al Noor has the strongest strategic and financial rationale for all stakeholders,\" it said. \nAl Noor was advised by Rothschild, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and Jefferies, while Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and Rand Merchant Bank worked for Mediclinic. \n($1 = 0.6518 pounds) (Additional reporting by Tom Arnold in Dubai; Editing by Jason Neely and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:58:07.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
