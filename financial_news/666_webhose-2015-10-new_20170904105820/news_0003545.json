Carson Energy, the 32 year old, A+ rated Texas oil company, believes the best place to invest right now to both maximize tax deductions and potential profits is oil.\nNew York, NY (PRWEB) October 12, 2015\nAs the 4th quarter gets underway, investors are starting to focus on how to best reduce 2015 tax liabilities and figure out how to best position themselves for 2016. In recent years, the number of investors considering oil well investments has grown significantly, yet still most Americans think the only way to invest in oil is through the stock market, when in fact it's actually possible to share in the potential profits and tax deductions of the oil industry, right alongside of oil companies.\nThe ability to own and invest in oil is something uniquely American. The United States is one of the only countries in the world where private citizens can own natural resources.\nIn an effort to make the United States less reliant on foreign sources of oil and to offset the risk associated with drilling domestic oil wells, the U.S. Government offers oil investors significant tax advantages that are unique to oil investments.\nOil and gas drilling programs are specifically designed to generate various tax deductions from drilling and operating oil and gas wells. These deductions include intangible drilling costs (IDC), depreciation and operating costs. In addition, when production is achieved, investors can claim a depletion deduction with respect to their share of the Venture’s income from the oil and gas produced. That makes oil investments the best tax deductions on the market, because those tax deductions actually come on top of producing wells.\nDRILLING FOR OIL AND GAS IS THE VERY BEST TAX ADVANTAGED INVESTMENT (NEWSWEEK MAGAZINE)\nCarson Energy is most widely known for creating oil and gas joint venture partnership investments in the 1980’s, being one of only a small group of companies to make it through single digit oil prices in the 90’s and most recently for launching a new oil project concept similar to stock market mutual funds, but for oil wells. Carson Energy also currently has the #1 oil investor website in the country: http://www.carsonenergy.com/\nFor accredited investors with a degree of risk tolerance, oil well investing can lead to some pretty big profits and tax deductions.
