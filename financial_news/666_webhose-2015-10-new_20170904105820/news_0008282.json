Michael Clayton-Jones Share on twitter by Sarah Danckert Commonwealth Bank of Australia will refund $7.6 million to thousands of agribusiness customers slugged with unfair fees on one of the bank's products.\nA statement by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission says CBA has agreed to repay 8400 customers after failing to properly administer the bank's AgriAdvantage Plus package over several years.\nCBA is not the first major Australian bank to run into trouble over charging incorrect fees on products.\nIn April, ANZ issued a statement, saying it would pay 8500 customers who purchased a bundled financing planning product, Prime Access, about $30 million in compensation.\nIn July, National Australia Bank said it would repay 62,000 customers of its wealth division $25 million after short-changing clients.\nCBA's AgriAdvantage problems come as the bank works through its compensation program for clients of its financial planning arms.\nSo far, only 19 of the 8835 customers who have requested their files be reviewed have been compensated by CBA for receiving poor financial advice.\nThe bank had also compensated 1100 customers who were victims of rogue planners, paying out $52 million.\nASIC says CBA has advised the regulator of \"its intention to undertake an investigation, engage an independent expert to review its remediation process to ensure an accurate calculation of refunds, and refund all affected customers\".\n ASIC did not detail how long it would take CBA's AgriAdvantage customers to receive bank compensation.\nIt is believed that the bank hopes to complete reimbursements by the end of next month.\n\"Where errors occur, it is important that they be rectified promptly and appropriately. That includes restoring consumers to the position they should have been had the breach not occurred,\" ASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sdanck"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:03:21.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
