The government failed to demand enough from ASIO in terms of accountability, but the government wished to be kept informed and ASIO ensured it was,\" the book says.\n \"ASIO came to be seen in the eyes of protesters and other observers as the tool of a conservative government, reaffirming views held since the Petrov defection in 1954. Not surprisingly, therefore, when a change of government occurred at the end of 1972, ASIO would be in for a shock.\"\nThe difficult relationship with the Whitlam government comprises much of the book, but Dr Blaxland also launched the volume at ASIO headquarters in Canberra on Friday with a cliffhanger: suggesting the third and final volume of the history to be released next year would reveal that the agency had been \"penetrated\" by the Soviet Union or an eastern bloc country.\nParanoia about a Soviet mole had been strong in the 1960s and 1970s – which the second volume covers, leading to the then director-general, Brigadier Charles Spry setting up a special unit to pursue possible infiltrators.\nWhile concern about espionage and subversion is now often dismissed in the post-Cold War era, Dr Blaxland says the evidence is \"compelling that the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc proxies were actively engaged in espionage in Australia\".\n\"Their efforts were multifaceted, enduring and relentless … there remained a variety of … Trotskyist or socialist splinter groups [that] retained a dogged fixation in terms of rhetoric and apparent intention, if not in capability, on the violent overthrow of Australia's parliamentary democratic system.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-10-16T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:58:45.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
