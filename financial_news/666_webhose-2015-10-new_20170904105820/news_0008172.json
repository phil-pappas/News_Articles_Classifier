Signs of further stimulus from China, after the latest set of factory activity data disappointed, and a drop in US crude production by 40,0000 barrels a day, also helped oil prices rally early in the trading session. \nNonetheless, oil and gas stocks dominated the top FTSE climbers , as BP advanced 8.3p, or 2.5pc, to 342.3p, Royal Dutch Shell B shares jumped 2.4pc to £16.01 and BG closed 1.4pc higher to 694.1p. Brent Crude Futures November-15 1-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nTullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) rose to the top of the mid-cap index, as Brent prices ticked higher, and as the oil producer announced it had retained its $3.7bn lending facility. The Anglo-Irish petroleum explorer also said it is on track and on budget to deliver first oil and generate cash flow from its TEN development in Ghana by mid-2016. \nDespite its stellar performance yesterday, Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) urged investors to “step back and consider the broader capital structure”. Brian Gallagher warned the ongoing cost of debt needs to be considered, pointing to the first half of the year, during which Tullow booked an interest charge of $83m. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) rose 16.3p, or 9.6pc, to 185.4p. \nMiners also cheered at the prospects of additional support from the Chinese government, with the motable exception of Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) . BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) rose 2.4pc to £10.29, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) made gains of 0.7pc to 555p, while precious metals miners Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) and Randgold Resources jumped 2.2pc and 1.8pc, respectively - as gold prices inched higher. \nMeanwhile, Glencore continued to dominate Britain’s benchmark index swinging from leader to laggard in intraday trading. Shares closed in negative territory, down 0.6pc to 91p, in what was another volatile trading session for the Switzerland-based company. \nHaving reversed losses made earlier in the week, the international miner and trading group began the day in positive territory before tumbling into the red in afternoon trade . After Investec cautioned investors on Monday Glencore’s equity value could evaporate , shares sunk to a new low. * Questor share tip: Is now the time to buy Glencore? However, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) since met with management, describing the meeting as “encouraging”, one which “helped to clear up many misconceptions and confusion”. The bank said Glencore’s management reiterated that there are “no liquidity or solvency issues”, and that it has a positive cash flow. Ian Rossouw, of Barclays, put one of the miner’s biggest “misconceptions” to rest. \nWhile it is widely held that Glencore requires its investment grade credit rating for the marketing business, Mr Rossouw said: “Most of the other commodity traders have a lower rating than Glencore and they are still able to operate in this environment.” \nSeparately, the latest purchase of shares by company director John Mack did little to halt its fresh slide, as traders in the City blamed the return of hedge funds and short-sellers for the latest fall. \nIn the wider market, the FTSE 100 enjoyed gains of 1.83pc in early trade, before retreating after a negative opening bell on Well Street had a rippling effect across the Atlantic, and oil prices slipped. \nJoshua Mahony, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “The apparent re-emergence of bullish sentiment seen over the past two days has gradually unwound today, despite initial appearances that we could see a continuation higher, the steam has been taken out the rally for now.” * FTSE rally only \"a window dressing\" as index suffers worst quarter since 2011 Meanwhile, with the Chinese market shuttered until mid-next week, to celebrate President Xi Jinping’s birthday, and analysts at IG said this will help remove volatility from the global markets, as the nation has been the “epicentre of major sell offs recently”. The blue chip index closed 10.86 points, or 0.18pc, higher at 6,072.47. \nA vote of confidence in Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) by Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) prompted the stock to leap 25p, or 2.2pc, to £11.52. The bank began covering the stock, urging investors to revisit its investment case. In a bullish note, analysts reckon 2016 will mark the first year where pretty much every division, with the exception of North America Schools, ends up in positive growth territory. \n“We think the worst is behind us in terms of challenges to underlying growth,” Thomas Singlehurst, of Citigroup said. \nElsewhere, a day after dominating the FTSE risers, supermarkets stocks suffered the biggest losses. On Wednesday, J Sainsbury (Other OTC: JSAIY - news ) boosted the entire sector, rising by almost 14pc, as it said its profits would come in slightly ahead of consensus figures of £548m. \nDespite brokers upgrading the grocer’s target price, its share price was left depressed, losing 5p to 256p. \nWhile it revised the stock’s target price to 275p, John Kershaw, of Exane BNP Paribas, cautioned: “Sainsbury’s store standards remain impressive, but with costs already lean and further savings targeted, it remains uncertain whether management can continue to deliver savings and superior service, particularly as the competition ups its game.” \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) slid 5p to 178.3p, after HSBC revised down its target price from 295p to 275p, and Wm Morrison fell 4.5p to 161.6p as it was trading ex-dividend. \nA downgraded rating saw Coca-Cola Hellenic tumble 1.3pc to £13.79. UBS reduced the stock from “neutral” to “sell” as its believes margin recovery will be limited by the company’s regional sales mix and foreign exchange headwinds. \nFinally, Aim-listed African Potash (Stuttgart: 13956724.SG - news ) ended the trading session flat, at 2.8p, despite finalising its first fertiliser sale agreement in Zambia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:38:21.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
