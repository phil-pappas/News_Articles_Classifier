Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Uber has accused the Australian Taxation Office of misrepresenting before Parliament the US-based ride sharing company's co-operation over its tax arrangements.\nIn the latest of a series of exchanges with the tax office, Uber has written to a powerful Senate estimates committee to complain about how the company says it was portrayed by Commissioner of Taxation Chris Jordan at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\"We're quite concerned that he left the estimates committee with the impression that we were unco-operative, where documents from his own organisation shows we have been co-operative,\" said Brad Kitschke, Uber's director of public policy.\nIn an unusual attack on an individual company, Mr Jordan used testimony to the committee this week to accuse Uber of making public statements it knows to be false.\nHe also strongly hinted that Uber's offshore parent company may fall foul, among a group of about 80 companies, of new multinational anti-avoidance legislation.\nUber is at loggerheads with the ATO over its insistence that drivers using the fast-growing service are the same as taxi drivers and must therefore collect GST from the first dollar earned.\nIn a letter to Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer last week, Uber said most of its \"driver-partners\" work only a few hours a week and earn $30,000 a year, and should not be considered as running an enterprise.\n\"Requiring collection and remittance responsibilities for GST before the first dollar earned imposes an unreasonable burden that is not imposed on other individuals or small or micro businesses,\" Mr Kitschke said in the letter.\n \"It is unreasonable that someone who runs a market stall on the weekends and earns $60,000 per annum or someone who is an independent contractor who uses their vehicle for pizza or flower deliveries and earns $30,000 per annum is not required to register for GST but someone who does ride sharing for 5 hours and earns less than $150 a week has to register. The burden far outweighs the benefit and singles out these people unfairly.\"\nIn its letter to estimates committee chairman Sean Edwards, Uber insists that it has never claimed that the ATO didn't consult with it. \"What we have questioned is the prominence and access given to the Australian Taxi Industry Association in the ATO's development of tax guidance for an industry that the ATIA does not participate in and persistently lobbies against.\"\n\"The world knows that the economy is changing. Both government and opposition have said so . Now [this] should be seen as an opportunity for the government to work with Uber to establish sensible policies that help the new sharing economy to flourish.\"\nA spokesman for the ATO said Mr Jordan \"stands by the comments he made\" and will continue to co-operate with any further requests or questions from the Senate committee.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:52:26.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
