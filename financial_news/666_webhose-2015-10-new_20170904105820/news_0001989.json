Photo: Pete Marovich\nAn agreement between a dozen Asia-Pacific countries including Australia that harmonises trading rules and regulations and recognises the growing importance of trade in services including information technology is worth pursuing.\nHowever, US economist Joseph Stiglitz​ hit the nail on the head a few days before the signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership when he observed that the TPP was not a free trade agreement, but an agreement to co-ordinate the management of existing trade relationships.\nThe TPP is a political construct more than an economic one.\nPolitics has shaped the way it has been negotiated, will decide whether or not it is implemented in its intended form, and will determine its long-term significance for Australia, the region, and the world.\nAdvertisement It has been negotiated behind closed doors by a dozen Pacific Rim countries including the United States, Japan and Australia.\nAlthough the Pacific Rim's most important emerging economy, China, has not been included, the agreement is much more ambitious than the bilateral trade deals negotiated by countries including Australia after the collapse of the Doha round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) between 159 countries.\nHowever, lIke the bilateral trade deals, the TPP also recognises that it has become politically impossible to negotiate trade deals in the open. Even with negotiations undertaken in confidence, a heads of agreement between 12 countries has been difficult to deliver.\nNow, political pressure that has been suppressed by the confidential negotiating process will emerge.\nThe 12 signatories will reveal the details of the agreement as they move to implement it. Some of the countries, including the US and Australia, will be moving deep into their election cycles as they do so, and the agreement is loaded to the gunnels with compromises and side deals that will fuel lobbying and infighting.\nAgricultural market access for exporters has been improved, but barriers remain in big markets, including Japan and the US. Those affected by cuts in tariffs and other protection will complain that their domestic markets are being eroded and jobs destroyed. Exporters – agricultural exporters in particular – will argue that markets in other TPP countries have not been opened up enough.\nAt least until the details are seen, questions about the agreement's impact on national sovereignty in areas including taxation and the environment will also be alive.\nThe risk that tobacco companies will use the TPP's investor-state dispute resolution mechanism to challenge domestic anti-smoking regulations appears to have been avoided by an agreement that \"tobacco control measures\" can override the dispute resolution process.\nThe general description of the TPP agreement also states that countries will be able to make rules that, among other things, protect human, animal or plant life or health and intellectual property, and conserve \"exhaustible natural resources\".\nHowever, legal challenges to changes in domestic regulations and rules are inevitable if the TPP – and the dispute resolution process it contains – becomes law.\nUS pharmaceutical companies and their political supporters who have been backing a US demand for 12 years of data protection for cutting-edge \"biologic\" medicines will fight the TPP agreement that data exclusivity be set at between five and eight years, something Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb has fought for. If Australia has given ground elsewhere to win that concession, that, too, will be revealed.\nThe US has been portrayed in Australia as a country likely to benefit from the implementation of the TPP. While it is a key part of US President Barack Obama's foreign relations \"pivot\" towards Asia, the TPP is not guaranteed safe passage through Congress.\nNegotiations went longer than expected after breaking down in July, pushing the implementation timetable deeper into an accelerating US election cycle, and making presidential hopefuls more susceptible to lobbying that would ramp up as the package's measures were revealed.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's support for the TPP appears, for example, to be softening as her anti-TPP opponent, Bernie Sanders, polls strongly.\nLeading Republican senator Orrin Hatch has declared that the agreement falls \"woefully short\" of what the US needs to embrace it, and wildcat Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has declared that if elected, he will scrap the TPP.\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico will be grist for the US debate. Trade and investment flows between the three countries soared after NAFTA came into force in 1994.\nHowever, the US has swung from a small trade surplus with Mexico to a deficit of more than $US50 billion a year, and US unions claim that US job losses outweigh NAFTA-related employment gains.\nIf the TPP does get up, it will probably be the world's trade regime template. It is the first big multilateral agreement to recognise the growing importance of the services sector and the borderless nature of information technology. Services exports to Asia are a key potential gain for Australia if the TPP regime is created.\nChina is excluded at present. However, it would probably join the TPP in time, vaulting the economic significance of the agreement.\nMeanwhile, the US and the European Union are negotiating a similar alliance that could dovetail with the TPP to create something that approximates a new global GATT.\nHowever, that is all some way off. Given that the political complexities have only just begun, I would not give the TPP agreement better than a 50-50 chance of getting up in its current form.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:21:01.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
