You might wonder why a globally recognized, decades-old programmer would want to downplay its brand when trying to reach young people accustomed to consuming content on social media and especially on mobile devices. \nHowever, a look at data from the analytics firm Tubular Labs shows that the list of media companies seeing early success publishing directly to Facebook is dominated by ‘digital natives’ rather than traditional media companies. \nFor example, BuzzFeed held four of the top five spots of Tubular’s ranking of Facebook creators in September (Tubular publishes a separate ranking of Facebook video accounts that simply aggregate videos). The top video creator on Facebook last month was the broader BuzzFeed Video page, while two food-related pages--BuzzFeed Food and Tasty--held spots two and three. \n“Buzzfeed has seen amazing Facebook view growth this year,” said Tubular co-founder Allison Stern, who noted that BuzzFeed collectively generated over 2 billion views on Facebook in September, a new high for the publisher. \nOther top Facebook video publishers include Tastemade--a food-focused Web-born brand--and NowThis, a news brand that publishes primarily on social platforms. \nAlso showing a strong recent surge in growth on Facebook is Tech Insider, the new consumer tech focused sibling of Business Insider that went live in June . Tech Insider ranked 9th on Tubular’s Facebook creator rankings last month, while Business Insider landed at 17--the first time either brand appeared on the relatively new ranking. \n“They came out of nowhere in September,” said Ms. Stern. Perhaps those Axel Springer SPR 0.32 % folks know what they are doing. Though keep in mind that publishers have only been regularly posting video content on Facebook for maybe the past year, and Tubular has only been tracking such data since May. \nAccording to Justin Maiman, executive editor, video for Business Insider, the two sites’ September growth wasn’t the result on a sudden increase in output on Facebook or a single viral clip, but rather a culmination of the company’s devotion to video. \nWhen he joined the company about two years ago, Business Insider had roughly five people on its video team. That number has swelled to 45. \nThat team is focus is on producing short clips that run between under a minute to two minutes, he said. A few years ago BI was producing about five such clips a week. Now it churns out 25 to 30 a day between its various brands, Mr. Maiman said. \n“It’s been a matter of getting our visitors used to video,” he said. “Early on it was a shock to a lot of people [that we were producing so much] and we just kept hitting them over the head with a lot of great video.” \nOne key decision they made early on he said, we to avoid trying to do TV business news on the Web. \nInstead, they chose to focus on business stories with wide interest that grab people quickly and are likely to be shared, he said-- such as a recent clip on Vetigel , a plant-based product designed to immediately stop wounds from bleeding that was invented by a 17-year-old. That video has over 64 million views on Facebook to date. \n“There is no special sauce,” said Mr. Maiman. “It’s just storytelling.” ENLARGE Tubular Labs data on Facebook video in September Photo: screenshot \nThat should be encouraging to CNN, which has built Great Big Story around positive storytelling and videos that ideally incite sharing. And it probably makes sense that the new brand’s priority is publishing on other platforms rather than building an audience on its own property, since that requires a strategy that’s not always easy for traditional media companies to master. \nTo its credit, CNN did land at number 21 on Tubular’s September Facebook ranking--among the best showings for traditional media brands. \nThe biggest success so far from old school media companies? Clips from NBC’s “The Tonight Show,” which have consistently generated massive numbers on YouTube. The show landed in seventh place with over 200 million Facebook views in September. \nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com Save Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:09:55.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
