Then it will be 2016. So don't dally, here are the money related tasks that you need to get started on now:1. Set a budget for holiday gifts and then stick to it. It doesn't matter how small or large an amount you decide to allocate, just don't spend more than you can afford. If you are a little strapped this year, then maybe make something instead, like a painting. The truth is, your true friends really love you for your company not what physical things you give them.2. Plan how much money you want to give to charity this year. Then send the money. I normally recommend making such payments at the beginning of the year, but we all forget sometimes. If you did, then do it now and then keep a record for tax purposes. It might help reduce what you owe the Internal Revenue Service.3. Decide which stocks that you own are candidates for tax-loss selling . Depending on your tax situation, you maybe able to offset some capital losses against capital gains. You don't have to make the sale until year end, but at least have a list of candidates to put on the chopping block. In any event, you may wish to consult a tax specialist.4. If you haven't done so in a while then rebalance your portfolio . Do you have too much of an allocation in stocks and not enough in bonds? Everyone has a different tolerance for risk. But having the right allocation can not only provide you with less volatile returns, but might let you sleep better at night. People over 40-years-old should probably have around 30% of their investment portfolio in bonds, at least as a starting position. You may wish to consult a financial planner to assist you in deciding what is right for you.5. Check to see if your retirement contributions are on target for 2015 . You might find that you can increase your contributions for the rest of year. For 2015 you can stash away up to $18,000 to a 401k retirement plan, if you are over 50 you can contribute even more. Doing so will reduce your tax bill and help secure a better retirement nest egg.6. Make sure you have had enough tax dollars withheld from your paycheck . If you think you might fall short, don't worry there's an easy way to catch up. If you change the withholding immediately there are enough pay periods between now and year end to make a dent in the difference between what you'll owe and what's already been sent to the government.7. Enroll for healthcare and other benefits for 2016 . If you get employer healthcare then that should be easy, just don't forget. If you don't have that alternative, you still need to signup for insurance and there are potentially hefty government fines for not doing so.8. If you haven't had your annual medical checkup schedule it now . An annual visit to the doctor isn't a high priority for many people, but it should be. Not only can you catch potential problems early, but you may also save money. That's because sometimes easily fixed minor afflictions can morph into worse things if not dealt with straight away. While you are at it, remember to get your cat or dog their yearly rabies shot.9. Up date your resume . It has long been traditional for companies to layoff staff before Thanksgiving -- it's a way of avoiding doing so around Christmas and other holidays. If you think you could be on the chopping block then an up-to-date resume is a must. Also, gather together all you business contacts and keep a copy. Also, check out my layoff survival guide from earlier this year.10. Get your winter clothes out of storage . Here in New York the weather is still beautiful and the need for heavy wool coats seems far away. But it will be chilly before you know it. If you leave your things in storage then you may be tempted to buy something new at the first cold snap. If you already have warm outwear then buying extra items could be a needless expense.
