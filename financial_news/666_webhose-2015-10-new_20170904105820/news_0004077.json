In all cases of resignations, the relevant provisions of notice period are applicable,” the spokesperson said.\nJet Airways employs sufficient number of type-rated crew to ensure optimal use of its fleet, he added. A type rating is a regulating agency’s certification of an airplane pilot to fly a certain aircraft type that requires additional training beyond the scope of the initial license and aircraft class training.\nSources said the “flexible” service contracts offered by IndiGo is one of the reasons apart from the higher pay packets for the pilots quitting Jet Airways.\nIndiGo offers seven different types of job contracts to its employees, providing greater flexibility, as against a single conventional contract by most of the domestic airliners, sources said.\nConfirming the resignation by 32 of its pilots in the last one year, a senior Air India official said this has not affected the airline’s operations in any way.\n“Of course, 32 pilots have quit the airline in the last one year to join other carriers, including IndiGo and some Gulf airlines, but this has not impacted Air India operations. Requirement-based hiring of pilots is an on-going process,” the official said.\nSignificantly, several domestic airlines in the past have voiced their concern on the poaching of skilled workforce, particularly of pilots, engineers and cabin crew by the competitors.\nAcknowledging that the industry was facing the problem of poaching, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Mahesh Sharma had in March this year indicated putting in place some mechanism to check it.\nThe poaching of staff “results in crippling shortage of trained manpower for airlines…We can ask the DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) to frame guidelines to address this matter,” Sharma had said.\n 11, 2015 1:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:17:45.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
