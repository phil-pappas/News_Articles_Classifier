Royalty is not Suzuki’s indelible right – it must explain its coercive charges on Maruti’s cash flows, says IiAS     The royalty payouts by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (Maruti) to its parent Japanese Suzuki Motor Corp (Suzuki) are 'extortive' says Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Ltd (IiAS). \"Royalty is not Suzuki’s indelible right and it must explain its coercive charges on Maruti’s cash flows. In addition, Maruti shareholders must ask the fundamental question as to what is the right amount of royalty that must be charged?\" the proxy advisory firm said.   IiAS says it examined Maruti’s royalty payouts in the context of revenues, margins, and research and development (R&D) spends, and concluded that Maruti’s royalty payouts are extortive. “Suzuki needs to explain the basis of charging Maruti very high rates of royalty. Royalty payments aggregated 5.7% of net sales and 36% of profits before royalty in 2014-15. Over the past 15 years, royalty paid to Suzuki, has grown 6.6x to Rs21,415 per car sold, while average sales realization per car has increased only 1.6x. While Suzuki’s consolidated R&D spend per vehicle (including motorcycles) averaged 4% of sales, its royalty payments from Maruti are 6% of net sales,” it said.   Most multi-nationals charge their Indian companies royalty. This royalty is typically charged for either the brand and / or product technology. The basis for this charge is that the global brands have been developed outside India, as is the product research and technology. There is some merit to this argument, says IiAS, but the question is how much should be claimed?   Maruti has been paying royalty to Suzuki for its car manufacturing technology since inception. Over the past five years (2010-11 to 2014-15), Maruti’s aggregate payout towards royalty was Rs11,870 crore while its five-year profit before tax (PBT) aggregated Rs16,770 crore. In 2014-15 alone, royalty expenses aggregated 36% of profit before tax and royalty. IiAS says, Maruti cars are for the most Suzuki’s products that emanate from the research and development undertaken in Japan. Yet, Maruti has been a stronger brand in India than Suzuki. To the extent that Maruti uses Suzuki’s technology, it must pay royalty. But how much is enough?\n\nIiAS says, Maruti cars are for the most Suzuki’s products that emanate from the research and development undertaken in Japan. Yet, Maruti has been a stronger brand in India than Suzuki. To the extent that Maruti uses Suzuki’s technology, it must pay royalty. But how much is enough? Maruti’s EBITDA margins (after royalty payouts) at over 12% are almost twice that of Suzuki’s sub-7% margins for the automobile segment. Maruti’s margins emanate from its own local efforts of cost control, value engineering, and indigenisation. Over the past 15 years, royalty payouts from Maruti have grown from 2% to almost 6% of net sales. However, IiAS says, Suzuki’s investments in R&D have not stepped up accordingly. In 2014-15, Suzuki’s expenditure in R&D aggregated only about 4% of net sales, it added.\n\nMaruti’s own efforts hold the key   Over the past three years, Maruti has invested an average of over Rs3,000 per car (produced) in R&D efforts, including capital expenditure aggregating Rs1,014 crore and another Rs814 crore in revenue expenditure.    Maruti’s R&D efforts have supported the launch of the new models and variants, new feature developments and fuel efficiency improvement efforts in the recent past.  The Rohtak R&D facility (Suzuki Group’s first R&D centre outside Japan) is expected to be fully functional by the end of the current fiscal. Among other facilities, the Rohtak R&D facility is expected to aid in testing and validating products to meet new regulations regarding safety and environment.    IiAS says, \"If the incremental investment in R&D facilities is largely being made in India through Maruti, should shareholders expect a reduction in royalty payouts per car going forward?\"   \"Maruti shareholders must ask the fundamental question. What is the right amount of royalty that must be charged? Royalty is not Suzuki’s indelible right – it must explain its coercive charges on Maruti’s cash flows,\" the proxy advisory firm added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:57:07.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
