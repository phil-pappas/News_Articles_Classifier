A spokesperson for Principal said the Liongate board would be \"taking steps to return assets to investors.\" \nMore from FT.com: Is hedge fund pain your gain? â€º \nIt is the second big fund to shut this week, after Fortress Investment Group announced it would be closing its flagship macro fund on Tuesday. Many hedge funds have been affected by market volatility in recent months, and the industry is on track to post one of its worst years since 2011. \nLiongate managed $2.1 billion worth of assets when Principal bought it in 2013, but Principal said in a statement that a loss of clients and reduction in assets under management had \"placed the business under significant pressure\" in the past two years. \nLiongate was founded by Randall Dillard and Jeff Holland in 2003. Principal wrote down its $44 million investment in Liongate in 2014, and the group's co-founders both left the fund this year. \nPrincipal gave no comment on the value of Liongate's assets, but the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that they had fallen to less than $500 million this year.
