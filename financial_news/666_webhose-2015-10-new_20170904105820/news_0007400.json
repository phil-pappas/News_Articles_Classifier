Teague said the pictures are unprocessed, taken from original NASA photo scans, with some of them comparable to the washed-out images you might come across while flipping through an old family photo album.\nSee also: How Matt Damon could rocket NASA to Mars in real life\nFlickr/Project Apollo Archive Slide 2 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 3 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 4 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 5 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 6 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 7 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 8 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 9 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 10 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 11 of 13\nNASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 12 of 13 NASA/Project Apollo Archive Slide 13 of 13 Prev Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.apolloarchive.com/apollo_archive.html", "http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/2015/20151002-apollo-astronaut-photos-flickr.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:52:25.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
