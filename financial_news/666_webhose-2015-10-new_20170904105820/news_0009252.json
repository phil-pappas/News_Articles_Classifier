Ghana’s economy relies heavily on climate sensitive sectors mainly on agriculture, energy and forestry. With less than one percent of cultivated land under irrigation, farmers are vulnerable to unfavourable climatic conditions.\n“Total rainfall amounts are projected to fall or experience great variability which will impact crop production and the livelihoods of many in rural areas,” as stated in the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. \nStrategies under agriculture include goals to “build and strengthen capacity of local farmers to increase agricultural productivity and awareness of climate issues” and to “build and strengthen capacity of extension officers in new farming technologies in order to enhance their support for farmers”. \nGhana’s actions for climate mitigation and adaptation are contained in the country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) submitted to the United Nation’s climate change negotiation process. \nSustainable land use, including food security, is among the seven priority economic sectors being proposed for implementation in the 10-year period (2020-2030). \nThe INDC Adaptation Policy Actions focus on “Agriculture resilience building in climate vulnerable landscapes” to be implemented along the lines of the country’s Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy, Ghana’s Medium-term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan and the Ghana Agriculture Investment Programme. \nA total investment of $3.18billion is needed to implement agriculture-related programmes of action – representing about 14% of the total $22.6billion climate implementation investment. \nThe three areas of investments include: scale up penetration of climate smart technologies to increase livestock and fisheries productivity by 10%; promote innovations in post-harvest storage and food processing and forest products in 43 administrative districts; and modify community-based conservation agriculture adopted in 43 administrative districts. \nFor the local farmer, the December 2015 Climate Talks in Paris should produce valuable outcomes to deliver interventions under national and international policies. \nSuch interventions must come in fast and flexible to enable farmers quickly adapt to the changing climate to protect their livelihoods and sustain economic development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:53:51.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
