The survey was conducted in August. \nThe survey also found that only 23 percent of expatriates believe banks at home are better than those in the UAE. \n\"As the organisation which advocates best practice for banks in the UAE, the Federation has a duty to gauge whether the efforts that banks make to meet their customers' needs are effective and being felt by their customers,\" said AbdulAziz Al Ghurair, chairman of the UAE Banks Federation. \n\"More importantly, we want to know where the banks need to up their game, from the point of view of their customers. This project forms the beginning of a process whereby we will be able to better understand whether we are improving our service performance or not, and how we can pinpoint the actions that need to be taken. \n\"While we are delighted to see that these results bear out our own expectations, we accept that there is still room for improvement, not least in terms of giving customers what they really want, and in delivering it in a way that provides them with the best value.\" he added. \nAccording to the survey, most of UAE banking customers questioned have confidence in banks to behave responsibly (74 percent) and trust banks to do what is right (70 percent). \nCustomers placed good customer service, loans and safety and security significantly ahead of excessive interest rates, high profits and poor customer service. \nThe survey said the majority of UAE customers feel that banks are dealing well with a variety of issues facing the sector, especially keeping up with digital innovations (78 percent), responding to new regulations (71 percent) and preventing cybercrime (71 percent). \nAn International trust barometer carried out by an independent agency, Edelman, showed that the UAE comes fourth with a rating of 81 percent, after Indonesia, China and India. \nThis barometer has an average median of 53 percent, with countries such as the US (51 percent), UK (32 percent) and Australia (51 percent) failing to meet the average ranking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:56:28.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
