Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) shot higher as copper prices added 1% either side of the Atlantic. \nPremier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) , Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) and Petrofac (Amsterdam: PF6.AS - news ) were all high risers as oil prices advanced, with West Texas Intermediate up 1.8% at $46.38 a barrel and Brent crude up 2.1% at $49.15 a barrel. \nAllied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) posted healthy gains after saying its subsidiary, Precision Biopsy, has raised $33.6m to accelerate the commercial expansion of its ClariCore biopsy system. Allied Minds contributed around $16.6m to Precision Biopsy, upping the value of its 68.3% holding in the subsidiary to $61.8m from $45.6m. ClariCore Biopsy System is a device platform designed to provide accurate, real-time classification of prostate tissue during biopsy procedures. \nPlaytech (LSE: PTEC.L - news ) was the standout loser after the company said it has received a letter from the Central Bank of Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) opposing the proposed takeover of Ava Trade. The company said it was seeking clarification and will engage with the bank on the issues raised. Playtech, which has already received approval from the Financial Services Commission in the British Virgin Islands, said it believes it can address the issues to the central bank's satisfaction. \nNostrum Oil & Gas (Stuttgart: 3NO.SG - news ) was also on the back foot after Kazakhstan-focused Tethys Petroleum confirmed that Olisol Investment Group has submitted a non-binding proposal to the oil and gas group, which is currently in takeover talks with Nostrum. Tethys said it is currently in a period of exclusivity with Nostrum and continues to negotiate the terms of a proposed offer and interim funding. \nRisers Kaz Minerals (KAZ) 102.60p +11.83% Premier Oil (PMO) 77.80p +10.51% AL Noor Hospitals Group (ANH) 934.00p +9.37% Allied Minds (ALM) 388.80p +7.08% Petra Diamonds Ltd (LSE: PDL.L - news ) .(DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (PDL) 92.45p +6.69% Tullow Oil (TLW) 204.80p +6.22% Aggreko (EUREX: AGKF.EX - news ) (AGK) 1,017.00p +5.55% Petrofac Ltd.
