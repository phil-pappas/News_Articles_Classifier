Rather it reflects the discount at which the shares were sold to institutions in the overnight placing. \nThe government said it raised £591.1m from selling its stake in Royal Mail at 455p a share, a discount of 3.6pc to the previous day’s close of 472.2p. \nThe final exit of the Government from the shareholder register should be welcomed. There is now greater liquidity in the trading of the shares and the sale removes the overhang of a known seller looking to exit its stake. Say what you will about the efficiency of markets, but Royal Mail’s share price now reflects the true market price. \n= Reasons to believe = \nThe 500-year-old postal service is facing some big challenges, but it has the dominant market position and balance sheet strength to survive. \nLetter volumes are in long term decline and last year fell 4pc during to about 13bn. Moya Greene, chief executive, expects letter volumes to decline by between 4pc and 6pc for the foreseeable future. \nRoyal Mail is coping with falling letter volumes by increasing stamp prices. At the end of March the price of a first class stamp increased from 62p to 63p, while second class is rising from 53p to 54p. The price of stamps has more than doubled during the past 10 years, so the 4pc decline in letter volumes only translated into a 1pc fall in letter revenue last year. \nThe company is also cutting costs as it adjusts to life in the private sector. Chief executive Moya Greene said that staff numbers were reduced by 5,500 last year, and she expects another 2,000 to 3,000 to go in the financial year to March, saving about £80m a year. \nThe parcel delivery business was the great source of hope for Royal Mail when it floated in October 2013. The rise and rise of shopping online was expected to drive profits at the postie. However, fierce competition is weighing on the prices that Royal Mail can charge, and the growth in profits has fallen short of initial expectations. \nRoyal Mail also operates a smaller courier service in Europe called General Logistic Systems (GLS). GLS is a steady performer with revenue and profits rising last year. However, changes to minimum wage legislation in Germany will see profit margins fall this year. \nThe wild swing in Royal Mail’s reported results, which resulted in pre-tax profits moving from £1.66bn, to £400m last year, was due to a £1.35bn one-off pension benefit skewing the performance in the underlying business. \n= Property nest egg = \nUnderneath those profit figures the company is generating cash, and free cash flow increased from £398m to £453m last year, with a little help from the £100m disposal of part of its property portfolio at Paddington in central London. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) still owns eight acres of prime property in the capital at Mount Pleasant near King’s Cross and 14 acres at Nine Elms, opposite the new Battersea power station development. Analysts from Berenberg estimate the property portfolio alone could be worth up to £1bn, or about £1 per share. \n= Strong balance sheet = \nThe strong cash generation means net debts fell to £275m at March, from £555m a year earlier, and those debts are held against net assets of £3.84bn, or about 384p per share. \nThe cash generation and adjusted earnings also cover the £200m, or 21p, dividend payments more than twice. \nThe dividend is forecast to increase 3.5pc this year to 21.7p, and that means the shares offer a prospective yield of 4.6pc. \n= Performance in a downturn = \nRoyal Mail shares have also performed admirably during the sharp market correction in August of this year. In the year to date the shares have gained 5pc, while the FTSE 100 is down 3pc. Royal Mail is not as exposed to the worst of a commodity slowdown like the rest of the FTSE, and as such is a good source of diversification for any portfolio. \n= Regulatory rumbles = \nIt is not all plain sailing for Royal Mail, however. The postal service is under investigation by the regulator Ofcom over claims it used its dominant market position to unfairly price out competitors. Royal Mail believes it acted fully within the agreed system. But a fundamental review of the pricing freedoms which were granted to Royal Mail three years ago is now taking place. Ofcom is expected to complete the review and put into place a new system during 2016. \nRoyal Mail position in UK parcels (based on revenue). Source: Royal Mail prospectus \n= Value delivers = \nMarket consensus is for pre-tax profits to fall 14pc to £431m in the year to March 2016, giving 33p in earnings per share. That leaves the shares trading on 14 times the forecast earnings, and that still looks good value given the income on offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:24:28.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
