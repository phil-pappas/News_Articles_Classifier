Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, fell 5.7 percent in August versus the median estimate for a 3.2 percent increase, and followed a 3.6 percent decline in the previous month. The decline in machinery orders suggests capital expenditure is not as strong as indicated in the Bank of Japan's tankan survey and could undermine Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's argument that consumer prices remain on track to accelerate. \"Machinery orders suggest that capital expenditure plans in the tankan could be revised down,\" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. \"Our house view is the BOJ will ease policy in January, but the chances have risen that the BOJ will move later this month. There will also be talk about a new fiscal stimulus package.\" Machinery orders fell 3.2 percent in August from July led by down by electronics, steel and car manufacturers, Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday. Orders from non-manufacturers' fell 6.1 percent, due to declines in orders from financial services and shipping, the data showed. The Cabinet Office lowered its assessment of machinery orders to say they are stalling. Last month the Cabinet Office said there were still signs orders were recovering. Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, fell 3.5 percent in August, versus a 4.2 percent annual gain expected by economists. The government has made encouraging capital expenditure a top priority as it tries to breathe new life into its economic agenda. The government plans to hold meetings with the private sector to come up with policies that officials can use to convince companies to invest more of their cash reserves. The Bank of Japan held off on expanding stimulus on Wednesday, even as slumping exports and falling oil prices threaten its rosy projection that the economy is on track to hit the bank's ambitious 2 percent inflation target next year. But lingering fears of recession mean economists still expect the central bank to ease policy at a more crucial meeting on Oct. 30, when it is expected to cut its long-term economic and price growth forecasts.
