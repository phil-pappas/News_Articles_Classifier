Who wouldn't? With the average age of retirement currently up to 62 according to Gallup and younger Americans expecting to retire before 55, there's both the reality of an increased number of working years and also the optimistic expectation for a shorter working life. But an early retirement is no accident; in fact, many people expect to work until they drop . To retire at all, and to do so early, takes years of careful planning and sacrifice to accomplish. Even with careful planning and sacrifice, the cards might be stacked against you. So how can you make it happen for you? \nThere's No Substitute for Early, Aggressive Savings \nMarcy Keckler, vice president of financial advice strategy for Ameriprise, says that to retire in your 40s you need to take advantage of compounding, which means that you have to start saving early and saving aggressively. Most people know that compound interest can kill them when it comes to credit card debt. What they don't know is that compound yielding is what makes all the difference when it comes to retirement savings. Put simply, your money will start making money and that money will make money and so on. \"You need to be really committed and dedicated to that,\" she says.
