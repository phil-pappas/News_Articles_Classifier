Benton Receives Drill Permit for Staghorn Gold Project Press Release : Benton Resources Inc. â€“ 18 minutes ago 0.000 Related Content THUNDER BAY, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Oct. 15, 2015) - Benton Resources Inc. (TSX VENTURE:BEX) (\"Benton\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce that the Company has received its permit for drilling on the Staghorn gold property (under option from Metals Creek Resources Corp., see Benton press release dated November 18, 2014). Benton is planning a 1000m to 1500m diamond drilling program to test multiple gold showings, soil geochemical and geophysical anomalies identified by the Company during this summer's exploration program. One of the priority drill targets will be the high grade Ryan's Hammer trend, where selective grab samples from numerous large angular mineralized boulders and outcrop have returned significant assay results ranging from trace up to 31 grams per tonne (gpt) gold. Drilling will also test the Rich House zone where selective grab samples returned assays ranging from trace up to 189.2 gpt gold. Drilling is expected to commence within the next few days and results will be released once they are received and compiled by the Company. \nThe Cape Ray/Victoria Lake regional fault zone hosts a number of gold deposits, including Marathon Gold's Valentine Lake deposit, located 30km to the northeast of the Staghorn project, and Benton's Cape Ray gold deposits located approximately 100km to the southwest. \nAll assays were completed by Eastern Analytical of Springdale, NL using pulp metallic and fire assay. \nAbout Benton Resources Inc.
