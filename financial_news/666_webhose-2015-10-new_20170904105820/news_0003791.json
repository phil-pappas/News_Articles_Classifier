But a 17 percent surge in multi-family housing - which includes apartments - accounts for almost all of that increase.\nNew construction and sales of existing homes surged in the first half of the year as more Americans found work. But rising prices and the absence of meaningful wage growth have capped growth as affordability became an issue.\nApproved permits fell 5 percent in September to an annual rate of 1.1 million, a sign of construction slowing in the coming months.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:50:07.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
