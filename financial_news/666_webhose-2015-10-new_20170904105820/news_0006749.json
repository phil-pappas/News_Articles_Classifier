The layoff will affect 400 to 500 workers, many of whom are eligible for transfer to other GM plants. The reduction in workforce is a disappointment to the United Auto Workers union, which is trying to expand its membership. \nThe UAW said on Thursday it is starting talks with GM on a new four-year labor contract, following ratification of a pact Thursday by hourly workers at Fiat Chrysler .\n\nDuring the government-sponsored reorganization of GM and Chrysler following their 2009 bankruptcies, the Obama administration signaled its strong support for the manufacture of small, fuel-efficient cars in the U.S.  rather than importing them from Mexico or farther away , a strategy that had been more attractive for automakers from a cost and profitability standpoint. \nPresident Obama visited GM Orion Township with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak in 2011 to highlight small-car production at the plant. \nIn January, GM said it will begin building a new small battery-powered car, the Chevrolet Bolt, at the Orion Township plant. \nChevrolet Sonic, Chevrolet Spark and Buick Verano higher-mileage small cars built at Orion Township were GM's answer to small imports like the Honda Fit, Toyota Corolla and Nissan Versa. But the entire segment has been struggling, especially in light of the collapse of oil prices that has driven the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline to $2.26 a gallon, down from $2.80 a gallon in June and nearly $4 a gallon in 2012. \nConsumer preference notwithstanding, regulators worldwide are tightening fuel-efficiency standards. Though U.S. auto industry sales have risen 5% through September and are on track for one of the industry's best years ever, demand for small cars as well as electrics and gas-electric hybrids is tepid. According to Kelley Blue Book, the subcompact car segment declined 1.4% through September, electrics were off 18.1% and gas-electric hybrids dropped 15.9% from a year earlier. \nMeantime, higher-profit Chevrolet and GMC large pickups and SUVs have been selling strongly. GM shares this week rose 7.3%, compared to a Dow Jones Industrial Average that was up 2.2%, on the strength of a third-quarter financial statement that reported a record quarterly $3.3 billion operating profit in North America . GM's net income for the quarter fell slightly due to the cost of recalls.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDoron Levin is the host of \"In the Driver Seat\" on SiriusXM Insight 121, broadcast on Saturday at noon, encore Sunday at 9 a.m.\n\nThe writer has no financial  interest in the aforementioned companies. \nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:08:39.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
