This policy setting was complemented for years with quantitative easing (QE), Fed bond-buying designed to anchor long-term interest rates - which are important for housing finance - and encourage riskier business and consumer investment.\nSpeculation has been rife about the timing of the Fed's next monetary tightening cycle since the end of the latest QE program in October last year.\nMr Lee, who was a Fed economist in the 1980s, last year was almost alone in predicting that the central bank would wait until late this year for \"lift-off\", as it is known. However, he said it missed its chance in September to begin policy \"normalisation\" and might not get another opportunity until March next year, which is his latest prediction.\nGlobal market upheaval, driven partly by concerns about Chinese growth, but also by investor positioning around the Fed's next move, appeared to weigh heavily on the central bank's Open Market Committee decision to hold rates again, when its normal focus is jobs and inflation.\nMr Lee said surges of volatility would continue to rattle financial markets – whose assets had been inflated by leveraged investors financed by QE in the US and elsewhere – until the Fed began its long-awaited tightening cycle.\nOver-reactive market \"If the markets were at an equilibrium, there wouldn't be this kind of disruptiveness,\" he said on the sidelines of Citi's annual Australia and New Zealand Investment Conference in Sydney.\n\"And the markets would be in equilibrium if rates were in equilibrium.\n\"So, as long as they're at zero, the tendency of markets to be over-reactive is going to be much greater now than if rates were at their equilibrium level.\n\"If rates are distorted, the reactions to any event will also be amplified and exaggerated, because so much leverage is out there,\" he said.\nHe said this was not just \"observable\" debt, but the less obvious type used in \"derivatives and other leveraged instruments being used to get that extra yield\".\nEconomists have for years been warning of the dangers of pumping up equity, housing and bond prices through ultra-accommodative monetary policy designed principally to get companies investing and consumers spending.\nTheir main concern is that once credit conditions begin to tighten in the US, the exodus into long-dated government bonds and other low-risk assets will drain potential buyers of high-yielding assets from the markets, leading to a liquidity crisis.\nRisk spiral The post-GFC reduction in market-making activities by investment banks because of more onerous capital requirements has added to the potential for critical mismatches between buyers and sellers.\nThe resulting price collapse could leave investors – including pension funds and insurers with long-term liabilities – with huge losses.\nMr Lee agreed that risks have built up across a range of asset markets, making the Fed's initial move all the more important. He said, in any case, the US central bank will move slowly, meaning real interest rates – accounting for inflation – will be below or just above zero for at least two years after the first increase.\nThe US economy had recovered sufficiently for the Fed to make that first rate hike last month, he said. \"Everyone agrees that zero interest rates are completely inappropriate for an economy that is growing at 2 or 3 per cent, and we are in the state now,\" he said.\n\"Within that range you should not have interest rates at zero. Why? Because asset price are distorted; and because asset prices are distorted, asset-allocations are distorted.\n\"People who had mandates for investment-grade [investments] are shifting into high-yield, because they can get more yield,\" he said.\n\"People whose mandates are high-yield are shifting into emerging markets. Those with mandates in emerging markets are shifting into real estate.\n\"They're all taking on more and more risk and getting higher and higher returns because they can finance at zero interest rates,\" he warned.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/debt-markets/janet-yellen-and-central-bankers-frustrated-in-bid-to-spur-new-growth-20151021-gkf9ll"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:05:19.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
