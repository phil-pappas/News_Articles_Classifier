Suplied. by Tony Davis Depending on how you count them, there are now at least 25 variations on the current series 911.\nThe GTS – as tested here – is the newest, and also the most powerful, Carrera model ever, generating a formidable 316 kilowatts and 440 newton-metres from its 3.8-litre horizontally opposed six. Among naturally aspirated 911s, only the track-focused GT3 models make more.\nWe once used the term \"normally aspirated\" for cars such as this. With turbos now so common, it is forced induction that is quickly becoming the norm – even among iconic sports car brands.\nWhich brings us to the big news in the Porsche world: the 911 is about to join the club, even with the base model. The capacity of the six-cylinder boxer engine will be reduced to 3 litres to go along with the turbocharging. This mildly facelifted model – known as the 991 Series 2 911 (how could there be any confusion?) – is going on sale in Europe shortly and will arrive in Oz in March.\nAll you need When a turbo Porsche is the norm, today's GTS might hold a special place among collectors. Until then, it is something of a conundrum. It was created as a slightly austere sports model, built around a marketing line \"all you need\".\nUnfortunately, supplying only \"all you need\" doesn't sit well with Australian buyers. Fair enough too, as they are paying so much more than those in Europe and the US. Therefore, the Australian model has a much higher level of standard equipment, making it more comfortable and in some ways more enjoyable, but confusing the message a little.\nWhile the marketing might emphasise the joys of an old school DIY seven-speed manual gearbox, 95 per cent of Porsche buyers go for the PDK, and GTS buyers will likely stick to that script.\n Parts bin special Coupe and cabriolet versions of the GTS are available in rear-drive and all-wheel-drive. Our Cabriolet was fitted with the PDK and, but for a few electronic driving aids more often found on luxury cars, there wasn't much to want for. That's not to say, there wasn't much to pay for. The PDK is $7400 more, and our car was also fitted with about $16,000 worth of interior enhancements. There was an Alcantara pack and \"exclusive GTS interior design package\".\nThe exterior was in Carmine Red, a new Porsche hue being introduced with this model. That costs an extra $6000.\nSo what exactly is the GTS, other than expensive (over $300k as tested here)? Crudely speaking, it's a parts bin special, but what parts! There is the wider, more aggressive-looking body from the all-wheel-drive model, a souped up version of the Carrera S engine and plenty of performance kit, such as adaptive suspension and the Sport Chrono package, which includes various tweaks and launch control (plus a chrono of course, sitting high up on the centre of the dash). The 20-inch centre-lock wheels are borrowed from the 911 Turbo S, and finished in black.\nAmong the purposeful touches are a thick steering wheel with no controls on it and large gear paddles directly behind. Being a Porsche, the GTS has a large variety of settings that can be tailored to taste and conditions – and even in the most sedate of these settings it delivers for a wonderfully swift and tactile driving experience.\nBeautifully weighted and precise The electrically assisted steering is beautifully weighted and precise. The car will track precisely through corners at astonishingly high speed, but you can hang the tail out should that be your bent.\nIf no closed road is available, there is a loud button on the centre console that opens up the sports exhaust irrespective of the other settings. If you can't be going quickly, you can at least sound as if you are.\nMuch of the interior is fairly standard Porsche 911 – albeit an amalgam of models. The high centre tunnel makes it feel like something it is not: a front-engined car. Still, it liberates a lot of useful space for engineers to hide stuff (including a drive shaft in all-wheel-drive versions).\nThe sports seats are comfortable, supportive and highly attractive. There is a reasonable amount of room in the front boot and there are those two squeezy but occasionally very useful rear seats for small people or extra bags.\nOpen atmosphere With its black wheels and low-slung body, the convertible looks quite different from the coupe, and no less attractive. The roof goes up and down with Porsche efficiency and speed. It makes for a nice open atmosphere in the front, though for back-seat passengers the sill is pretty high.\nThe complex cup-holder arrangements (two cup holders swing out from behind glovebox-like dropdown lid) seems strange for a car supposedly trying to watch every gram. Annoyed engineers were probably told \"Do you want to sell cars in the US or not?\"\nThe ride is a little firmer than expected, though the body remains rock-solid. Although it is a substantial canvas roof, with hard panels inside, there is a high ambient noise when touring at expressway speeds.\nHonesty with numbers If you opt for the convertible version, you'll be carrying extra weight and drag, with a subsequent performance penalty. Still, you won't be suffering too much. The time to 100 km/h is increased by two-tenths, but with the PDK it is still 4.2 seconds. The manual might be enjoyable, but never as quick or as efficient. A driver simply can't beat the PDK's electronic brain.\nTop speed is 301 km/h, but among the more pertinent real-world statistics, the fuel economy is 9.2 litres/100 km on the combined cycle. That is slightly higher than the rear-drive coupe equivalent. The \"extra urban\" figure is 6.9 L/100km and, driving without trying to reduce fuel economy, we recorded a 7.4.\nI'm sure it would have been easy to match the advertised figure and it reinforces a widely held belief that Porsche figures err on the conservative side. Alas, we now know honesty with numbers hasn't necessarily run through all VW Group brands.\nMagazine tests have shown Porsche's factory acceleration figures are achievable. They are also famously repeatable, not the result of one clutch-shredding glory run.\nPorsche 911 Carrera GTS Cabriolet\nPrice (excluding on-road costs): $289,300 (as tested: $322,480)\nEngine 3.8-litre \"boxer\" six (petrol)\nPower/torque 316 kW/440 Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 8.9 L/100 km\nC0₂ 207 g/km", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:15:45.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
