But those margins are still well below luxury brand Prada's 26 percent and they have been pressured by rising costs.\nIts revenue growth has been slower than most European luxury goods firms and the money it invests to develop new models and engines is more than double, depressing its return on capital.\nRACING START\nNevertheless, Ferrari shares will get off to a roaring start on their Wall Street debut under the ticker symbol \"RACE\" on Wednesday, analysts said.\nBut trading will remain volatile at least until it is spun off early next year and the free float rises to over 60 percent, potentially making investing in the stock a hard-to-predict bet, they added.\nThe small initial public offering and expected volatility pushed many investors to play the seemingly safer Ferrari bet by investing in its parent after FCA said in October last year it would hand out the rest of its stake in the carmaker to its own shareholders.\nFCA shares have jumped more than 90 percent since then.\n\"You're ultimately getting a luxury goods company inside of FCA ... this is a unique investment opportunity,\" said Adam Wyden who manages New York-based hedge fund ADW Capital and invested in FCA when Ferrari's spin-off was announced.\nFor Ferrari fans it's an investment of the heart first.\n\"Owners will buy the stock because they support the brand, have a passion for the Ferrari mystique; there is a sense of loyalty that doesn't fit with normal investor strategies of supply and demand and making money,\" said Joe Adams, president of the 6,000-member Ferrari Club of America.\n\"Most of the owners I've spoken to are going to buy shares and that will drive the price up. It's like with the cars, they are taking the same strategy.\" ($1 = 0.8811 euros)\n(Additional reporting by Lauren Hirsch in New York; editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:09:46.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
