But I think it’s fair to say that if you knew then what you know now, maybe you’d have done it slightly differently.\nOutgoing ANZ chief Mike Smith.

It is about ensuring it is in the right places.”\nMr Elliott said he was not daunted by the volatility out of Asia that has driven a wild ride on local share markets.\n“Asia certainly has been volatile ... but we are in for the long term,” he said.\n“We think it is better to be there and be on the front foot rather than reading about it in the newspaper.”\nMr Gonski said the lender’s super-regional strategy was “not really understood” by many and was about Australia’s links into Asia rather than simply “investing in China”.\nUnder Mr Gonski, the ANZ board has been undertaking a very public international search for a successor to the long-serving Mr Smith, who pivoted the bank towards ­engaging the growing Asian ­financial services sector.\nNew Zealand-born Mr ­Elliott, 51, who boasts more than 30 years’ banking experience and joined ANZ six years ago, will succeed Mr Smith in January. He will be the first internal candidate promoted to the top job in 23 years.\nMr Gonski said Mr Elliott was the best candidate, particularly due to his vision for ANZ’s future.\n“When we were in Silicon Valley (for an executive visit), I watched carefully how his mind works and how he analyses things. I have to say we have to turn these things to our advantage.”\nThe UK-born Mr Smith — who was renowned for his blunt assessments of Australian politics — said it was the role of CEOs to speak out.\n“I sometimes think business leaders should call out problems, particularly when there is bad policy around ... you can’t moan about it if you haven’t said anything about it,” he said. “With me you get what you see, I’ve always been forthright in my views.”\nAs for Mr Elliott? He admitted he had “big shoes to fill”.\njeff.whalley@news.com.au\n Be bold, new ANZ chief urged", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/02/1227553/162127-11db4a84-6809-11e5-968b-5ebf3b994251.jpg", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/new-anz-chief-shayne-elliott-defends-asia-strategy/story-fni0dcne-1227553161825"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:12:35.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
