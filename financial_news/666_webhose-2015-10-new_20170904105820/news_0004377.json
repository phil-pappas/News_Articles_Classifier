Yahoo says more than 30 big brands, including American Express and Toyota, have signed on for the 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time live stream – though a media buyer told the Journal that the price of commercials is far less than typical Sunday afternoon games on TV. Yahoo forked over $20 million for the rights to the game, so the pressure will be on to make sure the picture is sharp and the stream is glitch-free. For the NFL, the move may portend a future shift toward more streaming of games.\nHOLDING OUT : Major marketers are reviewing their agency spending and cutting costs, and big advertising holding companies are seeing it in their bottom line. WSJ reports that French ad giant Publicis cut its full-year sales outlook as North American-based marketers in the automobile, consumer goods and pharmaceutical categories pulled back ad spending, according to Chief Executive Maurice Lévy. The poor results come as marketers become more concerned about things like agency transparency, and Publicis has been particularly hard hit, since many of its clients are conducting reviews and the stinging from last year’s failed merger with Omnicom has yet to subside.\nALPHABET CITY : Alphabet Inc., the recently-named parent of Google, reported strong third-quarter earnings on Thursday, and executives lauded revenue from areas like mobile search and YouTube , CMO Today reports. Though many had previously wondered whether Google’s search ads would play as well on mobile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said mobile search could become “as compelling or even better than desktop.” Executives talked up how advertisers were shifting traditional budgets to YouTube, and Mr. Pichai also said, interestingly, that the company was not particularly worried about ad blocking.\nWISDOM OF CROWD OUT : The 2016 election will produce a glut of political TV advertising, but it just might push out regular marketers in a phenomenon known as “political crowd out,” Ad Age reports. There’s reason to believe marketers may get squeezed, with some 20 presidential candidates, huge money from political groups and high-stakes toss-up congressional and gubernatorial races in many states to contend with. Local advertisers and even national ones with frequent regional buys may have to purchase spots far ahead of time, or avoid shows frequented by political junkies, Ad Age notes.\nElsewhere\nJohn Malone ’s Liberty Global is in talks to acquire Cable & Wireless Communications [ WSJ ]\nActivision Blizzard has hired a former ESPN and NFL executive to head a new e-sports unit [ WSJ ]\nPeople still like sharing articles via text message [ Nieman Lab ]\nInstagram has launched a standalone app called Boomerang to shoot one-second video loops [ TechCrunch ]\nJimmy Fallon is widening his lead in the ratings battle with Stephen Colbert [ Variety ]\nPart of Jack Dorsey’s challenge will be to get people like his new board member Omid Kordestani to use Twitter more [ WSJ ]\nShane Smith says that rumored Vice TV network will arrive next year, and that the company is acquisition talks at the valuation of $5 billion [ CNBC ]\nAmazon tested using newspaper carriers to make package deliveries on their routes [ WSJ ]\nAirbnb faced backlash for San Francisco political ads [ New York Times ]\nMcDonald’s posted growth in same-restaurant sales for the first time in two years [ WSJ ]\nMaxim editor-in-chief Kate Lanphear, who rebranded the lad mag to have a greater focus on style, is leaving the magazine [ New York Magazine ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/22/instagram-boomerang/#.u1ne6v:r0Xm", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/22/vice-to-launch-tv-network-in-us-and-a-dozen-in-europe.html", "http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/10/youre-probably-underestimating-how-much-your-articles-are-being-shared-via-text-message/", "https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/late-night-ratings-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon-1201624122/", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/business/media/airbnb-ads-flop-in-san-francisco.html?smid=tw-nytmedia&smtyp=cur", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/10/kate-lanphear-will-step-down-as-maxim-eic.html", "http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/advertisers-suffer-political-crowd-2016-elections/301014/", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "https://twitter.com/perlberg"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:01:24.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
