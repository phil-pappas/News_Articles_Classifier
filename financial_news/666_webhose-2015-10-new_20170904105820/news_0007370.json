Improving patient quality of life was the second highest motivation for pulmonologists when selecting an IPF treatment (63%). 1 In addition to asking pulmonologists about their approaches to treatment, the survey asked participants to consider IPF from the patient’s perspective, including impact of the disease. When asked what was most important for an IPF patient to understand in terms of knowing how IPF will affect them, 77% of pulmonologists stated ‘knowing what treatment options are available for IPF’, and 68% said ‘knowing that IPF is unpredictable and that their condition could change suddenly and unexpectedly’. Top of mind for physicians when thinking about the impact of IPF were breathlessness (54%), lung function (21%) and exacerbations (13%). 1 As IPF progresses lung function gradually and irreversibly declines leading to difficulty breathing and decreased oxygen supply to the major body organs. 6 Exacerbations – events of acute respiratory worsening – are a risk to all IPF patients and they can occur at any time during the course of the disease without warning or known cause. 7 Acute exacerbations can impact the course of the disease, often leading to death within a few months, making them a crucial treatment consideration for pulmonologists managing IPF patients. 8 “As someone who talks every day to people with IPF, it is fascinating to see how pulmonologists view and prioritise the impact of the disease on patients and make treatment decisions,” said Dagmar Kauschka, Chairperson of the German patient advocacy group Lungenfibrose e.V.. “We put a lot of time and energy into supporting IPF patients over their day-to-day concerns such as breathlessness and the risk of exacerbations. One of our goals is to fight for patient support as a regular part of therapy. We are reassured to see through this survey that pulmonologists do recognise the key concerns when thinking about the impact of IPF on their patients.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:18:05.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
