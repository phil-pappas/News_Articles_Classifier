All dollar figures in millions. \nAs the bold line item signifies, the biggest reason for Facebook's net-income year-on-year drop was the huge ramp in research and development. On a year - on-year basis, Facebook increased its R&D costs 135%, much higher than the aforementioned 40% increase in revenue. The end result is R&D that climbed from 17% of total revenue in 2014's first half to 29% in 2015. That huge increase drove total costs and expenses higher and both income from ops and net income lower. \nA question of effectiveness ... It should be noted that a majority of this large R&D expense isn't cash per se, but actually share-based compensation expenses. Per Facebook's quarterly report, share-based compensation comprised $1.17 billion during the six months in 2015, or 52% of all R&D expenses. Of course, this is still an expense, as it expands shares outstanding. As such, investors should ask if Facebook's R&D spend is apropos. \nAnd in terms of effectiveness, Facebook seems to be succeeding. In this period, the company grew its video views from 1 billion views a day to 4 billion and has significantly cut videos hosted by Alphabet 's YouTube on its site in favor of its native video platform. In addition, new surveys show advertisers actually prefer advertising on Facebook over YouTube, a move that portends future ad-spend to be apportioned to the service going forward. For investors, Facebook's large R&D ramp-up should be welcomed, even if it means a short-term hit to the bottom line. \nThe next billion-dollar iSecret The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.
