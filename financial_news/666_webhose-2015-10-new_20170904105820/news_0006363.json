They have pledged that tax reform would be a top legislative priority and that they would act on their proposals in 2017 if elected. \nps, and include taxing carried interest, limiting the corporate interest deduction and ending the deferral for like-kind exchanges. The Obama Administration and Congressional Democrats have been going after carried interest for years, with no success. However, the push to raise tax rates on carried interest has gained considerable support with the endorsements of Donald Trump and Jeb Bush to tax carried interest as ordinary income. Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders also support taxing carried interest. In addition, Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), a long-time defender of carried interest, has announced his support of proposals to increase taxes on carried interest. Schumer has noted the “wealth of bipartisan support” for taxing carried interest, and urged Congress to act on the proposal as soon as possible. However, the Bush proposal to tax carried interest was included in his comprehensive tax reform plan, and any real threat to carried interest will likely be in a comprehensive tax reform bill. One of the most significant proposals in the Bush tax reform plan is his proposal to end the “favorable tax treatment” of debt financing over equity financing by eliminating the deduction for corporate debt. According to the proposal, “the deductibility of interest for businesses subsidizes debt, discouraging equity, and thereby threatening long-term prosperity.” This proposal would stop government from “subsidizing corporate and Wall Street debt.” A tax reform plan by another presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio (D-FL), would also eliminate the corporate deduction for debt. These proposals mirror the plan outlined by the Obama Administration in its corporate tax reform plan to reduce the bias towards debt by reducing the deductibility of interest for corporations. The New York Times has said that these proposals would “have a profound impact on almost every industry, but would especially affect private equity and real estate.” Standing alone, this proposal has little chance of passing. However, members on both side of the aisle see it as way to pay for a substantial corporate tax reduction in a major tax reform bill. ’s budget proposes to limit the deferral to US$1 million a year. The comprehensive tax reform plan proposed by Jeb Bush most likely includes like-kind exchanges. Although not all the details have been released, the plan does call for the elimination or phase-out of most tax expenditures. . Congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama have been unable to resolve their stark differences over individual tax reform. However, there is widespread agreement in Washington that tax reform is needed to fix the broken tax code, and that the next best opportunity for action on a major tax reform bill will come when a new President takes office in 2017 . to make the case against any proposals now aimed at them by presidential candidates. a number of key issues are on the tax agenda for the rest of the year . Paul Ryan (R-WI) intends to move an international tax reform plan this fall , one that aims to shift to a territorial tax system with a one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings to help fund the highway trust fund and adopting an innovation box regime. The committee is also expected to add an extension of expiring tax provisions to the international tax reform plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:54:06.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
