Amongst other chapters, various activities were also organised at the dealerships of Seven Islands, Harley-Davidson (Mumbai) and Two-Rivers, Harley-Davidson (Pune) celebrated the special day.\nPallavi Singh , director of marketing, Harley-Davidson India said, “We are very proud to be associating with The Bindi Project for the second year, and participating in the Father-Daughter Ride.

By holding Father-Daughter rides across the country and publicly sharing their love and respect for own their daughters, they are helping to inspire others to want similar relationships. I believe that such initiatives will both help save baby girls from the impact of son preference and eventually transform our society to treat all women and girls with respect and love throughout their lives.”\nOn this occasion, hundreds of Harley owners across the country also signed The Bindi Project Pledge to treat their daughters with love and respect and to provide them happy, healthy and fulfilling lives, free from all forms of violence.\n 12, 2015 4:02 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:40:27.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
