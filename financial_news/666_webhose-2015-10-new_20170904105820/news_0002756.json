He is struck by the \"vacuous stares\" he sees and the sense of \"utter hopelessness\" he experiences there.\nHe is alarmed by the approach of the \"nouveau riche noire\", the newly wealthy black segment of society, which seeks short cuts to success rather than using education and hard work.\n\"You are screwed if you’re not with the ‘in group’. If you are with them then you’ll be screwed tomorrow when there’s a new ‘in group’. It’s this political dynamic of trying to be with the ‘in group’ to thrive that’s so concerning\".", "external_links": ["http://bdlive.profiledata.co.za/ShareData/Company/CompanyChart.aspx?JSECode=IMP"], "published": "2015-10-22T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:55:14.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
