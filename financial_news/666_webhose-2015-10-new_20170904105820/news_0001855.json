Google sure hopes so.\nThe company announced on Wednesday that it's launching a subscription service, YouTube Red, which launches on October 28. Subscribers can get access to Red for $US10 per month.\nThe main perks of the service is the ability to watch videos across the site without having to see any ads, as long as users are signed in. Other advantages include the option to save videos to watch offline and to keep videos playing in the background on a mobile device, even when you switch apps.\n\"Every step that we have taken along the way is 180 completely the opposite of what Netflix is doing.\": YouTube executive Robert Krycl. Photo: Bloomberg\nThe name of the new service has raised some eyebrows, as it bears a resemblance to a popular porn website , RedTube. â€‹\nAdvertisement YouTube Red has already been compared to Netflix, but YouTube doesn't see the two as competitors.\n\"Our membership service is completely different from what Netflix is,\" Robert Kyncl, who oversees all business functions for YouTube, told reporters at an event on Wednesday.\n\"Every step that we have taken along the way is 180 completely the opposite of what Netflix is doing.\"\nThe YouTube Red service will work across YouTube's site, including on YouTube Gaming and YouTube Music, which also got an update Wednesday with the launch of a new Music app. In a company blog post, YouTube's Matt Leske, a senior product manager, said that YouTube users have wanted a paid, ad-free option for a long time:\n\"For years, YouTube's fans have been telling us they want more - more choice when watching their favourite content, more ways to support their favourite creators and, above all, the option to watch their favourite videos uninterrupted.\"\nIn addition to announcing subscriptions, YouTube also gave an update on its efforts in the world of original content. Google will tap some of its top talent, including game-video maker PewDiePie as well as other personalities such as the Fine Bros, Rooster Teeth and Lilly Singh, to make \"new, ambitious content.\" The firm also said that more original initiatives are in store for 2016.\nAnalysts have long suspected that YouTube, which gets billions of hits per day, would look to launch a paid service building off of its popularity. Two years ago, the site launched a paid channels program that enabled some YouTube content creators to charge for access to premium content. More recently, the site has been creating silos for specific content - YouTube Gaming, YouTube Kids, YouTube Music - to reach focused audiences.\nAccording to an eMarketer report from April, YouTube is expected to reach $US1.99 billion in net revenues from video ads by 2017.\nWires", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQxX8zgyzuM", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/10/21/youtube_red_a_new_subscription_service_sounds_a_lot_like_the_porn_site_redtube.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrZm1CUydzo"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:03:32.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
