But it's good to know McFarlane's intentions are pure.\nCop out Colourful copper hopeful, CuDeco, reports that its accounts for the year ending June 30 continue to be delayed while it crunches the numbers on the valuation of its Cloncurry, Queensland copper deposit.\nIt must be hard to translate the the metallurgical properties of Cloncurry's native copper – described by CuDeco founder, Wayne McCrae , as \"just like dried dog shit\" – into a respectable balance sheet line item.\nThe good news is that CuDeco expects to finish the exercise by the end of this week, and report any impairments of its much prized asset.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:44:46.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
