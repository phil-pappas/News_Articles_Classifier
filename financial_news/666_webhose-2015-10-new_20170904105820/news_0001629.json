Gulf Coast cash gasoline differentials rose on Thursday \nin thin trade with few sellers participating, traders said. \nA4 CBOB, or conventional regular gasoline blendstock formulated for blending with 10 percent \nethanol, traded at 8.00-, 7.75- and 7.50-cent discounts to December RBOB futures, and \nthen was talked as low as 6.50 cents under, down 2.00 cents per gallon from Wednesday's finish. \nConventional M4 gasoline sold at 4.50- and 4.00-cent discounts to futures, up a penny per \ngallon, traders said. \nThe moves came as a gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at Marathon \nPetroleum Corp's 451,000 barrels per day (bpd) Galveston Bay refinery in Texas City, \nTexas, remained shut because of ongoing compressor and catalyst flow problems. \nAlso, Valero Energy Corp on Thursday reported to regulators a controlled shutdown at its \n205,000 bpd Corpus Christi, Texas plant for leak repairs in a process unit. \nHowever, also on Thursday Royal Dutch Shell said planned work was finished at its \n316,600 bpd refinery in Deer Park, Texas, and LyondellBasell Industries \nsaid an FCCU at its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery had restarted. \nTraders attributed higher differentials to thin trade, noting that the restarts largely \ncanceled out fallout from the outages in the well-supplied market. \nMidwest products were mixed. Chicago CBOB gasoline had buyers bidding 14 cents above \nNovember RBOB for cycle-3 October barrels, while sellers asked 17 cents over. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was \npegged at 15 cents above the benchmark late on Wednesday. \nChicago ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) continued to slump on improved supply availability, \nbrokers said. Sellers asked 9.00 cents above November ULSD and buyers were bidding 6.00 \ncents above futures. It was pegged at 15 cents over late on Wednesday, off 10 cents from \nTuesday. \nGroup Three gasoline had buyers and sellers on either side of 15 cents above November RBOB, \ntwo cents below where it was valued late on Wednesday. ULSD was pegged half a cent stronger at \n1.50 cents above November ULSD. \nNew York Harbor differentials mostly firmed. F4 RBOB was at 0.75 cent above November RBOB, \nup 0.25 cent from its late-Wednesday peg. M3 (Other OTC: MTHRF - news ) gasoline strengthened 0.75 cent to 5.25 cents over \nNovember RBOB. \nULSD gained 0.75 cent to 0.75 cent below November futures. Jet fuel was pegged at 3.50 cents \nbelow November ULSD, 0.50 cent stronger from its value late on Wednesday. \nEthanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits rose a penny to trade at 41.25 cents \neach, brokers said. \nBiodiesel credits for 2015 traded two cents higher at 62 cents. \nFor more refinery news, please go to \nLatest day \nTiming NYMEX Bid Offer Change \nContract \nA4 CBOB gasoline Cycle 61 RBOB -7.00 -6.50 2.00 \nM4 conventional gasoline Cycle 61 RBOB -4.25 -3.75 1.00 \n62-grade ULSD Cycle 59 HO -7.75 -7.25 0.25 \n54-grade jet fuel Cycle 59 HO -9.00 -8.00 0.00 \nHeating oil * Cycle 58 HO -15.00 -14.50 0.75 \nNEW YORK HARBOR \nM3 conventional gasoline Prompt RBOB 5.00 5.50 0.75 \nF4 RBOB Prompt RBOB 0.50 1.00 0.25 \nULSD Prompt HO -1.00 -0.50 0.75 \nHeating oil Prompt HO -10.25 -9.75 0.00 \nJet fuel Prompt HO -3.75 -3.25 0.50 \nMIDWEST \nChicago CBOB gasoline Cycle 3 RBOB 14.00 17.00 0.00 \nChicago ULSD Cycle 3 HO 6.00 9.00 -6.00 \nGroup Three gasoline RBOB 14.00 16.00 -2.00 \nGroup Three ULSD HO 1.00 2.00 0.50 \n(Reporting by Kristen Hays in Houston and Robert Gibbons in New York; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:44:31.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
