Still, investments \nmade in recent years, such as the Golden Eagle (HKSE: 3308-OL.HK - news ) project which \nstarted up in 2014, are helping to expand supplies. \nOutput of the four crudes that set the Brent benchmark \n--Brent itself, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk -- is still set to \nbe higher in November despite planned maintenance on the Buzzard \noilfield, the largest field contributing to the Forties stream. \nThe table below is based on the latest known loading \nprogrammes for 12 crude streams as tracked by Reuters. \nVolumes are in millions of barrels and loading rates are in \nbarrels per day. \nBrent 120,000 3.60 116,000 3.60 \nForties 440,000 13.20 426,000 13.20 \nOseberg 120,000 3.60 116,000 3.60 \nEkofisk 300,000 9.00 290,000 9.00 \nDUC (LSE: 0O3S.L - news ) 80,000 2.40 58,000 1.80 \nFlotta Gold 90,000 2.70 97,000 3.00 \nGullfaks 189,000 5.66 182,000 5.66 \nStatfjord 189,000 5.67 208,000 6.46 \nTroll 220,000 6.60 271,000 8.40 \nTOTAL (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) 1,748,000 52.43 1,764,000 54.72 \nAsgard 114,000 3.42 110,000 3.42 \nAlvheim 104,000 3.12 75,000 2.34 \nGrane 120,000 3.60 116,000 3.60 \nTOTAL 2,086,000 62.57 2,065,000 64.08 \nNOTES: Totals are rounded and may not add up exactly. \nDUC, Troll, Brent, Forties, Ekofisk and Oseberg cargoes are \ntypically of 600,000 barrels, although sometimes several \nnon-standard sizes are included. \nStatfjord cargoes can be 800,000 barrels, while Alvheim \ncargoes are mainly 780,000 barrels. \nLoading programmes are usually issued to equity holders \nbetween the first and tenth of each month.
