Honda Motor Co rose 1.5 percent and Advantest Corp gained 2.6 percent.\nOn the other hand, shippers lost ground on the Nikkei report saying that three major Japanese shipping companies are expected to report lower-than-expected group pretax profit for the six months ended September on weak demand for bulk cargo carriers in the face of China's decelerating economy.\nThe sea transport sector fell 2.7 percent, the worst performer on the board: Nippon Yusen dropped 4.5 percent and Mitsui OSK Lines shed 1.8 percent, while Kawasaki Kisen also fell 1.8 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 1.3 percent to 1,567.84 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 1.3 percent to 14,063.15.
