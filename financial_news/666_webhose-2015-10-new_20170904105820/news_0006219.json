Rosier year-end seen for Lupin, Aurobindo, Glenmark thanks to faster US approvals Condo owners in Panama tell Donald Trump: You're fired! App-only apparel company Myntra, which is now owned by e-commerce major Flipkart , has said it expects to ship around 600,000 packages during Flipkart’s five-day-long Big Billion Day sale starting October 13, reports Avanish Tiwary in Bengaluru. Discounts in the sale period will go as high as 60% on its private-label apparel brands, including products from other brands listed on its platform.\n“We are soaring our capacity, and are actually adding manpower including a new management team to be there around the clock. We are doing a bunch of other things too, to make sure the consumer experience doesn’t suffer,” said Myntra’s CEO Ananth Narayanan. “October to December is always the best season for us and this is the first time we will be participating in the Big Billion Day sale with Flipkart. That is why we are so excited about it,” he said in an exclusive chat.\nWhile denying to comment on the GMV that the company is targeting during the festive period sale, Narayanan said,\n“We are expecting a rise of about 3-4 times in revenue compared to the base line figure that we do every day. And in terms of traffic we are expecting a 8-10x increase during the five days of sale.” The company claims to have six million active monthly customers and 12 million total users, who need not be active buyers on the platform.\nAlso expecting a rise in the demand for ethnic wear, Myntra is introducing a few new private-labels which will have exclusive ethnic wear collection. “This is in-line with our ethnic wear campaign. As a part of Myntra fashion brands, we are launching our own brands in that category, and getting a few foreign brands here as well,” he said.\nThe company had gathered a lot of flak over shifting its shopping platform completely from desktop and mobile websites to mobile apps only early this year in May. The company while shifting its base said all kinds of data and user behavior suggests this is the right move at the right time and that others will follow soon. Flipkart, which had acquired Myntra for a whopping Rs 2,000 crore hasn’t completely shifted its base to become an app only platform, which Myntra is.\n“I think it allows users to have a sort of personalisation that they couldn’t do on their desktops. Experience for consumers will be much better compared to desktop experience during the festive period. We expect to acquire 3-4 times more new customers during the festive period compared to what we would have done on non-sale days,” Narayanan added.\n 12, 2015 12:49 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:32:53.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
