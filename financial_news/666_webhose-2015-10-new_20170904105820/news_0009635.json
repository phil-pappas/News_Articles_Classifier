Photo: Supplied\nDavid Chiu thinks he has a pretty good handle on what makes Chinese gamblers tick.\nAs one of Hong Kong's best connected billionaires, he socialises with many of the high rollers who have helped turn Macau from a sleepy backwater to Asia's gambling capital.\nWhile many of China's VIP set are currently steering clear of the city state due to a corruption crackdown, Chiu argues they remain the holy grail for casino operators. The Hong Kong property tycoon reckons if any casino can hook a Chinese VIP, it will be on the road to making money.\nDavid Chiu is betting on Chinese gamblers to propel the growth of Queen's Wharf.\n\"They are not easy customers, but they are great customers,\" Chiu said in an interview in Hong Kong on Thursday. \"Why do I say they are great? They lose a lot of money. In pure numbers, they are good.\"\nAdvertisement For the past 12 months, Chiu has been sharing his insights into the behaviour of casino whales with Sydney-based casino operator Echo Entertainment.\nThe Chiu family has made much of its fortune through property development with its Far East Consortium entity building a string of apartments and hotels in Australia.\nAnd now Chiu, along with Hong Kong's wealthy Cheng family – which controls the jewellery-to-shopping mall Chow Tai Fook Enterprises conglomerate – has teamed up to help bankroll the $3 billion Queen's Wharf casino resort due to open in Brisbane in 2022.\nEcho, owner of The Star in Sydney, Treasury in Brisbane and Jupiters on the Gold Coast, will operate Queen's Wharf with a 50 per cent share of the venture.\nWhile Echo will bring expertise in running the casino side of the resort, it's relying on its Hong Kong partners to develop a string of hotels including the Ritz Carlton, Rosewood and Dorsett brands, along with Michelin star restaurants and more than 2000 residential apartments.\nConnection into extensive links Echo is also banking on Far East and Chow Tai Fook to tap their extensive links with high-value Asian gamblers as they look to generate a third of revenues at Queen's Wharf from VIP operations.\nChiu appears to be relishing the challenge of opening doors on Echo's behalf. He was known as \"Tiger Boy\" for being an aggressive stock trader in his 20s, and still displays a strong sense of ambition through ambitious ventures like Queen's Wharf.\n\"If you ask me who the richest people are in Hong Kong, Beijing or Shanghai, in theory we should know them and we obviously do,\" he laughs.\nChiu says attention to the finest details will often impress a VIP gambler more than private jets and super yachts.\n\"High rollers drop $2 million, but they are very concerned about being over charged for a coffee,\" Chiu said. \"For the Chinese it's just as important they get a shark fin soup in a Chinese restaurant as it is a private jet turning up in Shanghai.\"\nLike the members of many family-run business clans in Hong Kong, 61-year-old Chiu has a diverse array of corporate interests. Developing residential and commercial property clearly remains his passion, but he's open to using his business connections to expand into other sectors.\nThe family empire was built on movie and television interests in the 1980s and mindful of that heritage Chiu recently bid for a new Hong Kong TV licence in a consortium with Pansy Ho, daughter of Macau gaming tycoon Stanley Ho.\nMacau has suffered in the last few years due to the Chinese government's crackdown on corruption, but Chiu thinks the enormous growth of the city into the world's biggest gambling hub is instructive for the Australian casino market.\nInsightful tour of Macau He recently took Echo management including chief executive Matt Bekier on a tour of the Macau strip using his contacts and connections to give the Australian operator an insight into the mechanics of an Asian-run gambling operation.\nChiu managed to gain entry for Echo into most Macau casinos. Melco Crown's casinos were off the list given they are owned by James Packer's Crown Resorts. Chiu said Crown approached Far East to become its joint venture partner as part of a rival bid on Queen's Wharf, but the Hong Kong company opted for Echo instead.\n\"Crown were already in Macau – in fairness Echo were not. So we bought them to Macau to meet all our friends. Of course not at Melco because Crown did not want to show us. But everyone else was happy to show us their casinos,\" Chiu chuckles.\nHe bats away talk Macau is in terminal decline, but says it was critical the Chinese government took control of rampant corruption.\n\"Some people are saying China is trying to run down Macau – that's not right. Of course you don't want to destroy a city,\" says Chiu.\n\"I think for President Xi Jinping the bigger picture was that corruption in China was serious for the last 10 years. And it's a tough battle for the new leadership because some of the battle was the fact that some of those guys were powerful and rich. So for him to do this crackdown is not an easy journey.\"\nWhile Macau struggles to shake off its downturn, Chiu thinks that if Australia builds equivalent facilities like Queen's Wharf, it will grow its share of the casino pie.\n\"Echo management was able to look at how Chinese VIPs behave. But we also learnt a lot from Echo in how the mass market in Australia operates and behaves – it's a highly complementary mix. And everyone is learning from Macau. I think Crown even does it better now because of their Macau experience. And I hope with our local knowledge we can help Echo too.\"\nCashing in on the big bets of high rollers is central to the Queen's Wharf pitch, but luring China's burgeoning middle class to Australia will also play a big part in the ultimate success of the casino resort.\nChina's middle class will more than double to 600 million people by 2025 from 240 million people now, according to Chiu, with Australia at the top of the list as a destination.\nHe's bullish that tourism growth will continue despite China's economic slowdown.\n\"China's growth is slowing down. But it's no big deal, it is just getting more mature. We feel it will come back. There will be more disposable income – and one thing we do know is that the Chinese love to gamble. That will not change.\"\n*The reporter travelled to Hong Kong as a guest of Echo Entertainment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:00:57.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
