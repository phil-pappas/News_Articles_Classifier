Photo: Ben Rushton\nThe banking regulator has criticised the mortgage lending standards some banks had in place before it stepped up scrutiny of the sector earlier in 2015, saying some standards had fallen to \"horribly low levels\" that lacked \"common sense\".\nThe chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, Wayne Byres, also conceded that the regulator would have liked to uncover the poor lending standards earlier than it did.\nHis comments are the latest negative assessment of credit standards in the home loan market – a problem the regulator has sought to address through a series of curbs on bank lending activity.\nAPRA launched detailed reviews of the big banks' loan standards in the first half of 2015, which led to banks toughening their credit policies for many borrowers. Photo: Michelle Smith\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia also said last week lending standards in the property market, which the two regulators view as the main risk to financial stability, had been worse than thought.\nAdvertisement Appearing before a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra, Mr Byres highlighted the regulator's surprise at how far bank credit standards had been eroded by competition between banks.\nIt launched reviews of the large banks' loan standards in the first half of the year, which led to banks toughening their credit policies for many borrowers.\n\"We were a bit surprised by how much the competitive pressures in the industry and the competitive dynamic in the industry had led people to do things, albeit at the margins but nonetheless do things that were really in our view lacking in common sense,\" Mr Byres said.\nRepeated warnings These flaws in loan standards came despite repeated warnings from APRA over the housing market, where very low interest rates, rising house prices and high household debt have increased significantly the amount of risk.\n\"We had spent a lot of time in 2013 and 2014 reminding [authorised deposit-taking institutions], reminding their management, reminding their boards, about the importance of lending standards. We sought assurances from boards that they were on top of these issues,\" Mr Byres said.\nLater in the hearing, he defended APRA's 10 per cent cap on housing investor credit growth against claims it was preventing some smaller lenders from competing aggressively in regional areas, where house price growth was soft. He said competition between banks had dragged loan standards to \"horribly low levels\" in some areas.\n\"I don't deny there's an element of bluntness to it, and it's very difficult for us to go around and say the right number in this postcode is 'X' and the number in another postcode is 'Y',\" he said.\n\"Does this have competitive implications? Yes it does, but the whole issue I think started because competition was driving standards to a horribly low level.\"\nMr Byres said APRA wished the problems had been detected earlier than they were, but standards had improved over 2015.\n\"With the benefit of hindsight, obviously we wish we got on to this a bit sooner, but we are where we are. If we act too soon we get accused of being too interventionist and managing institutions – it's a delicate balance to be had.\"\nQuality of lending The quality of lending was \"noticeably superior\" now compared to what was happening before APRA wrote to banks late in 2014 outlining various actions to improve loan standards, he said.\nIt was also forcing banks to slow the rate of credit growth in the housing investor loan market to less than 10 per cent a year.\nIn response, banks are forcing investors to stump up bigger deposits, they have raised interest rates, and customers' ability to cope with higher repayments are being tested more rigorously.\nThe deterioration in loan standards was not always obvious, Mr Byres said.\nSpotting the problems required taking a more \"forensic\" look at what banks were doing, such as the calculations they were making to test customers' ability to pay off loans or deal with higher interest rates.\n\"When we did that in a more forensic way, we weren't particularly comfortable with what we saw,\" he said.\nAs well as scrutinising bank lending, APRA has also been pushing up capital requirements for banks, which has prompted the big banks to raise more than $18 billion in equity capital.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/rba-cracks-whip-at-banks-20151016-gkb8ku"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:22:20.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
