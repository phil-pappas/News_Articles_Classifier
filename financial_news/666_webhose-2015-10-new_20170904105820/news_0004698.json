ADVERTISEMENT Sales are up 8.8 percent compared with a year ago.\n“While current price growth around 6 percent is still roughly double the pace of wages, affordability has slightly improved since the spring and is helping to keep demand at a strong and sustained pace,\" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR chief economist. \nA separate report from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) on Thursday credited a mix of steady employment and economic growth, pent-up demand, affordable home prices, and low mortgage rates for keeping the housing market on track for expansion into 2016. \nImprovement is expected amid persistent headwinds, with housing shortages and readily available labor, along with rising costs for materials, holding back a more robust recovery. \n\"This recovery is all about jobs,\" said David Crowe, the NAHB chief economist. \"If people can get good jobs that pay decent incomes, the housing market will continue to move forward.\" \nAnother positive is that home equity has nearly doubled since 2011 and now stands at $12.5 trillion, Crowe said. \nHome prices have continued ticking upward but at a slower pace. \nThe median existing-home price for all housing types in September was $221,900, which is 6.1 percent above the September 2014 price of $209,100. \nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency reported Thursday that home prices rose 0.3 percent in August from the previous month. \nThe average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage remained below 4 percent for the second consecutive month, declining slightly in September to 3.89 from 3.91 percent in August, down from 4.16 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac. \nThe market also is facing a dearth of homes on the market. \nThe number of homes for sale decreased 2.6 percent, to 2.21 million, or a 4.8-month supply at the current sales pace, down from 5.1 months in August. \n\"Despite persistent inventory shortages, the housing market has made great strides this year, backed by an increasing share of pent-up sellers realizing the increased equity they’ve gained from rising home prices and using it towards trading up or moving into a smaller home,” Yun said. \nBut first-time home buyers are struggling to get into the market. \nThose buyers made up just 29 percent of sales in September after climbing to their highest share of the year in August, at 32 percent. \nDistressed sales — foreclosures and short sales — remained at 7 percent in September for the third consecutive month and have fallen from 10 percent a year ago. \nAll four regions saw sales gains in September. \nSales increased 8.6 percent in the Northeast, 2.3 percent in the Midwest, 3.8 percent in the South and 6.7 percent in the West.
