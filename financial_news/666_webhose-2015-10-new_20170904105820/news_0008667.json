Living upto expectations, the Prabhu Dheva directed ‘Singh Is Bling’ has emerged as the leader from the pack garnering occupancy. The film already has a bequest of its own as the previous film in the series, ‘Singh Is Kinng’ was one of the highest grosser of all time.\nGoing by the advance booking that ‘Singh Is Bling’ has fetched, Akshay Kumar can well brace up for his biggest opener till date. While it was pretty much expected that single screens would see a very good opening for this release, what is making all the difference to the opening day is the kind of advance that the film has managed at the multiplexes.\nEspecially in the Delhi NCR, the film has seen one of the biggest advance ever, which can in fact also be compared with that of ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’.\nAkshay Kumar’s fourth release of the year ‘Singh Is Bling’ also stars Amy Jackson and Lara Dutta. The movie is directed by Prabhu Deva whose last two releases ‘Ramaiya Vastavaiya’ and ‘Action Jackson’ were big flops at box office. Akshay is looking for his first 100 crores grosser of 2015, while Prabhu is hoping for a big hit after debacle of Action Jackson.\n‘Singh Is Bling’ sees Akshay Kumar playing the role of Raftaar Singh in the film. With the backdrop of Punjab, the movie is a concoction of comedy, emotions and action.\nOn the other hand, Friday’s another release Irrfan Khan starrer ‘Talvar’ that features relatively fewer morning shows has recorded 25% occupancy rate.\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 8:01 pm © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:58:30.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
