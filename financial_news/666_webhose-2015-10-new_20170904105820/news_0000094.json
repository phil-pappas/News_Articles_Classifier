Jamie Williams/City of Sydney Share on twitter by Misa Han Office workers in Sydney CBD could be commuting on \"Boris bikes\" instead of taking public transport or taxi.\nMayor Clover Moore said the City of Sydney had plans to implement a bike hire system similar to \"Boris bikes\" , a Â£2-a-day bike hire system in London named after its mayor Boris Johnson.\n\"I support the views of the mayor of London, the mayor of Amsterdam, the mayor of Rotterdam and other mayors around the world in creating a city where people can safely cycle and walk,\" she said.\n\"We have plans on a bike hire system, when we've got enough separated cycleways.\"\nThe council is looking into the feasibility of introducing a pilot public bike hire scheme before 2020.\nLondon has installed more than 700 bike docking stations in the city. Melbourne has also introduced a \"blue bikes\" hire system with 50 bike stations throughout Melbourne CBD. The system is operated by private car insurer RACV.\nIt is estimated as many as 150,000 workers in Australia cycled to work as part of the national Ride2Work campaign on Wednesday, despite traffic dangers.\nSydney barrister Steven Berveling, who was taking part in Sydney Suit Ride on Wednesday, said a bike share system could encourage office workers to take bicycles for short CBD trips instead of taking the taxi.\n \"It will improve the visibility and presence of cyclists,\" he said. \"I'm not sure whether it would help encourage people going to work because it depends on the rental system, but people can do short trips within the city, instead of taxis.\"\nSafety remains a problem for many cyclists, despite improvements over the years. In Sydney CBD, the number of cyclist injuries have dropped from 50 in 2010 to under 40 in 2012, while the number of bicycle rides increased from 35,000 to more than 50,000 in the same period.\nIn central Melbourne, though the bicycle crash rate has decreased from 1.09 per 10,000 cyclists in 2009 to just over 0.60 in 2014, there have been more than 1400 bicycle-related injuries in the six years ended 2014, including three deaths, according to the City of Melbourne's draft bicycle plan.\nMr Berveling said it should not prompt a ban for cyclists on the road. \"Why would you ban cyclists? Instead why would you not ask drivers to be more careful?\" he said.\n'Vicious drivers' Ms Moore said instead of banning bicycles in some parts of Sydney CBD, the city should invest more in separated cycleways to improve safety.\n\"I know when you're on Oxford Street where you don't have cycleways, I've experienced drivers being quite vicious, driving threateningly close to you. Separated cycleways are the best thing we can do. The city's been working on that and it hasn't been easy because we haven't had the support of the minister for roads, but we're committed to doing this,\" she said.\nSydney offices like Aurora Place and the International Towers Sydney at Barangaroo are spending millions building bike facilities and showers for office workers who cycle to work .\nCathy Oke, chairwoman of the City of Melbourne's transport committee, said the city council would be opposed to any cycling ban in Melbourne CBD.\n\"The city's approach is we would prefer cyclists to use safe cycling infrastructure. We're enabling cyclists to take safer routes and the focus is not on the ban but it's about providing more infrastructure,\" she said.\nMs Oke also ruled out any requirement for licensing cyclists.\n\"We believe cyclists don't need to be registered as such. But the speed of cyclists and knowing the road rules is something we need to manage,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/melbourne-police-officers-pull-up-arnold-schwarzenegger-for-riding-a-bike-without-a-helmet-20150316-1m0s5c.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/lessons-from-london-and-copenhagen-on--how-local-councils-could-transform-sydney-20150506-ggv3kt.html", "https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:20:45.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
