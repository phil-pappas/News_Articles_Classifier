Louisiana ended last year with a deficit that needs to be closed, gaps have appeared in this year's budget and a more than $700 million shortfall is on the horizon for next year. It's unclear whether term-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal , running for the Republican presidential nomination, will work to lessen some of the problems before leaving office. \nBoicourt said those financial concerns could boost interest rates that would be locked in for 20 years if the state did a traditional bond sale in January, making it more expensive for the state to pay off the debt. \n\"To some degree, the investors may demand what I'll call an uncertainty penalty,\" she said. \nShort-term bridge financing could give the new governor and new Legislature time to work through the state's budget problems. \nThe mechanism being explored involves something called a bond anticipation note. The state would sell it for an infusion of cash to pay for construction work, then sell bonds six months or more later to pay off the bond anticipation note and pour new money into the construction account. \nAsked the possible downside of the approach, Boicourt said if interest rates for the general obligation bond market spike in the interim, a bond sale later in the year could become more expensive. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:16:23.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
