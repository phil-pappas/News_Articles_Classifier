If we find that aspirin does stop these cancers returning, it could change future treatment – providing a cheap and simple way to help stop cancer coming back and helping more people survive.”\nFirst Published on October 22, 2015 8:53 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:10:32.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
