Photo: Daniel O'Brien\nReports of the $US5billion co-working provider WeWork​ arriving in Sydney has created a buzz of excitement. But the reality is the co-working concept has been entrenched in Australia for several years, and there are already more co-working spaces in Australia (per capita) than anywhere else in the world.\nCo-working spaces offer short term, flexible, and creative office premises for people to work independently, collaboratively, or in small teams – the perfect spaces in which start-ups and freelancers can operate alongside like-minded individuals within a community environment.\nDemographic, technological and economic advances underpin the growing co-working demand. The workforce is increasingly freelance. Forty per cent of Australia's workforce are predicted to be freelancers by 2020; they have the technologies in their pockets to disrupt traditional industries, and they understand that collaboration is critical to their success.\n There are also private equity investors and crowd funding, creating available funds for new business start-ups that would historically have been viewed as risky by banking institutions and, as such, suppressed.\nAdvertisement Currently, co-working operators are largely viewed by property owners as no different to any other occupier – they sign a lease and operate a business. However, in effect, this is the beginning of the consumerisation of the workplace.\nThis could have a major impact on the property industry. In the future, businesses from start-ups to major corporates, could easily house the majority of their workforce in co-working spaces. This could see individual employees provided with a financial allowance to select the location and style of the accommodation they work at, in the same way that they have latitude to choose the mobile phone and tablet they use.\nIn the battle for the best and brightest talent, this could prove extremely attractive for tomorrow's workforce, and a useful recruitment tool. Further, this would provide the ultimate flexibility of footprint area for a business depending on headcount and workload at a given time, scalable up and down within days, rather than years as is the current lease model.\nTurning to the arrangements with the co-working operators themselves, the complexion of the current head lease situation is also likely to change. Hotel style management agreements have been implemented for some co-working spaces in the US, and larger global companies such as WeWork perhaps have the financial clout to buy their own sites and develop their own buildings.\nToday, only one thing is certain – these are exponential times when the pace of change is occurring faster than ever before, and every sector is subject to swift and significant disruption, including property.\nJohn Preece is the head of office agency at Knight Frank", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:07:19.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
