Chris Hillock by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Tegel Foods management has met with potential trade buyers believed to include Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group and global meat processing giant JBS, as owner Affinity Equity Partners nears a decision about whether to seek a trade sale or initial public offering for the poultry business.\nIt's understood Tegel management gave a high level presentation to interested trade groups at a meeting in Sydney recently, which was described as similar in nature to metings held with listed equities investors.\nSources said Affinity was hopeful of finding a buyer before the end of the calendar year but stressed there was no formal sale process underway.\nWithout an auction - and with only two months until much of the market shuts down for the annual holiday season - Affinity would have to move quickly.\nOf course, the trade talks come as Affinity and advisers Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank keep a close eye on listed equities markets, and investor demand for IPOs.\nIt's understood Goldman and Deutsche's research analysts have been briefed and are preparing pre-marketing research reports, which are due in the market towards the end of October.\nIt would not surprise, however, to see the IPO pushed into 2016 given the state of equity markets, sources said. Potential listings for the likes of radiology group I-MED and New Zealand's Carters have already been deferred until the new year and they are unlikely to be the last.\nElsewhere, sources told Street Talk an announcement from ANZ Banking Group on the sale of its Esanda Dealer Finance unit could be made as early as Tuesday.\n Macquarie is the frontrunner [and has been named preferred bidder] to grab the $8.3 billion loan portfolio, estimated to have a $1.1 billion book value, although China's HNA Group was still in the race over the weekend. As Street Talk revealed on Sunday , the third bidding group, involving ASX-listed Pepper Group and New-York-based York Capital Management, was told by vendor ANZ and its adviser Deutsche Bank that they would no longer be proceeding with their bid.\nMorgan Stanley analysts are tipping that Macquarie would require $623 million to $1.1 billion capital should it buy the unit. The analysts based their call on a $1 billion to $1.5 billion purchase price, which would represent 0.9-times to 1.4-times book value.\nMacquarie last raised equity to fund an aircraft portfolio acquisition in March, tapping institutional investors for $500 million by way of a placement. That deal was done at $73.50 a share. Macquarie stock last traded at $77.16.\nFinally, IT services company UXC Limited is understood to be close to announcing an agreed deal with acquirer US multinational Computer Sciences Corporation.\nThe parties have been in talks for several months.A period of exclusivity is expected at a price of $1.26 per share plus an interim dividend.\nNomura is said to have fielded interest on behalf of UXC.\nUXC shares have rallied strongly - up from about 80Â¢ in April - and investors will have to overcome the fact, that despite negotiations starting some months ago, the stock is trading above the offer price.\nThe shares closed at $1.33 on Monday.\nReverse break fees are thought to be in place.
