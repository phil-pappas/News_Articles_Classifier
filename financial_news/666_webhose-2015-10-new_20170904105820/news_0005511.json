A spokesman for Cerberus could not be reached. \nWhile the Wal-Mart forecast on Wednesday cast a chill through the broad U.S. stock market and the retail sector particularly, it came as the Albertsons deal was already hitting some resistance, said people familiar with the matter. Despite an intended price range in the mid-$20s, some of the larger institutional investors who were bidding for shares of the IPO had gravitated toward a $17 price point -- a level far lower than what the grocery chain's sponsors had in mind.\nRead More Wal-Mart's warning just shook these two IPOs \nAs of Wednesday night, there was no guarantee of specific timing, but Albertsons did plan to \"take a swing\" at pricing its deal the following afternoon, said someone familiar with the matter. \nIf the Albertsons IPO were to be priced on Thursday evening, this person said, a share price of $18 might be the best underwriters could expect. One strategy the company's owners might use, the person added, was to downsize the deal from a planned 16 percent of the shares outstanding to something smaller. \nAnd Albertsons wasn't the only new issue to face resistance on Wednesday. First Data, the payment processor, went forward with a planned IPO pricing late in the day, but at $16 per share -- a level notably beneath the $18 to $20 range the company had intended. \nKate Kelly CNBC Reporter Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change WMT ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:48:50.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
