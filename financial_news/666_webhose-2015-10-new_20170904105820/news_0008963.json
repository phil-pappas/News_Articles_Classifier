Andrew Quilty Share on twitter by Stephen Cauchi Australian shares closed lower on Friday after a wild five days of trading that included a 3.8 per cent wipeout on Tuesday and two recovery rallies that put the market into positive territory for the week.\nWith few leads from overseas – the Dow Jones finished flat – the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 traded lower from the outset and finished down 1.2 per cent for the day and up 0.2 per cent for the week to finish at 5052.0. The broader All Ordinaries finished 1.1 per cent lower on the day but up 0.2 per cent for the week to close at 5089.2.\nMany investors were holding fire ahead of Friday night's crucial US employment data and the third-quarter earnings season, which starts with Alcoa's report next week. Australian retail sales figures showing a 0.4 per cent increase in August, in line with expectations, did not move the market.\nThe key event this week was the sudden 30 per cent plunge in the shares of commodities group Glencore, sparked by an analyst's report suggesting that if commodity prices were to stay at current levels the stock would be close to worthless. The UK-listed mining giant has a debt pile of $US30 billion, which many consider unsustainable in the current commodities environment.\n\"There is still a lot of nervousness and skittishness out there among investors given the volatility we're seeing,\" said Wilson Asset Management senior equity analyst Martin Hickson.\n\"We're still 18 per cent off our highs so we're getting close to that bear marker territory, which is a fall of 20 per cent. There's still a lot of nervousness among investors, particularly given we're entering October and a lot of people worry that October is a negative month given the number of corrections that have happened.\"\nWhile the market rose for the week, commodity prices continued to fall, including iron ore and oil, said Mr Hickson. \"That was largely driven by further fears of a slowdown in global growth.\"\nOn the back of those falls, the energy and materials sectors – as well as healthcare – finished in the red for the week. Consumer stocks and the banks led the way forward for investors.\n Among the banks for the week, ANZ lost 0.2 per cent to close at $26.93, Commonwealth Bank was up 2.7 per cent to $73.39, National Australia Bank gained 1 per cent to $30.10 and Westpac lost 2.1 per cent to $29.75.\nBHP lost 1.4 per cent for the week to $22.60 and Rio Tinto shed 0.4 per cent to $48.73.\nIn other market news on Friday, Bega Cheese closed 1.3 per cent higher to $4.86, the highest since May 18, after Bell Potter raised its target price to $5.23 from $5.09. It was up 5.6 per cent for the week.\nThe week's best performers included Oz Minerals, which rose 14.1 per cent to $3.87 on the news global private equity firm KKR & Co has secured a 10 per cent stake. Telco Group M2 rose 12.6 per cent to $9.48 after news it would merge with Vocus Communications, while Slater and Gordon rose 10.5 per cent to $2.95 after releasing fully audited accounts.\nThe worst performing stocks for the week were dominated by energy companies including Beach Energy, which lost 12.4 per cent to 46¢, Santos, Karoon Gas, Origin and Whitehaven.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@cauchis"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:12:01.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
