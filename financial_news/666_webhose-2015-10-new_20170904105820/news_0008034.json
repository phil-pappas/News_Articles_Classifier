NAB has announced variable rate home loans will increase by 0.17 per cent. Picture: Thinkstock\nNetwork Writers and Wires News Corp Australia Network AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) is the last of the big four banks to hike standard variable interest rates.\nANZ will lift rates for home owners by 0.18 percentage points to 5.56 per cent effective from November 20.\nIt is the last bank to announce an increase after NAB announced this morning that all new and existing variable rate home loans would be increased by 0.17 per cent to 5.60 per cent per annum effective from Thursday, November 12.\nThe Commonwealth Bank previously announced that it would increase its rate by 0.15 per cent to 5.6 per cent and Westpac would raise its rate by 0.2 per cent to 5.68 per cent .\nThe rates increases are in response to market conditions and regulatory changes that require NAB to increase the amount of capital applied to residential mortgages.\nGavin Slater, NAB’s Group Executive for Personal Banking, said the bank had carefully considered the decision before raising interest rates, which are at “historically low levels”.\n“There are a range of factors that come into consideration in interest rate decisions. The home loan market is dynamic, with multiple changes being seen across the industry,” Mr Slater said.\nTough decisions ...

In May this year, NAB took early steps to strengthen our capital position by raising $5.5 billion to begin to address expected changes in capital requirements.\n“Today’s decision has not been easy, but we believe this is right decision for the long term. We know we have to balance the interests of our customers with the needs of our more than 550,000 shareholders.”\nMr Slater said NAB appreciates that price is important but they also know that customers want the right help and advice, as well as the right products and innovative digital capability.\nThere will be no changes to fixed-rate loans, after the company cut its two, three and four-year fixed home loan rates earlier this year.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/43c99797953d7595ed47ad475fb95338", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9b42dd05aaf947c2c97b0f6ac92c844", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FZ2NnBjeDppiU3CCGJdGQTbGjjmb_bgHU%2Fpromo269825130&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:32:25.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
