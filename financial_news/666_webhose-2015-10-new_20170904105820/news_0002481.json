As expected the major indices in the Indian stock markets were moving sideways through the day and closed with marginal losses. Bulls were not able to move in large numbers with their value buying. The trends in the major indices through the day are given in the table below: A sudden fall in the Chinese markets and caution over the ongoing quarterly results, coupled with profit booking, led the major indices of the Indian equities markets to close flat after falling a bit in the post-noon session on Wednesday. Both the bellwether indices ceded their initial gains, as investors were seen reluctant to chase higher prices. By the end of the day, additional factors leading to subdued Indian stock markets include diminishing hopes of a European stimulus package and heightened chances of a US rate hike. The Indian rupee too lost strength in the day's trade. It was down seven paisa at 65.13 to a US dollar from its previous close of 65.06 to a greenback. Both the domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the day's trade. According to data with stock exchanges, the DIIs sold stocks worth Rs.138.73 crore and the FIIs off-loaded scrip worth Rs.48.33 crore on Wednesday. Analysts pointed out that investors' confidence was eroded as caution built up over the possibility of a US rate hike this month, diminishing hopes of European Central Bank (ECB) extending its stimulus package and receding Chinese markets. On Tuesday, the US housing data revealed a rise of 6.5% in ground breaking activity which stood at 1.21 million units in September from 1.13 million units in August. The data which showed a pickup in economic activity spooked investors as it can push the US Fed to raise interest rates in October. The US Fed will decide whether to raise rates during its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet on October 27-28. The FOMC assumes significance as higher interest rates in the US are expected to lead away FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) from emerging markets such as India. The ECB will conduct its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. In Asia, the Chinese equities retreated from an eight-week high to end the day with losses of over 3%. China's Shanghai Composite index declined by 3.47%. Sector-wise, S&P BSE capital goods index plunged by 166.22 points, banking index receded by 156.18 points, healthcare index plummet by 142.16 points, oil and gas index fell by 50.56 points and reality index shed 25.99 points. The S&P BSE metal index surged by 87.17 points, automobile index augmented by 50.15 points and information technology (IT) index gained by 47.80 points.
