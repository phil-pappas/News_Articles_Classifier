The way this country is run is broken. People feel remote from decisions that affect them. Initiative is suffocated. Our cities held back. \n\"There's no incentive to promote local enterprise. It's time we fixed it.\" \nHe went on: \"So this is what our plan means. \n\"Attract a business, and you attract more money. \n\"Regenerate a high street, and you'll reap the benefits. \n\"Grow your area, and you'll grow your revenue too.\" \nMr Osborne said: \"Money raised locally, spent locally. Every council able to cut business taxes. \n\"A new way to govern our country. Power to the people. Let the devolution revolution begin.\" \nHe also sought to appeal beyond core Tory supporters and reach out to disaffected Labour voters, describing the Conservatives as \"the party of work\". \nThe Chancellor said: \"My message to today's Labour Party is this: You head back to the 1980s. We're heading forward. \n\"You listen to the few. We'll govern for the many.\" \nAnd he defended cuts to benefits for low-income households, which is a source of concern for a number of backbench Tory MPs \n\"We simply can't subsidise incomes with ever-higher welfare and tax credit bills the country can't afford,\" said Mr Osborne. \nBut he said in return, there would be new apprenticeships, lower income taxes and higher wages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:30:06.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
