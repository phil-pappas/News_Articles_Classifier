Eight percent fully inherited their fortune, and 35 percent partially inherited and grew their wealth. \nOnly 3 percent of the UAE’s UHNWIs made their wealth through oil, gas and consumable fuels, while industrial conglomerates proved the most significant source of the UAE’s wealth, as the main sector of investment for 20 percent of UNHWIs. \nThere are more UNHWIs in Dubai (495) than in Abu Dhabi (450). \nIn total, the Middle East has nearly 6,000 UHNWIs, worth about $995 billion. \nSaudi Arabia has the world’s 17th highest UHNW population, followed by the UAE (22nd) and Kuwait (32nd). \n“Despite the UAE equity market suffering declines of nearly 20 percent in the last year, our study shows that UHNW individuals in the country have defied this economic backdrop to record further increases in their fortunes in 2015, highlighting the ability of the world’s wealthiest individuals to continue to create new wealth,” Wealth-X Middle East director David Awit said. \nFor information, tips and advice on setting up a new business or insights from those who have taken the leap into the world of entrepreneurship, click on the Arabian Business StartUp section .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:08:50.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
