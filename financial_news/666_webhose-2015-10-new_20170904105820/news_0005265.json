Irwin Graduate School at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and one of the authors of a report titled “Is Your Tax-Managed Fund Manager Hiding in the Closet?” published in the Fall 2015 edition of the Journal of Wealth Management. The other authors are Dale Domian and Philip Gibson, professors at York University in Toronto and Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., respectively.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs The 4 Things to Do Before Retirement Guide to the New Fund Rules Tough Year for Target-Date Funds ‘529’ Mismatch? Our College Q&A U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 8.2% in Quarter The professors compared the performance of tax-managed funds to that of three other categories of funds—actively and passively managed mutual funds and passively managed exchange-traded funds—over the five years through 2014. All of the approximately 2,000 funds they studied were focused on U.S. stocks. Passively managed funds are set up to track the movements of an index, as opposed to the stock-picking of active management.\nThe major finding: In every year, tax-managed funds on average failed to save their investors more money on taxes than their incremental expenses, or the difference between their operating costs and the lower fees of the other types of passively managed funds.\nIn other words, any tax savings were eaten up by fees.\nIt gets worse Tax-managed funds were even beaten at their own game most of the time. In only two of the five years did they generate the lowest average tax burden on average of the four categories that were studied. The authors calculated the tax burden based on the highest marginal tax rates for both dividends and capital gains.\n‘Quite abysmal’ is how tax-managed funds have performed, says Prof. David Nanigian. Photo: Zach Winnie, American College of Financial Services “You take a worst-case scenario using the top rates and find they get no benefits from it, then it would follow those in lower tax brackets would be even worse off” in tax-managed funds, says Prof. Domian.\nAnd finally, using a commonly used measure of risk-adjusted returns after expenses, the tax-managed funds on average had the worst performance of the four categories in three of the five years. In the other two years, the category came in third. The authors say further research is needed to determine why the tax-managed funds performed so poorly. But they offer the idea that maybe tax-loss harvesting—selling securities that have fallen below the purchase price so that the loss can be claimed to help lower the investor’s tax burden—and avoidance of high-dividend stocks, because dividends are taxable, may hamper the ability of fund managers to achieve superior returns.\nNot all bad Still, the authors shy away from damning all funds in the category: “None of the data proves there aren’t any good ones,” Prof. Domian says of tax-managed funds, “only that the category on average doesn’t perform.”\nKen Eades, a finance professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, notes that the broad stock market was rising throughout the five-year period of the study. “It would be informative to have more years to look at for performance,” including a bear market, he says.\nIn a rising market, “the bias might be against the tax-managed funds,” Prof. Eades says. That’s because a bull market provides fewer opportunities for tax-loss harvesting.\nMr. Constable is a writer in New York.
