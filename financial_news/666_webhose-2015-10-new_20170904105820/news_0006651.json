Despite its name, the bank tax will apply to investment managers and brokerages, which are not traditionally seen as banks. \nThe tax is due to come into force next year, and was introduced by George Osborne in his July Budget. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) charges banks an extra 8pc corporation tax on profits of above £25m . The tax was introduced in part in exchange for a reduction in the bank levy a tax on the balance sheets of Britain’s biggest banks, who had complained it made their international operations less competitive. \nSmall cap brokerages typically have profits which are close to the £25m threshold or even below it, but the sector has seen substantial growth in recent years, picking up more corporate broking mandates and taking roles on capital markets deals. \nAs a result, they fear that growth could be impeded by an extra tax. \nOverall, the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the tax changes will raise £1.6bn over five years. However, estimates from analysts at EY believe it could bring in as much as £8bn for the Treasury. \nA group of challenger banks led by Paul Lynam, the chief executive of Secure Trust Bank who also head the British Bankers’ Association’s challenger bank panel, did go to meet Treasury officials last month. Other banks involved include Metro Bank, Aldermore, TSB and Close Brothers (LSE: CBG.L - news ) . \nHowever, they failed to win any immediate concessions from the Chancellor’s office. \nSeveral of the banks want to raise the threshold on the tax to profits of £250m per year, a level which would also benefit the brokerages which face paying the charge as things stand. \nIn a letter to the banks ahead of last month’s meeting, top official Charles Roxburgh indicated that before the tax can be cut back, the complainants need to be able to put forward workable alternative plans for raising the funds. \nThe Treasury declined to comment on its interactions with individual businesses on tax matters (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:23:57.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
