Those who will pay more tax under the new rules will be landlords who put down small deposits when they bought their properties. From 2017, landlords' ability to deduct the cost of their mortgage from the rent received will start to be withdrawn, pushing some basic-rate taxpayers into the higher bracket and forcing them to pay 40pc tax on the whole rental income. \n- Death of buy-to-let: landlords wake up to Osborne's 150pc tax \nBut landlords in some parts of the country will be worse off than others, especially in towns with a low rental yield â€“ the ratio between rental income and property value. Data from peer-to-peer lender LendInvest shows which towns have the lowest rental yields and where landlords could therefore expect to be hit hardest by the new tax.
