He has also promised to raise taxes on high-income Canadians and reduce them for the middle class.\n\"People had an appetite for change,\" Conservative cabinet minister Gail Shea, who lost her Prince Edward Island seat, told the CTV News. She conceded voters disliked Harper. \"I heard it on the doorstep and I expected it to affect the campaign.\"\n(Writing by Andrea Hopkins ; Editing by Amran Abocar and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:21:27.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
