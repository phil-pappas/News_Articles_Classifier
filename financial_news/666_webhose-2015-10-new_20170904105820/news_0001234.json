The firm also has a policy of keeping its board members independent from its investors. \nAfter several months of discussions with the firm’s board as it increased its stake to almost 30pc, Sherborne requested the shareholder vote in September. The investment group has said that it wants Electra to “explore opportunities to increase shareholder value” by as much as £1bn while improving its corporate governance. \nElectra Partners is the investment manager that acts on behalf of Electra Private Equity, the listed company. The latter is one of a handful of private equity vehicles listed on the stock market and owns stakes in several dozen companies including Park Resorts, TGI Fridays, the Original (LSE: 0IQ2.L - news ) Bowling Company and Hotter Shoes. \n“Electra and its manager, Electra Partners, are continuing to deliver excellent investment returns for shareholders: strong results do not require a ‘turnaround’ by Sherborne,” the board said. \nSherborne’s previous attempt to install its own directors on the board in October 2014 was voted down by other investors. Electra subsequently declared a dividend and changed its fee structure, which some analysts said was an indirect result of the pressure from Mr Bramson. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Electra are trading at £33.28, meaning they are valued at a 6.2pc discount to the firm’s net asset value at March 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:09:31.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
