Privacy advocates say the EU court ruling closes a gaping hole in individuals’ online privacy, but companies say the ruling will raise their legal costs and possibly hobble their ability to operate in Europe by forcing them to locate more data on European soil. \nIt remains unclear how long the Irish probe will take, or if it will be overtaken by efforts by the U.S. and the EU to replace the invalidated Safe Harbor agreement with a new pact that addresses EU concerns. Last week, EU privacy regulators--including the Irish regulator--gave negotiators for the EU and U.S. until the end of January to come up with a new agreement, before starting “coordinated enforcement actions.” \nThe privacy probe stems from a 2013 complaint Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems lodged with the privacy regulator in Ireland, where Facebook has its EU headquarters. Schrems argued that leaks from former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden showed his data wasn’t being protected by Facebook. But the watchdog refused to investigate at the time, citing the now defunct trans-Atlantic data pact, and Schrems appealed in Irish court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:31:52.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
