Comments Email Print × \nWilliam, Pearl, Wall and Pine streets form one of the financial district’s most bullish blocks, whose buildings encapsulate capitalism’s creative and destructive forces. \nOn one end resides New York’s monument to the industry that revs its economic engine: the Museum of American Finance, which is located inside 48 Wall St., built 87 years ago originally to house the Bank of New York. \nIn the middle, dominating the block, rises the massive 60 Wall St., built by JPMorgan Chase in the 1980s to be its headquarters, and acquired later by Deutsche Bank, which sold it for what was then the biggest sum ever in downtown Manhattan. \nAmerican International Group made its headquarters in this area, too, with two adjoined buildings, one on Pine and the other on Wall; but the company had to unload them in the wake of the Great Recession, capitalism’s latest great crisis, in which AIG played a leading role . Now, as has been the case with so many of the city’s older buildings possessing architectural verve, developers have swooped in, converting one of the buildings into a high-end condo. \n1) 48 Wall St. \nThe address is best known as the old Bank of New York Building, which went up in 1928 in place of a property the bank had used since 1797. Not surprisingly, the Museum of American Finance, which bills itself as “the nation’s only independent museum dedicated to preserving, exhibiting and teaching about American finance and financial history,” now calls it home (as do law and communications firms). Private landlord Swig Equities and investment group MacDonald & Cie acquired the 324,000-square-foot property in 1998. \n2) 52 William St. \nThe building’s owner, a limited-liability company called RCQ Hotel FD, appears through state records to be tied to the family of the late Ralph Bahna, a travel and hospitality pioneer who founded the business-traveler-targeted Club Quarters hotel chain and served as chairman of Priceline.com. Bahna, who died in 2014, developed the hotel, which dominates 52 William’s nearly 120,000 square feet. It opened in 1995, a year after a Club Quarters on West 45th Street. \n3) 60 Wall St. \nOriginally built in the late 1980s by and for JPMorgan Chase , Deutsche Bank bought 60 Wall in 2001 for $600 million and then traded it to the Paramount Group, a Manhattan-based real estate investment trust , in a sale-leaseback agreement that keeps the German bank housed in most of the building. When Paramount bought the 1.6 million-square-foot tower from Deutsche Bank in 2007, for $1.2 billion, it was the biggest downtown building sale ever.

In 2010, Chinese real-estate and home-goods firm Soufan Holdings bought the 250,000-square-foot upper office portion of 72 Wall for $46 million. The following year, Youngwoo & Associates bought the 6,100-square-foot retail portion for $14.5 million. Meanwhile, Rose Associates has converted 70 Pine St. into high-end rentals. Eastbridge Group, a Luxembourg-based holding company, co-owns the tower with Rose. A lounge and restaurant planned for the top floors—which is reportedly going to be run by Spotted Pig restaurateur and Crain’s 40 Under 40 honoree April Bloomfield—will open the landmarked building to the public for the first time in about 40 years.
