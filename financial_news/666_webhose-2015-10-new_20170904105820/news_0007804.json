That shift is a “powerful symbol” for the future of the U.S. ad market, said Magna Global’s director of global forecasting, Vincent Letang. Digital media is already the biggest media type in several Western European countries as well as in China.\nDigital media spending has been booming as advertisers increasingly pour ad dollars into social and video formats, as well as search ads, to keep up with changing consumption habits. At the same time, advertisers have been pulling back on their investment in most types of traditional media categories, including television. In its latest forecast, Magna Global lowered its projections for overall U.S. spending in 2015 and 2016, citing weaker-than-expected TV ad sales.\nThe growth of digital advertising doesn’t fully offset the contraction in TV ad dollars . When advertisers shift budgets to digital media, they expect to save on their overall ad spending. Digital media thus has a deflationary effect on the broader ad market and can hurt the pricing power of traditional media, Mr. Letang said.\nTelevision ad sales have had a tough year so far due to sliding ratings, weaker pricing and difficult year-ago comparisons. National TV sales in the U.S. fell 3.4% in the second quarter-- the worst quarterly performance for TV since 2009—though this was affected by the year-ago impact of the FIFA World Cup tournament on Spanish network ad sales. For the first six months of the year, national TV sales were down 1.4%, excluding political and Olympic ad spending. Magna Global projects national TV ad sales to decline 0.4% for the year full year.\nDespite a strengthening economy, overall ad sales growth in the U.S. has been tepid in the first half of the year – providing further evidence that the ad market is no longer as strongly correlated with the health of the broader market as it has been historically, Mr. Letang said.\nMagna Global now expects U.S. ad revenues to increase 2.2% to $165 billion this year, excluding non-recurring revenue from political and Olympic ad spending, down from its June forecast of 3% growth. Domestic ad spending is expected to accelerate to 3.3% growth for 2016, excluding political and Olympic ad spending, though that’s below Magna Global’s prior projection of 3.8% growth.\nMr. Letang notes that ad revenue growth in the second half of 2015 is projected to fare better than the first half’s 1.6% growth due to easier year-ago comparisons. Digital media ad sales, led by social and video formats, were up 16% in the first six months of the year and are expected to increase at a similar rate for the full year.\nOut-of-home was the only traditional media category to experience ad sales growth, up 4% so far this year, as it continues to benefit from new digital screens and strong growth in the small sector of cinema advertising. Out-of-home ad spending is expected to grow 3.3% for all of 2015, compared to a 3.8% contraction for ad sales across all traditional media types this year.\nWrite to Nathalie Tadena at nathalie.tadena@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:50:56.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
