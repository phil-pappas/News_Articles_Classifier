The role of the financial system is togather money from people and businesses that currently have moremoney than they need and transfer it to those that can use it foreither business or consumer expenditures.

In general, the larger the flow of funds andthe more efficient the financial system, the greater the economicoutput and welfare in the economy. It is not possible to have amodern, complex economy such as that in Australia, without anefficient and sound financial system.
