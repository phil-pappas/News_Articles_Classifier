The Society followed the course through a full semester to understand how the concepts used in the course translate to a similar approach being implemented for professional education by the CPA Center of Excellence®. The Marian course, officially Business 109 but better known as Business Plan Competition, began in 2012. It is believed to be the first course at any college or university in the country to utilize experiential learning, team teaching, and ultimately the planning and development of a real on-campus business selected through a competition at the end of the semester that is funded by investors.\nBusiness 109 - while incorporating accounting, economics and general business planning - stresses and builds foundational skills such as teamwork, leadership, communications and problem solving. It does this through practical applications and team exercises as the course mixes lectures from three different professors with students working in three- or four-person teams, presenting to their classmates, and interacting with other students, professors, administrators and groups on campus throughout the semester.\nIn just three years, it has been found to effectively build the so-called “soft” skills in students often found previously lacking, as well as create enthusiasm for business and their future course work. It has also given students the confidence to succeed, prepare for the job world, and strengthen their résumés with some of the real-life experiences gained through participation in the class.\nThe CPA Center of Excellence® is also developing innovative changes to CPA continuing professional education. CPAs in most states including Indiana are required to take a series of continuing education courses in order to renew their CPA license every three years. The CPA Center of Excellence®, established in 2014, has quickly become a leader in the development of new learning opportunities for CPAs based on the core competencies of the CPA profession (i.e. \"soft\" skills), experiential learning and a competency-based approach.\nThe Society prepared an article for its magazine, CPA IN Perspective, about the course and produced a video posted on its YouTube channel that includes interviews with Marian administrators, instructors and students. The goal is to generate understanding and support among INCPAS members for this type learning approach as it mirrors much of the work being done by the CPA Center of Excellence®.\nFor more information about the CPA Center of Excellence®, go to cpacoe.com .
