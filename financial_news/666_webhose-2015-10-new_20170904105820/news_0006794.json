Excluding car sales, total sales fell by 0.3pc compared with the previous month, according to the US Census Bureau . \nRevisions to previous data painted a darker picture of the US economy, with August's 0.4pc rise in sales nudged down to 0.2pc, and July's 0.6pc gain amended to 0.5pc. \nA strengthening dollar and weak inflation have kept the costs of goods low, weighing on retail sales' value growth. Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said that, as a result, \"slowing sales don’t necessarily imply slowing real consumption\", as volumes could still be rising. \nThe data come as the US Federal Reserve continues to mull over an interest rate rise, as it weighs the impact of a slowing Chinese economy and inflation that is well below target. \nMinutes of its September rate-setting meeting showed that the central bank was worried that emerging weakness could hit US exports and cause the dollar to appreciate further, reducing growth and inflation. \nPaul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said that the retail figures \"support our view that the Fed probably isn't going to hike interest rates until early next year\". \nTraders believe that there is just a 30.4pc chance of a Fed rate hike by the end of the year, believing that one will arrive in March instead. The central bank has kept its interest rates close to zero since 2008. \nCapital Economics now believes that US GDP rose by just 0.5pc in the third quarter of the year. \nAs a result, the US central bank might hold off on interest rate rises for longer, believing that tighter policy would hinder efforts to get the economy running at full speed. \nJames Knightley, an economist at ING, said that analysts would need to see \"a very strong labour report next month to give them any confidence the Fed will hike in December\". \nDisheartening jobs figures revealed that the US added just 142,000 jobs in September , well below the 201,000 expected by forecasters. The economy would need to generate far more jobs in October to reignite hopes of higher rates (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:38:54.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
