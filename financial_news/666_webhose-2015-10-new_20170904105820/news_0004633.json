Andrew Meares by Joanna Mather Superannuation is the place where bucketloads of money collide with age-old ideological divides: the union movement versus the big end of end of town; Labor versus Liberal and the retirement savings of at least 8 million workers.\nAs Australian Council of Trade Unions president Ged Kearney says, the $2 trillion (and growing) super system which includes the savings of 8 million Australians is the \"biggest wealth management game in town\".\nWhich is why super was central to the recommendations of the financial system inquiry led by banker David Murray, and to the government's response last week.\nThere is a lot of detail but one big idea of principle is that the government has accepted the recommendation by the FSI, that the purpose of superannuation should be written into law. Defining the purpose of super is important because, as Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer noted, \"so much hangs off that\".\nWhile most agree super should be for the provision of income in retirement, there are more complex questions to be answered, such as how much does a person need for a comfortable retirement? And what level of tax concessions should be afforded to super? Should people who will never claim the pension receive tax breaks for retirement saving?\nSuper contributions are taxed at 15 per cent, which is a great deal for anybody who pays the top marginal rate of 39Â¢. But as the Grattan Institute has noted, some of these concessions go to people who would save for an independent retirement anyway. The final report of the FSI also picked up on the equity theme, saying only $1 in every $200 of the cost of super tax concessions goes to the bottom 20 per cent of income earners, whereas more than half goes to the top 20 per cent.\nSuper is tax-free once a person reaches retirement age. Senior government ministers have talked about the need to reduce reliance on the age pension in reference to a definition for super. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia said last week the definition should disavow wealth creation and estate planning. Others have proposed a $2.5 million lifetime cap on contributions.\nUnlike his predecessor Tony Abbott, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has not ruled out changes to super tax concessions.\n Departed treasurer Joe Hockey threw a cat among the pigeons when he used his valedictory speech last week to say tax breaks on super should be carefully pared back. Tellingly, even Arnold Bloch Leibler senior Mark Leibler, well known as an adviser to the rich and powerful, said more or less the same.\nIt is interesting to note that before they were rolled in September, Abbott and Hockey were inclined to cap borrowing for property within self-managed super funds, another key recommendation of the FSI.\nThe FSI final report said: \"The GFC highlighted the benefits of Australia's largely unleveraged superannuation sector.\"\nBut Treasurer Scott Morrison said there was insufficient evidence to support an immediate ban on borrowing.\n\"The information collected on this doesn't lead us towards that conclusion at this point,\" he said.\nThe Turnbull administration rejected the proposal, although the situation will be monitored by regulators.\nUnions sense attack Back to the ideological battleground. The Coalition government has two particular changes to super in play that rankle the union movement.\nFirst, it wants to pass legislation requiring the boards of all super funds to have a minimum of one-third independent directors and an independent chair from July 2017. An extra requirement is that by July 2019 funds that do not move to a majority of independent directors will have to justify their decision.\nThe regulator says it wants to bring super funds into line with other parts of the financial services and corporate sector, where the wisdom is that independence is best. The ACTU reckons it's an attack on the legally enshrined presence of union representatives on the boards of super funds.\nThe second change is what the government describes as bringing competition and choice to the area of default super. It wants to break the near monopoly that industry super funds have enjoyed in the default space. The government's FSI response includes asking the Productivity Commission to \"immediately develop alternative models for a formal competitive process for allocating default fund members to products\".\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said the super system should be about individuals and their choices, not a \"traded commodity of industrial bargains\".\nWriting in The Australian Financial Review on Friday, ACTU president Ged Kearney characterised the situation as \"a contest between a sector that believes in driving the investment of funds for shareholders' profits and to benefit finance industry executives versus a group tasked under a not-for-profit model to achieve the best for members' money\".\nThe new governance requirements will have the biggest effect on industry, public sector and corporate super funds because they mostly operate under what is known as an equal representation model. That is, half of the board positions are filled by employer nominees and the other half by union nominees.\nThat change brought about by the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Governance) Bill 2015 will tear at the heart of arrangements that have delivered better results for account holders, according to the ACTU and Industry Super Australia.\nThe other part of the industry is made up of retail funds, which are owned by banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions. Banks and life insurers have been required by Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) standards to have a majority of independent directors and an independent chair since 2006.\nThe wisdom is that more independent directors mean better decision-making and therefore safer keeping of people's money. \"As a result of this bill, the governance of super fund boards will move from an outdated model that has applied since 1993 to an international best practice model whereby at least one-third of directors are independent,\" Ms O'Dwyer has said.\nThe 2003 Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) governance council guidelines recommended that the majority of directorships on listed company boards be filled by independent directors. Any company that fails to comply must disclose this fact in its annual report. Guidelines are one thing, but it's a whole other ball game with something written into law, says Eva Scheerlinck, the head of governance with the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), which calls itself the peak body for the $650 billion not-for-profit super sector.\n\"The trustee bill requires by law that super funds have one-third independent directors and an independent chair,\" she said. \"There is no such law for ASX companies.\"\nAIST says boards should have the flexibility to appoint independent directors but it objects to the setting of a quota and the push to \"abolish the legislative basis for equal representation\" and the need for the chair to be filled according to the bill's overly prescriptive definition of independent.\nBy default The other issue is the system for choosing so-called default funds which are offered to workers when they sign up. Today, 122 awards mostly list between two and 10 default funds. Most of this money, estimated by the Productivity Commission to involve least $6 billion and potentially more than $9 billion in 2010, continues to flow to industry super funds. On top of this, some union-negotiated collective agreements direct contributions to one default fund. While most workers can choose their fund, the PC estimates that 75 per cent of compulsory contributions flow to defaults. That's why being listed as a default fund is so valuable.\n\"One of the options here which is very possible out of what we do with the Productivity Commission is the individual would be able to select from a potential menu of various funds so it doesn't just come down to one,\" Mr Morrison explained on ABC radio. \"And the other area is to ensure that there can't be enterprise agreements which lock people out of funds, which currently you can do.\n\"I mean, the unions can get together with whoever they're dealing with and they can say that your super, your mandatory super has to go into a particular fund. Now that's just not on and we're going to stop it.\"\nIn 2010, under the Labor government, a review recommended the development of MySuper products, which would be no-frills accounts focusing on optimising investment returns and reducing overall costs.\nThe PC was asked to looked at the issue of how to give non-industry funds a better shot at having their MySuper products listed as defaults. It recommended a panel be set up within the Fair Work Commission to come up with a shortlist of funds for each award.\nThis occurred in 2012 but things have since gone awry, with the panel being disbanded by a court over conflict of interest allegations brought by the Financial Services Council, which lobbies on behalf of the retail super sector. It wants all approved MySuper products to be able to compete for default superannuation contributions, and for employers to be able to choose those defaults.\nThe governance legislation has yet to be passed by the Senate and it is unclear whether the government will have the cross-bench support it needs.\nAs it happened, APRA member Helen Rowell gave a speech to an industry audience on the same day last week as the government provided its formal FSI response. Ms Rowell went into bat for the governance changes and was accused of dabbling in political advocacy.\n\"Independent directors broaden the skills and capabilities that can be brought to the board table, and improve decision-making by bringing an objective perspective to issues the board considers,\" she said. \"I have been quite disappointed ... by some of the commentary on the proposed changes and the assertions being made regarding the consequences that may flow from them.\"\nMs Rowell went on to blast segments of the industry for promulgating what she said were fallacies about superior member returns and fees by industry funds. \"On a number of occasions in the last few years I have noted that comparisons of investment performance at fund level is not comparing apples with apples,\" she said, adding that figures for 2015 showed that when MySuper products went head to head, fees and returns were roughly on par no matter whether offered by retail or industry funds.\nIndustry Super Australia rubbished that claim. \"When it comes to returns, the average annualised MySuper return for March 2013 to June 2015, the result for industry funds is 8.58 per cent versus 7.68 per cent for retails â a difference of 90 basis points,\" chief executive David Whiteley says. \"While proposals to change the face of industry super funds may suit the bank-owned super funds, it will risk member's super savings.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:07:48.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
