Share on twitter by Jacob Greber A high-profile economist suggests new doubt about the reliability of official employment statistics means there should be another cut in official interest rates.\nAfter damning comments by former Australian Bureau of Statistics chief Bill McLennan published in Thursday's The Australian Financial Review, Citigroup's Josh Williamson said the Reserve Bank of Australia would be wrong to rely on official labour force data to justify its current neutral stance.\n\"We have been regular critics of the quality of the new labour force data for over a year now,\" Mr Williamson said. \"But the RBA has used the labour force data to paint a picture of an economy that is probably doing better than the official national accounts would suggest.\"\nThe bureau reported that the jobless rate held at 6.2 per cent in September, after a fall in total employment of 5100, which was slightly weaker than expectations. Overall year-on-year growth in employment continues to trend at about 2 per cent.\nMr Williamson said alternative measures of the labour market, such as Newstart Allowance payments, indicate the reality is weaker than official figures show.\n\"When you add that to the fact the Australian dollar has picked up and financial conditions are still on the restrictive side of neutral … the RBA needs to cut rates again,\" he said.\nMr McLennan, the nation's former top statistician, criticised the cash-strapped bureau, saying the results of the past six months of labour force data \"aren't worth the paper they're written on\".\nBadly damaged He called on the bureau to stop making seasonal adjustments to its core figures for up to five years to restore their public credibility, which was badly damaged after changes were made in early 2014, including to survey questions.\nThis has had the effect, Mr McLennan said, of creating a break in the series that should have been tested properly through the use of a parallel survey using the old methodology. He said again on Thursday the current methodology would be ultimately unsustainable and the bureau would be forced to stop and rebuild.\nAn analysis by National Australia Bank senior economist Ivan Colhoun suggests 2015's seasonal adjustment pattern for July, August and September appears consistent with the pattern that existed before 2014.\nWild swings in the data in mid-2014 prompted the bureau to announce a review of its methodology, which produced 16 recommendations, all of which were adopted.\n\"This year's July-August-September pattern looks relatively similar to, if perhaps a little weaker than, the seasonal patterns that existed prior to last year,\" Mr Colhoun said. \"We conclude that there is no significant 'issue' to suggest that today's labour force numbers are very rogue.\"\nAlongside renewed concern about the quality of data, economists were split over what the latest jobs result meant for official interest rates.\nKeep rates unchanged Mr Colhoun said while Thursday's data would encourage those arguing in favour of another Reserve Bank rate cut, he cautioned that the central bank was still more likely to gauge developments and keep rates unchanged for now.\nThe results, which were followed by a modest rise in the dollar to US73.45¢, left analysts divided over the need for another official rate cut.\nExpectations for further Reserve Bank monetary policy easing have grown in recent days, following Westpac Bank's decision on Wednesday to hike its mortgage rates and renewed concerns about delays to the US Federal Reserve's \"lift-off\".\nMr Colhoun also looked at the employment figures over July, August and September, saying the seasonal pattern looked relatively similar, if perhaps a little weaker, than the patterns that existed before 2014, when the changes were made.\nMr Colhoun, who said there appeared to be no evidence to suggest the September's figures \"are very rogue,\" he cast doubt over the sudden gain in employment reported for South Australia.\nANZ Bank senior economist Justin Fabo said the jobless rate was likely to remain about 6.25 per cent for some time, with the rate of jobs growth to slow, given soft domestic and global backdrops.\n\"The significant support to jobs growth from the labour-intensive services sector is expected to wane amid less support from housing activity and the lower currency,\" said Mr Fabo, whose bank predicts two more rate cuts in the first half of 2016, when a jobless rate of more than 6 per cent will \"ultimately prove to be too uncomfortable for the bank\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:54:35.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
