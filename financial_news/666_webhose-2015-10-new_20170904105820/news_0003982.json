AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe American technology icons Amazon, Microsoft and Google's newly named entity Alphabet delivered strong financial results, lifting investor confidence and undercutting talk of a tech bubble.\nThe share prices of the three tech firms surged in after hours trading in the US on Thursday, as investors applauded their earnings in the early stages of US profit reporting season.\nAmazon's stock hit an all time all when it soared 10 per cent to $US624, Alphabet jumped 9 per cent and Microsoft gained 7 per cent, reversing recent pullbacks that were predicated on concerns of frothiness in tech stocks.\n\"There was just so much negativity months ago,\" said Ross Kawasaki, chief executive of Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management.\n\"It just proves the premise that these large, amazing tech companies in America have so much potential.\"\nMore broadly, global stock markets lifted on the back of European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi signalling he would expand its â‚¬1.1 trillion quantitative easing program in December.\nThe US S&P 500 gained 1.66 per cent to 2052.51, the Euro Stoxx jumped 2.47 per cent to 3353.11 and the UK's FTSE 100 rose 0.44 per cent to 6,376.28 on Thursday.\nBlue chip stocks McDonald's, Dow Chemical and EBay also rose strongly on Thursday as investors responded to better than anticipated profit reports, putting the US share market on track for a fourth straight week of gains, after a correction in September.\n Heading into reporting season, consensus estimates for the third quarter earnings per share for S&P 500 companies was for a 4 per cent year-on-year decline, the first back-to-back quarterly fall since 2009.\nAnalysts are now reassessing those forecasts in light of some blue chip companies delivering stronger than anticipated results.\nAlphabet, recently installed as the parent company of Google to separate its cash-machine search and advertising businesses from risky \"moonshot\" projects, was boosted by a $US5.1 billion share buyback.\nMore internet users are clicking on Google advertisements. Paid clicks jumped 23 per cent. Net profit for the September quarter was $US4.7 billion, or $US7.35 a share, ahead of predictions of $US7.21.\nNew Alphabet chief financial officer, former Wall Street banker Ruth Porat, is winning support from exerting cost control, better managing capital and introducing new transparency into the company's earnings.\nAlphabet's cash stash rose to $US73 billion, more than half of which is parked in lower tax jurisdictions outside the US.\nOnline retailer Amazon reported a rare profit of $US79 million on revenue of $US25.4 billion, partly due to its expanding cloud-computing division. Amazon is still investing in rapid expansion of its warehouses and other projects, so it usually turns a loss.\nAmazon's share price surge propelled founder Jeff Bezos to become America's third-richest person, Bloomberg reported. Mr Bezos is worth an estimated $US55 billion, ranking behind Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett.\nAmazon has introduced four new tablets, including Fire. \"For the first time, we're recommending you bring home a six-pack for the whole family,\" Mr Bezos said. \"At a price of $50 for one or $250 for a six-pack, Fire sets a new bar for what customers should expect from a low-cost tablet.\"\nComputer and software manufacturer Microsoft, now considered an \"old\" tech company, unveiled a September quarter profit of $US4.62 billion, above the $US4.54 billion from a year earlier. The company is grappling with the consumer and business shift to mobile and cloud technology and away from hardware like personal computers.\nOther tech giants Apple and Facebook are yet to report their results.\nMcDonald's turnaround strategy to arrest a sales slump appears to be paying early dividends. Its US restaurant sales rose 0.9 per cent in the third quarter and its share price jumped 8 per cent to an all-time closing high.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:05:09.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
