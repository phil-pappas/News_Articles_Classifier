Strauss-Kahn quit the firm just days before Leyne's death and accused his former associate of \"excessive borrowing.\"   US cancels drilling rights auctions in Alaskan Arctic AFP \nThe United States has announced it is calling off two auctions for oil and gas drilling rights in the Arctic off â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:00:08.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
