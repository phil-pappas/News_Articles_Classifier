But Iraq continues to provide numerous opportunities for corruption, both large and small. Kate Geraghty Share on twitter by Mark Lawson When a trial involving a former chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Trevor Flugge, over payments allegedly made to the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein started in Melbourne last week, international observers might have thought Australia was finally making some progress in enforcing anti-corruption laws.\nBut a closer look at the proceedings reveals that this is a civil case brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission alleging breaches of Flugge's duties as a director. Although the 2005 Cole Inquiry heard that the AWB transferred $US225 million to the Hussein government, all criminal proceedings were dropped long ago, with a major barrier being the complicated law in this area.\nDespite the vast sums involved, the only other action over what was obviously a major case after 15 years has been two civil cases resulting in fines against other senior executives of AWB, all for more than $15 million in legal costs run up by ASIC.\nIt's time to clean up Australia's anti-corruption act, particularly as other countries – notably the UK and the US – are widely acknowledged as having forged ahead in this area, and one way of achieving the reforms necessary may come from an ongoing Senate committee inquiry.\nKicked off by Labor senator Sam Dastyari, key crossbenchers and the Greens in March, the spark for the Foreign Bribery Inquiry was ostensibly allegations that Leighton paid tens of millions of dollars to win an Iraqi oil pipeline contract and reports that BHP-Billiton badly overstepped the mark in hospitality and gifts given in Cambodia as part of its sponsorship of a 2008 Beijing Olympics sponsorship deal.\nCommentators have noted that another possible motive for Senator Dastyari and others involved is to find ways to potentially embarrass the government or its supporters. However, as shown by submissions to the inquiry, which closed in September, and specific allegations aside, everyone can agree that the issue needs major reform. That reform should include a reworking of the criminal law, which, among other problems, requires intent to be proven in different ways for different parts of the offence.\nAnother clear theme of the submissions is that there should be a major shift in the enforcement approach, preferably to something closer to the model of the UK bribery act. In that approach, a company in which corrupt activity has occurred is automatically liable, unless the company can show that it has encouraged compliance with the law, and encouraged an anti-corruption culture.\nIn other words, in Australia the onus of proof should be reversed, albeit for what would still be a civil action.\n Frank O'Toole, a senior partner at Deloitte, which compiles a survey of corruption in major companies, told The Australian Financial Review that often the serious cases of bribery were the result of rogue executives, or perhaps a group of executives in an overseas office paying bribes without anyone else in the company being aware of it.\n\"Those individuals would still be pursued with criminal charges, but a great deal more could be done with the UK approach of making the company liable for corrupt activities, with the company able to defend itself by proving that it has undertaken strong anti-corruption programs,\" he said.\nThose procedures have to be clarified, but may include education programs and complaint-handling or whistle-blowing procedures.\nMuch goes unreported A lot of bribery goes unreported. The Deloitte survey found that one-third of all companies operating in high-risk destinations, including Asia, Africa and the Middle East, had uncovered a suspected bribery or corruption incident in the past five years. However, 40 per cent of the 250 executives surveyed said they did not have, or did not know if they had, a formal compliance program in place to manage corruption risk. Deloitte has also revealed that it has investigated at least 100 potentially illegal acts involving local firms in the past two years. Only a handful of those incidents has been reported to the police.\nJustin McDonnell, a partner, and Natalie Canton, a special counsel, with King & Wood Mallesons, said one reason companies were reluctant to report such incidents was that there were no guarantees about just what would happen in the subsequent enforcement action.\nMcDonnell and Canton do not recommend the UK approach, but they point out that there is no formal guidance for companies on the benefits of self-reporting.\nAt the moment the police can't tell companies what will happen as there's no guarantee the courts will respect any deal they strike with the company, McDonnell said.\nThis is a world away from the notably effective US system of deferred prosecutions, where the regulatory agency strikes a deal with the company to undertake corrective action, and usually pay a fine, in exchange for the agency refraining from prosecution. The agency reserves the right to prosecute if the conditions of the deal are not met. BHP Billiton's hospitality case, for example, was effectively settled by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an $A31.6 million and agreed remedial action after six years of investigation.\nAs the King & Wood Mallesons submission also notes, there should be formal guidance for what constitutes a compliant corporate culture, guidance on the limits of hospitality offerings, and guidance on the use of facilitation payments.\nThese payments involve small payments to officials for work that would be undertaken anyway, such as connection of phone lines or processing of approvals, and are legal albeit with confusion over what constitutes such payments. They were discussed extensively in submissions, with many submissions favouring the defence's retention.\nBut one organisation that wants the facilitation payment defence removed, as well as strong action on what it calls \"grand corruption\" – that is, big-ticket bribery involving senior bureaucrats and politicians – is Transparency International Australia.\nZero tolerance TIA executive director Michael Ahrens says there should be zero tolerance for bribery, including rejection of the usual excuses for paying bribes.\nOne excuse is that the company simply would not win business in some jurisdictions without paying bribes, but Ahrens says the company and the deal should be \"good enough\" to win the deal without having to pay the bribe. It should be a matter of the company lifting its performance.\nAt the same time, the government should encourage companies to proactively fix issues, by fostering a culture where not only is the letter of the law followed but there is the spirit to do the right thing, he said.\nAs the TIA submission to the inquiry points out, at the moment personal incentives and rewards will often run counter to compliance with company policy.\n\"There are very few bonus programs which take into account the need not to bid or to walk away when bribes are being demanded. To refuse to pay and conform to the company policy, although moral, may not stand up against the need to maximise one's earnings.\"\nAnother strong recommendation made by TIA is to penalise false accounting, specifically a \"failure to record accurately the payment of a bribe\" offence in the criminal code. This is to prevent businesses recording bribes as legitimate expenses such as commissions or consulting fees.\nA similar offence under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act does not take into account the size of the transaction, Prosecutions have involved cases of misreported large bribes and widespread inaccurate recording of small payments, TI's submission said.\nWith international trade expanding, temptations to offer bribes, however they are reported in the books, will become more frequent. In a corruptions perceptions index survey run by TIA, more than two-thirds of the countries surveyed rank below 50 in the index, as opposed to the 80 scored by Australia and the 92 of the index leader, Denmark.\nWhile the Senate inquiry continues – it is due to report by July next year and may hold hearings in December – the authorities have not been idle. Cases involving Reserve Bank affiliated companies Securency and Note Printing Australia over alleged corrupt payments to officials in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia are ongoing, and subject to a suppression order.\nThis case has also claimed the only bribery scalp anyone can think of, that of David Ellery, a former chief financial officer of Securency, who has pleading guilty to a charge of false accounting over a $79,000 payment to a Malaysian arms dealer in 2012. He has agreed to testify against others involved.\nAn inter-agency Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre hosted by the Australian Federal Police has also started operations, and in March charged two executives of construction company Lifese with offences involving attempts to bribe Iraqi officials to gain construction contracts.\nThe police are understood to have another dozen more investigations ongoing, but that may just scratch the surface and if previous efforts are any guide will be greatly hampered by the complicated law in this area. Reform has now become a matter of urgency.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@horrid91"], "published": "2015-10-26T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:10:54.671+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
