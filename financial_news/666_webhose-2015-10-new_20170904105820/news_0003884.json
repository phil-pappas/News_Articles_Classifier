Last month, he cut the official cash rate to 2.75 percent.\nNew Zealand’s dollar fell after his comments, as traders increased bets Wheeler will lower the benchmark again on Oct. 29. It bought 66.45 U.S. cents at 9:47 a.m. in Wellington from 66.65 cents immediately before the release.\nA majority of economists forecast the Reserve Bank will lower rates this month as economic growth slows and inflation remains below the 1 percent to 3 percent band that Wheeler targets. A report Friday will show consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in the year through September, according to the median forecast from a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.\nThe RBNZ “remains conscious of the impact that low interest rates can have on housing demand and its potential to feed into higher price inflation,” Wheeler said, indicating the issues that might moderate the push to lower rates. “It is important also to consider whether borrowing costs are constraining investment, and the need to have sufficient capacity to cut interest rates if the global economy slows significantly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:19:21.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
