Openness and the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour make economies more dynamic, efficient and productive. Economic integration is a good thing, and tearing down barriers boosts competition, innovation and GDP per capita. That is the real message to take away from the Bank of England’s paper on our membership of the EU. \nYet this basic proposition - which isn’t original, even if the arguments and data are often novel and fascinating - doesn’t actually tell us very much about whether or not we should be part of the EU. A country can enjoy all of the benefits outlined by the Bank and be outside of the EU, in practice and in theory. We could belong to the European Economic Area , or a different, as yet uninvented, relationship. Sadly, that point isn’t made in the paper: it conflates membership of the single market and membership of the EU throughout, a basic and unforgivable error. \nSo when the Bank says that “to the extent it increases economic and financial openness, EU membership reinforces the dynamism of the UK economy”, what it really means is that “single market membership” improves our economy. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) that is contestable: it may be that the UK could withdraw from the legal structure formally known as the single market and yet still engage fully with it, as a result of an a la carte, yet-to-be negotiated arrangement that retains all of the integration advantages detailed in the Bank of England’s report. Carney’s speech was not pro-EU membership - it was pro Four Freedoms and economic integration with the EU. Even then, it highlighted downsides with some EU policies. \nThe BoE's paper on membership of the EU \nThis lack of definitional clarity on such an important issue is a great shame, for the report contains a good summary of the research on economic growth and integration, as well as many useful facts and figures. \nOne that may surprise some readers is that trade as a share of GDP hasn’t gone up that much. In 1973, the Bank points out, UK imports and exports were worth 40pc of UK GDP; by 2014, they had reached 60pc of GDP. There is a good reason for this, however: the prices of tradeable goods have fallen relative to that of non-tradables - in other words, trade volumes have grown much more quickly than its value. \nLess surprising, the financial system was worth 100pc of GDP in 1958, against 830pc in 2014. Unlike some people, I’m not bothered by this: we simply need robust resolution mechanisms to deal with any failures in the sector without jeopardising the rest of the economy or picking the pockets of taxpayers. But less than half of the financial sector’s overall size is accounted for by banking (now around 410pc of GDP); it turns out that insurance firms, pension funds and other financial institutions together account for 420pc of GDP. Finance accounts for 65pc of the UK services sector’s £89bn trade surplus. \nPerhaps most interesting of all are figures that show that a 1pc drop in GDP in an EU country leads to a 0.6pc fall in consumption in that nation; in the US, Canada or Germany, a 1pc fall in GDP in one of the states, provinces or Lander leads to a drop of just 0.2pc. Intriguingly, the issue is not a lack of fiscal redistribution, which is actually not that large outside Canada, but is caused by insufficient risk sharing in capital markets. A secondary reason is labour mobility: some 2.5pc of Americans move to a different state annually, just 0.3pc of EU citizens change EU country every year. Food for thought - but no endorsement for the political (as opposed to market) relationship between the UK and the EU. \n= Tax madness = \nIf you think taxes are too high today, spare a thought for the post-war generation. \nToday’s framework is far from perfect but those seeking to build businesses in the 40 years from the outbreak of the Second World war had a much tougher time. The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) reminds us of the nihilistic regime imposed in 1947-48 by the Labour government: a “special contribution” was required on incomes of more than £2,000 a year, with a 50pc tax slapped on investment income above £5,000. As the IEA points out, if one considers the 45pc rate of income tax and the 52.5pc surtax, the effective top rate of tax was a demented 147.5pc. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was even worst for investment income, which in the Marxist worldview of the time was dismissed as “unearned”: anybody unfortunate enough to make £8,000 a year in this way was hit by income tax of 41.25pc, a surtax of 50pc and a total effective top rate of tax of 136.25pc. \nFew people want to work when the state grabs the bulk of their income or gains; absolutely nobody will do anything if they have to pay money to the taxman for the privilege of being successful. These sorts of tax rates led to a massive destruction of capital. \nThe IEA also notes that capital transfer tax (a forerunner of inheritance tax that also hit lifetime gifts, albeit at half the rate, on death) and estate duty were set at extortionate rate of up to 75pc during the post-war, pre-Thatcher era. For years, the tax helped to destroy family assets, including, most destructively, businesses. The Tories cut the top rate to 40pc; crucially, they made business and farming assets tax-free. \nBy the standards of the day, that was radical and much welcome. But as the free-market think-tank rightly asks, why do we still levy the tax at all while so many other countries have stopped doing so? The dreaded equivalent of inheritance tax was axed in 1972 in Canada, 1979 in Australia, 1981 in Israel, 2006 in Hong Kong, 2008 in Singapore, Sweden and Austria and last year in Norway. The UK is falling behind in terms of policies that allow capital to cascade from one generation to the next. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:59:50.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
