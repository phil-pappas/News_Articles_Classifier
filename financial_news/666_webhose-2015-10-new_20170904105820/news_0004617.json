Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Matt King has been telling his loyal followers for longer than they care to remember about the hidden monsters that lurk in the credit markets. Now Citi's star credit strategist fears theses monsters are joining forces, with potentially devastating consequences for global markets.\n\"All the work I have done over the last four or five years on bond market illiquidity, central banks inflating money and 'tourist' money in emerging markets risks coming together in an unholy trinity,\" Mr King told The Australian Financial Review on the sidelines of Citi's annual investment conference.\n\"We don't know it's definitely going to do that, but there are disturbing ways in which all of this seems to be coming together.\"\nMr King said investors had \"been herded into assets they don't believe in\", buying assets in the hope they could get out before anyone else.\nBut markets were changing, he said. Prices were no longer \"mean-reverting\" in an orderly way. Now, in a world where liquidity was challenged, prices \"go up and up and up and fall back catastrophically\", whether it was gold, Chinese stocks or German bonds.\nInvestors were growing fearful on the prospects of emerging markets as China's economy stalled . Mr King said one could make a case that money coming out of emerging markets was the equivalent to global tightening of financial conditions.\nHe pointed to a surprisingly high link between emerging market foreign exchange reserves and growth in the G20 economies, suggesting the fortunes of developed and emerging economies were one and the same.\nPrices had fallen sharply Much of the pain in emerging markets was reflected in commodity markets, where prices had fallen sharply, which had consequences for credit markets, he said.\n\"The world geared up for a period of extended higher demand and that was based on unsustainable credit expansion in emerging markets, which is slowing down quite sharply. As such we are left with massive overcapacity.\"\nMr King said 2015 was telling in that almost every asset class, whether it was stocks or bonds, had returned close to zero.\n\"Whatever you did, at some point blew up at you. Central banks have been forcing people to reach for yield but one at a time are discovering it's not such a good idea.\"\nThat was Mr King's central warning â€“ that the limit of central bank powers \"to prop up the world through a series of credit bubbles\" had been reached.\nCentral banks' power over financial markets was also waning, he said. It most certainly existed. The $US4 trillion of Federal Reserve stimulus boosted the sharemarket's value by $US10 trillion. But now investors \"see the effects on growth have not been as positive as hoped\".\n\"With this realisation, we are revisiting the illiquidity problems as people change their minds about where they have invested, and they find they can't get out.\"\nDifficult and expensive The changing structure of financial markets is one of Mr King's key areas of research. For years he has sounded the warning that easy monetary policy and tighter regulation would make it difficult and expensive for investors to sell the assets they had bought during the era of easy money.\nHe was frustrated with regulators who appeared dismissive of the dangers that could arise, even after several warnings such as the flash crashes in stocks and bonds, where large and liquid markets shifted enormously in moments as liquidity dried up.\n\"The regulators have been reluctant to connect these issues together. They want to find the fat finger of the trader in Honslouw.\"\nThis was \"partly mental block\" on behalf of regulators but also a \"deep-seated reluctance to recognise the extent to which extreme monetary policy has had unintended consequences\", he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:05:55.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
