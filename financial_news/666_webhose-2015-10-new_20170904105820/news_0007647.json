Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Dominic White Earlier this year, television industry veteran Bruce Gordon offered to inject up to $100 million of new money into Ten Network Holdings as he positioned himself for possible changes to media ownership laws.\nUnder his proposal, which was revealed by Fairfax Media, the WIN Corporation chairman could have effectively doubled his 14.9 per cent holding in Ten if the government scrapped the so-called \"reach rule\" .\nThe deal would have given him a more powerful say in the merger frenzy that is widely expected if the government scraps the rule, which prevents his regional network WIN Corp from merging with a metropolitan network like Ten.\nHis efforts were thwarted. The Ten board opted instead for a proposed cash injection from all Ten shareholders and Foxtel, a controversial deal that regulators are due to rule on this week.\nNow, operating from his home in Bermuda, the billionaire has turned his attentions to Ten's larger, better-funded rival, Nine Entertainment Co.\nIt is understood that his adviser KPMG approached UBS late last week and made enquiries about buying a 13 per cent stake from US hedge fund Apollo, which has been keen to trim its 22 per cent holding.\nThe 86-year-old sourced the circa-$200 million he would need to buy it, increasing his stake to 14.95 per cent.\nWIN Corp chief Andrew Lancaster was given the job of phoning Nine chief executive David Gyngell and chairman David Haslingden on Tuesday morning.\n Their response is not known and at the time of writing Nine had yet to make a comment.\nSitting with a near-15 per cent stake in both Nine and Ten, the maximum he can acquire under current media laws, Mr Gordon is now in a powerful position if Malcolm Turnbull can get sufficient political and industry support to change the ownership laws.\nMr Gordon believes that Nine, which is trading well below its 2013 listing price of $2.05, is undervalued.\nHe has deep roots in TV and was lifelong friends with Nine's former owner Kerry Packer and Mr Gyngell's father Bruce, who also ran Channel Nine. He rates Mr Gyngell highly.\nAs revealed by Fairfax Media on Sunday Nine directors have approached potential successors to Mr Gyngell amid rising expectations he will not renew his contract when it expires in November 2016 .\nAny power vacuum at Nine could make it more vulnerable to takeover, although it has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector.\nMr Gordon's entry price implies an underlying earnings multiple that is well below the multiple at which he sold WIN's Perth and Adelaide stations to Nine ahead of its 2013 float.\nThat is partly a reflection of the structural issues now facing free-to-air television, worsened by the arrival of over-the-top streaming services such as Netflix.\nBut it's also a symptom of the tough advertising market - Nine shares were hit hard by its profit warning in June of this year .\nNine pressuring WIN Spice has now been added to Nine's push to make WIN to pay higher fees for taking its feed, under their affiliation deal which expires in December.\nAnd as the calls for media reform grow louder in Canberra, the billionaire in Bermuda is holding some of the key cards.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/bruce-gordon-offers-to-pump-100m-into-struggling-ten-20150310-1406p3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nine-shares-tumble-after-earnings-downgrade-20150609-ghjm5u.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nine-starts-hunt-for-david-gyngells-successor-20151015-gkacso", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-10-20T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:03:44.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
