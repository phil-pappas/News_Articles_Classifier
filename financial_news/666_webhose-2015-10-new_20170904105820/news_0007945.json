We also hope to be able to announce the Release 2 timeline next year,\" Watt said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association's annual conference in San Diego.\nIn the program's first stage, or Release 1, the CSP will begin issuing and administering Freddie Mac's securities.\nIn Release 2, the platform will issue and administer bonds for both mortgage agencies using a new single security for the first time, Watt said.\nRight now, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issue and administer their mortgage programs separately.\nSince the housing bust, they and peer Ginnie Mae repackage at least 95 percent of the home loans into bonds annually.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)\nFreddie Mac Melvin Watt Federal Housing Finance Agency mortgage bond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:24:04.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
