Anna Kucera Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The federal government has rejected the Murray review's proposal to ban self-managed superannuation funds from borrowing to buy property.\nBut the use of super for wealth accumulation and transfer could be prohibited and the system's links with union-negotiated workplace agreements will be severed.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said there was insufficient evidence to support an immediate ban on borrowing.\n\"The information collected on this doesn't lead us towards that conclusion at this point,\" he said.\nHowever, regulators would be asked to monitor the situation closely and report their findings to the government, he said.\nThe decision to reject a borrowing ban, which was recommended by the inquiry amid concerns about the stability of the system if property prices crash, will be welcomed by super fund investors.\nThe government will also move quickly to open up the default super system to greater competition from bank-owned funds.\nUnion-negotiated enterprise agreements will no longer be allowed to mandate the use of one particular fund, which will be viewed as an attack on union-aligned industry super funds.\nMr Morrison said it was time to \"end the closed shop when it comes to mandatory superannuation contributions and how they are directed off into funds\".\n The government also appears to have hardened its stance on super governance, in its response to the financial system inquiry, led by former bank chief David Murray.\nIts formal response to the inquiry, released on Tuesday morning, flags the introduction of \"penalty provisions and criminal sanctions for directors who fail to execute their duty to act in the best interests of members\".\nAnd in a measure that will receive near universal approval, the government has pledged to enshrine the objective of the superannuation system into legislation.\nThere have been calls for the government to be explicit that the objective of the super system is to provide retirement income, not to accumulate and transfer wealth.\n\"The objective will be a valuable yardstick against which to measure competing superannuation proposals, providing certainty that measures that do not accord with the objective will be held up to scrutiny,\" the government says.\nA third major government response to the inquiry will be to open up the default super system to competition.\nWhen employees do not nominate a super fund, their contributions are paid into a default fund.\nAs such, this is a steady and lucrative funding stream that is highly sort after by super funds.\nHistorical and industrial factors mean most default super is held by union-aligned industry super funds. Banks have been lobbying for better access to the pie.\nThe government's concern is that limited competition is driving up fees.\nIt will ask Productivity Commission to develop \"alternative models\" for allocating default contributions.\n\"Currently, if you're a worker and you're covered by an enterprise bargaining agreement, you are forced to take the fund that is provided for under the enterprise bargaining agreement,\" Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said.\n\"What we're saying is that the individuals themselves should be able to choose the fund that is right for them, that's right for their family, that's right for their circumstances and they shouldn't be constrained in that choice.\n\"We we will immediately task [the Productivity Commission] with looking at a competitive process. That is what they will be doing immediately and we believe that that can be done in a fairly expeditious manner.\"\nThe inquiry recommended that super fund boards be required by law to have a majority of independent directors.\nThe government has already introduced legislation to fulfil this recommendation, although the requirement will be for one-third independent directors. It is unclear whether this will be passed by the Senate.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:09:04.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
