The summit will address the changing digital landscape, how we live in a moment-driven society, and how marketers can gain a strategic advantage. CMOs, senior brand and digital marketing executives, and agencies will all benefit from a day of discussion and insight as to what this new era of marketing will demand. \nAccording to AdExchanger Research , the majority of marketers are managing at least 20 percent of their ad spend programmatically, but almost two-thirds plan to spend double that much on programmatic over the next 12 months. eMarketer has estimated that programmatic advertising spend will exceed $26.78 billion by 2017. This shift will be game-changing for those who move quickly. \nThe complete agenda for Momentous 2015 will include more than 10 engaging sessions and will address topics such as: \nThe Transformation in Marketing and the Role of Programmatic Future of Programmatic Marketing: Programmatic Everywhere The Adoption of – and Need for – a Data Management Platform Beyond 1:1 – Marketing in the Moment Momentous 2015 is all about programmatic marketing and the people who are leading the transition. The virtual event will feature a number of keynotes and insights from IBM, Marketo, DISH and RPA, among others. In addition, analysts from AdExchanger Research and Forrester Research will discuss the state of the market, the outlook for the future, and the trends that are taking shape in digital marketing. \n“We are hosting Momentous 2015 to spark the conversation around the momentous shifts in our industry,” said Rhonda Shantz, vice president of marketing at Rocket Fuel. “We live in a moment-driven society and marketing must adapt. Programmatic marketing is a key component of ‘what’s next’. Momentous has an incredible agenda of thought-provoking speakers to inform CMOs and digital marketers on new approaches to drive better performance out of their marketing.” \n“The next step in the evolution of digital marketing is reaching an individual with a message that is relevant to him or her,” said Melissa Parrish of AdExchanger Research. “While there is a growing consensus in the industry that programmatic approaches to marketing automation are the leading way to get there, a major roadblock remains: marketer understanding of what programmatic is and how it helps move the 1:1 marketing agenda forward.” \nTo register for Momentous 2015 and have access to a full day of content and industry insights, visit momentous2015 .
