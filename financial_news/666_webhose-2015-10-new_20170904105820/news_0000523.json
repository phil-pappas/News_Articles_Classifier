The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index fell by 0.25 percent.\n\"Asia hasn't really reacted positively to the China rate cut, and what we are seeing is a natural pull-back of markets in Europe,\" said CMC Markets market analyst Jasper Lawler.\n\"Probably, given there is a Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and there have been massive gains last week, I wouldn't be surprised to see the markets chop around,\" he said.\nPeugeot fell 2.3 percent even though it reported a 3.2 percent increase in third-quarter revenue. The stock has gained 59 percent this year.\nTechnology group Philips also fell after reporting results that beat expectations. The shares dropped 2 percent on reports the U.S. government objected to the $3.3 billion sale of its Lumileds division to a mostly Chinese consortium.\nWPP fell 1.5 percent, although the world's largest advertising company said it would meet its full-year forecasts.\nBut Aberdeen Asset Management rose 3.9 percent. A Financial Times report that Aberdeen was looking for a buyer was enough to push the shares higher, although the company denied the report.\nGermany's DAX outperformed other European indexes with a gain of 0.25 percent, helped by strong gains in utility RWE.
