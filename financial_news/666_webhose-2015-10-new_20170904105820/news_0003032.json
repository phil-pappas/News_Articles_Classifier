Stevens himself, who concedes the RBA cannot accurately forecast the future, projected for Parliament that \"it seems very likely global interest rates will still be quite low for quite some time yet\".\nThe RBA's head of economics research, John Simon , dedicated an entire speech this week to arguing that cheap credit is neither predictive of financial crises nor anything to lose sleep over.\n\"Once again, one must ask, why are people so concerned about low interest rates?\" he asked, concluding, \"Low interest rates are a poor indicator of future problems and, given currently weak global growth, entirely appropriate.\"\nComforting stuff.\nA month earlier fellow MIT PhD Guy Debelle questioned whether \"the government bond rate [is] still the appropriate risk-free yield\". I've dedicated many column inches to explaining how efforts by policymakers to suppress government bond yields through tens of trillions of dollars of asset purchases have artificially reduced risk-free rates, which investors use to discount cash flows back to the present. By leaning heavily on the short- and long-term price of money, governments have boosted the value of all assets, including shares, bonds and housing.\nYet Debelle reckons this is no big drama. \"The risk-free yield should approximate the growth rate of the economy,\" he says. \"On that basis, the government bond yield is still doing a pretty good job.\"\nThe empirical pattern had certainly been one where, before the introduction of quantitative easing (QE), long-term rates tended to reflect the economy's sustainable growth pulse.\n The problem is that Australia's 2.7 per cent 10-year government bond yield is way below estimates of \"trend\" growth. Even if we assume that the new normal for trend real GDP growth is, say, just 2.5 per cent (that is, much weaker than the usual threshold of about 3.25 per cent) because of slower population and productivity growth, you still get trend nominal growth of 5 per cent after adding back core inflation.\nThat's almost double the prevailing 10-year risk-free rate, which implies market pricing is off and far removed from the 6 per cent yield that has held on average since 1993.\nDebelle rejects the proposition that central banks' \"extraordinary\" bond purchases have biased risk-free rates and propagated irrationally inflated asset prices in markets that are not clearing. \"Again, I don't see these purchases as distorting the Australian government bond yield, but rather reflecting the reality of the world we live in,\" he says.\nAn indirect RBA case for this \"low rates for long\" meme has also been made by Peter Tulip, who works under Simon in the economics research area. Readers might recall that after alleging Australian housing was \"fairly valued\" in April 2014, Tulip revealed in July 2015 that it had become \"30 per cent undervalued\". He reiterated the assertion several times, explaining that \"the undervaluation of 30 per cent is unusually wide – the widest in at least 30 years\".\nAfter double-digit house price growth between 2013 and 2014, how could Australian bricks and mortar have suddenly become less expensive? \"What has changed since [April last year] is that real long-term interest rates have fallen substantially,\" Tulip clarified. \"That fall made housing more attractive relative to renting, despite the increase in prices.\"\nThe 10-year bond yield had slumped by about a third (or more than five RBA rate cuts). That had a huge impact on Tulip's valuation estimates because he used this yield to benchmark projected borrowing costs.\n'Price of money faked' Matthew McLennan, an Australian who runs $80 billion at First Eagle in New York, says that \"the price of money has been faked through central banks cutting interest rates to artificially low levels\". McLennan characterises the \"yield curve in the US is a seriously distorted entity\" as a result of QE and asks: \"How can you expect to have a proper allocation of scarce capital to its most productive purpose when the price of the money has been faked?\"\nYet the RBA's Simon contends that the central bank's easy monetary policy settings are \"entirely appropriate\". In contrast to McLennan, he does not think that record-low rates will skew savings and investment decisions in a way that causes imbalances. \"Low interest rates are implicated in the formation of property and financial bubbles,\" Simon acknowledges. \"People think that low rates are associated with greater asset price, and hence financial, volatility. But looking at the breadth of history suggests there is no particular link between interest rates and financial or asset price instability.\"\nHe maintains that \"there are many periods when interest rates have been low and excessive risk taking has not occurred. Indeed, low interest rates have been a more common feature of the financial system over time than high interest rates – which are very much an aberration related to the 1970s and their aftermath.\"\nSimon neglects to mention four fundamental, and interrelated, differences between the world today and that which prevailed before the 1970s: the removal of the \"gold standard\" and the introduction of non-asset-backed \"fiat money\" underwritten only by the credibility of governments; the surge in public- and private-sector debt since that time; the arrival of sustained consumer price inflation (now actively fostered by policymakers), mostly absent before the 1970s; and the establishment of central banks for the purpose of guaranteeing the liquidity of highly leveraged (read fragile) private banks and the development of \"risk-free\" funding via deposits, which has radically multiplied the quantity of money and credit throughout the economy.\nIt is spurious to suggest that the paucity of links between low rates and financial crises before the 1970s, when there was scant private debt, means that the orders-of-magnitude-higher debt levels today coupled with even cheaper money is A-OK. You cannot divorce prices from quantities: interest rates are simply the cost of borrowing credit.\nOne of the main reasons there was much lower credit creation by banks before the 1970s was because currencies were tied to commodities (commonly via the gold standard) and \"fiat\" money, or currency that derives its value from political assurances, was not the norm. In 1973 an ounce of gold was worth US$42. Today the same gold costs US$1145.\nEvery single documented high-inflation episode has correlated with governments discarding asset-backed money and using their monopoly over the printing press to manufacture vast volumes of costless fiat currency to finance burgeoning budget deficits. This, incidentally, is what is happening today. Beyond central banks printing fiat money to buy public bonds, we have had the more subtle development since the global financial crisis whereby banks are required to hold much larger quantities of \"liquid assets\" in the form of government bonds. In Australia alone banks have to buy $195 billion of government bonds, which further inflates prices and suppresses yields.\nCelebrated academics Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff showed in 2013 that sustained consumer price inflation only emerged in the second half of the 20th century following the embrace of fiat money: \"[historically] high inflation was . . . a relatively rare phenomenon associated with wars and their immediate aftermath\". In 1913 consumer prices \"were only about 20 per cent higher than in 1775 and around 40 per cent lower than in 1813\".\nThey argue that inflation has been \"dominated by the abandonment of the gold standard in 1933 and the adoption of fiat money subsequently. One hundred years after its creation, consumer prices are about 30 times higher than what they were in 1913.\"\nFiat money combined with central-bank-backed banks that can source more (government-guaranteed) funding more cheaply than other businesses has fuelled explosive credit creation. This is illustrated by comparing money defined as \"M1\", which is physical currency, with money known as \"M3\", which is currency plus deposits (noting also that deposits lead to loans). In 1959, M3 was 8.7 times the size of M1. After exponential growth since the 1970s, M3 is now 28 times M1. Alongside declining interest rates during the 1990s, bank-driven credit creation has pushed household debt from 63 per cent of disposable incomes in 1988 to 186 per cent today.\nSimon thinks 3.9 per cent home loan rates are no big deal because \"credit growth is generally low\". In August the RBA reported that credit had expanded at a \"modest\" 6 per cent annual pace. Yet judging credit growth in isolation to the quantity of credit and incomes is meaningless. Credit growth is running four times faster than wage growth and twice the rate of national incomes. Given that the debt-to-income ratio is at an all-time high, that sounds worrying to me.\nThis muddling may be a function of the RBA's mixed mandate. It has the tricky task of being responsible for price stability, full employment and financial stability, when these goals frequently conflict. It has justified slashing rates to support employment, yet ended up blowing a mega-housing-bubble. Institutionally resistant to self-criticism, it now claims houses are cheap, rising debt-to-income ratios are sustainable, and interest rates are \"appropriate\".\nInvestors need to recognise the RBA could be wrong.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-10-09T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:11:06.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
