Sales of Samsung's Galaxy S6 were slower than some expected. Share on twitter by John Davidson Samsung is bringing forward the launch of its next flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S7, to help it compete with the all-conquering and frankly pretty awesome Apple iPhone 6s.\nAccording to a report in Korea's Electronic Times, the Galaxy S7 is going to launch in January, rather than February when Samsung usually launch its Galaxy S handsets as part of the Mobile World Congress tradeshow in Barcelona.\nSo for anyone hankering for the return of a micro SD memory card slot on the Galaxy S, that's potentially 50 sleeps less waiting time.\nThough 31 sleeps seems more likely. Mobile World Congress starts on Monday, February 22, meaning the S7 would ordinarily launch on February 21. (Samsung likes to launch on the Sunday night ahead of the show.) But an early January launch would clash with Samsung's flagship TV launch (usually at CES in Las Vegas in the second week of January), suggesting a late January launch is more probable. So let's just say January 22 for the sake of easy maths.\nIn any event, it's a big deal for Samsung. The Galaxy S7 needs to do well because Samsung's 2015 phone sales are expected to be 1 per cent lower than its 2014 sales, according to a recent report from TrendForce , which predicted that \"Samsung's annual shipments will enter negative territory for the first time; whereas Apple will keep up its sales momentum in this year's second half with iPhone 6s\".\nBack to the story. Electronic Times reports that Samsung finished designing the Galaxy S7 in September, and is already in discussions with the manufacturers that would supply parts for the new phone. As well as bringing forward the release date, those discussions involve bifurcating the Galaxy S7 design, so that there will be a \"premium\" model and a \"sub-premium\" model for anyone who doesn't like paying the $1300-plus that new high-end phones can cost nowadays.\nThe sub-premium model will have the modem and the application processor on separate chips, rather than combined onto the one chip, Electronic Times reports, which could potentially affect the size of the device and, one might hazard to guess, its battery life.\nThe Galaxy S7 is also rumoured to be coming with a pressure-sensitive screen, courtesy of Synaptics' new ClearForce technology , which will help the phone compete with the 3D Touch feature on Apple's iPhone, which can tell how hard the user is pressing on the screen and change the function to suit. Pressing lightly on an incoming email on the iPhone calls it up in a preview mode, and then pressing more heavily opens up the email more fully. 3D Touch is a pretty compelling reason to chose an iPhone over a Galaxy S right now, so let's hope the pressure sensitive Galaxy S7 rumour is true, for everybody's sake.\n Between that and the expected micro SD card slot (sorely missed on the Galaxy S6), I for one am counting the days . . .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs", "http://press.trendforce.com/press/20151014-2094.html", "http://www.synaptics.com/en/press-releases/clearforce-phone.php", "http://english.etnews.com/20151020200003"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:09:28.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
