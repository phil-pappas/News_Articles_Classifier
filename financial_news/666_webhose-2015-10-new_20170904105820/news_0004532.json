Intertek snaps up PSI for $330m as it eyes US construction recovery By Alan Tovey | Telegraph – 27 minutes ago IT Group Holdings Inc. \nTesting group Intertek buys US peer as it looks to grab a bigger slice of US construction market \nIntertek is to buy US peer Professional Service Industries (PSI (Taiwan OTC: 8028.TWO - news ) ) for $330m as the UK-listed testing and certification group builds up its operations in construction. \nFTSE 100-listed Intertek is acquiring Illinois-based PSI on a debt-free basis that values it at 7.6 times adjusted earnings. The deal is being financed from Intertek's existing debt facilities. \nIntertek said the deal was in line with its strategy of expanding its presence in markets with long-term growth opportunities. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said PSI, which tests non-residential buildings such as factories, offices and hospitals, and structures including bridges and roads, fitted the bill. \nThe US construction market is recovering strongly and the country’s infrastructure is in need of overhaul and expansion. \nAbout a quarter of PSI’s revenue comes from non-destructive testing (NDT) of oil and gas pipelines using techniques such as ultrasound and X-rays to look for cracks, an area that Intertek said complemented its own operations in the US. \nIn its last full-year PSI reported revenue of $254m, adjusted earnings of $40m and an operating profit of $29m. \nPSI, which has about 2,400 staff in 87 locations and is majority owned by private equity firm Olympus Partners, is expected to increase Intertek’s earnings per share in the first full year after acquisition and contribute “meaningfully” to margins in the future. \nAndre Lacroix, Intertek chief executive, said: “The demand for construction and building testing and assurance services will continue to grow, driven by the strengthening US economy, and we will be uniquely positioned to capture an increased demand for higher quality commercial buildings and public infrastructure. \n“In the NDT business, greater demand for pipelines as a safer and more cost-effective means of transportation will drive additional investment that Intertek will benefit from.” \nInvestors welcomed the deal, pushing up Intertek shares almost 2.5pc in early trading. \nShore Capital analyst Robin Speakman said: “This is Intertek’s largest acquisition for some time, proving that consolidation opportunities of scale remain in the testing industry globally. The industrial logic is clearly scale here for Intertek.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:30:52.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
