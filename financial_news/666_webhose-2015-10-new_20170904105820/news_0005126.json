Mortgage Choice, in which CBA has a 20 per cent stake; and National Australia Bank's aggregators, Choice Home Loans and FAST.\nSmaller lenders have previously raised concerns about the high level of bank ownership in mortgage broking and financial advice, questioning whether it has constrained competition.\n\"We strongly support transparency about ownership and remuneration in the financial sector, whether it's major bank sub-brands, financial advisers or mortgage brokers,\" said Luke Lawler, head of public affairs at Customer Owned Banking Association.\n\"Consumers are entitled to know who they are dealing with and who is paying who.\"\nAs well as lifting disclosure, the government supported the inquiry's recommendation to rename \"general advice\". It currently refers to information that does not take into account a customer's entire situation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:39:53.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
