He later told a business audience that there would be no hard landing for China's economy. \n\"The Chinese economy will maintain its strong momentum,\" Xi said. \"There will be no hard landing.\" \nNUCLEAR DEAL \nChina will take a 6-billion-pound stake in EDF's Hinkley Point project in the southwestern English county of Somerset, due to be the first new nuclear plant to be built in the European Union since Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. \nThe Chinese investment, agreed in principle in October 2013, breathes life into a British plan to replace around a quarter of its electricity generating capacity over the next decade. It offers China a way to showcase its nuclear technology as part of its pitch as a global exporter of quality infrastructure. \nNo overall figure was given for the Chinese nuclear investment. Britain said before the visit that a total of 30 billion pounds' worth of contracts would be clinched, though Cameron upped the figure to 40 billion on Thursday. \nOther deals included a $10 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply deal between BP and China's Huadian power (HKSE: 1071-OL.HK - news ) producer, a 2.6 billion pound deal with Carnival Corp to make new cruise ships, and a 1.4 billion pound deal between Rolls-Royce and HNA Group. \nThe nuclear deal brings Britain's first new nuclear plant since 1995 a step closer and is also a boost for EDF, which has been hit by billions of euros of cost overruns and years of delays with two of its other European nuclear projects in Finland and France. \nThe prospect of China, which Western spymasters say sponsors hacking of global companies, helping to build a nuclear plant in Britain and being involved in running others has stoked security concerns. \nSteve Hilton, a former policy adviser to Cameron, told the BBC that Britain should impose sanctions on China for political oppression and cyber attacks instead of rolling out the red carpet. \n\"This is one of the worst national humiliations we've seen since we went cap-in-hand to the IMF in the 1970s,\" said Hilton, referring to the 1976 crisis during which Britain was forced to ask for a loan from the International Monetary Fund. \n\"The truth is that China is a rogue state just as bad as Russia or Iran, and I just don't understand why we're sucking up to them rather than standing up to them as we should be.\" \nChina has strongly denied previous accusations of espionage, saying it is itself a victim of cyber attacks. Cameron said Britain had signed an agreement with China on preventing cyber espionage.
