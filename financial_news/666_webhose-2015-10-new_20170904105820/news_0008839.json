The total brine injection allowed for individual portions is limited to a maximum of 15%. Previously there was no limit prescribed. \nThe product name must now also include a true description of the added formulated solution. Examples would be \"chicken with brine\" and \"sweet 'n sour marinated chicken drumsticks\". \nThe Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries cautioned in a statement that producers must regularly perform tests to ensure compliance with the new water uptake and injection limits. Producers must keep records thereof for at least one year. \n\"These amendments will be phased in over a period of six months to allow for producers to gradually adjust the levels of brine injection and to bring the labelling of these products in line with the new requirements,\" explained the department. \nThe department said it remains committed to ensuring that these regulations are enforced, the quality of poultry meat is maintained and that consumers are enabled to make informed decisions about the poultry meat products they buy. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:18:32.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
