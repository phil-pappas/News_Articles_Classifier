(\"we\", \"our\" and the \"Company\") entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with The Bank of Nova Scotia (\"Lender\") to provide for a $400 million unsecured term credit facility (the \"Term Facility\"). The Term Facility matures on October 15, 2016, but may be extended at the Company's option until October 15, 2017 (the \"Extension Option\"). \nThe Term Facility proceeds are available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases, as permitted under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 20, 2015, by and among the Company, the LC Subsidiaries named therein, the Subsidiary Borrowers named therein, the lenders named therein, the Issuing Banks named therein, Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, Citibank N.A., HSBC Bank USA, National Association, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Lender, as co-documentation agents, and Bank of America, N.A., as agent for the lenders and Issuing Banks thereunder (the \"Revolving Credit Agreement\"). \nThe Term Facility will accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.75%, or, upon exercise of the Extensions Option, LIBOR plus 0.85%. The Term Facility incorporates financial and other covenants by reference to the covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens and subsidiary debt as well as the maintenance of two financial ratios-a fixed charge coverage ratio based on the last four consecutive fiscal quarters of 2.00:1.00 and a leverage ratio as of the last day of each fiscal quarter determined on the basis of the last four consecutive quarters of not greater than 2.25:1.00. As with the Revolving Credit Agreement, a violation of these covenants could result in a default under the Term Facility, which would permit Lender to require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the Term Facility. In addition, such a default could, under certain circumstances, permit the holders of other outstanding unsecured debt to accelerate payment of such obligations. \nThe foregoing description of the Term Facility is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which will be filed as an exhibit to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2015.
