Photo: Peter Braig\nThe residential property market has peaked – at least in Sydney.\nHow do I know? Well, it's not by poring over sale prices, auction clearance rates or activity levels. Nor has it anything to do with Morgan Stanley's claim that the boom is over . In fact, the peak has been signalled by one simple indicator.\nMany share investors forget that initial public offerings are sales of shares. And sellers – having owned their businesses for many years – almost always choose the timing that suits them.\nLJ Hooker is tipped to list in 2016. Photo: Lee Besford\nSo it's noteworthy that two real estate agencies plan to float on the ASX over the next few months. When avowed property market people decide to sell their businesses to sharemarket people, it's the sharemarket people who should worry.\nAdvertisement With property prices having soared in Sydney and Melbourne over recent years – and transaction volumes having risen, too – many real estate agencies will have been producing record profits.\nThe first real estate agency to float on the ASX will probably be McGrath Estate Agents. The prospectus isn't available yet but the float is rumoured to be priced at about $200 million.\nThe second is LJ Hooker, which is apparently seeking pre-float funding. Any listing is not expected to take place until 2016.\nRising risk\nWhat's particularly interesting is that the vendors of these businesses appear to be structuring them in a way that will maximise their returns from the sale, making the businesses riskier for buyers.\nTraditionally, many agencies operated as franchisors, with the franchisees taking much of the cyclical risk.\nHowever, McGrath, for example, has recently bought out its largest franchisee. This means the company will be more exposed to any cyclical downturn in commissions than before. LJ Hooker has flagged it will buy out some of its franchisees, too.\nMcGrath has also expanded into Victoria this year. This may help with marketing the company's \"growth potential\" but expansion into new territories brings risk. McGrath Estate Agents' future business will look very different to its past.\nCyclical businesses floating right before downturns has a precedent. Numerous stockbroking firms, for example, listed in 2007.\nBuy stockbrokers? Lousy investments\nWilson HTM (now Wilson Group) (ASX: WIG), Bell Financial Group (ASX: BFG) and Austock Group (ASX: ACK) all floated within six months of each other, with the last broker hitting the ASX in December 2007.\nThe All Ordinaries peaked at 6873 only one month before, and hasn't hit that level since.\nThe listed brokers have been terrible investments over that period. The best performer, Wilson Group, which incidentally sold its broking business this year, still sits almost 50 per cent below its issue price.\nWho knows whether the listed real estate agencies will suffer the same fate? However, if there's one thing the owners of very cyclical businesses understand, it's that the good times don't last forever.\nIt's often said that \"no one rings a bell at the top of the market\". I disagree. When it comes to the residential property market, the bells from McGrath and LJ Hooker are ringing loud and clear. It's over.\nDisclosure: The author owns shares in Wilson Group.
