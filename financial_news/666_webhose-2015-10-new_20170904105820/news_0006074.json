The biggest US bank by assets suffered drops in other businesses, including corporate and investment banking and commercial banking. \nConsumer banking was also a standout division at Bank of America, which cited year-over-year increased activity in deposits, mortgage originations, credit card issuance and brokerage assets. \n\"On Main Street there is a little bit more momentum than you might see in the overall economy,\" said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst at broker/dealer Vining Sparks. \nSmall businesses and households \"are starting to get some traction, which they haven't had so far in this recovery, whereas the corporate sector is the one where we are seeing a little bit less momentum,\" he said. \nMosby said businesses had halted big investment plans as worries about a potential Greek debt default in the spring morphed into summer concerns about China's slowing economy and market turmoil, and then to the risk of a US government shutdown before year-end due to budget strife on Capitol Hill. \n\"That uncertainty causes businesses to say, 'Let's wait and let the landscape calm down'\" before making investments, Mosby said. \n- Oil defaults ahead? - \nLarge banks have also lifted their reserves in case of energy industry defaults. \nWells Fargo's wholesale profits were dented by such an increase because the company believes the energy industry \"will incur greater challenges in the near term as it adjusts to lower commodity prices,\" said chief financial officer John Shrewsberry. \nBank of America also lifted its reserves for oil-related loans after placing additional loans on the watch list for potential default. \nBofA chief executive Brian Moynihan said the company's oil exposure was \"manageable\" because much of the bank's work has been to package loans where \"the risk is distributed out to investors.\" \nCitigroup (NYSE: C - news ) also lifted its reserves for institutional clients by $275 million, although chief financial officer John Gerspach said the bank feels \"very good\" about its overall exposure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:39:40.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
