However, even bigger shockwaves could be felt in the natural gas sector, should economic sanctions restricting the Persian Gulf powerhouse be fully lifted. \nTehran’s reintroduction to the international community would fire the starting pistol on a natural gas race that could have profound long-term implications for international oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell , which have ploughed billions of dollars into developing higher-cost gas projects in areas such as Australia. \nIran shares access to the world’s single largest natural gas field with Qatar but has so far been unable to fully develop its share of this vast resource. The South Pars field is thought to hold at least 325 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to supply all of Europe’s needs for the next 16 years. \nPrior to the imposition of tougher economic sanctions on Iran, the country had made progress in tapping into South Pars, which had been broken down into 24 phases of development. The Iranians were able to move ahead with early phases intended to provide energy for the country’s domestic market but more lucrative plans to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) have been delayed. \nIran had signed deals with international oil companies to develop LNG projects under a five-year plan that had envisaged exporting 70m tonnes of the fuel each year. However, many of these deals were cancelled, setting back Iran’s gas industry by decades as its big rival Qatar pressed ahead with its own developments on the other side of the Gulf . \nQatar’s North Field, which is adjoined to South Pars, is estimated to hold in excess of 900 trillion cubic feet of gas. Combined, the field is the single largest deposit of the energy source to be found anywhere in the world. The Qataris have raced ahead of Iran in terms of developing their share of the deposit, in partnership with companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) and Exxon Mobil (Swiss: XOM.SW - news ) . \nThe tiny Arab sheikhdom has the capacity to ship 77m tonnes of LNG per year from 14 so-called LNG trains that stretch along its coast at Mesaieed and Ras Laffan. Since 2005 the Qataris have had a moratorium in place on further developments of its North field but, should Iran begin to suck more natural gas from the adjacent South Pars, this policy may change as both sides race to drain the resource. \nQatar is already predicted to see its income from LNG exports fall over the next decade as output has peaked and global markets become flooded with the fuel source. The moratorium on development of the North Field pushed international oil majors into developing more expensive projects in deep waters close to Australia. Although these projects have been more expensive to develop, they have benefited from being closer to fast-growing Asian markets, where the majority of new demand for LNG is expected to occur. \nAt the same time, the development of the shale gas industry in the US has shut out growth of LNG imports into the world’s largest economy. Many of Qatar’s LNG projects were originally aimed to supply the US market before the North American shale revolution reduced the country’s need for foreign imports from the Middle East. \nThis has contributed to the collapse in LNG prices despite rising demand. Landing prices for spot cargos in Asia have fallen to $8 per million British thermal units (btu), from $20 per btu in 2014. Long-term prices could fall much further should Tehran’s reintegration into the international economy provoke Doha to lift its own moratorium on the development of the North Field. \nFaced with declining prices, and a market that Citi Research estimates could be oversupplied by as much as 28m tonnes of LNG by 2018, the last thing the industry needs is a flood of cheap Iranian gas to come on stream. Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, has already said that he wants to see his country exporting gas to Europe. But for that to happen the country will first need to attract the investment of international oil companies to build the giant facilities capable of freezing the fuel to a liquid before it can be loaded onto tankers. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if partners can be found once sanctions are lifted, it would take at least five years to build the infrastructure that would be required for Iran to export LNG on a global scale. However, Iranian gas would have the advantage of being relatively cheap to produce and export when compared with the highly expensive deep-water projects in Australia. \nFor companies such as Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , which are betting their future on natural gas, the start of a race between Qatar and Iran to exploit their vast resources could be disastrous. The Anglo-Dutch company and shareholders are poised to commit £47bn to buy BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) , increasing its exposure to LNG in the long term. Shell has already pulled back on some of its plans for further LNG investments by recently ditching a new $20bn scheme in Queensland, Australia. \nIf Iran does open up and provoke Qatar to lift its moratorium in response then LNG prices will fall even further, despite forecasts that demand will increase by 5pc annually through to 2025. Given the market’s obsession with the impact of weaker crude prices on international oil companies, it is perhaps gas and Iran’s ambitions to supply LNG which are a bigger worry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:20:14.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
