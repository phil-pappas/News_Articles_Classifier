Federal and state prosecutors will split $312 million, and the Federal Reserve will get $90.3 million. The Treasury Department's $329 million penalty is deemed satisfied by the other payments. \nCredit Agricole has already made provisions totaling 1.6 billion euros ($1.82 billion) against litigation costs after taking a further 350 million euro charge related to the U.S. investigation in its second-quarter results. \nCredit Agricole is the latest of about a dozen mostly European international banks penalized in recent years for sanctions-related violations, forfeiting some $14 billion. \nOther banks that have reached agreements include Germany's Commerzbank AG (Xetra: CBK100 - news ) , Amsterdam-based ING Bank NV, Barclays Plc (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group AG . \nStandard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) paid $667 million in penalties to U.S. authorities in 2012, and another $300 million last year. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is still under investigation for banking Iranian-controlled entities in Dubai, sources have told Reuters. \nBNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) , France's largest bank, last year paid a record-breaking $8.9 billion in penalties and pleaded guilty to criminal charges over sanctions-busting. It was also banned from conducting certain U.S. dollar transactions for a year. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Credit Agricole closed down 0.9 percent on Tuesday, when the Stoxx Europe 600 banking sector index was down 0.6 percent. \n(Additional Editing by Greg Mahlich, Tom Brown and Carmel Crimmins)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:32:35.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
