Share on twitter by Jamie Freed When Virgin Group chairman Sir Richard Branson visited Australia for a series of business engagements in September, he took a day off for kite-surfing at Noosa. But does he encourage his staff to do the same? “One hundred per cent,” exclaims the affable Brit. “It’s very important.”\nVirgin is known for being a progressive employer, so Branson’s take is perhaps not surprising. But, due in part to growing demand from the millennial generation, most companies are now having to grapple with the rise and rise of “bleisure” travel, a mix of business and leisure.\n“It’s a growing trend,” says Virginia Fitzpatrick, general manager of Flight Centre Travel Group’s consulting arm 4th Dimension. “It was the younger ones that started the trend. The older ones in their 40s and 50s are now seeing there’s an advantage to this.”\nA report issued by BridgeStreet​ Global Hospitality last year found 83 per cent of global business travellers use time on business trips to explore the city they’re visiting and 37 per cent add personal travel days to most or all trips. After all, the airfare is already paid by the company.\nA few extra days Jamie Pherous,chief executive of Corporate Travel Management, is a big fan of bleisure travel. “I know when I go somewhere that I can’t stand going in a cab from a flying tin can to an airconditioned room,” he says. “I try to have a day to look around. For someone who goes once or twice a year to Europe, you’d be mad going all that way and not spending a few extra days, especially over a weekend.”\nThe average Australian business traveller tends to add between two and five days to work trips when bleisure travel is involved, says Flight Centre general manager corporate, Danielle Galloway. “The big proportion is still international, to major destinations like Singapore and London,” she says. “But it’s expanding domestically.”\nPenny Spencer, managing director of Spencer Travel, says it’s her older clients who tend to take advantage of the bleisure option. “It’s more at the executive level than middle management,” she says. “If they’re going to New York or Los Angeles on business, they might go skiing or meet up with their wife. A lot of the time they use frequent-flyer points for their wives to come over.”\n Bleisure travel is less popular for middle managers, who tend to be in their 30s or 40s, because they often have younger children and want to spend time with them, Spencer says. They can’t take their families on work trips unless they coincide with school holidays.\nEmployers are increasingly adapting to the concept of bleisure in high-pressure, white-collar jobs whereworkers are permanently connected – often answering emails in personal time – and want benefits to make up for the intensified workload.\nInsurance loopholes But experts caution that companies need to better consider how bleisure travel sits within their travel and insurance policies, as well as with their obligations under duty of care to employees. Most travel policies don’t even mention bleisure travel.\nFor instance, while employees’ travel insurance arrangements are ostensibly covered by the company, they may be using days either side of official business for high-risk activities, such as skiing or hiking. They may also be staying in a property that falls short of corporate standards.\nSally King, customer experience leader for Corporate Traveller Australia, says the most forward-thinking businesses are looking at how they can incorporate bleisure into their travel policies.\nOne NSW company is thinking of switching its long-haul air bookings from business to premium economy, which could save up to $7000 a ticket, while upgrading the hotels used from four- to five-star and allowing staff complimentary annual leave for the day of their arrival. Overall, the move is expected to save the firm about $5000 per long-haul trip.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:09:57.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
