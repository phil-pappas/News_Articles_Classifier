Thirteen per cent only took an overseas holiday, while 41 per cent took both domestic and foreign breaks. \nThe report's other findings included: *London residents took the most holidays in 2015 (4.4 on average), followed by those in the North West (3.5) *Those living in Northern Ireland took the least (1.8 on average) *Those in Scotland get through the most spending money on an overseas break, with 44 per cent requiring £500 or more *Those from the South West are the most likely to only take a holiday in Britain *Those from Yorkshire are most likely to book a last-minute break *City breaks are the most popular type of holiday, accounting for 54 per cent of all holidays booked *10 per cent of holidays booked in 2015 were cruises *40 per cent used a mobile or tablet to book a holiday this year, up from 35 per cent in 2014 The report was presented at the annual Abta Convention at the Costa Navarino resort in the Peloponnese region of Greece. \n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Average number of holidays taken 3.9 3.5 3.1 3 3.2 Percentage of Britons taking no holiday 10 17 17 20 23", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:37:23.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
