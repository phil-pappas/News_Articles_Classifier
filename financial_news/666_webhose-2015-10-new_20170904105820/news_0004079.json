Even a sure winner can run into a recession, which either beats down stock prices or at least slows gains for months, even years.\nThis is sort of what happened to Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT ) when its stock went public in the over-the-counter market in October 1970. (Wal-Mart didn't list on the NYSE until August 1972.)\nThe atmosphere was tough for business in the 1970s and into the early 1980s.\n  View Enlarged Image \nConsider what Wal-Mart faced:\nAn 11-month recession began in December 1969 and ended in November 1970. A 16-month recession began in November 1973 and ended in March 1975. A six-month recession occurred in 1980, and a 16-month recession ran from July 1981 to November 1982.\nSo, in its first 12 years in the stock market, Wal-Mart operated in a recession for 39 months.\nDespite those headwinds, the business thrived. Even in the nasty recession years of 1973-74, Wal-Mart grew EPS by 49% and 34%, respectively. Revenue in the same years leapt by 60% and 34%.\nThose were great numbers, but an investor wouldn't have guessed as much from the stock performance. In 1973, the stock price plunged 61%. In 1974, the stock retreated an additional 29%.\nBy 1983, however, the atmosphere in the country, and the stock market was different. After Nixon's Watergate and Carter's malaise, the market was ready for Reagan's pro-growth optimism.\nIn December 1982, about four months after the end of the 1981-82 bear market, Wal-Mart began forming a first-stage base. Ordinarily, the base would've been third stage, but a bear market resets the base count for all stocks.\nWal-Mart consolidated for 12 weeks, with the pattern dipping 19%. The shape was saucerlike, and there were positives within the structure.\nLook at the five, fairly tight weekly closes near the bottom of the pattern. (1) This was a sign that funds were unwilling to give up their shares.\nAfter the five tight weeks, Wal-Mart surged 7% as it retook its 10-week moving average. (2 ) The next two weeks, the stock tested the 10-week line. This was quite natural. After establishing a bottom near 22, the stock needed to show it could find support just under 24, where the 10-week line operated.\nWal-Mart broke out in early March 1983 (3) and advanced 72% in about four months from a split-adjusted 27.10 buy point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:16:54.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
