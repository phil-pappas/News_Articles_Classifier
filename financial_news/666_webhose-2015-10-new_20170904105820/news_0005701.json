This year’s theme, Outlook and Opportunities for 2016, will focus on the rapidly evolving developments and practices in the crowdfinance industry, and provide participants with key insight into where the industry is headed. The Summit will be led by prominent leaders in the industry, reflecting the broad spectrum of innovative talent which is necessary to move this new and burgeoning industry forward. Some of these leaders include members of CfPA’s recently expanded 13 member Board of Directors. (see: http://www.cfpa.org/meet-the-board/ ) The Summit represents a unique one-day opportunity to listen to, learn from, and network with industry leaders, including federal and state regulators, legislative officials, founders and operators of leading crowdfinance platforms, leading legal, financial and accounting professionals, academic thought leaders, and nationally recognized industry advocates.\nThis year’s Summit is expected to be both timely and groundbreaking, with the recent implementation of SEC Regulation A+, the JOBS Act Title III final crowdfunding rules widely believed to be imminent, and a growing base of knowledge and industry best practices after more than two years of experience with public, internet-based accredited investor financing under Title II of the JOBS Act.\nInvestment crowdfunding at the state level has also witnessed exponential growth, with a large majority of the states having adopted their own crowdfunding statutes or actively considering legislation. In this regard the CfPA is especially honored to have the Secretary of State of Georgia, Brian Kemp, discuss his efforts toward expanding their Invest Georgia Exemption to allow up to $5 million in equity crowdfunding, a move that is expected by some industry insiders to serve as a catalyst for similar new federal legislation in 2016.\nAll interested members of the public are welcome to attend this year’s Summit, and those registering for this year’s Summit will automatically receive a one year individual membership in the CfPA. Those interested in attending the Summit in person should register early, as space is limited and the event is expected to sell out.\nFor further information on the 2015 Summit, and to register online, please visit http://www.cfpa.org/2015-summit/ .\nABOUT THE CfPA:\nEstablished shortly after the signing of the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act (“JOBS Act”) on April 5, 2012, the Crowdfunding Professional Association (CfPA) is the leadership and advocacy organization bringing together all those who support and benefit from the nascent industry of crowdfinance.
