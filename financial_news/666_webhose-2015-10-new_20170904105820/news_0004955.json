Pran Tiku offers a clear and informative account of the opportunities that exist in six of the major new global economies. The book sizzles with practical advice for the would-be global investor; but, more significantly, it includes important background material on the history and politics of the six countries--material that is interesting in itself and also very practical.\"--Sidney Verba, Professor of Government, Harvard UniversityIn Six Sizzling Markets, seasoned financial veteran Pran Tiku effectively outlines how you can profit from investing in six dynamic emerging market economies: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (collectively known as BRIC), as well as South Korea and Mexico. Tiku introduces each country by painting a picture of its historical and political landscapes and quickly moves on to provide you with practical applications and profitable strategies for these markets.This reliable resource skillfully addresses growth opportunities and describes sustainable investment strategies--based on vigorous research and investment experience--and provides a basis for investing in these markets by explaining the opportunities that are available. Six Sizzling Markets also argues that meaningful diversification is likely to reduce risk and enhance returns based on well-known principles of modern portfolio theory.Engaging and informative, Six Sizzling Markets will educate both experienced and aspiring investors on strategies for developing their international portfolios by capitalizing on emerging market opportunities.
