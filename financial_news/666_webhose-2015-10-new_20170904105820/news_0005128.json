Gathering over 60 years of art criticism, the 500-page book covers a vast historical breadth, from the Chauvet Cave paintings from 30,000 B.C. to contemporary Syrian artist Randa Mdah. In between, the work of some 70 artists is explored.\nRead an excerpt from “Portraits: John Berger on Artists.”\nHere are some key findings from ‘Portraits,’ released in the U.K. by Verso Books and out Nov. 24 in the U.S. by Penguin Random House:\nENLARGE ‘Portraits: John Berger on Artists’ covers 60 years of art criticism and a vast historical breadth.

For Mr. Berger, a Marxist, Caravaggio was the first painter to show life as experienced by the dispossessed. The Italian artist’s darkness, Mr. Berger writes, was “the darkness of stairwells, gambling corners, cheap lodgings, sudden encounters.”\nArt criticism isn’t for the faint of heart. Mr. Berger almost lost his job as a critic for the New Statesman in the 1950s after writing disparagingly about the sculptures of Henry Moore, then at the height of his career. “I was considered a national traitor!” he says.\nFrancis Bacon was a heartbeat from the Wonderful World of Disney . DIS 0.97 % In a 1972 essay, Mr. Berger likens Bacon’s art to that of Walt Disney. “Disney makes alienated behaviour look funny and sentimental and, therefore, acceptable,” he writes. “Bacon interprets such behaviour in terms of the worst possible having already happened, and so proposes that refusal and hope are pointless.”\nJean-François Millet was the first “peasant” painter. In 1974, Mr. Berger put down roots in Quincy, a small hamlet in France’s Haute-Savoie, where peasants still toiled the land and the most familiar artist was Jean-François Millet. Mr. Berger describes the 19th-century French painter’s work as unique, saying that before him no European painter had treated rural labor as the central theme of his or her art. “His life’s work was to introduce a new subject in an old tradition, to force a language to speak of what it had ignored,” writes Mr. Berger.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL125_BERGER_JV_20151020175816.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:17:12.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
