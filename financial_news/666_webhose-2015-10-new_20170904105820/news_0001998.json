But government data showed on Monday Japanese wage growth slowed in August and summer bonuses were lower than last year.\nMarket players expect the BOJ could increase its purchase of risk assets such as stock index-linked ETFs, and could extend the average maturity of JGB it buys.\nOther possible measures include a cut in the interest rate on excess reserves and further increase in its bond buying.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price rose 0.10 point to 148.47 .\nThe market also drew support from surprisingly weak U.S. employment data published on Friday, which reduced expectations of a U.S. rate hike later this year and supported bond prices globally.
