Yume is down nearly the same amount, TubeMogul TUBE -0.76 % has fallen about 25%; Tremor Video TRMR -1.08 % is off over 20% and Rubicon Project RUBI -1.51 % has dropped nearly 17%.\nIndustry observers attribute the declines to continued “confusion” about the companies among investors, and concerns about the growing dominance of the online ad market by major firms such as Google Inc. GOOG 0.47 % and Facebook Inc. FB 1.17 %\nSerious questions about the future of ad tech and online advertising are also mounting. Some online publishers say they’re now actively avoiding working with third-party ad tech firms , for example, because they argue the vendors devalue their ad space.\nMeanwhile the industry is struggling to come to grips with major challenges such as the growth of ad-blocking technologies , and the ongoing problem of fraudulent or “non-human” Internet traffic .\nPhoto: The Wall Street Journal Photo: The Wall Street Journal Write to Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO775_cmoad1_G_20151001154457.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO777_cmoad2_G_20151001154633.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:07:29.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
