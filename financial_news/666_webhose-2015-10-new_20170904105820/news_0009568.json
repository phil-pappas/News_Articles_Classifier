Digital Retail Apps is providing SelfPay self-checkout technology for Visa’s Everywhere Shop mobile app, giving shoppers the ability to shop and pay from anywhere in-store directly on their own mobile device and skip the checkout line.\nVisa guests have the opportunity to experience the time-saving convenience and ease of retail shopping and payments with the Visa Everywhere Shop checkout app, embedded with SelfPay’s technology, built for the Samsung Galaxy S6. The solution enables guests to use smartphones loaded with Visa’s Everywhere Shop app to scan items they want to buy, build a cart, and pay for their in-store purchases directly in-app on their mobile device. Guests will be able to scan printed barcodes from physical items as well as digital barcodes displayed on an interactive digital wall, and Visa team members will have the ability to instantly verify an in-app payment using SelfPay’s patented purchase verification solution for in-store sales.\nThe announcement of this showcase is indicative of the ever-increasing rate of mobile commerce in use by retail shoppers. A recent Deloitte study shows that over half of all shoppers would rather look up product details and pay for an in-store purchase on their own mobile device rather than visit a self-checkout kiosk or work with a store associate. Another study by App Dynamics shows that 75% of U.S. shoppers who own a smartphone, tablet or both desire apps that let them bypass checkout lines at brick-and-mortar stores.\n“Having SelfPay technology showcased at One Market is an exciting signal that in-app mobile payments are on their way to mainstream brick-and-mortal retail,” said Wendy MacKinnon Keith, CEO of Digital Retail Apps. “The traditional point of sale is shifting from a fixed location or associate-operated mobile device to a cloud solution on a shopper’s personal mobile device. We’re thrilled to showcase this leading technology to the world and know Visa’s guests will be impressed by the seamless mobile shop and pay SelfPay experience.”\nOne Market’s Visa Everywhere Shop will showcase Digital Retail Apps’ SelfPay experience starting today. Visa guests will be able to shop for items in-store and pay in-app using a stored Visa card. The SelfPay-powered checkout app plans to introduce additional mobile in-app payment methods such as Visa Checkout in the near future.\nAbout Digital Retail Apps\nDigital Retail Apps, a private company with offices in Toronto and San Francisco, is focused on providing retail shoppers with a completely seamless shopping and payment experience.
