We have received the complete study report of the recently concluded trials in the U.S. which indicates the important role played by Insulin Tregopil in post prandial glycemic control. We are extremely excited with these findings and will decide the future course of this molecule in consultation with our partner BMS. We also plan to submit research papers for publication in peer reviewed international journals. Itolizumab We are actively engaged with our global clinical advisory team in developing this first-in-class anti-CD6, monoclonal antibody for a range of autoimmune conditions. However, we do expect procedural delays in developing this molecule in the US, on account of the requirement to obtain certain Governmental clearances. Based on recent feedback, we believe it is unlikely that we will receive waivers from the US authorities expeditiously. Whilst this has no impact on further development of this asset outside the US, we have taken an impairment charge against the US rights, in view of this uncertainty. Meanwhile, we continue to develop the molecule for other markets and hope to address the US market at an opportune time. OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE Biopharmaceuticals The Biopharmaceutical segment grew 4% YoY in Q2FY16, delivering sales of Rs.578 Cr. Within the segment, Biopharma grew 4% delivering Rs.459 Cr, while Branded Formulations grew 3% to Rs.119 Cr. Biopharma The overall performance of Biopharma business this quarter was affected due to slow offtake of some of the APIs and capacity constraints. However, we are taking steps to address this challenge. Our Insulins facility in Malaysia is progressing towards qualification and emerging market filings in FY17. The expansion of our Biosimilars fill-finish facility in Bangalore is also on track for qualification in FY18. Furthermore, we continue to pursue licensing opportunities in emerging markets for two key products, Trastuzumab and Insulin Glargine, and expect to commence sales of these products in some of these markets, this fiscal. We have recently acquired the business assets including a USFDA approved synthesis facility of Acacia Life Sciences, in Vishakhapatnam, India. It presently manufactures advanced intermediates of potent APIs with sales to customers in India and overseas. This acquisition will enable us to vertically integrate our oncology related ANDA filings of the future. Branded Formulations The Branded Formulations business’s focus on key brands has improved the profitability of this business. The growth of this business during the quarter, was largely driven by key brands in the Metabolics and Oncology divisions. The Metabolics division is expected to get a fillip with the introduction of BASALOG One™, a long acting basal Insulin Glargine presented as an innovative, pre-filled pen, manufactured at our newly commissioned devices facility in Bangalore. This new facility will equip us to address the growing demand for disposable devices for diabetics around the world. However, our inability to participate in some large institutional tender opportunities due to restrictions on the use of CMOs to meet these requirements, along with short supply of some key products, impacted the revenue growth of this business. Research Services – Syngene It was a landmark quarter for Syngene, as it created immense value for its shareholders through a successful listing on NSE/BSE on August 11, 2015. Currently, it has a market cap of US$ 1.15 Bn (as on Oct 19, 2015). In Q2 FY16, Syngene has delivered a remarkable YoY growth of 30%, recording sales of Rs.250 Cr. The business performance was driven by strong growth across its three verticals – discovery services, dedicated centers and development & manufacturing services. Business momentum is expected to continue into H2 FY16. Notes to the Editor : Net Profit Includes exceptional income (net) of Rs.203 Cr (IPO receipts net of IPO expenses and tax, book value adjustment for 11% Syngene stake dilution & impairment charge** for Itolizumab). Adjusting for exceptional income and associated tax, Net Profit was Rs.103 Cr, with Net Profit margin of 12%. **Impairment Charges are reflected when the fair market value of the asset is less than the historical value of the asset.
