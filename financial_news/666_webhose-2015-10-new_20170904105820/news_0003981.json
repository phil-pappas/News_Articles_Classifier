Photo: Glenn Hunt\nSantos, the target of a rebuffed $7.14 billion takeover approach from private fund Scepter Partners, has lowered its production forecast for the full year and further reined in capital spending as it defers development because of slumping oil prices.\nProduction for 2015 is now expected to be between 57 million and 59 million barrels of oil equivalent, down from a previous estimate of 57 million to 64 million boe.\nCapital spending for the full year will be just $1.8 billion, down from a previous estimate of $2 billion.\nThe reduction in production guidance was driven by lower than expected requirements for domestic gas production from the GLNG venture in Queensland, which shipped its first LNG exports from Gladstone last Friday. Photo: www.shipspotting.com\nThe oil and gas producer on Thursday announced it had knocked back a $6.88 per share cash approach from Scepter , a $US14 billion private fund with links to Brunei royalty . The firm is understood to be aiming to rebuild the company under the leadership of former CEO John Ellice-Flint.\nAdvertisement The reduction in production guidance was driven by lower than expected requirements for domestic gas production from the GLNG venture in Queensland, which shipped its first LNG exports from Gladstone last Friday. Unexpected maintenance work required at oil fields in Western Australia and Vietnam contributed to the downgrade, which was only partly mitigated by stronger than anticipated performance from the Papua New Guinea LNG venture.\nSantos noted that its LNG sales volumes had more than doubled this year, thanks to PNG LNG and the start-up of GLNG.\nProduction in the September quarter was 14.5 million boe, up 4 per cent on a year earlier. But the drop in oil prices meant sales revenues were 24 per cent down from the third quarter last year, at $808 million.\nCapex has been slashed as a result of the dive in prices, while the completion of GLNG also contributed. Capex in the third quarter was $388 million, down almost 60 per cent form $952 million spent in the September quarter last year.\nChief executive David Knox, who has announced his intention to step down in 2016, noted the progress made to reduce costs.\n\"We said that we would produce more for less and this quarter's figures are a strong reflection of that,\" Mr Knox said in a statement.\n\"Year-to-date production is up 10 per cent while capex is down 55 per cent and unit production costs are down 15 per cent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:08:23.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
