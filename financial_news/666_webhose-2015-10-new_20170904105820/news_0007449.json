AP by Greg Smith China's life insurance industry has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, emerging as the fourth-largest market in the world in 2015. Even so, less than 3 per cent of the population have a life insurance policy, so there is plenty of room for growth.\nIt is no surprise, then, that China is expected to surpass Britain and Japan to become the second-largest insurance market in terms of primary insurance premium volume over the next decade.\nAs the country's biggest player in the sector (with 25 per cent market share), China Life Insurance is well placed to take advantage.\nBased on Moody's forecasts, the Chinese life insurance market will grow about 15 to 20 per cent in the next 12 to 18 months, driven by strong sales of long-term savings and protection-type products. But the market faces a deteriorating investment environment because of the high volatility in the Chinese equity market, on the back of lingering economic uncertainty, low liquidity and reduced margin financing activity. This would imply some negative impact on some of Chinese life insurers, as their floats are dependent on sharemarket performance.\nIncreased uncertainty and volatility reflect not only the downside risks in the Chinese economy, but also the government's stimulative measures. Some have encouraged insurers to raise their stock purchases, which increases their exposure to potential sharemarket volatility. China Life arguably will be less affected, though, with the company adopting a relatively conservative investment strategy, angled more towards safer assets.\n'Safe assets' In the first half of 2015, China Life's total revenue increased by 37.5 per cent, reaching 33.13 billion yuan ($7.23 billion), driven by strong growth in written premiums and an industry-leading distribution network. Investment revenue of 4.97 billion yuan rose 10 per cent, but remains a relatively small proportion of total turnover, at about 15 per cent.\nChina Life has parked about 80 per cent of its investments in \"safe\" assets including bonds, term deposits and asset-backed investments. The company has only allocated 17 per cent towards stocks and equity funds.\n It has also been able to generate a high investment return, with its gross investment yield rising 4.28 per cent to 9.06 per cent over the past 12 months. It is in a strong capital position with its debt-to-equity ratio improving by 3.04 percentage points to 22.72 per cent in the first half of 2015.\nGiven the competitive advantage of its strong distribution network, we believe China Life is well positioned to maintain a leading market position and make the most of a rapidly growing Chinese life insurance market. The Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed company recently issued significant revenue and profit upgrades and we believe the stock is attractively priced on about 15 times forward earnings estimates and a 2 per cent yield, which we expect to grow.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.\nDisclosure: Interests associated with Fat Prophets declare a holding in China Mobile.\nFor a free trial of Fat Prophets' daily market commentary please click here .", "external_links": ["http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview"], "published": "2015-10-22T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:05:19.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
