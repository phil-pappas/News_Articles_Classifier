Not if you are in snow business. Comment Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 8:12 PM By Beth Brelje Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 8:12 PM » Social News Does it seem a bit soon to think about winter? Not if you are in snow business. Shawnee Mountain and Camelback Mountain, two of the Pocono Mountains' largest ski resorts will hold job fairs in early November for seasonal jobs. First time applicants can expect to see lots or potential staffers vying for the same jobs. Attend job fairs with information needed to fill out a job application, such as your social security number, and the names and phone numbers of personal references. And be prepared to be interviewed. Returning winter workers find these mountain job fairs are like coming home, a chance for connecting with work buddies seen only when the snow guns run. For many, a job at a ski resort is more about getting mountain privileges for skiing or snowboarding, than it is about the paycheck. Shawnee Mountain will host its fair on Saturday, Nov. 7 from 10 a.m. — 2 p.m. in Hope Lodge at Shawnee Mountain Ski Area, according to the company's website. There will be full and part time seasonal positions available in most departments including ski school, lift operations, food and beverage, rental facility, cashiers, ticketing cashiers, lodge maintenance, security and parking, nursery, group sales, and guest services. Lift operators must be 18 years of age or older. There are also some supervisor positions mentioned at the Shawnee Mountain website, www.shawneemt.com . The Camelback Mountain job fair will be held on two days: Saturday, Nov. 7, from 9 a.m. — noon; and Wednesday, Nov. 11, from 5 p.m.-8 p.m. inside Big Pocono Family Eatery at Camelback Mountain. Camelback will be hiring for all positions and offering on the spot interviews.
