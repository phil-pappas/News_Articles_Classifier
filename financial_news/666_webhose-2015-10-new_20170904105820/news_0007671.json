Investment banks have started taking strict measures to prevent this from happening in recent years amid increasing scrutiny from regulators. \nGoldman Sachs is among the most selective employers on Wall Street. Last year, the bank hired just 3% of 267,000 applicants, and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has called his firm “the employer of choice in our industry.” Fortune magazine named Goldman Sachs one of the 100 best companies to work for, a citation it has received every year since the list began in 1984, according to a presentation given by Blankfein in February. \nThe firings come the same week that the New York-based firm reported quarterly earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates for the first time in four years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:15:36.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
