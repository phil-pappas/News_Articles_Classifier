( NASDAQ : NAUH )\nFinancial and Operational Highlights \nEnrollment by headcount for the FY 2016 first quarter (summer 2015 term) decreased 18.0% over the prior-year period to 8,139 students as of August 31, 2015. \n\nFY 2016 first quarter total revenue was $24.6 million, compared to $29.3 million in the prior-year period. The Company's academic segment's revenue was $24.4 million in the FY 2016 first quarter, compared to $28.6 million in the prior-year period. \n\nFY 2016 first quarter net loss attributable to the Company was $1.3 million, compared to net income attributable to the Company of $2.2 million in the prior-year period, primarily as a result of lower revenues and increased SG&A expenses due to an increase in allowance for bad debt expense. \n\nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.045 per share on all shares of the Company's common stock outstanding and of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2015, which will be paid on or about October 9, 2015. \n\nBalance sheet at August 31, 2015, included cash and cash equivalents and investments of $34.3 million; working capital of $33.3 million; no outstanding lending debt; and stockholders' equity of $50.1 million, or approximately $1.99 per diluted share.\n\nNational American University Holdings, Inc. (the \"Company\") ( NASDAQ : NAUH ), which through its wholly owned subsidiary operates National American University ( \"NAU\" or the \"University\" ), a regionally accredited, proprietary, multi-campus institution of higher learning, today reported unaudited financial results for its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended August 31, 2015.\nRonald L. Shape, Ed.D., Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, \"During the FY 2016 first quarter, we made progress on several new key initiatives that we believe will drive NAU's enrollment growth in the future. Among these initiatives is a plan to develop a second online recruitment center in the larger metropolitan market of Albuquerque, New Mexico. We believe the additional recruitment center will allow us to scale the necessary talent for our enrollment advisor team to help improve enrollment to the levels we believe can be achieved in this market. While we continue to work to increase the efficiencies of our operations, we have also continued to invest in expanding our academic programming and services to students. In this regard, several of the new programs we had planned to launch in August are still pending final approval and will be pushed back to later this winter. In addition, we realized some pressure around our financial services operations over the past few months, which has impacted our student start rates for the summer and fall terms, as well as our overall bad debt expense. We have added several quality individuals to the financial services team and are seeing incremental improvement in this area, which we believe will have a positive impact on enrollments.\"\nDr. Shape continued, \"I am pleased to share that NAU was recently approved by the Ministry of Education in Ontario for eligible residents of the Province to utilize Canadian-based aid to fund the cost of an online degree program from NAU. We are currently working with several institutions in Canada with which we have established relationships for their students to be able to enroll in NAU courses and programs. We look forward to serving these students in the terms to come and are excited to be able to offer our flexible online programs to another group of students looking to continue their educational journeys. Our students are our first priority, and we look forward to continuing to support their academic goals and post-graduation outcomes for many more years to come.\"\nOperating Review \nEnrollment Update \nTotal NAU student enrollment for the summer term of 2015 decreased 18.0% to 8,139 students from 9,930 during the prior summer term. The decrease was primarily a result of the pressure surrounding the University's financial services operations, as well as the seasonality that typically impacts the summer term. Students enrolled in 70,621 credit hours compared to 85,085 credit hours during the prior summer term. The current average age of NAU's students continues to be in the mid-30s, with those seeking undergraduate degrees remaining the highest portion of NAU's student population.\nThe following is a summary of student enrollment at August 31, 2015, and August 31, 2014, by degree level and by instructional delivery method: \nAugust 31, 2015 August 31, 2014 (Summer '15 Qtr) (Summer '14 Qtr) No. of Students % of Total No. of Students % of Total Continuing Ed 116 1.4 % 104 1.0 % Doctoral 77 0.9 % 37 0.4 % Graduate 242 3.0 % 278 2.8 % Undergraduate 7,704 94.7 % 9,511 95.8 % Total 8,139 100.0 % 9,930 100.0 % August 31, 2015 August 31, 2014 No. of Students % of Total No. of Students % of Total Online 5,608 68.9 % 6,201 62.4 % On-Campus 1,326 16.3 % 2,213 22.3 % Hybrid 1,205 14.8 % 1,516 15.3 % Total 8,139 100.0 % 9,930 100.0 % Financial Review \nThe Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, operates in two business segments: the academic segment, which consists of NAU's undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral education programs and contributes the primary portion of the Company's revenue; and ownership in multiple apartments and condominium complexes from which it derives sales and rental income. The real estate operations generated approximately 1.1% of the Company's revenues for the quarter ended August 31, 2015. \nFiscal 2016 First Quarter Financial Results \nTotal revenues for the FY 2016 first quarter were $24.6 million, compared to $29.3 million in the same period last year. The academic segment's total revenue was $24.4 million, compared to $28.6 million in the prior-year period. This decrease in academic segment revenues was primarily a result of a decrease in enrollment, which was driven by weaker market demand among NAU's targeted student demographic and an improving economic environment in which many working adults choose not to attend school. \n\nFor the FY 2016 first quarter, educational services expense was $6.3 million, or 25.8% of the academic segment's total revenue, compared to $7.1 million, or 25.0%, for the FY 2015 first quarter. The increase in cost of educational services as a percentage of total academic revenue was the result of fixed facility costs on lower revenues.\n\nEducational services expense specifically relates to the academic segment, and includes salaries and benefits of faculty and academic administrators, costs of educational supplies, facility costs, faculty reference and support material and related academic costs. \n\nDuring the FY 2016 first quarter, SG&A expenses increased to $19.0 million, or 77.1% of total revenues, from $18.6 million, or 63.6%, in the prior-year period. This increase was largely the result of a $0.8 million increase in the provision for uncollectable tuition. \n\nLoss before income taxes and non-controlling interest for the FY 2016 first quarter was $2.1 million, compared to income before income taxes and non-controlling interest of $3.5 million in the same period last year, primarily as a result of decreased revenues and increased SG&A expenses. \n\nNet loss attributable to the Company for the FY 2016 first quarter was $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share based on 25.2 million shares outstanding, compared to net income attributable to the Company of $2.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share based on 25.1 million shares outstanding, in the prior-year period. \n\nLosses before interest, tax, and depreciation and amortization (\"LBITDA\") for the FY 2016 first quarter were $0.5 million, compared to EBITDA of $5.2 million in the prior-year period. A table reconciling EBITDA/LBITDA to net income can be found at the end of this release.\n\nBalance Sheet Highlights \n(in millions except for percentages) 8/31/2015 5/31/2015 % Change Cash and Cash Equivalents/Investments $ 34.3 $ 27.4 25.1 %* Working Capital 33.3 34.6 (3.8 )% Total Long-term Debt 0 0 N/A Stockholders' Equity 50.1 52.5 (4.7 )% * The increase in cash is primarily due to increased net income and the timing of funds received from student receivables, which the Company received in June and July this year.\nQuarterly Dividend \nThe Board of Directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.045 per share on all shares of the Company's common stock outstanding and of record as of the close of business on September 30, 2015, that will be paid on or about October 9, 2015.\nConference Call Information \nManagement will discuss these results in a conference call (with accompanying presentation) on Thursday, October 1, 2015, at 11:00 a.m. EDT.\nThe dial-in numbers are:\n(877) 407-9078 (U.S.)\n(201) 493-6745 (International)\nAccompanying Slide Presentation and Webcast\nThe Company will also have an accompanying slide presentation available in PDF format at the \"Investor Relations\" section of the NAU website at http://investors.national.edu .

The Company uses EBITDA as a measure of operating performance. However, EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing its operating performance, investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and is therefore limited as a comparative measure. Furthermore, as an analytical tool, EBITDA has additional limitations, including that (a) it is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments; (b) it does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, its working capital needs; and (c) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. To compensate for these limitations, the Company evaluates its profitability by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with its analysis of cash flows from operations and through the use of other financial measures.\nThe Company believes EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating its operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company's operating performance without regard to certain non-cash expenses (such as depreciation and amortization) and expenses that are not reflective of its core operating results over time. The Company believes EBITDA presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of its capital structure, the method by which assets were acquired and non-cash charges, and provides us with additional useful information to measure its performance on a consistent basis, particularly with respect to changes in performance from period to period.\nProfessional Services Company Earnings National American University Contact: National American University Holdings, Inc.\nDr. Ronald Shape\n605-721-5220\nrshape@national.edu \n\nInvestor Relations Counsel\nThe Equity Group Inc. \nCarolyne Y.
