The tail was 0.06, smaller than 0.09 last month, helped by strong investor demand after the start of new financial half year on Oct. 1.\nThe shorter end of the market fared worse after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday that he had no plan to cut interest rates on excess reserves.\nThe two-year bond yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.005 percent while the five-year yield rose 1.0 basis point to 0.065 percent.\nThe 10-year yield also rose 0.5 basis point to 0.330 percent .\nIn the money market, however, a shortage of government bills led the six-month Treasury bills yield to a record low of minus 0.089 percent, down 1.7 basis points.
