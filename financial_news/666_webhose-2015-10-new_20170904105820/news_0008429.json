The current gross dividend yield on Australian equities is 7.5 per cent — three times the deposit rate.\nCredit Suisse estimates that selfies were paid $12 billion in dividends by Australian companies in the last financial year, and expects a similar amount for the coming fiscal period.\n“Aussie equities are a brightly shining beacon of yield against an investment landscape barren of income generating assets,” Mr Tevfik said.\n“Selfies buy what they know and ATO data suggests they have a clear domestic bias,” he said.\n SMSFs lose $40bn in six months", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/smsfs-lose-40bn-in-six-months-as-australian-equities-underperform/story-fni0dcne-1227548750861"], "published": "2015-09-29T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:08:46.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
