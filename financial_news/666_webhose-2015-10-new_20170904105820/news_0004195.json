The herbivores could measure up to 12 m (40 ft) long and weigh more than two tons. They are distinguished by a crest that projects backward off the top of the skull.\nThe three or four babies described in the paper did not yet have this cranial crest, and their skulls were not yet fused, suggesting they were in the early stages of development.\nScientists are not sure if they had hatched yet or if they met their demise while still in their shells.\nFirst Published on October 15, 2015 4:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:01:03.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
