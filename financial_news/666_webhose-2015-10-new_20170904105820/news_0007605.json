Google's chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the sum had been reached as a result of some \"fun math\". \nThe vast majority of the company’s revenues come from advertising on Google’s websites, which investors have fretted over as internet users increasingly go online on their smartphones, where adverts can be less lucrative. \nFor the first time, searches on smartphones overtook those on desktops during the last quarter. But despite Google’s “cost per click” the average amount advertisers pay every time someone clicks on an advert falling by 11pc, Alphabet said Google had seen “substantial growth” in mobile search revenue. \nShares in the company rose by around 10pc immediately following the results, climbing to an all-time high and valuing Alphabet at more than $500bn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:41:57.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
