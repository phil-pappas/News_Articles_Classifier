The hope, according to the company, is to have all recalled cars fixed by the end of next year. But recent data suggest that although recall rates have risen in recent years, many drivers may still be willing to take their chances, especially when the flaw is not of the life-threatening variety.\nHowever, the overall recall response rate for light vehicles hovers at around 75%, up from 70% in years prior, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but that doesn’t necessarily indicate completion of the recall. “They would like to boost that response percentage,” Nerad says. If there are 1 million recalls and 25% of people aren’t responding, that’s still a big number, he says. And the longer the recall is delayed, the more likely such a situation could occur. “Some people take the attitude that if it’s sunny today, it’s never going to rain,” he says. “With wear and tear, older cars are more susceptible to something going wrong related to that flaw.”\nLast year, almost 64 million vehicles were recalled for repairs , a record number, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a U.S. government agency. In 2014, GM GM, -0.05% reached an agreement after accidents involving Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions, among other compact cars, were cited in 13 deaths in the U.S. when a faulty ignition-switch shut off power to the vehicles. Also that year, Honda HMC, -1.04% announced that was recalling more than 886,000 Odyssey minivans. Given the more serious nature of the General Motors recall, consumers are more likely to take action, says Jack Nerad, executive market analyst and editorial director at Kelley Blue Book.\nThere’s a financial cost to not responding to a recall notice. “If you ignore the recall completely and have a problem, it could be an issue for financial compensation,” says Patrick Regan, a civil trial attorney based in Washington, D.C., who also handles product liability cases against automobile manufacturers. The law might rule that the driver in question “assumed the risk” of the product, he adds. Used car owners who have not received a notification of the defect would have a stronger case, he says. With the breadth and age of the cars involved in the General Motors recall, he says, “these cars could have changed hands five times. If you don’t get the attention of owners right now, you may never get them.”\nRead: Elderly drivers are NOT the most dangerous on the road \nBut the older the car, the less likely people will return it, according to a 2012 Society of Automotive Engineers report. Only 42% of people responded to recalls for 2000 models, versus 49% for 2001 models, it found. The rate of recalls steadily increased to 74% for 2004 models, 77% for 2007 models and 89% for 2009 models. One theory: Drivers may believe that the longer they drive a car, the safer it is. But older cars are also sold on to third parties and, therefore, become difficult for auto makers to track. \nWhat’s more, when asked which factors were important to them when choosing a new or pre-owned car, car owners and leasers put the safety record of a particular make of car behind price, fuel efficiency, and mileage as their most important consideration, a survey conducted of more than 1,160 adults in 2014 by consulting group YouGov found. Although the safety record of the brand is of some consideration to the majority of Americans (89%), only 59% believe it is very important. Women appear to be more concerned about the brand safety record than men, with 64% of women drivers deeming it “very important” compared to 43% of men.\nAnd drivers do need a certain amount of cajoling to submitting their existing car for a recall, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers report. Automotive companies can boost the response rate with pre-calls to consumers followed up by a notice sent by FedEx (rather than ordinary 1st class or priority USPS mail), it found. Experiments with the color of print and size of envelope notifying people of the recall had negligible impact, “but automated pre-calls timed to occur 1 to 2 days prior to delivery of a paper notice were more effective than follow-up calls timed to occur after the mailings had been delivered.” \nOwners of new and used cars can sign up for recall notifications by email at the NHTSA’s safety issue search site, according to the American Automobile Association. Still, the percentage of people who respond to auto recalls varies greatly between manufacturers and even different campaigns, says Joe Wiesenfelder, executive editor of auto news site Cars.com. “An automaker might claim 95% compliance on some recalls and, say, 50% on others,” he says. Even so, the recall rate could be closer to the latter with Volkswagen’s emissions problem, he says. “Safety recalls definitely get higher numbers.”\nAlso see: 5 ways commuting ruins your life \nThis story has been updated from a previous version .\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:27:24.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
