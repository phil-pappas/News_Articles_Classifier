Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Misa Han Copenhagen is riders' heaven. Over half of commuters cycle to work every day, and collectively Danes pedalled 3.1 billion kilometres last year alone.\nOn Tuesday, Marianne Weinreich was in Sydney to talk about how Australian cities can embrace Copenhagen's cycling-friendly culture and infrastructure.\nAs the chairman of an independent cycling lobby group the Cycling Embassy of Denmark (yes, there is such a thing), part of her job involves travelling around the world to share the Danish way of building bicycle-friendly cities.\nCyclist rubbish City bikers in Amagertorv, Copenhagen. Getty Images So what would it take to make Australian cities bike-friendly? A good start would be building separated cycleways.\nIn Denmark, there are proper, curb-protected bicycle lanes and tracks, because paint alone does not work when there is high volume and speed of cars.\nBut building a bike-friendly city is much more than just having separated cycleways. In Copenhagen, there is bicycle parking everywhere, including in the front of the Folketinget, the Danish Parliament.\nThere are airpumps on the road for flat tyres and footrest on the road to help cyclists rest their tired legs. Even the rubbish bins are tilted towards the road, so riders can put rubbish in the bin without getting off their bike.\nTilted rubbish bins aimed at cyclists. City of Copenhagen The Danes have also invested in a giant cyclist counter that shows how many cyclists have been on the road. \"It's a tool that shows cyclists that they count,\" Weinreich says. Literally.\nCity infrastructure To get around the problem of water in a harbour city, Copenhagen also invested in building a number of bridges that exclusively cater for bicycles.\nOne of the bicycle bridges, known as The Bicycle Snake, is a famous landmark that now doubles up as a popular tourist destination, although \"not as popular as The Little Mermaid,\" Weinreich says.\nThe Bicycle Snake, a cycle bridge in Copenhagen. Supplied Cycling is also integrated into public transport. Danes can bring their bicycle along on certain trains and the train carriages are designed to cater for bicycles.\nIt is also mandatory for taxis in Denmark to carry a rack for the bicycle so commuters can easily jump in the cab with their bicycle.\nWhen contacted by The Australian Financial Review , cities minister James Briggs' office said it will be developing a comprehensive plan focusing on better integrated planning and new infrastructure funding models, but it has not released any details yet.\nNo lycra Bicycle Network's campaign to encourage more women to cycle. Supplied The Australian cycling campaign, Weinreich says, has been a marketing disaster. \"You have a lot of men in lycra and we have a lot of ordinary people in everyday clothes - and a lot of women,\" Weinreich says.\n\"There are women, children, cycling in ordinary clothes. It's transportation cycling, urban cycling.\"\nOnly one in three cyclists in Australia are women, in comparison to Denmark where female cyclists slightly outnumber male cyclists.\nWeinreich says she was not impressed by Bicycle Network's The Ascent campaign , which features women heavy on lycra riding on racing bikes.\n\"I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. I will never ride in lycra. This is not the way to go if you want to have women cycling.\"\n\"These are my cycling clothes,\" Weinreich says, showing off her business skirt, stockings and heels. She adds cycling in heels is much easier than walking in heels.\nHelmets are also not mandatory in Denmark, which makes riding easier for everyday commuters.\nBut Bicycle Network's Anthea Hargreaves is standing by the campaign. She says while the campaign is not a \"single catch-all for female riders\", it has appeal to some female riders.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/the-ascent/"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:02:38.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
