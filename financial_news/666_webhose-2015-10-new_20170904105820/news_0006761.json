Photo: Theresa Ambrose\nI hate to admit this but I'm an incredibly envious person. It's probably my greatest flaw. Stretching back to at least adolescence, envy has been the cause (or the consequence) of a tendency to endlessly make comparisons. Of wealth. Of health. Of looks. Of love. Of experiences. Of popularity. And, of course, of career growth. None of which, I realise, is good for personal wellbeing, especially when the outcome is usually a prevailing sense of inferiority.\nWhich is why I was intrigued to recently learn about two types of envy. I evidently belong in the 'benign' category, which compels people to be more ambitious and to work harder in an attempt to catch up with the Joneses. The other category is 'malicious envy'. This is when the intention isn't to catch up but to tear down. It's a mean-spirited mentality characterised by a wish the person you envy will be dragged down to your level … and preferably lower.\nThat people like me are at risk of getting worse has been demonstrated in a new analysis by the University of Cambridge, which found \"malicious envy is more likely within neoliberalism\". That's because our economic system deems achievements to be truly successful only by the extent to which they push us further up the financial hierarchy.\nAs the authors note: \"Success that is measured by non-financial means – such as work that is fulfilling, rewarding in its own right, or based on intangible markers – is irrelevant according to the neoliberal rubric. Within neoliberalism, unless success is financially rewarded, it is devalued.\"\nAdvertisement So here's what's happening. As the gap between the rich and the poor widens, so too does the prevalence of envy. And what the scholars are particularly concerned about is that, as the gap continues to get larger, people who are in the benign category may be tempted to venture into the malicious one.\nIt's not surprising the workplace is one location at which envy is at its most potent. Several reasons explain why. In most organisations, employees compete for scarce resources, opportunities, rewards, support and attention. The unequal distribution of those desired objects, even when their distribution is conducted meritoriously, is the trigger for envy. Competition trumps collaboration.\nIn the short term, the reaction is often emotional. For some people, it's anger. For others, it's resentment – or distress, sadness, isolation, fear, rejection and a loss of self-esteem.\nThose emotions were identified a few months ago in two studies published in the Journal of Social Psychology. Those emotions, I guess, are to be expected. So here, then, is what's particularly interesting. Many leaders assume competition in the workplace, and the envy that ensues, is a positive thing because it motivates employees to try harder in a desperate attempt to avoid being the loser. The reality, though, as the researchers discovered, is that:\n\"Victims of this dysfunctional dynamic develop a sense of failure, uselessness, and diminished self-respect, which can harm their performance significantly. Regrettably, a vicious cycle may thus be established.\"\nIn effect, people who don't have a healthy view of themselves, who don't see themselves as worthwhile, will struggle to perform better in the future. Competitive cultures, in other words, can be counterproductive.\nThat doesn't mean you should introduce socialist practices into the workplace. Far from it. But what it does mean is that if you're a leader keen on reducing envy within your team, it's wise to heed the scholars' suggestions:\nProvide coaching and care to all employees rather than just a select few. If your time is spread thin, appoint some of your most competent team members to mentor and support their colleagues. Communicate openly and comprehensively so that employees understand decisions are based on merit as opposed to favouritism. Boost people's self-esteem by recognising their positive attributes and by incorporating their strengths into their job. Ultimately, you can keep distributing resources, rewards and opportunities unequally. Individual effort, after all, should be acknowledged. Just bear in mind you might end up generating some unintended consequences; consequences that verge on the malicious.\nDo you get envious at work?
