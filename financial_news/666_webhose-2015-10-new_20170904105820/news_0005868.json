There is confusion about what really impacts one’s credit score. Here the author enlists all the parameters and explains how they impact credit score. Post your opinion here Rajiv Raj Creditvidya.com In order to get a loan at competitive interest rates, it is mandatory to have a CIBIL score of 750 and above. This is a fact that most people are unaware of, despite the information overload about credit score and its impact. If you too are among those who are still confused as to what really impacts your CIBIL score, worry no more! Here is the lowdown about what really affects your CIBIL score, technically termed as credit score. What really matters: Make timely payments - The one hack to pump up your CIBIL score is to make all your payments on time. This is applicable to all the credit you already have. This includes credit card outstandings and EMIs on loans. Also make sure you make other payments such as insurance premiums etc on time, though it does not fall under the credit bracket. Even a single late payment on a home loan or an unpaid outstanding on your credit card, will bring your CIBIL score tumbling down and be a blemish on your CIBIL report. The total amount of credit you have availed of - Credit is something that is easily available today. You therefore probably have at least two or three credit cards that you are using simultaneously, along with a home or a vehicle loan. While you are particular about repaying EMIs, you think it is ok to pile on the debt on your credit card, because you are far from your credit limit. If you are under any such impression, stop right there! The amount you owe to your lenders makes a large impact on your credit score. The closer you are to your credit limit, the worse its gets! Ideally you should not be using more than 30% of your total credit limit at any given time. For how long you have had credit - “Credit history” as it is called in financial parlance has a large impact on your CIBIL score. If you have availed of credit for a long time and have serviced it well, it certainly fetches you brownie points to increase your CIBIL score. A good credit history gives a prospective lender the confidence to lend to you. Too much credit in a short period of time - If you apply for too many credit cards or loans close to each other, it sets the alarm bell ringing for any bank. As for your CIBIL score, it inches lower each time you apply for a new loan. Everytime you apply for a new credit card or loan, there is a “hard enquiry” made on your CIBIL score and CIBIL report, bringing down the score a few notches lower each time. Good and bad debt - Believe it or not, the kind of debt you avail of, makes an impact on your CIBIL score. While home, vehicle and student loans fall under the category of good debt because they are “secured” in nature, “unsecured” loans such as too many credit cards or personal loans spell trouble and bring your CIBIL score down. What does not matter Your age - Your CIBIL report does carry yor date of birth, but it does not play any role in the computation of your score. Your address - Once again, your address is recorded, merely as a part of yoru personal information record, but does not have any impact on your CIBIL score. Your bank account and investments - It is a good practice to keep your finances in order, but your savings and investments do not feature as a part of your CIBIL score. A credit score, as the name explains merely has to do with credit. The interest rate on loans - Its great if you have managed to get a loan at a lower rate, but even if you have availed of a loan at a higher rate of interest, you have nothing to worry, as long as you are servicing it on time. The rate of interest does not have any impact on your CIBIL score. So now that you know about exactly what impacts your CIBIL score and what does not, we hope, you will be able to use the information to your advantage to boost your CIBIL score. \nRELATED NEWS Don't have an account yet? - Register now Ask the Experts Get your Personal Finance queries answered Select Topic Taxation Q Interest rates are going to go down.
