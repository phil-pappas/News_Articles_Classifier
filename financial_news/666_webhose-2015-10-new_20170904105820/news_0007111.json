After raising investment loan rates by 0.27 percentage points in July, CBA announced on Thursday that it would jack up all investment and owner-occupied costs by another 0.15 percentage points. NAB followed suit with a 0.17 percentage point top up on Friday.\nLet's unravel what this means for the two biggest behemoths. Investment and owner-occupied products account for 37 per cent and 63 per cent, respectively, of the $497 billion of home loans sitting on CBA's balance sheet. This means that the July and October hikes add up to exactly 0.25 percentage points across all CBA home loans. It is a mathematically elegant green light to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut its cash rate by the same margin. If the banks fully pass on the reduction (a bold expectation), borrowers will be in the same position they were before the out-of-cycle hikes.\nInterestingly, Australia's second largest bank, Westpac, has slugged borrowers with a noticeably chunkier rate increase despite – or perhaps because of – its relatively skinnier capital ratios. Westpac has a greater exposure to investment loans than CBA and they account for 46.3 per cent of the $475 billion of residential mortgages on Westpac's balance sheet. The remaining 53.7 per cent comprises owner-occupied borrowers.\nSince July Westpac has raised investment product costs by 0.47 percentage points and owner-occupied loans by 0.20 percentage points. On a weighted-average basis, it has therefore boosted its home loan margins by a substantial 0.33 percentage points.\nThe financial system inquiry (FSI) concluded that the majors would have to lift lending rates by about 0.1 percentage points for every 1 percentage point increase in their common equity tier one (CET1) capital ratios. This of course assumes they pass on the higher equity funding costs entirely to customers, which in a truly competitive market they would not be able to do.\nThe only folks who might be surprised by the fact that we have an exceedingly oligopolistic banking system are the dupes inside the RBA and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which have for decades eagerly exclaimed otherwise.\nSince June 2014 the banks have collected $31 billion in CET1 capital through rights issues, dividend reinvestment plans, asset sales and retained earnings, which has pushed up their CET1 ratios by at least 1 percentage point. (ANZ boss Mike Smith's fairy tales came true!\nExposures Diving into CBA and Westpac's Pillar 3 reports, one finds that home loans account for 54 per cent and 52 per cent of their respective credit exposures. Accordingly, if they plan on preserving net interest margins for the benefit of shareholders, and only adjusting the cost of residential mortgages (not business or personal loans), they need to boost lending rates by about 0.19 percentage points for every 1 percentage point increase in their CET1 ratio.\nA wrinkle here is that APRA recently announced that the majors were in fact short \"at least\" 2 percentage points of capital, which it privately presumes to be CET1. This would get the majors to the 10 per cent CET1 ratio \"line in the sand\" that many analysts and investors think is the minimum \"new normal\". And it implies CBA and Westpac have to expand mortgage margins by roughly 0.38 percentage points. Given they have only done 0.25 and 0.33 percentage points, respectively, there would appear to be more hikes (or less than full pass-through) coming.\nFurther funding cost pressures are being imposed on the banks by APRA's requirement that they lengthen the maturity of their bonds and deposits to minimise acute asset-liability mismatches that cause strife in liquidity (solvency) crises. They are also being asked to replace a significant chunk of their short-term offshore funding with domestic or long-term overseas money, which could carry a dearer price. The key take away is that the major banks' profits are being squeezed from many directions.\nWe've certainly come a long way since a prominent former banker complained in January 2012 that regulators had \"tightened capital ratios at the same time as overseas funding is hard to get and credit isn't growing very much, which is not what you want to happen\".\nThis same banker was subsequently Quote: d dismissing the International Monetary Fund's November 2012 finding that the majors were inadequately capitalised. \"Higher capital at a time when you want to fund the economy and make sure banks can lend – it ultimately constricts the rate of lending growth,\" he responded. \"The issue is not more capital in my mind.\"\nDavid Murray was to experience his own dramatic conversion as chairman of the FSI on the road to Damascus. After briefings from the best banking experts in the world, Murray would focus much of the FSI's final report on addressing the problem that the major banks' equity capital ratios were clearly \"not unquestionably strong'\". \"They should be ranked in the top 25 per cent of global banks [but]…are currently somewhere between the global median and the 75th percentile,\" he warned.\nInsolvent Indeed, the FSI found that the majors' weak 4.5 per cent \"leverage ratios\", which reflect the value of equity capital divided by credit exposures, would \"render [them] insolvent in the absence of further capital raising\" in the event of an \"asset value shock…within the range of shocks experienced overseas during the GFC\".\nThis insight was lent credence by two APRA studies. The first was its 2014 stress tests, which showed that a severe recession could theoretically wipe out all the equity capital the majors held as insurance against losses on home loans. That shocking result was not news to readers of the banks' regulatory filings: Westpac's June 2015 disclosures state it held merely $6.2 billion of equity against $475 billion of home loans, which means it is leveraged an absurd 76.6 times within this business.\nThe second study was a 2015 comparison of the majors' capital ratios with 94 peers overseas. This revealed the majors' all-important tier one capital leverage ratios, which investors rely on during crises because they cannot be manipulated, were actually \"below the median\" (or 50th percentile) of their global competitors, with the 75th percentile bank at a much higher 6 per cent.\nAfter the government this week delegated responsibility for implementing the FSI's banking recommendations to APRA, the resilience of the system now rests with chairman Wayne Byres. Thankfully the early reads are encouraging.\nOn Thursday Byres told parliament he was \"surprised\" to learn that lending standards among Australian banks, including the majors, had fallen to \"horribly low levels\" that were \"lacking in common sense\". This news was partly triggered by analysis published by this author reporting that NAB and other lenders were blatantly flouting APRA's December 2014 dictate that they apply a minimum 7 per cent interest rate when testing borrowers' repayment capacities. The banks were sneakily using the 7 per cent benchmark only for new loans and not applying it to an investment borrower's existing owner-occupied mortgage debts, which were being assessed on rates as low as 4 per cent to 5 per cent over 25-year periods.\nCrowing APRA's hard-hitting criticisms contradicted years of crowing from the RBA about the conservatism of Australia's big banks. \"The tightening in banks' lending standards since [the global financial crisis] has improved the underlying resilience of their loan books to adverse macroeconomic conditions,\" the RBA alleged in its March 2013 financial stability review. That year the RBA also repeatedly dismissed our warnings of the risk of a housing bubble emerging.\nThe next big story for the banks will likely derive from the government's decision to embrace the FSI's recommendation that APRA introduce a minimum leverage ratio of up to 5 per cent. My analysis indicates that even after raising $31 billion in equity, the majors' leverage ratios remain well below 5 per cent (see table). Significantly, Westpac is by far the worst at just 4.3 per cent, which is miles below the median peer bank globally and may explain its more aggressive attempts to expand mortgage margins (more equity raisings are coming).\nIf APRA only lifts the minimum leverage ratio to 5 per cent (as Switzerland did this week), the majors will have to find another $15.6 billion of tier one capital, which will put them around the 50th percentile peer bank globally. It is, however, hard to fathom how APRA could define this as \"unquestionably strong\" given that the 75th percentile bank is at 6 per cent. If we suppose that the de facto target ends up being around, say, 5.5 per cent, the majors will have to accumulate an extra $34.5 billion in tier one equity over what they have currently (asset growth lifts that number by about 6 per cent annually). The neat thing about a 5.5 per cent leverage ratio is that it also gives the majors \"total loss absorbing capacity\" (TLAC) of 16 per cent, which is set to become the standard for the biggest banks by 2019.\nAll of this is very achievable and will furnish investors and taxpayers with materially lower risks.\nChristopher Joye is a director and shareholder in Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income investment portfolios.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:00:46.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
