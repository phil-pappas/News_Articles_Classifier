I believe it's underowned. It should be a part of every investment portfolio, maybe five to 10 per cent,' says billionaire investor Paul Singer. Share on twitter by Karen Maley The gold price surged to its highest level in more than three months overnight – climbing 1.84 per cent to $US1,186.90 - as disappointing US retail sales made investors even more confident that the US central bank would delay any interest rate increase.\nEnthusiasm for the precious metal also strengthened after billionaire investor Paul Singer argued that gold is a hedge against the policies of the world's major central banks that have pushed their key rates close to zero.\n\"In a world where the value of paper money is affirmatively aimed at being degraded by central bank policy, it's kind of surprising to me that gold can't catch a bid,\" Singer, who founded Elliott Management, told a conference in Tel Aviv on Wednesday. \"I like gold. I believe it's underowned. It should be a part of every investment portfolio, maybe five to 10 per cent.\"\nSinger also took aim at what he called the \"cult of central banking\" in which investors turned to US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi to solve the problems of the global financial system. While policies by the world's central banks had \"levitated\" the prices of bonds and equities, Singer said he was surprised at how few investors he met owned gold.\nFor his own part, Singer said he preferred to own options on gold to maximise the returns when it \"feels like something institutional investors need to own\", adding that the supply of gold cannot be ramped up in a short period of time.\nThe increased interest in gold comes at a time when some of the world's biggest investment names have seen their reputations badly tarnished due to their failure to negotiate major market turns.\nStar investor Michael Novogratz is to leave Fortress Investment Group after the firm this week decided to close its flagship macro hedge fund, which was set up in 2002 to bet on major global economic trends.\nBut the fund has had a disastrous year – it was down 17.5 per cent in the year ended September – after losing money on its investments in Brazil, and its bets on US government bonds and the Japanese yen, which prompted investors to withdraw their money. The Fortress fund manages about $US1.6 billion, down from more than $8 billion in 2007.\n Recent market turbulence has also damaged the performance of many other multibillion-dollar hedge funds, with David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital having their worst year since the financial crisis.\nAs an industry, hedge funds, which charge high fees and pride themselves on their ability to deliver superior returns regardless of market conditions, lost 1.4 per cent in the year ended September.\nSome hedge fund managers argue their poor performance reflects the decision of the world's major central banks to keep interest rates close to zero, which has completely distorted the prices of financial assets and left markets at the whim of policy-makers.\nOthers point to China's unexpected move to devalue the yuan, which triggered a major sell-off in emerging market assets.", "external_links": ["http://topics.wsj.com/person/E/David-Einhorn/115", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley", "http://topics.wsj.com/person/A/William-Ackman/6984"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:07:07.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
