Saga’s stance is both ignorant and unfair.” \nMr Nelson explained that he was a member of the British Beekeepers’ Association, which included third-party liability insurance. \nBut Saga argued that a “customer” buying honey from his front garden could be stung by a bee and sue the Nelsons, meaning their monthly insurance premiums should increase from £354 to £700. \nMr Nelson, a retired orthodontist who said selling honey in his front garden wouldn’t cover costs, said he “hasn’t sold a single jar” for fear of invalidating his home insurance. \nSaga agreed to drop the premium increase when Telegraph Money questioned the decision, mysteriously declaring it was the result of “human error”. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has now issued guidance to its underwriters on how to define a “small business”. \nSaga’s Paul Green, who is also a beekeeper, said: “You don’t need to have business cover for having a few people coming to the garden gate and buying some pots of honey or selling it to friends and family. \n“Underwriting is as much an art as a science with judgment being used as well as the cold fact of someone saying they were now operating a small business.” \n= The 'zero value claims trap' = \nYet Telegraph Money regularly hears from customers who feel unfairly penalised for telling their insurers seemingly innocuous details which are later used to increase their bills. \nOne phone call by Clare Laird to her insurer led to a £300-a-month premium increase after she inquired about replacing a door panel in her Edinburgh home. \nUnknown to her, Direct Line (Other OTC: DIISD - news ) had placed a “zero value claim” notification on her account because she had discussed making a claim. When her renewal letter arrived last month, her premium had risen. \nCar (HKSE: 0699-OL.HK - news ) insurers will also use “zero value claims” to ramp up premiums, as another Telegraph Money reader discovered this July. \nJill Shelton, 69, was at work when a driver reversed into her parked car, leaving a note with his contact details. The driver’s insurance covered the cost of the damage. \nBut Admiral logged the claim as a “no fault” incident and increased her cover by £200 , saying that, statistically, drivers who report an accident that is not their fault will go on to cause an “at-fault” accident. \nAt the same time, if you don’t give your insurer full information, they can accuse you of failing to declare the facts. \nAny information a firm considers “material” that the insurer later discovers could be used as an excuse to refuse to pay out claims, for example if a detail means they would not have offered cover in the first place. \n= Why your 'hobby' could pose a risk = \nBritain’s compensation culture is to blame for insurers’ nervousness around people like Bruce and Anne Nelson, experts say. \n“We’re becoming more 'American’ in that people are more likely to sue if they hurt themselves,” said Karl Evans, a broker specialising in home insurance. \n“This means that if anyone is entering your property, even if to buy a few pots of honey, the insurer could argue that there is a greater risk of them seeking compensation if they trip over.” \nPersonal (LSE: PGH.L - news ) liability cover typically ranges from £3m to £5m. \nRenting out your home for a few days while you are away, for example, or having a friend to stay as a lodger, could invalidate your insurance for this very reason. \nMr Evans said: “If you have a guest for the weekend, your insurer won’t see this as a business, but if you charge someone rent for a few months you need to tell them.” \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:55:35.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
