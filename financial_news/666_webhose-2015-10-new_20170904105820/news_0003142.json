Given we have all of this ongoing, we have excluded ourselves from trading in the shares... it would not be appropriate”. \nMr Lewis said he was included in a list of board members who would “definitely” like to invest but had barred themselves from doing so. \nTesco said on Wednesday that its “portfolio reshaping” programme had concluded and it would keep data analytics business Dunnhumby after a failed auction. Last month, Tesco agreed the £4.2bn sale of its South Korean business to an Asian private equity firm MBK . \nThe company has declined to comment on an ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over last year’s £326m “blackhole” accounting scandal although there have been reports that it was preparing to enter into a “plea bargain” with the authority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:52:46.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
