However, revenue is expected to decline year over year.\nCitigroup has been forecast, by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters , to report earnings of $1.28 per share on revenue of $18.56 billion for the September ended period.\n\nLast year, the company posted earnings of $1.15 per share excluding CVA/DVA on revenue of $19.6 billion for the 2014 third quarter.\nShares of Citigroup are up by 0.35% to $51.46 on Tuesday afternoon.\nCitigroup is a New York City-based multinational banking and financial services company. The company's clients include individual consumers, corporations, governments and other financial institutions.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates CITIGROUP INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate CITIGROUP INC (C) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, attractive valuation levels, expanding profit margins, good cash flow from operations and impressive record of earnings per share growth. Although no company is perfect, currently we do not see any significant weaknesses which are likely to detract from the generally positive outlook.\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Commercial Banks industry. The net income increased by 2562.6% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $182.00 million to $4,846.00 million. 42.63% is the gross profit margin for CITIGROUP INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 21.51% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 707.80% to $16,253.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow of 707.80%, CITIGROUP INC is still growing at a significantly lower rate than the industry average of 3018.12%. CITIGROUP INC reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, CITIGROUP INC reported lower earnings of $2.19 versus $4.25 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($5.55 versus $2.19).
