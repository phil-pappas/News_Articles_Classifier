Eight people have died worldwide because of exploding inflators and more than 100 have been hurt.\nAbout 23.4 million Takata driver and passenger air bag inflators have been recalled on 19.2 million U.S. vehicles sold by 11 automakers, including Honda and Fiat Chrysler. As of Sept. 1, only 4.4 million inflators had been replaced.\nNHTSA recently sent letters to seven more companies seeking information and warning that the recalls could be expanded.\nThe deadly flaw in Takata air bag inflators continues to spread to newer vehicles.\nOver the weekend, GM said that it was recalling more than 400 vehicles because the side air bag inflators could rupture and send shrapnel into drivers and passengers, according to the company and documents posted by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nConsumer Discretionary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:13:00.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
