Photo: AFR\nAs mining at MZI Resources' Keysbrook project kicks off, investors are eyeing the mineral sands producer's forecast earnings margins with interest.\nMZI Resources is expected to commence 24-hour mining operations at Keysbrook, just 70 kilometres from Perth, on Monday, ahead of first production of its zircon and leucoxene products in November.\nMZI managing director Trevor Matthews said as the miner tracked closer to first free cashflow from Keysbrook, investor interest in the company had increased, boosting its share price accordingly. Shares in MZI have jumped more than 40 per cent from 38¢ at the beginning of September to 54¢ on Friday.\nOne of the key drivers behind the interest in MZI is the Keysbrook project's forecast earnings margins, Mr Matthews said.\nAdvertisement Even at a time when mineral sands spot prices are soft, MZI expects Keysbrook to generate an earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation margin of more than 50 per cent, or EBITDA of about $40 million at current prices and exchange rates.\n\"If there is any improvement in prices that will only improve our earnings as well but clearly we are profitable and will make pretty strong cashflows even in current conditions,\" Mr Matthews said.\nMineral sands producers have endured an extended period of price weakness after prices hit significant highs in 2012 but analysts largely expect an improvement in coming years.\nOn Thursday, Iluka Resources, the world's largest producer of zircon, said global and regional economic conditions continued to weigh on market sentiment and prices.\nMr Matthews said Keysbrook's development was tracking on budget and ahead of schedule, aided by the benefits of building during the down cycle.\n\"The fact we are coming out of the construction boom certainly makes access to resources and materials a lot better when you are trying to develop a project,\" he said. \"But that comes back to counter cyclical investment in the development of the project . . . and you need financiers prepared to back that.\"\nMZI secured $US110 million funding last year from RMB Australia Holdings and Resource Capital Funds to finance the development of the operation. RCF holds just over 30 per cent of the company's stock.\nMonday also heralds a first for S2 Resources, the exploration spin-off born from the merger of Sirius Resources and Independence Group.\nS2 will list on the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday morning and is expected to initially trade around 15¢ per share.\nVeteran Perth prospector Mark Creasy will be the company's largest shareholder on listing, with 35 per cent of the stock.\nFormer Sirius managing director Mark Bennett will head the new company, which starts its life with about $20 million cash and West Australian and Scandinavian exploration assets formerly owned by Sirius.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:57:15.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
