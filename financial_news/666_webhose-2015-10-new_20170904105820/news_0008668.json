To quote the report directly: \nFor the first time, the number of persons aged 65 years and older exceeded the number of children aged 0 to 14 years. \nWill the world start pandering more to Seniors now? That is where the money is, see the interesting graphic below from the report, and there are going to be a lot more of us soon too! \nFor those not in the Ottawa area, Ottawa lost an adopted son with the passing of Max Keeping yesterday. I am an adopted son of Ottawa now too (having lived here longer than I have anywhere else), and Max Keeping was the voice of News for a very long time, so I am sad to see him passing, but he had been having a touch fight with cancer. Did I agree with all of his opinions? No, but I respected the way he portrayed the news. Rest in Peace Max. Population aged 0 to 14 years and 65 years and older, as of July 1, 1995 to 2035, Canada My Writings for Week Ending October 2nd \nA busy life week for me, so only two posts, but an oldie but goodie seems to be gaining some attention What Money Twits are there on the Internet ? This week I highlighted a few of my favorites You do realize that Government cheques are no longer going to be mailed out in less thana year? How hard could it be to Direct Deposit Enrolment for Government Benefits ? Not hard What could be financially Dumber Than Snaked Mittens ? You might be very surprised if you read this old tid bit of mine Interested in reading about Security and Technology Tweets for the week? Check them out on this site’s sister publication. Facebook Fun of the Week \nOf course you can trust me : Money Stories and the Changing Colours of Autumn \nFor those with Netflix The Imitation Game is now available (in Canada), an interesting movie about Alan Turing. Alan Turing had a great curiosity for Mathematics and Puzzle solving, which is interesting as the Blunt Bean Counter points out Curiosity May Kill the Cat, But it can Bring Alive Personal Relationships , where he comments on the importance of curiosity in your life. Stay curious, but don’t be too nosy either. Do you and your spouse talk about your finances? The Frugal Trader brings us a Letter to My Wife – How Our Finances Work , does your spouse understand your finances? \nI have lived through a lay off (and an extended job search ) so I can attest to the importance of Money We Have’s article on How to Prepare for Unemployment importance. Many of us just never see it coming, but a little preparation can make it a lot easier for you. Retirement is another form of unemployment, but it is still important to understand so Marie from Boomer and Echo brings us Understanding Your Retirement Benefits (Part 3) . In Ontario if the new Ontario Pension Plan happens, that will even be more confusing. \nI gave blood for the 24th time this week. My goal is to break 100 before I have to stop giving blood, but it will take some real dedication on my part. Someone who cares about Blood and such is My Own Advisor, and he points out that Retirement is closer than you think – as long as you can work until age 65 , which is true, and a smaller group of the N.C.F.B.A. met this week, for fellowship and some financial kibitzing too. \n\nIrrationally Yours sounds like an interesting book, and Michael James reviews it and it sounds like he enjoyed the read. A blogger turning his content into a book? Might be a not too bad idea. \n\nThe Super Rich \nThis documentary on TVO (do you support them? you should) shows just how the Super Rich (aka the 0.1%) get life pretty damn easy in terms of countries pandering to them: Autism Grows Up? \nTVO had another interesting documentary which was very close to my heart , and worth watching for those wondering what parents such as myself worry about at night. 2015 Random Thoughts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:19:20.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
