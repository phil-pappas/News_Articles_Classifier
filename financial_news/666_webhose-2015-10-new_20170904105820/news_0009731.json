Sean Gallup Share on twitter by Misa Han Owners of 91,000 cheating Volkswagen may be eligible for extended warranties, replacement vehicles or even full refunds, consumer lawyers and advocates say.\nOn Wednesday, Volkswagen Australia and Audi Australia confirmed there are over 91,000 cheating vehicles on the road in Australia , including 14,000 Audis, 55,000 VW passenger cars, 17,000 VW commercial vehicles and 5000 Skodas.\nDrivers can check if their Volkswagen, Audi or Skoda is fitted with the cheating emissions device on volkswagendieselinfo.com.au by entering their vehicle identification number.\nVolkswagen has said customers of affected vehicles do not need to take any further action until the head office offers a technical fix.\nBut consumer lawyers and advocates say VW owners may be entitled to more than a simple technical fix by VW.\nï»¿ Matt Levey of consumer group CHOICE said consumers may be eligible for replacement vehicles or a full refund if there has been a \"major failure\".\n\"Our message to people who have purchased an affected car is the VW fix is not your only option. If they diminish the vehicle's environmental performance and fuel efficiency, our view is that it's not simply about the fix,\" he said.\nHe said if the fitting of the emissions-rigging device constituted a \"major failure\", consumers would have a right to full refund, or the right to be provided with a replacement vehicle.\n Even if there was no major failure, consumers might be entitled to compensation, particularly if the resale value of the car was reduced, he said.\n'Pocket thousands of dollars' Maurice Blackburn class actions principal Damian Scattini said consumers would be able to \"pocket thousands of dollars\" for each cheating Volkswagen.\n\"You paid for a premium for that car on the understanding that it is a green vehicle that meets the acceptable emissions standard and has high performance, and it turns out those are mutually exclusive promises.\"\nMr Scattini said they would be entitled to much more than just a technical fix.\n\"It has an immediate effect on the value of the vehicle because the vehicle doesn't meet the performance standard you paid for.\n\"They ripped you off essentially and we will be contending for warranty coverage to be extended from the time the new chip is put in.\"\nHe said consumers could also be entitled to the difference in value between the initial purchase price and the resale price, which would be lower due to depreciation and immediate loss of the value of the vehicle on the back of the revelation it is fitted with a cheating device.\nMaurice Blackburn is threatening a class action against Volkswagen and more than 1000 drivers have registered their interest in a potential class action by the law firm.\nConsumer watchdog ACCC is investigating Volkswagen for possible use of defeat devices in Australia and the office of the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Major Projects Paul Fletcher said the fitting of the emissions defeat devices may breach the motor vehicle safety laws as well as consumer laws.\nVolkswagen says it is safe to continue to drive the cars until they can be inspected or repaired.", "external_links": ["http://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-update-on-vw-enforcement-investigation", "https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://volkswagendieselinfo.com.au/Content/Document/VGAstatement07-10-15.pdf", "http://volkswagendieselinfo.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-08T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:39:28.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
