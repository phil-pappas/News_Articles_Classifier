Shoreline Group, owner of the airport, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently with the handling company to provide ground handling services at the Osubi Airport. According to nahco aviance, the agreement would give the company exclusive right for ground handling services at the airport including passenger, ramp, and cargo operation. Presently, some carriers operating in Osubi include Aero, Arik, and Escravos (operated by Aero). The MoU also provides for nahco aviance to negotiate separate agreements with the other operators using the airport. Expressing his delight over the new deal, the Chief Commercial Officer of the Company, Mr. Seyi Adewale said that there had been relatively good successes through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and government's concession initiatives in the aviation sub-sector is a good example. \"Airports within the country now have opportunities for new capital (investments) to improve airport infrastructure and also improve the overall airport architecture that helps facilitate excellent Passenger experience within our borders. \"Using this partnership model, we are currently witnessing concessioned airport terminals outperforming the publicly managed airport terminals and many of these concessioned airports rely on NAHCO in-part to achieve this feat,\" Adewale said. He added: \"Specific to Osubi Airport, we would be bringing over 35years aviation ground handling capabilities to further accentuate the excellent passenger experience through passenger handling competences, skilled manpower, up-to-date (airport) technology, tools and equipment, world class management structure and its competence to make Osubi airport a reference point for efficient and effective aviation ground handling services.\" Nigeria \nFOLLOWING the confirmation of President Muhammadu Buhari's nominees for ministerial appointment by the Nigerian Senate … see more » Copyright © 2015 This Day.
