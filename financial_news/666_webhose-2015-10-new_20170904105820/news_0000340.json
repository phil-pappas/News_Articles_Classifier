Here's a hint: It's not the Commonwealth Bank. Dallas Kilponen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston There are chill winds blowing through the ministerial wing of Canberra's Parliament House at the mention of Brian Hartzer 's Westpac.\nLast week, of course, the nation's second biggest company tapped the market for $3.5 billion of new equity (becoming the fourth of the Big Four to do so) but also added a political right hook: jacking up its home loan interest rates by 20 basis points.\nCan you imagine how delighted the office of new Treasurer Scott Morrison was to receive the bank's courtesy call on this one? And the messenger? The bank's government relations head Brett Gale , a former adviser to Labor Treasurer (and now ScoMo's opposite number) Chris Bowen . The old Joe Hockey regime wasn't bothered by this particular nicety, being far less tribal, but sadly for Westpac, the ScoMo show ain't so.\nWestpac directly attributed its interest rate increase on increased capital holding requirements imposed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority . APRA did so in response to David Murray 's Financial System Inquiry (which APRA may as well have written itself!).\nBrian Hartzer: talking points distributed to Westpac's 40,000-odd thousand staff to help with hostile customers. Andrew Meares And which bank was in charge of the industry-wide lobbying effort on the FSI? No, not the Commonwealth Bank! It was Westpac, during Gail Kelly 's rotation as chair of the Australian Bankers' Association . Kelly must've been too busy on her victory lap to notice the biggest political iceberg coming at the big banks in two decades.\nAt this point we should probably slow clap Kelly's and Hartzer's top lieutenant on all things politics: Carolyn McCann . Again.\nIt was once National Australia Bank on the Liberal Party's dartboard, run by Wayne Swan 's mates Cameron Clyne and George Wright . But we suspect, right now, ScoMo prefers NAB's new God-botherer chief Andrew Thorburn to the clueless at red Westpac.\nWestpac's corporate affairs chief Carolyn McCann.
