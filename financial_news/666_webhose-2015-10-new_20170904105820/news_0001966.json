Anthony Johnson by Sally Rose As Australian superannuation funds grapple with how to maximise returns amid the outlook for a prolonged period of weakness in financial markets their focus is tipped to turn from big money punts toward strategies to find small savings.\n\"Predicting the future is cocktail party talk that grabs headlines; the tedious side to the work of fund managers is figuring out the most efficient way to implement those strategies,\" Parametric Portfolio Services chief executive Brian Langstraat said. \"It's boring, but can make a big difference to how much money people have when they retire.\n\"Increasingly the management and boards of super funds are realising it is a key part of their fiduciary duty to actively manage the implementation of their investment strategy to minimise leakage of member returns through brokerage, foreign exchange and tax.\"\nThat represents a business opportunity for Parametric, which makes money by providing an \"engineered portfolio solution\" service to pension funds in the United States and Canada.\nThe savings to a fund from centralising its implementation strategy is typically around 0.5 per cent of investment returns a year, he said.\n\"That sounds modest ,but our modelling shows that for the average Australian fund member entering the workforce today, over their working lifetime and including the benefits of compound interest, those savings could equate to close to $250,000 more in their account at retirement.\n\"Financial markets will always be uncertain, so it makes sense for funds to control the costs they can\".\nThe firm set up a small local office four years ago but has struggled to win clients in a period when Australian super fund trustees have been focused on complying with the SuperStream reforms, which have required an overhaul of back-office systems.\n An abundance of tax loss credits from the years during the global financial crisis also meant funds felt no urgency to tighten up their after-tax management systems. That is changing.\nParametric analysis of Australian Prudential Regulation Authority data showed the majority of funds had used up the last of these tax credits by the end of 2014.\nAn APRA ruling two years ago also placed an official obligation on super funds to focus on after-tax returns.\nLegitimate methods of reducing tax leakage that super funds have been urged to focus on include deferring tax losses, timing capital gains, and managing franking credits.\nOne notable local client is Qantas Super, which used Parametric's services as part of a major overhaul that stripped responsibility for executing trades away from its fund managers who are paid to make the investment decisions, and pooled that task with execution specialists .\nThe initiative saved members in Qantas Super's default growth option 38.3 basis points, $23.6 million, in the 12 months to June 30, 2014. Around 80 per cent of those savings came from reducing tax losses.\nOn his visit to Australia this week, Mr Langstraat's first in three years, he will meet with 15 super funds as well as all four of the major asset consulting firms that service the local industry: Jana, Towers Watson, Frontier and Mercer.\nAsset consultants have warned that super funds risk missing their long-term investment return targets over the coming decade, reflecting weak global economic growth, the unwinding of the massive experiment in quantitative easing, and record-low interest rates in Australia .\nMr Langstraat is hopeful the gloomy outlook will be good for business.\n\"In anticipation of lower returns over the coming years, super funds are more focused than ever on the need to make their investment strategy work as hard as possible to squeeze out every last basis point of return,\" he said.\n\"As many funds turn to more expensive asset classes such as infrastructure and hedge funds to generate returns, that will add to their investment fees, so finding other ways to bring down costs will become even more important\".\nParametric has $US1.5 billion ($2.05 billion) in assets under management.
