Current market conditions should allow a successful sale and the realisation of value for the taxpayer. \n\"The universal postal service is strongly protected by law and Ofcom has a duty to ensure its provision. Therefore the government sees no policy reason to retain a stake in Royal Mail.\" \nThe Chancellor has been exiting the Government's stake in Royal Mail this year as he is looking to raise a total of £1.5bn, as part of a £4.5bn debt reduction plan. \nA sale of a 15pc holding, at 500p in June, raised £750m, and last month a 1pc shareholding worth was transferred to the Royal Mail Share Incentive Plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:00:53.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
