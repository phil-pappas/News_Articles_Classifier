Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle France would assist Australia to build a \"sovereign and autonomous\" submarine industry in Australia, French Ambassador Christophe Lecourtier said on Tuesday, as part of a more comprehensive engagement in a region where one million French citizens live.\nAmbassador Lecourtier addressed the National Press Club as lobbying intensifies over the $50 billion contract for Australia's new submarine contract.\nFrance is one of three countries – along with Germany and Japan – whose companies are bidding for the deal, with heavy backing from their governments.\nWhile Japan was regarded as the frontrunner under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the field is believed to be much more evenly balanced after the leadership change. Earlier talk of offshore builds has dissipated, with all bidders emphasising commitments of various levels to a local build.\nThe Collins class submarine needs to be replaced and the race to win the contract is heating up. The Age Ambassador Lecourtier made a bid in the court of public opinion on Tuesday that emphasised France's high tech credentials in heavy industry – from high-speed trains and aviation to satellites and the nuclear industry – at a time when the new Australian prime minister has put a heavy emphasis on innovation.\nFrance had a demonstrated capacity to build submarines of the size required by Australia, as a specialist in large ocean going submarines. It's specialisation in nuclear submarines has been argued to weaken its bid for a conventionally powered submarine. But the ambassador argued that nuclear technology had the spin off advantage of creating even higher safety standards for their submarines.\nA government to government agreement would deliver skills and technology to Australia, he said, which France regarded as a first class ally and one to which France was eternally grateful because of links going back to World War One.\nThat gratitude underlay a commitment \"to build in this country a sovereign and autonomous [submarine] industry\".\n \"This is what the country needs and deserves\", he said\nThe Ambassador said France was supportive of the current competitive evaluation process for bidders for the submarine contract, saying he believed it would uncover the best option.\nA French build would only lead to greater naval co-operation between the two countries at a time when France was one of a very few partners that had a naval presence in the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans.\nAmbassador Lecourtier envisaged a more comprehensive engagement for France in the region that, like Australia, was a respected neighbour who was not part of any regional tensions.\nThere were one million French citizens living in the Pacific, he said.\nHe warned that if the region was to become more militarised, the need for a sovereign industry only grew.\nFrance saw its role as empowering partners like Australia strengthen their ability to ensure their own sovereignty\nOpposition defence spokesman Stephen Conroy said Labor's position had consistently been that the government should only consider a domestic build option for a wide range of reasons, including strategic ones.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-10-20T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:06:54.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
