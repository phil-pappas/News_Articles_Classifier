While the bulk of the hiring happens in November, “if you’re going to find those jobs you need to start today,” said Andrew Challenger, vice president, business development at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Many holiday jobs have the potential to turn into full-time positions, as employers often hang onto the best of the holiday hires, Challenger said. If you’re only interested in temporary employment, you shouldn’t mention your short-term intentions at your interview, Challenger said. Instead, emphasize your ability to work flexible hours in various positions as needed.\nPositions generally pay between $8 and $12 an hour. While that’s not much, even a little extra cash can come in handy around the holidays. What’s more, many retailers extend their employee discounts to holiday hires, which usually range from 10% to 20%. Those collecting Social Security payments before their full retirement age should keep in mind that they’ll see their benefits reduced if they earn above certain thresholds. While major retailers list seasonal openings on their websites, the best way to land a job is through good old-fashioned shoe leather, Challenger said. Visit stores where you’d like to work and ask if there’s a manager you can talk to about possible opportunities. It’s best if you target stores where you like to shop. “They love to hire people who love their products,” Challenger said.\n\nGetty Images Slide 2 of 9 Butterball Butterball’s 50-plus experts staff the Turkey Talk-Line from November through December. But the number of local hires the Naperville, Ill.-based Talk-Line makes is relatively small, since the company gets so many repeat employees with backgrounds ranging from registered dietitians to food stylists. These days, it’s not enough for experts draw on their “long history of turkey knowledge” to help panicked home cooks nationwide, said Nicole Johnson, co-director of the Turkey Talk-Line. Experts also have to be adept at fielding calls and questions through social media and live chats.
