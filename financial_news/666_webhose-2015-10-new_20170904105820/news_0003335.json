Photo: EPA \nChina's international payment system for yuan went online on Thursday in a watered down, soft-launch version that did not meet early market expectations. \nPreviously dubbed the China International Payment System, the People's Bank of China formally christened the system as the Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payment System (CIPS). It will operate out of Shanghai for 11 hours a day, instead of the 24-hour, open-to-all system that had been hoped for, which would have allowed global players to access the Chinese onshore market directly. Only 19 banks qualified under the first phase of CIPS. \nThe qualifying banks are 11 Chinese banks and eight international banks. The Chinese banks are Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Hua Xia Bank, Minsheng Bank, China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank, Ping An Bank and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. HSBC, Citi, Standard Chartered, DBS, Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, ANZ and Bank of East Asia make up the international list. \nThe operation will run between 9am and 8pm local time each day, covering the clearing needs of institutions operating between the Asia-Pacific and European time zones. However, American trading hours will not be catered to at this time. \nIt will accept payments related to cross-border trade, direct investments, financing and personal remittances. The system's architectural framework and the level of clearing fees CIPS will charge have not been disclosed, and so cannot be compared with the existing designated clearing bank structure, under which China's state-owned banks currently enjoy monopolies in various global markets. \nKee Joo Wong, the head of global payments and cash management at HSBC Asia-Pacific, said it was \"the start of a journey\". \nIt might be a few months before the market could see how CIPS would measure up against existing global systems, he said, and for the full benefits to be passed on to customers. \nHowever, customers could immediately benefit from same-day turnaround under the straight-through processing of the new system, and expect fewer manual errors. \nIt is unclear if the new system will bring actual cost savings or better yuan pricing to clients offshore, which would allow the offshore price to converge with the onshore price - one significant benefit expected of the system. \nA payment by Ikea through Standard Chartered was the first to be processed on the system. The bank said that between 9am and 5pm on Thursday, it had competed 170 clearings. \nA source with direct knowledge of the matter said that despite the system being officially open throughout the day, there were still times when it would not allow banks to trade. \nWong said that as far as he was aware, the People's Bank of China had not issued guidance or quotas on the volume of yuan that banks would be allowed to clear. \nIndustrial Bank chief economist Lu Zhengwei said the launch would bring the yuan a step closer to meeting the IMF's full list of demands for inclusion as a special drawing rights currency, something he expected to happen next month.
