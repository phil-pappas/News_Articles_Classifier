Government debt funds and short-maturity bonds were particular favourites as they are relatively resilient in a rising interest-rate environment rise.\nETFs, which debuted in the United States in 2002, are increasingly used by both retail investors and institutions as a replacement for corporate bond and government-issued debt.\n(Editing by Louise Ireland )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:35:19.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
