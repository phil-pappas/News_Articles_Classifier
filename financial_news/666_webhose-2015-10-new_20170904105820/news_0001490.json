That marked nearly four consecutive years of price increases, even as the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage actually lowered from 3.94% on October 6, 2011 to 3.85% on October 1 of this year, according to Freddie Mac. According to National Association of Realtors chief economist Lawrence Yun, even a Fed rate hike won't change that .

That number has dropped to roughly 7 million (13% of all homeowners) while the number of equity-rich homes (with at least 50% positive equity) has climbed to more than 11 million, or 20% of all properties. \n“Median home prices nationwide bottomed out in March 2012 and since then have increased 35%, lifting 5.8 million homeowners out of seriously underwater territory,” says Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. “While the remaining seriously underwater properties continue to be a millstone around the neck of some local markets, the growing number of equity rich homeowners should help counteract the downward pull of negative equity in many markets, empowering those housing markets — and by extension their local economies — to walk on water in 2015.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:11:10.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
