Most of the cases have been filed in a New York federal court. \nThe lawsuits come as US regulators step up scrutiny of the bond market following multi-billion dollar settlements with banks over LIBOR and foreign exchange collusion. \nThe New York Department of Financial Services has demanded information from nine big banks in a probe of potential collusion on treasuries, a person familiar with the matter told AFP last month. \nThe US media has reported that the Justice Department is investigating the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:30:27.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
