The success of raising capital through this route lies in the broad development of this market,\" it added.\n\nWhile some of the major banks in India may turn to global markets, that route would bump up cost of capital significantly and put more stress on their profitability.\n\nThe challenge will be to achieve the most optimal model for implementation of Basel III, one that will fortify the sector while not impairing its efficiency or delivery, the report added.\n\n\"In order to achieve this, we need a supportive capital market environment and depth in the corporate bonds market...\" Assocham President Rana Kapoor said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has set a deadline of March 31, 2019, for implementation of these norms even as banks are fighting NPAs and capital market volatility.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:44:47.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
