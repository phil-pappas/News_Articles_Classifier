But the wild vacillations in share prices over the past few months have given even the most seasoned investors reason to pause.\n\"The September quarter was the most volatile I can remember in my 47 years in the market,\" Morningtar's head of equities research, Peter Warnes, wrote on Friday.\nSure, that sounds extreme, but Warnes does have some numbers to back it up: he points out that the All Ordinaries index fluctuated by over 1 per cent in more than half of all the trading days over the three-month period. He reckons that is – at a minimum – twice the normal level of volatility.\nAs for the reasons for volatility broadly, well the answer is straightforward: uncertainty. China's sharemarket crash and shock currency devaluation compounded worries that the country's economy was starting to freefall. Commodity prices have plunged; they've recovered of late, but where they end up in the coming months and years is anybody's guess. The US Fed says it's on the brink of raising rates, but recently looks like it may be too scared to do so. Here in Australia, our economy continues to look unsteady, with growing evidence the one corner of our market providing solid growth – housing construction – may have peaked.\nSo yes to all that, but investors have still been struggling to come to terms with the violence of the share price moves. What's fanning the flames?\nA popular scapegoat has been short sellers, but with limited available data that notion been more based on anecdotes and gut instinct than anything else. But my analysis of regulatory data can, for the first time, provide some hard evidence that short selling has ramped up aggressively over the past five years, and over the past 12 months in particular.\nShort position summary required Short selling, to pinch Investopedia's definition , is a straightforward concept: you borrow a stock, sell the stock and then buy the stock back, preferably at a profit, to return it to the lender.\n ASIC has since mid-2010 required professional investors to provide a summary of their short positions in individual stocks, which the regulator then reports to the market on a daily basis. The so-called \"short report\", released Monday, contained 433 names. By aggregating those individual stocks positions for the first day of every month we can create an overall picture of how short selling on the ASX as a whole has evolved in recent years.\nWhat stands out are a couple of things. Firstly, hedge funds over the past year have become sharply more negative on the Australian sharemarket. Positions betting share prices will fall have increased by more than 50 per cent over that period, a total 5.8 billion shares in ASX-listed companies are now sold short, based on my calculations. That's equivalent to about2 per cent of the issued stock of the companies on the regulator's \"short report\", an even bigger jump of 65 per cent from this time last year, or about1.5 per cent of the issued stock of companies included in the All Ordinaries index.\nThe acceleration in short selling \"clearly reflects the downturn in resources and the concern around that sector,\" Aurora Funds Management chief investment officer John Korr says. \"Investors globally are also looking at an Australia [they believe could be] going into recession and potential hedges around that.\"\nThe second observation from the data is that short positions have tripled over the past five years, which doesn't surprise Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist for Australia, Malcolm Wood.\nHedge funds – that broad group of asset managers that are able to use shorting in their investment strategies – \"are more prevalent in our market than ever before,\" Wood says.\nAnd the Aussie market is not alone in attracting a high level of interest from short sellers. The New York Stock Exchange data shows that short sales on that exchange crash stands at 18.4 billion shares, approaching the peak immediately preceding the GFC.\nPrecipice of a massive crash perhaps? What does that tell us? At first blush, you may get the feeling we are on the precipice of a massive crash – that's what the \"smart money\" is telling us, right? Wrong.\n\"The shorts are often, but not always, right,\" Wood says. Sure, they look to have been on the money so far with Fortescue this year and more recently Woolworths, but they can also get caught out: the sharp snap-back in energy companies, such as Santos, shows how a negative bet can quickly and explosively go wrong.\n\"We think short interest is a reasonably good sentiment indicator,\" says State Street Global Advisers' Olivia Engel, who runs an Australian equities fund with particular emphasis on limiting volatility. \"The rise in short interest tend to coincide with big falls in the market.\" But Engel downplays the predictive power of shorting interest data.\nIn fact, the sharp rise in shorting both here and abroad is \"a false note in the story that it's all about to go south,\" says Graham Harman, investment strategist for Asia Pacific at Russell Investments.\n\"Normally when it's all over red rover, it's 'New World Order', it's [Irving] Fisher in 1929 [just prior to the Wall Street crash] saying 'equities have reached a permanently high plateau' – that's what I associate with the peak,\" Harman says.\nWhat the massive increase in short selling over the past year, along with the steady increase over the past five, probably does tell us is that the extreme volatility of recent weeks and months is likely to remain a feature of the market as long as the levels of short selling remains at these levels. That may be frustrating for a long-term investor looking to spot what matters through an increasing amount of noise, but it's something we may just have to get used to.", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Fisher", "https://twitter.com/ComminsP", "http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/03/060303.asp"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:38:56.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
