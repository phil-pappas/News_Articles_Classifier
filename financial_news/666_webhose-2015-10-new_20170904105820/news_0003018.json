Can I take my first one this December to avoid that scenario?\nJerry Thompson, Orlando, Fla.\nYou have another year to worry about this.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/Encore More in Encore: The New Retirement To Age Better, Avoid Stereotypes About Aging Keep Your Bonds Safe Men Seeking Friends When Is Fainting Serious? Boost Your Brain Power Required minimum distributions from individual retirement accounts and other retirement accounts start for the year you turn 70½, not when you celebrate your 70th birthday. That means your first RMD will be for tax year 2016, not this year.\nBut you are smart to think ahead to the timing of the first two payouts. Under the tax law, you get extra time to take your first RMD, until April 1 of the calendar year after the year you reach 70½. For you, that means your RMD for 2016 must be taken by April 1, 2017.\nBut the deadline for subsequent RMDs is year-end. So your RMD for 2017 would be due by Dec. 31, 2017—potentially giving you two payouts in that single year, which could push you into a higher tax bracket.\nTo spread out the tax bite, you could take your payout for 2016 by Dec. 31, 2016.\nIt is easy to get confused about the rules for the first RMD—including the fact that the critical April date for these withdrawals is a few weeks before a better-known April deadline, the midmonth tax-filing day.\n*** In an earlier column about the 8%-a-year increase in Social Security for delaying your retirement to age 70, you said those figures are before any cost-of-living adjustments. Are you saying that cost-of-living increases will increase each year’s benefit…and the COLA increases are compounded? Could you clarify this and give examples?\nJim Murphy, Peterborough, N.H.\nConsider a worker who is entitled to $2,000 a month at her full retirement age of 66, says Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University professor and co-author of “Get What’s Yours: The Secrets to Maxing Out Your Social Security.”\nIf this individual waits to age 70 to start her benefit, she would get an additional 8% of her full benefit for each year, which isn’t compounded—so an additional 32%, or a total of $2,640 a month, at age 70. That is before her benefit is adjusted for the cost of living, an adjustment that compounds over time.\nPreviously in Ask Encore When You Forget a Required IRA Withdrawal (June 2015) From a Standard 401(k) to a Roth (March 2015) The Math on Delayed Social Security Benefits (January 2015) How to Reduce the Tax Bite on Company Stock in a 401(k) (December 2014) In Mr. Kotlikoff’s example, inflation is 2% in the first year, then 3.2%, 5.3% and 0.3%. So he multiplies the $2,640 by 1.02 (to reflect the 2% inflation the first year), and the resulting figure of $2,692.80 is then multiplied by 1.032 (to reflect the 3.2% inflation the next year). Continue multiplying the result by 1.052 and 1.003, and the age 70 benefit is $2,935, he says.\n(Note that in the precise year-by-year computations done by Social Security, there is some rounding, generally to the next lower dime .)\nThere won’t be a Social Security COLA in 2016, the Social Security Administration said Thursday, because the measure of consumer prices used in the calculation fell in the third quarter from the year-earlier period.\nSend your questions for Ask Encore to karen.damato@wsj.com .
