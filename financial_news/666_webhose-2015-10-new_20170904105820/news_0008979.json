Putting commercial pressure on a company has become the latest political tactic to try to force policy change, given the government and Labor are in fundamental agreement on the need for offshore detention on Manus and Nauru.\nDivestment Some industry funds have already announced they are divesting their holdings in Transfield Services, partly in response to the concerns of some of their union members about the policy of detention. In August the $32 billion fund HESTA sold a 3.5 per cent stake , citing evidence of human rights violations in the centres.\n\"We have confidence in the company and its transparency and we don't foresee any reason why we should change our position,\" Ridout told The Australian Financial Review . \"Our members want to know what our position has been on this and we have been open with them.\"\n She also describes as \"spurious\" the alternative argument used that reputational damage to Transfield as a result of the campaign could lower returns to shareholders, meaning it is not a good investment.\n\"We have had no pressure from the investment community on this,\" she said.\nIntense campaign That is even though Transfield Services is now dealing with the same sort of intense campaign faced by many companies attracting the ire of activists, especially those in the coal industry. A lobby group, No Business in Abuse, has recently launched a public attack after having initially targeted the company's investor base to argue the company was complicit in human rights abuses which would expose it to legal and financial consequences.\nAs with similar divestment campaigns, the tactic is to use social media to try to galvanise community sentiment as well as intensifying pressure on shareholders or financiers to respond.\nAustralianSuper has round 0.01 per cent of Transfield shares.\nTransfield Services share price has gone down by 45 per cent over the last year due to the company's heavy reliance on providing maintenance services to a resources industry which is no longer in expansion mode. It had also rejected a takeover bid valuing the company at $2 a share â€“ compared to the closing price Wednesday of $1.07.\nThat means Transfield's ability to win a multibillion-dollar long-term government contract is of even greater commercial significance. It is the preferred tenderer for the new contract for the detention centres due to be finalised at the end of this month.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:07:17.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
