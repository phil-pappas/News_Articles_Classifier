The UK economy is producing around £20bn more in annual GDP than we previously thought. This extra output reflects a more optimistic picture of the economic recovery. \nOver the past six years, since the recovery began in mid-2009, the UK economy has grown on average by just over 2pc a year. That may not sound much, but it is in line with the other large Western economies. We are in a “new normal”, where growth rates cannot be expected to match the performance before the financial crisis, when economies were buoyed up by easy money, cheap imports and over-confidence about the future. Business and professional services have grown strongly, partly on the back of our ability to sell our skills and expertise abroad \nAccording to the latest GDP figures, every household in the UK is now £850 a year better off than previous estimates suggested. But where has the extra money has come from? \nWhen the economy recovers from a recession, the businesses and sectors that do best are not necessarily the ones which prospered before the downturn. The financial sector is a good example of this. Banking and finance did extremely well from the 1990s until 2007. But last year the UK financial sector produced 10pc less than it did in 2008, even though the economy as a whole is now generating 6pc more GDP than at the peak of the last cycle. \nEconomic growth over this recovery is coming from other parts of the economy. Business and professional services have grown strongly, partly on the back of our ability to sell our skills and expertise abroad. The hi-tech industries are doing very well. \nThe UK's hi-tech industries are doing very well \nThe fact that growth comes from new industries and unexpected sources means it takes a while for statisticians to catch up with what has been happening in the real economy. We now have record levels of self-employment. It is only when self-employed people file their tax returns and declare their income that we can understand how much they are contributing to the UK economy. \nThis is not the first time that economic statistics have been slow to reflect what has been happening on the ground. In the early 1990s, there was also a belief that the economy was in the deepest, longest recession since the Second World War. Now we have the full economic data, there is only one year – 1991 – in which GDP fell, despite the perception that the recession dragged on well into 1993. Economic policy-makers should not over-react to GDP figures, which are only one element of the data we have to analyse the performance of the economy \nA few years ago I shared a conference platform with the Chancellor of the Exchequer from that time, Norman Lamont (now Lord Lamont). He commented that when he came to write about his time as Chancellor about 10 years after the early 1990s recession, he did not recognise the economic statistics. Everything now looks a lot better than it did at the time. \nThis is not just a problem for former Chancellors writing their memoirs. It is a serious issue for those in charge of economic policy. George Osborne has been widely criticised for presiding over an era of “austerity”, in which government spending has been held back and tax increases have had to be implemented. He has stuck to his guns in reducing the Government’s deficit, and the figures now bear him out. \nIn the first year of recovery, before the famous June 2010 “austerity” Budget, the UK economy grew by 1.7pc. Since then, the UK has grown on average by 2.1pc a year – in other words, “austerity” has been accompanied by faster economic growth. Yet in the dark days of 2011 and 2012, when the euro crisis loomed large, there were concerns that the economy was in danger of falling into a double-dip or even triple-dip recession. Most of these dips have since been ironed out, with the exception of two very small falls in GDP in 2012, due to special factors – the extra public holiday to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and the unwinding of the boost from the Olympics . \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) may also have been misled by unreliable GDP figures. In February 2011, the MPC came the closest since the financial crisis to raising interest rates. Three members (myself included) voted for a rate rise and two or three other members were close to joining us. But at the end of January we received a shock set of GDP figures showing a decline of 0.5pc in the final quarter of 2010. Bad weather had contributed to the weakness of the economy, but the figures were much worse than expected. George Osborne stuck to his guns in reducing the Government’s deficit, and the figures now bear him out \nAccording to the data released this week, the economy actually grew by 0.1pc in that quarter, instead of contracting. How would the MPC have reacted if they had seen the picture presented by the latest data and not the initial misleading estimates? We will never know. \nThere are two important lessons we should take from this experience. First, economic policy-makers should not over-react to GDP figures, which are only one element of the data we have to analyse the performance of the economy. Labour market statistics, business surveys, the signals from the housing market and indicators of consumer spending all provide vital information about how the economy is performing in real time. \nThe housing market gives us a good indication of how the economy is performing \nSecond, economic policy needs to embody a sound, long-term strategy which is not too heavily influenced by short-term economic indicators. A long-term strategy appears to be succeeding in getting public finances into better shape. Where a strategy appears to be lacking, both in the US and the UK, is in the approach to monetary policy. There is still great uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic about the approach to raising interest rates and the timing of the first move. \nThe decision to raise interest rates after such a long period will never be easy. But independent central bankers need to be prepared to take difficult decisions in an uncertain economic environment. That is their responsibility. \nAndrew Sentance is a senior economic adviser at PwC and a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:18:17.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
