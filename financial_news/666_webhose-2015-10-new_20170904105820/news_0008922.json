According to popular culture, a n likes bling and deals drugs, is armed and dangerous and usually drives some sort of ostentatious vehicle with rap music blaring from the massive speakers set in the doors. Actually, a n is just like a white person: a range of personalities and temperaments that transcend stereotypes, a point that film makes over and over.\" \nJohnstone gave the film four stars, calling it a \"feel good movie about black kids who are not stereotypes\". \nThe review has caused outrage on social media, with readers labelling the article and its author racist. \nCommenter Thomas Allen Morrison said about the review: \"The trailer for this film makes me really want to see it. The review however made me die a little bit on the inside.\" \nThis afternoon Rip It Up released a statement, saying \"the review does not portray our intended context\". \n\"We have a policy of sub-editing all contributed articles to ensure they meet editorial standards; however, in this instance the review of the movie Dope was published prior to subbing, and as a result appeared in its raw form, missing some key references.\" \nThe magazine says the author intended \"to raise the issues that the film explores, as well as exploring the taboos that surround the word\". \n\"We recognise that the intentions of the article have been misconstrued and taken out of context and apologise for any offense caused.\" \nDope is a coming-of-age movie about a high school student in a rough California neighbourhood trying to get into Harvard University and inadvertently crossing paths with drug dealers. \nIt has received wide praise from critics after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:01:59.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
