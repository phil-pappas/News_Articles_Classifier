Last quarter, this consumer product giant posted a positive surprise of 3.68%. In fact, Kimberly-Clark has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.39%.\nLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\nWhy a Likely Positive Surprise? \nOur proven model shows that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.\nPositive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +0.67%. This indicates a likely positive earnings surprise for shares.\nZacks Rank: Kimberly-Clark carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which, when combined with +0.67% ESP, makes us confident about an earnings beat.\nNote that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. \nWhat is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings? \nKimberly-Clark’s cost saving initiatives and continued product innovation have been driving earnings for the past many quarters. The company also achieved higher organic sales on the back of volume growth and better pricing in the last five consecutive quarters.\nMoreover, the spin-off of its health care business into a new company called Halyard Health, Inc. (HYH) in 2014 is allowing Kimberly-Clark to focus on its core portfolio. It has initiated a restructuring program in order to improve organizational efficiency and underlying profitability, increase the company's flexibility to invest in targeted growth initiatives and offset overhead costs stemming from the spin-off.\nThough Kimberly-Clark anticipates a sluggish sales trend in 2015 as it faces currency volatility and increased competition in its diapers segment, we expect the above-mentioned positives to continue to drive earnings in the to-be reported quarter as well.\nOther Stocks to Consider \nStocks worth considering in the consumer staples sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:\nFlower Foods Inc. FLO, with an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe J. M. Smucker Company SJM, with an Earnings ESP of +0.66% and a Zacks Rank #2.\nPinnacle Foods, Inc. PF, with an Earnings ESP of +2.22% and a Zacks Rank #3.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
