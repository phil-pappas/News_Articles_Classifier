Photo: Supplied\nBoutique apartment developer CD Group has splashed out $6,275,000 on a Hawthorn development site opposite Swinburne University.\nCD Group has bought 382-386 Burwood Road, a shop and former bank building across the road from the old Hawthorn post office on the corner of Kent Street, paying a bullish $7500 a square metre.\nTeska Carson agent Tom Maule, who negotiated the deal with Anthony Choi and Michael Taylor, said \"I can't recall Commercial 1-zoned land value achieving that high a price.\"\nThe private Chinese family who sold the 836-square-metre site bought it for $596,000 in 1995.\nAdvertisement \"We sold 609 Burwood Road recently at $5500 a square metre. This is a significant jump,\" Mr Maule said.\nWhile that 900-square-metre site had approved plans and a permit for a 31-unit mixed residential-retail development, it is further away from Swinburne University and closer to the Auburn Road, East Hawthorn precinct.\nMr Maule said more than 100 enquiries were received which resulted in 10 formal expressions of interest, with a shortage of student housing driving interest.\nTeska Carson research shows there is only one purpose-built bed for every student in Melbourne, he said.\nHowever, CD Group director Michael Edwards is not planning to build student accommodation.\nCD Group, owned by Mr Edwards, and the Xi and Lu families, is affiliated with the JD Group, which recently paid around $30 million for a 7013-square-metre site at 196-202 Burwood Road.\nMr Edwards, who has previously worked on huge developments for Mirvac and R Corporation, is focused on boutique developments aimed at owner-occupiers.\n\"It's a bit early to indicate plans. It will be a residential development, about 30-35 apartments but we still haven't locked down an architect yet,\" he said.\n\"But it won't be student housing,\" he said.\nCD Group has a slate of small residential developments, most of which are in the eastern suburbs. It is about to start construction on a Camberwell project and has another project in planning – a 35-unit apartment building at 496 Glenferrie Road, Hawthorn.\n\"We are building seven townhouses in Box Hill and we are waiting for a planning application for a 67-unit apartment project in Moonee Ponds.\"\n\"It's getting very difficult to buy sites,\" Mr Edwards said. \"And the rate of sales for apartments is starting to slow down a bit.\"\nFurther east on Burwood Highway one of Melbourne's biggest car dealers, Penfold Motors, has put part of its Burwood landholding​ on the market.\nPenfold Motors, a 51-year-old private company run by the Johnstone family, is selling the 3212-square-metre car yard at 142 Burwood Highway which previously housed its Holden franchise.\nThe L-shaped site, close to Deakin University, Presbyterian Ladies College and Mount Scopus Memorial College, is expected to fetch more than $6.5 million. The deal is being handled by Dawkins Occhiuto and Fitzroys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:12:51.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
