(Andrew Burton/Getty Images)[/caption]The S&P 500 slipped 10% from a record high, which is considered a normal correction and far from bear market territory, defined as a 20% correction. But its price chart made an ominous “death cross” in which the shorter-term 50-day moving average crossed below the longer-term 200-day average. As a blaring sell signal for technically-oriented investors, the death cross suggests more pain ahead. Here's a group of investment strategists explaining whether they think we’re headed for a bear market and what investors should make of the Federal Reserve’s landmark decision to stand pat on interest rates. Cary Greenspan, CMT, regional director of investments for PNC Wealth Management in Washington D.C. with $134 billion under management: But what may be a larger question is how long do bull or bear markets last? This is where the concept of long-term secular equity cycles vs. intermediate term cyclical movement needs to be reviewed. [tweet_Quote: display=\"History suggests that long-term secular bull markets can and have lasted for two decades or more.\"]History suggests that long-term secular bull markets can and have lasted for two decades or more.[/tweet_Quote: ] This is not uncommon. And within these longer term secular bulls, several pullbacks may occur, and each may be severe.Prior to 2009, the last secular bull began in 1981 and ended in 2000. But there were quite severe cyclical corrections in 1987, 1990 and 1998. And yet once completed, the secular bull phase continued reaching significant new highs. The lows reached in March of 2009 suggest that the bull phase we have experienced since then was only recently interrupted by an intermediate term correction and not a bear market.To determine where you are, you must examine where you have been. It is true that asset class opportunities and risks can be examined at a single point in time. But I have never known a successful investor or advisor who didn’t evaluate past conditions to determine current relative value.While there are thousands of calculations that an investor may consider when making an ultimate decision to buy, sell or hold, traditional valuation metrics, while somewhat simple to calculate, are often the most useful.Currently, the forward 12-month (through 9/30/2016) price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 15.6 according to Standard and Poor’s estimates. The trailing P/E ratio stands at 18.1. This would imply an earnings growth rate of nearly 17%. Historically, the average trailing PE ratio is 15.3. Given reduced growth estimates worldwide, it is doubtful earnings will be close to the implied growth rate stated above. They may not even approach a double-digit rate. However, during time frames where the rate of inflation is exceedingly low, P/E ratios frequently expand even if earnings just hold steady.Current inflation is running below the Fed’s anticipated threshold of 2%. Historically, average P/E ratios are near 17 when inflation runs between 1%-2%. Even though equities traditionally represent a risk asset class, alternatives to equity do not present compelling interest at this time. On this basis, I do not feel domestic equities are overvalued. That does not mean that one should blindly buy stocks, ETFs or mutual funds. They should be evaluated based upon merit and risk tolerance. What is more, each contemplated purchase should be clearly understood relative to one’s objectives and time horizon. Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock in San Francisco $4.7 trillion under management: I don’t believe we’re in a bear market, which is typically associated with overly aggressive Fed tightening, a recession and/or an exogenous shock. So far, we see none of these conditions. Monetary policy is still ultra-accommodative.Equity market valuations are heightened in the U.S. but more reasonable, and in some cases cheap, internationally. Even in the U.S, at 15 times forward earnings valuations are not unreasonable given low inflation and interest rates. While investors should expect more modest equity returns from these levels, valuations are not at a level that has been consistent with recent market tops.The Fed’s decision (to leave rates the same) was arguably influenced by heightened uncertainty as to the state of the global economy and the recent drop in both realized inflation as well as expectations for future inflation. That said while the U.S. economy is still dealing with structural headwinds – demographic changes, still heightened debt levels for many middle-class families and sluggish productivity growth – it is not clear that the right policy rate is zero.Growth in the United States is likely to be around 2.50% in 2015 and the pace of job creation is running at the fastest levels since the late 1990’s. In this environment, it is not obvious why the Fed should be maintaining a zero rate policy when we are no longer facing the same emergency conditions that were present during the financial crisis. The Fed needs to provide more clarity on what factors they will be watching and what conditions would justify a change from the current 0% policy rate. This is particularly important given what is likely to be an atypical tightening cycle and the recent focus on events outside of the United States.The global economy is slowing, but not in a recession. Europe is improving and the U.S. is growing at a reasonable pace. Indeed, currently the U.S. labor market is creating jobs at an average pace of well over 200,000 a month. While growth is likely to once again disappoint, leading indicators are not suggesting a contraction, but rather a period of sluggish growth. China is slowing -- not collapsing. Finally, low rates and cheaper oil should be supportive of global growth. Michael K. Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, LLC in Washington, DC with more than $1 billion under management: Despite the first technical “correction” from its all-time highs, the S&P 500 is still up close to 180% from the financial-crisis low on March 9, 2009. This strong performance is attributable to several factors, the most important of which are earnings growth and expansion in the price-to-earnings multiple. First, index earnings have roughly doubled since 2009, making earnings growth responsible for a little more than half of the increase in the S&P 500.Secondly, the price-to-earnings multiple for the S&P 500 has expanded meaningfully since the low in March 2009. This increase in multiple, to the current level of about 16 times estimated 2015 estimates, has contributed an estimated 30% of the rise in the index. Together, these two factors have contributed around 85% of the rise in the index. Other less influential factors have collectively been responsible for about 15% percent of the index’s increase.The troublesome issue, in our view, is that the doubling in index earnings came on just a 30% increase in index revenue. Said another way, corporate profit margins have expanded dramatically over the past six to seven years at a time when top-line growth has been lackluster (compared to historical economic recoveries). In fact, corporate margins have risen so much that they are now running about 50% above the long-term historical averages. The drivers of the margin expansion have been many and include massive labor slack, idle factory capacity, cost-cutting, layoffs, deferral of investments, and lower interest and tax expense. [tweet_Quote: display=\"Index earnings have also benefited from huge stock buybacks. Unfortunately, these are not sustainable\"]Index earnings have also benefited from huge stock buybacks. Unfortunately, these are not sustainable[/tweet_Quote: ] sources of earnings growth over the long term. Rather, corporate margins are more likely to trend lower toward the long-term average than higher in the coming years. At the very least, then, equity returns over the next several years are likely to be far lower than investors have come to expect. Daniel Beckerman, CFP® , ChFC®, president Beckerman Institutional in Oakhurst, N.J. with $55 million under management: I view the recent correction in the stock market as a temporary downturn within a long-term bull market that began in the first quarter of 2009. Since then, this is the fourth double-digit correction. We had one in 2010 coinciding with the “flash crash.” Another took place in 2011 as the European debt crisis played out. A third downturn took place in 2012 during the debt ceiling issues that we faced. This time around the primary areas of concern seems to be the slowdown in China as well as the crash in commodities prices.Just to be clear, there are two sectors of the stock market that are already in a bear market: energy and materials. In the past year, the energy sector has plummeted more than thirty percent. You are certainly hurting if you are an investor focused on the energy sector. However, the news is not all gloomy in this regard. In fact, for most businesses and individuals, crashing energy prices act like a tax cut. Many businesses (particularly transportation companies) are enjoying the lower prices. If prices remain depressed, it also creates a tailwind effect not just for the average corporation, but for anyone who drives a car or heats their home.Furthermore, there is not a very compelling case for a long-term bear market. Economic productivity does not seem to indicate a recession in the short term. It is also difficult to make the case for any systemic banking system problems given that the banks have become far more conservative ever since the aftermath of the financial crisis.Valuations for the stock market overall should be considered reasonable. They are not particularly cheap nor are they expensive. The forward price to earnings ratio for the S&P 500 stock market index is right at about its 15-year average. Investors are likely to be more apt to pay up for companies that can achieve strong organic growth. Many of these kinds of companies can be found in the technology sector.The Federal Reserve’s decision to hold off on raising rates indicates that (even though they are planning to begin moving rates up) they are leaning more toward an accommodative stance for the economy, which is generally a positive for the stock market. The traditional indicators that the Federal Reserve tends to focus on are the unemployment rate, the consumer price index, and some others. Our Federal Reserve Chair, Janet Yellen particularly likes to look at the “JOLTS” (Job Openings and Labor Turnover) survey. But it is clear that the Fed is also watching the broad macroeconomic environment as well as the stock market.In their meeting this month, Janet Yellen explained the rationale for the Federal Reserve to leave rates unchanged. She cited economic concerns in the emerging markets and the volatility of financial markets. This recent focus on the markets illustrates that despite the desire to raise rates, greater still is the Fed's desire to maintain growth that should be viewed as a positive for the stock market. Peter W. Tuz, CFA, president of Chase Investment Counsel Charlottesville, Va. with $400 million under management: I doubt we will see a bear market. But I do believe a weak third-quarter earnings season could send the market back to correction territory. The ingredients for a bear market aren’t present now. Markets are not excessively valued market, and an impending recession appears unlikely. Energy prices are benign and interest rates are low. The world is growing, albeit slowly and in this low-growth world companies that exhibit it will be rewarded by markets for years to come. Robert R. Johnson, PhD, CFA, CAIA, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Penn. : I don't believe we are in a bear market but do believe that returns over the next few months and years will likely be lower than returns over the past seven years. For years, I have been researching the relationship between Federal Reserve monetary policy and capital market returns and have found distinct patterns. Equity returns are much lower when the Fed is increasing rates than during falling rate periods. From 1966 through 2013, the S&P 500 returned 15.2% in falling rate environments and only 5.9% in rising rate periods.I believe the Fed made a mistake in keeping rates unchanged. The market would have welcomed a rate increase as it would have provided more clarity to the market. One truism in the markets is that markets abhor uncertainty. Market participants realize that a rate increase is inevitable and were receiving signals that the increase was forthcoming. When it didn't happen, the market reacted negatively.Overall, valuations in the market appear to be fair to slightly overvalued. I believe that investors would be well-served to concentrate in firms producing mundane, necessity goods that provide high cash flow. Rahul Ray, principal and portfolio manager of Burr Capital LLC in Edgewater, N.J. with just under a million under management: After a six-year bull market and anemic economic growth, market multiples appear stretched in almost all sectors, particularly consumer staples. If the U.S economy shows any signs of improvement, possibly enabled by a meaningful change in U.S fiscal policy then corporate earnings could improve and the market could grow into its current valuation.If we don't see a material improvement in the economy and with monetary policy reaching the point of diminishing returns, then we could very well enter a bear market. The Fed's decision to keep interest rates near zero may have contributed to a deflationary spiral (low or declining prices) because low interest rates may have forced investors to \"reach for yield\" by becoming lenders of capital rather than consumers of goods, which is what the Federal Reserve really desired.The excess capital in turn led to the availability of cheap debt and over-production of commodities such as oil and declining prices (deflation). Unfortunately, keeping rates low may exacerbate low inflation rather than cure it. This is a dilemma for the Fed, hence the wavering on raising interest rates.[gallery2012]", "external_links": ["http://beckermanllc.com/", "http://farrmiller.com/", "http://www.chaseinv.com/", "http://www.blackrock.com/", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490445866/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.burrcap.com/"], "published": "2015-10-01T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:50:44.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
