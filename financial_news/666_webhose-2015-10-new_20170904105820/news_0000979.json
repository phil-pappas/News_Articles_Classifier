The double wasn’t the problem — Estrada stranded it in a scoreless first — but according to “Esky Magic,” by simply swinging at the first pitch, Escobar had already increased the Royals’ chances of winning the game. See, when Escobar swings at the first pitch, the Royals are 43-17 this season. It’s nothing but a coincidence, but for the Royals players it’s as meaningful as any other superstition. Now they’re 44-17.\nDoubles power\nIt was another leadoff double two innings later that actually did the damage as Royals left fielder Alex Gordon led off the third inning by hooking Estrada’s pitch down the right-field line, scoring the opening run two batters later as Escobar did the same. Escobar was then cashed in himself by Lorenzo Cain, as Kansas City took an early 2-0 lead.\nPerez goes yard\nRoyals catcher Sal Perez, who had the third-most homers by a catcher this season (behind the Jays’ Russell Martin and Yankees’ Brian McCann), added to the Royals lead in the fourth inning when he sent Estrada’s first-pitch fastball over the deep left-centre wall at Kauffman Stadium. Perez had two homers in the Royals’ division series against the Astros despite suffering from a severe stomach bug. His third homer of the post-season tied him with teammate Kendrys Morales for second in the AL, behind the Astros’ Colby Rasmus.\nVolquez freezes Bautista\nMeanwhile, Royals starter Edinson Volquez was dealing all night. The hard-throwing right-hander — who was at the heart of much of the controversy from the testy matchup between the two clubs Aug. 2 — had arguably his best start of the season on Friday night, holding the Jays to just a pair of hits. Volquez may have been at his best in the fourth inning, when he led off with a three-pitch strikeout to Jose Bautista, in which all the strikes were called. Volquez started Bautista off with a pair of sinkers on the outer edge of the plate and then froze him with a knee-buckling curve. There would be no bat flip, only a dejected stroll to the dugout.\nAt-batlles\nThe Jays had their best chance against Volquez in the sixth inning, when Josh Donaldson and Bautista drew back-to-back walks in back-to-back nine-pitch battles. They were hard-fought at-bats at a key moment in the game and it was the first time the Jays had more than one base-runner inside a single inning — only the second time they had any base-runners with less than two outs. But with the tying run at the plate, neither Edwin Encarnacion, nor Chris Colabello, nor Troy Tulowitzki could do any damage. The Jays battled Volquez for a combined 37 pitches that inning — remarkable when you consider he faced just five batters — but ultimately came up empty handed.\nMore on thestar.com\nJohn Tory does a bat flip over bet with Kansas City mayor\nBlue ‘Toronto’ sign, bigger TV at Nathan Phillips Square for Jays game", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:56:07.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
