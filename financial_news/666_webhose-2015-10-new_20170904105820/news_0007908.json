Poloz said again on Monday that the bar for change is high.\nDuring a question and answer session with the audience, Poloz said that the strengthening of the U.S. economy is \"having the expected effects on Canadian exports.\"\nA pick up in exports is key to the Bank of Canada's view that the economy will regain momentum after being in a mild recession in the first half of the year. While recent data showed exports dipped in August, the sector saw strong growth over the previous two months.\nThe Bank of Canada has cut interest rates twice this year to stave off the economic blow from cheap oil prices, but some have voiced concern that the cheaper borrowing costs will add more fuel to an already hot housing market.\nIn a speech that largely echoed one he gave on Saturday, Poloz justified the rate cuts as being required by the oil price crash cutting into national income and threatening to drive inflation below target for an unacceptably long time. The central bank is widely expected to stand pat next week.
