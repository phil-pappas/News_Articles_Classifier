These resources would then be available for students who might need a change of clothes throughout the school day.\n“Our school is thankful for Belvoir Federal and the partnership we have created. Belvoir Federal’s staff continues to go above and beyond in their support of our school, community, and students. Their most recent donation of items will help us when instances arise where students need a change of clothes,” stated Theresa Carhart.\nMs. Carhart shared that through this donation, they will be able to help students have necessary resources when emergencies arise, maximize instructional time, and minimize pulling parents away from their work to bring a change of clothes.\nFort Belvoir Elementary School\nFort Belvoir Elementary School, A Fairfax County Public School, opened its doors in September 1998. Located on the Fort Belvoir Army Installation, the school serves military-connected students in grades Pre-K-6, and has a program capacity of 1,102 students.
