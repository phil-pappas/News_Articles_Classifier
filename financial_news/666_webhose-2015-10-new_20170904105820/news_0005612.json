Photo: Bloomberg\nDeutsche Bank expects to report a net loss of €6.2 billion ($9.7 billion) for the third quarter and may eliminate its dividend for the year after taking a writedown tied to capital requirements and the disposal of its Postbank unit.\nThe estimates, announced in a statement Wednesday, are part of a strategy that co-chief executive officer John Cryan will present October 29 as he looks to shore up capital and boost profitability at Europe's biggest investment bank. Deutsche Bank's American depositary receipts tumbled 6.4 per cent after the disclosure to $US26.96 at 4.22pm in extended trading in New York.\nThe firm said it's taking a €5.8 billion writedown of goodwill and intangible assets as higher capital requirements reduce the value of its investment bank and it adjusts the estimate of what it will receive in the disposal of its Postbank unit. The Frankfurt-based lender also is adding about €1.2 billion euros to its litigation reserves.\n\"As part of the planning for the implementation of Strategy 2020, the management board will recommend a reduction or possible elimination of the Deutsche Bank common share dividend for the fiscal year of 2015,\" the company said in a statement on its website.\nAdvertisement Cryan is cleaning up the firm's balance sheet in his first full quarter at the helm. Cryan, who shares the CEO post with Juergen Fitschen, inherited a strategy to boost returns by lowering expenses about 15 per cent by 2020 and shrinking assets at the investment bank as much as 17 per cent through 2018.\nCryan is seeking to avoid tapping shareholders for funds while focusing on reorganising the bank to meet growing demands for buffers from regulators. In July he said \"raising additional capital would not solve our core problem of reversing our low financial returns and our poor organic capital generation.\"\nDeutsche Bank had turned to Postbank to diversify its funding mix by boosting consumer deposits in the midst of the global financial crisis.", "external_links": ["https://www.db.com/ir/en/content/ir_releases_2015_5045.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:59:20.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
