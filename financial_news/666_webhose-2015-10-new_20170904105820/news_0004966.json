Teachers Service Commission chief executive secretary Nancy Macharia said county directors had been told to suspend the hiring. She spoke yesterday when she appeared before the National Assembly's education committee. Mrs Macharia said the recruitment was to fill the shortage of teachers countrywide. \"We will keep the details of all the applicants in our database as we await the court verdict,\" said Mrs Macharia. She said the country has a shortage of 85,980 teachers and the hiring was to bridge the gap. Mrs Macharia maintained that the commission was an independent institution and it is its job to recruit teachers. She said the commission was not going to seek extra money for the teachers since it was to use that meant for the ones who left the service. The session was attended by Education Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi, principal secretaries Bellio Kipsang and Colleta Suda, and Teachers Service Commission Chairperson Lydia Nzomo. There was heated debate during the session after Mbooni MP Munyao Kisoi brought to the attention of the committee members that the issue was before a court of law.
