MPs to put UK membership under the microscope By Julia Bradshaw | Telegraph – 55 minutes ago 0.00 \nThe Treasury Select Committee is launching an inquiry into Britain's membership of the European Union \nA Parliamentary committee that scrutinises the country’s finances is launching an inquiry into the economic advantages and disadvantages of Britain’s membership of the European Union . \nAs David Cameron, the Prime Minister, attempts to renegotiate the country’s position in the EU ahead of an ‘in-out’ referendum in 2017, the Treasury Select Committee is asking organisations including trade bodies representing UK business, academics, Government officials and think thanks to give evidence as it probes the financial benefits and drawbacks of being part of the bloc. \nThe inquiry is expected to take at least three months and will culminate in a written report - most likely containing recommendations - that will land on Chancellor George Osborne's desk. \n\"The TSC will try to get all sides of the story, from the 'yeses', the 'nos' and the ‘in-the-middles'\", a spokesman said. \n\"If it thinks evidence is missing, it'll seek out extra information from various parties by calling for oral evidence.\" \nOnce the 11-strong committee, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, is satisfied with the evidence, it will put together a report to which the Treasury will have two months to respond. \nWhile the report will contain a series of recommendations agreed upon by the cross-party committee, it's unlikely to set out in \"black and white\" whether or not Britain should remain in the EU. \nInstead it will contain suggestions on what should be included in any renegotiation package and highlight what the Government should think about and who it should speak to as the referendum date approaches. \n\"This inquiry will be wide ranging, dealing with all the economic and financial consequences of the UK’s EU membership, and the impact of departure,\" said Mr Tyrie. \n\"The committee’s job will be to attempt to marshal the evidence on this important question into a coherent form, enabling the electorate to make a more informed decision. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) welcomes evidence from all those with views and expertise.\" \nAreas the TSC is asking for evidence on include how the balance of costs and benefits might change following the government's negotiation efforts and what effect the fallout from the eurozone crisis might have on Britain. It also wants to examine the terms on which the UK might leave the EU. \nThe 11-strong committee wants to know whether the UK's access to EU goods, services and capital markets would be blocked by an exit and if it would result in less inward investment. \nMore technical questions cover the EU’s regulation of products and markets and whether a ‘Brexit’ would lead to compliance and regulatory clashes with the EU, making trade more difficult. \nMPs also want to know how labour markets might be affected by closing borders to prevent the free movement of people and how EU membership affects the UK's current account. \nCommittee member Helen Goodman, Labour MP for Bishop Auckland, said: \"We want to have a thorough look at economic costs and benefits of membership. And the economic costs and benefits of leaving. \n\"There are people on the committee with a wide range of ideas and therefore I think it is really important for Parliament that the TSC can provide an objective perspective in the run-up to the referendum. \n\"It’s about preventing people from making wild claims one way or another.\" \nAsked about her views on EU membership, Ms Goodman pointed out that her constituency was the most successful exporting region in the British economy outside of London and that a lot of jobs were dependent on exporting to Europe. \n\"A lot of inward investment is dependent on us being able to be within the European market. Nissan and Hitatchi are both on record quoting that their inward investment is dependent on UK membership,\" she said. \"That is my starting position. \n\"I’m not saying there are not costs to membership, there are downsides, but overall thousands of jobs in my constituency rely on these investments.\" \nThe Confederation of British Industry, which represents 190,00 firms in the UK, said that it would be giving evidence to the inquiry. \nIt has previously stated that it wants the UK to remain in a reformed EU. \nCBI director-general John Cridland said: \"The CBI speaks for firms of all sizes, in every sector and in every corner of the UK, and most of our companies want the UK to be in a reformed EU. \n\"The EU must be more focused on driving growth, by signing trade deals like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and interfere less in domestic affairs where it’s not needed, like prescriptive regulation around working hours. \n\"It is not mutually exclusive to both recognise the benefits of EU membership and still want to push for reform to make it work better most CBI members want to be in a reformed EU and are supportive of the Prime Minister’s ambitions. The CBI has been banging the drum for EU reform for many years and will continue to do so.\" \nA spokesman for the British Bankers’ Association, which represents hundreds of financial institutions, said: \"The single market is the European Union's greatest asset and is of crucial importance to the banking and financial services industry in the UK. \n\"We are clear that we want the UK to remain an active participant in the single market, helping to write the rules and push for greater trade and economic growth. \n\"It is crucial that voters are in a position to make up their minds on EU membership on the basis of the facts. The Treasury Select Committee’s inquiry will play an important role in putting the evidence on both sides into the public domain.\" \nThe BBA hasn't yet set out a formal position on the referendum. \nA recent poll of members of the Federation of Small Businesses found business owners were split on whether to leave or stay in the EU. However the vast majority wanted to see reforms or powers transferred back to the UK from Brussels. \nA spokesman for the FSB welcomed the inquiry: \"Members have told us they don't have enough information on the economic benefits and drawbacks of membership. We hope that this inquiry will help to close the information deficit felt by many businesses on this important issue. \n\"In the run-up to the UK’s referendum on EU membership, the FSB will ensure the small business voice is heard in the discussion, and that our members have all the information they need to make a decision.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:58:21.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
