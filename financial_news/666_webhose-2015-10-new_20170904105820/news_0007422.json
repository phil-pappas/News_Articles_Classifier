AP by Jack Clark Google parent Alphabet Inc is selling more ads and keeping spending under control, fuelling better than projected sales and profit in the latest quarter. The shares jumped as much as 8.6 per cent.\nRevenue, excluding sales passed on to partners, rose 15 per cent to $US15.1 billion in the third quarter, the company said in a statement on Thursday, exceeding analysts' average estimate for $US15 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $US7.35 a share, beating predictions of $US7.20.\nChief executive Larry Page is adopting a new holding company called Alphabet to separate Google's main operations from various new endeavours, but the latest figures are still being reported in line with past quarters - before the final transition in the coming months.\nThe key challenge for Google is to control spending on initiatives to boost web traffic, which are aimed at making up for declining ad prices on mobile devices. Those efforts are paying off, with total clicks on ads up 23 per cent, even as the average price for an ad fell 16 per cent.\n\"It's moving in the right direction,\" said Kerry Rice, a senior analyst at Needham & Co, who has a buy rating on the stock. \"There certainly is a shift and they need to figure out how to monetise it better.\"\nUnder Alphabet, Google's search-ad business is one among many. Other initiatives range from computers and fast-internet services, to projects such as like product-delivering drones, life sciences products, airborne wind turbines and self-driving cars. While the new areas have yet to bring in sales to rival Google's core operations, they're being given room to operate as distinct units under a new operating structure. At the same time, chief financial officer Ruth Porat has tempered this expansion by focusing on controlling costs.\nThird-quarter net income was $US2.74 billion, compared with $US3.98 billion a year earlier.\nThe shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet rose to $US740 in extended trading. The stock advanced 1.4 per cent to $US681.14 at the close in New York, near the October 19 record of $US699.95.\n Bloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:05:59.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
