But a new report from Millward Brown Digital suggests that, contrary to popular belief, the mobile Web isn’t dying—it’s being used just as much as apps.\nOf the 30 most-visited properties on mobile, 59.2% of unique visitors viewed through a browser while 60.3% visited through an app, according to the report, which tracked a panel of 20,000 smartphone users over the first six months of the year.\nThe study comes as publishers struggle to generate revenue from their growing mobile audience. Viewership has climbed on mobile devices, but revenue isn’t keeping pace, creating an issue known as the “ mobile gap .”\nPublishers have experimented with a range of strategies on mobile, like developing their own apps and signing deals with tech giants like Facebook FB 1.23 % and Snapchat to distribute their content and share ad revenues. Meanwhile, the rise of software that can block ads on mobile browsers have been cause for concern, too.\nThe report found that users “don’t have a strong preference between apps and browsers” when it comes to news—except for sports and business news, which favor apps.\nRachel Eisenberg, senior vice president of marketing and client services at Millward Brown Digital, said that many consumers are drawn to the mobile Web because it replicates the desktop experience, while apps often feel different and require a “ramp up.”\n“The consumer really wants a consistent experience across platforms,” Ms. Eisenberg said.\nMs. Eisenberg said the perception that the mobile Web was in decline spurred Millward Brown Digital to look into the matter.\nA full 61% of smartphone users accessed their mobile browsers at least once a day for an average of 31 minutes, according to the report. More than half of smartphone users have 40-70 apps on their phones, but 43% use only 4-6 a day and 28% use only 1-3 a day.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:47:59.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
