The man was reportedly sitting behind her.\nIn a tweet early on Monday, Los Angeles airport police said officers responded to a call shortly before midnight reporting a \"passenger disturbance\" on the Southwest flight.\nNBC News Quote: d an FBI spokeswoman as saying that one passenger was detained for questioning after the plane returned to Los Angeles, but that no arrests were made.\nThe other 136 passengers were put on a later flight to San Francisco, Southwest Airlines said, getting there about five hours behind their scheduled arrival time.\nLast year, there were several reports of mid-air arguments over reclining seats causing flights to be diverted. In one case, a 60-year-old Frenchman was subdued by plainclothes U.S. air marshals and charged in federal court with interfering with crew members aboard an American Airlines flight to Paris from Miami. It was diverted to Boston.
