Alibaba Defined includes letters from Executive Chairman Jack Ma and Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang and other traditional annual report content. Alibaba Defined is now live at http://ar.alibabagroup.com/2015/index.html . “Alibaba needs no explanation in China, where consumers interact with our products and services every single day. But for those outside of China, who have limited access to our ecosystem, it can be difficult to appreciate our vision, our company and what we are working to achieve,” said Joe Tsai, Executive Vice Chairman. “Our first annual report was the ideal opportunity to create a comprehensive experience for everyone who wants to better understand us.” Alibaba Defined includes visually-rich interactive content showcasing Alibaba’s ecosystem. Visitors can walk through the seller experience, following along as an entrepreneur uses Alibaba to start, run and grow a business. Similarly, users can experience a day in the life of a typical consumer to understand how Alibaba’s more than 360 million yearly buyers use its products and services. To understand Alibaba, it’s also necessary to have some understanding of China. To this end, Alibaba Defined transports viewers to modern China, providing necessary context for them to appreciate how China’s e-commerce market became the largest in the world in just a few years – and the size of the still-untapped market opportunity. Through a series of videos, Alibaba Defined helps users see for themselves how Alibaba is building the infrastructure of commerce for the future – starting by connecting all of China, including the 600 million-strong rural population, and expanding its international operations by helping global companies and brands access China’s large and growing middle class.
