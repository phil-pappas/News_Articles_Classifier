You need people who will bring new ideas into the workplace, and help expand the idea of what you hope the company can be.

Encourage Employees to Branch Out \nInnovation starts with the people who work for you. You want an employer brand that reflects a culture of innovation, but you need the innovative employees to help drive that ingenuity. Consider the employees you already have; they need to be engaged in and consistently challenged by their work. So how do you do challenge an innovative employee?

Whatever your special work-related program is, stick a name on it and promote it to candidates. You can use it as an essential cog when you build the company’s employer branding story.
