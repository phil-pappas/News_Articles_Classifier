The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 3.8 percent. \nCitigroup rose 4.8 percent to $53.15 after the third-biggest U.S. bank's results beat estimates, while Goldman Sachs was up 1.3 percent at $181.86, despite weak results. \nThe financial sector rose 2.2 percent, recovering from losses Wednesday when JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) results disappointed. \nThe market's gains follow two days of declines and increased worries about the outlook for U.S. earnings. As the earnings season gathers steam, investors will be scrutinizing results and forecasts for any signs of an impact from a slowing global economy. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,449 to 616, for a 3.98-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 2,262 issues rose and 563 fell, for a 4.02-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. \n\"Everything is having a pretty good move, even the financials,\" said Frank Gretz, market analyst and technician for brokerage Wellington Shields & Co in New York. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) just got washed out enough, so I think we're in the midst of a year-end rally, thought obviously it isn't going to go straight up.\" \nAt 3:16 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 190.67 points, or 1.13 percent, to 17,115.42, the S&P 500 gained 26.28 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,020.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 73.09 points, or 1.53 percent, to 4,855.94. \nData showed U.S. consumer prices declined the most in eight months as gasoline costs fell in September, but a rise in core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, suggested inflation was starting to firm. \nUnemployment benefit claims, however, fell in the last week, pointing to a strong labor market. \nThe data, coming on the back of weak retail sales, added to the uncertainty over the timing of an interest rate increase as the Federal Reserve waits for signs of stabilizing global economy.
