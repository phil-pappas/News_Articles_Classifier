Looking through TheStreet Quant Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary quant-based stock-rating tool, we picked the nine best energy companies, which are all rated B through A+.\nThe Street Quant Ratings rates every one of these stocks a buy. These stocks were chosen from 4,300 different types of equities we rate.\nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.\n\nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a buy yielded a 16.56% return in 2014, beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points.
