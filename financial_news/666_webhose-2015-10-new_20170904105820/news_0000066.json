Daniel Munoz by Vesna Poljak Philip Baker One of the quirks of the Australian auto industry is that Australian drivers account for one of the most diverse pools of carmaker brands in the world.\nFor fund managers Ed Prendergast and Steve Black, this piece of trivia is the basis of an investment idea they have developed for parts retailer Burson Group , which is in an expansion phase.\n\"They're the biggest player in the industry and there's still plenty of mum and dad operators who are slowly just incapable of keeping up with the amount of spare parts you need to keep on hand to please your mechanic who needs the part today to get your car back,\" explains Prendergast.\n\"Australians have more types of cars, more brands of cars than most countries in the world for some reason. If you go through the breadth of parts that are required, because no one knows what car is going to turn up to be serviced, [Burson's warehouse network is] a natural advantage.\"\nThe Melbourne-based pair are in their 11th year of running the Pengana Emerging Companies Fund a portfolio of around 60 stocks from a universe of 800. The $600 million fund, that normally has about60 stocks at any given time, has been soft closed for a few years, because it can be harder to outperform with larger sums, particularly when buying and selling into smaller stocks.\nAbout20 per cent of the fund has been handed back to investors in the last two years to keep its size under control.\n\"You won't hear many fund managers complain about being too big, they make it sound easy but it's not and you think about the economics of business people, they just want the biggest fund in the world because the fee flow is unreal,\" Prendergast says.\n\"We're actually better taking a performance-based long-term view on it and indeed handing money back.\"\n From their perspective, the only thing that Australian trailblazers CSL, Computershare and Sonic Healthcare have in common is that they were all once small caps. The challenge is to find the next big thing before a company breaks into the top-50.\nUnder the radar \"They all start off as small industrial companies, and now they're world leaders,\" Black says. \"We really want to focus on companies that are under the radar. For the readers of your paper they might not necessarily be household names.\"\nSome of the stocks in the Pengana portfolio include resort manager Mantra, dental group Pacific Smiles and M2 Group and Vocus Communications.\n\"They're now actually household names,\" Black says of the telecommunications stocks that flagged intentions to merge. \"They've passed the index, have done very well in the share price sense. We were the first institutional shareholders on the register so we like to find these stocks before others do.\nThe fund managers keep turnover in their portfolio low and tend to hold onto stocks. That's why, Prendergast says, they don't spend too much time looking at share prices. \"It's like knowing the price of your house by the hour,\" he says. \"That's not the point. If you like it because you think you can grow it for five years, then don't look at the price. Get out there and look for another one.\n\"We see a hell of a lot of companies, and in theory that's a waste of time. But, it's not, because you're just turning over a rock one at a time,\" he adds. \"And, we also don't do massive amounts of modelling before we visit a company. Often it's five minutes reading just to make sure they're profitable and we understand who the people are.\"\nRisk of bias The danger of doing all the work beforehand, is seeding a bias.\nBlack was at JBWere and Prengergast was at Citigroup before they teamed up at Pengana. They acknowledged from the start the biggest risk to the business was if the two of them came to blows. So far, so good.\nPengana Emerging Companies has a solid track record. The pair have outperformed the Small Ordinaries Index easily with 13 per cent per annum returns. Last week, they received the Lonsec Icon Award.\nEven so, Black and Prendergast acknowledge that they only get six or at best seven out 10 investment ideas right. \"That's why we own 60 stocks,\" Black says. \"Because if we knew we were right every time we'd be 50 per cent in that stock and 50 per cent in another stock and we'd be laughing.\n\"You don't know everything about a stock, it's about probability-based risk assessment.\"\nOutside of the office, which Prendergast admits has the vibe of a library – \"because when you walk into our office there's not a lot happening\" – Black finds time for snow-skiing and Prendergast surfing and music.\nLovers of little-heard music may have caught Prendergast filling in on cult Melbourne community radio station PBS. The guitarist – whose band opened for Sean Kelly's Models at St Kilda's the Espy last year – did a volunteer radio announcing course a couple of years ago, \"so I do a graveyard shift every now and then\".\n\"I just did my thing and had my friends listening – they're pretty forgiving,\" he says. \"I've done a lot of 2-in-the-morning til 6-in-the-morning but I don't know who is listening.\" Melbourne, \"is the centre of all live music. There's a band on every corner\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:04:02.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
