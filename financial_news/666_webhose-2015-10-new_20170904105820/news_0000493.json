More Boardroom trades, October 10 \nTrillion, which says it now plans to offer crowdfunding services in other sectors, is the latest business affected by policy moves that included the scrapping of a climate change tax exemption and a decision to end subsidies for onshore wind power. \nThis month, two UK green energy companies went into administration , with their failures being widely blamed on government policy. \n“When the government announced it was withdrawing so much of the support for smaller-scale projects, that rocked investors’ confidence and made the viability of such projects very uncertain,” Ms Groves said. \nTrillion has raised loans for two onshore wind energy projects, including one where it promised 7 per cent fixed interest for three years, that it said had been affected by policy changes. It said on its website that while these projects’ future revenue streams will be slightly reduced, investors “will continue to be paid interest by the borrower and have capital repaid”. \nDespite the high-risk nature of funding start-ups, the UK’s alternative finance industry is growing, with £2.1bn raised so far this year via peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, according to data provider AltFi. A report published last year by Cambridge university and Nesta, an innovation charity, also found that 92 per cent of peer-to-peer lenders wanted to support green or renewable products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:37:07.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
