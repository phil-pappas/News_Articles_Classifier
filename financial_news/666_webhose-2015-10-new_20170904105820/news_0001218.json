Volkswagen’s stock has fallen steeply in the last couple of weeks as the company might have to pay a hefty fine to settle this issue.\nAccording to the Financial Times , “More than two dozen diesel car models made by BMW, Chrysler, General Motors, Land Rover, and Mercedes-Benz are under scrutiny.” The report also added, “Spokesmen for Fiat Chrysler, Mercedes, GM, and JLR all said their companies did not install defeat devices in their cars.”\n\nGeneral Motors In September, General Motors (GM) admitted fault in a case concerning faulty ignition switches. The company had to pay a hefty fine of $900 million to finally settle the case. Mary Barra, GM’s CEO, added “The mistakes that led to the ignition-switch recall should never have happened. We have apologized, and we do so again today.”\nLast year, a $1.2 billion fine was imposed on Toyota (TM) after sudden acceleration of some of Toyota’s vehicles caused several fatal casualties. It was a case of a faulty part, which Toyota initially contested, only to admit later on.\nMore skeletons in the closet? So far there’s no evidence to suggest that automakers apart from Volkswagen have installed such defeat devices to cheat regulators. However, investors should watch this industry in the coming months. Although diesel vehicles don’t make up much of total vehicles sales in the United States, they are quite popular in Europe. Companies such as Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) get a large portion of their revenues in Europe from the sale of diesel vehicles.\nCurrently, Fiat Chrysler forms 2.07% of the First Trust US IPO ETF (FPX).
