Several large sales have occurred including the Investa office portfolio bought by the Chinese Investment Corporation for about $2.5 billion.\nKnight Frank has launched its Global Cities: The 2016 Report , which looked at the market performance of 20 global cities worldwide, of which 10 are in Asia Pacific.\nThe report says a new real estate investment market has emerged.\nIt says this new environment is characterised by growing cross-border money flows, a push to diversify portfolios, and a willingness to think laterally by looking beyond the traditional sectors of office, retail and industrial.\nKnight Frank head of institutional sales for Australia James Parry said an increase in overseas capital inflow has been apparent in Australia and is likely to remain.\n\"We have seen an increase in Chinese investment into Australia in recent years, driven by a slowing domestic economy, measures to cool the housing market and the relaxation of regulations on overseas investments, all of which have prompted many Chinese investors to seek opportunities abroad,\" Mr Parry said.\n\"Investors are increasingly willing to take more risk to achieve a higher yield in Australia's office markets, and are now willing to compromise â€“ either through a higher-risk appetite and/or alternative geographies than originally intended.\n\"Regardless of whether Chinese investment eventually cools, there is significant potential for increased capital to flow into Australia from places such as Japan, Taiwan and also the US given the lower Australian dollar.\"\nThis demand is also stretching out to the fringe and suburban areas throughout the country.\nKnight Frank head of research and consulting for Australia Matt Whitby said investment into Sydney CBD office and hotel assets by overseas groups has grown considerably in the past five years, boosted by relatively higher yields and, more recently, by currency depreciation.\n\"Offshore ownership of investment-grade office stock and four and five-star hotels in the Sydney CBD office sector, as at August 2015, compared with January 2010, shows the globalisation thesis is clear cut,\" Mr Whitby said.\n\"Offshore ownership of Sydney CBD office assets has increased from 16 per cent to 30 per cent of the market by value, while ownership of significant four and five-star hotels increased from 69 per cent of rooms to 88 per cent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:19:53.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
