Bond hits the parts a more enlightened hero couldn't reach. Sony Pictures by Robbie Collin\nSay what you like about the invisible car in Die Another Day : at least it gave the James Bond films an apparently unbeatable worst-ever moment.\nOne school of thought holds that the true nadir comes around an hour later in the same film, when 007 kite-surfs down a tsunami on the bonnet of his broken rocket sled –​ but even $US50million ($69 million) of the feeblest special effects money can buy doesn't beat the timeless simplicity of Pierce Brosnan doing his best to look impressed while staring at an empty plinth.\nThe invisible car was a turning point in Bond history: it was the moment at which the trajectory of the Brosnan films, then in their eighth year, became unsustainable.\nAfter \"Die Another Day\" (2002, starring Pierce Brosnan), the new Bond film, featuring Daniel Craig, promises to live another day. Brosnan had assumed the role in 1995's GoldenEye , the year after Tony Blair acceded to the Labour Party leadership in Britain –​ and as his incumbency wore on, you could sense the Bond films circling the Cool Britannia cultural scene with an increasingly desperate grin.\nNever mind that Bond had been created by Ian Fleming half a century ago. This \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\", as he was branded by Judi Dench's M in GoldenEye , could swing with the changing times –​ and the plots and gadgets became progressively outlandish in order to prove it.\nWhen Brosnan tumbled down the roof of the Millennium Dome in the opening sequence of The World is Not Enough (1999), the franchise had become every bit as culturally relevant as the Spice Girls and pickled sheep. And to think that, at the time, that must have seemed like a good thing.\nOf all the things that Daniel Craig's Bond films have done right to date, the rightest is almost certainly this: they looked forward to where the Brosnan films were leading, and then ran, headlong and panting, in the opposite direction. The idea of an up-to-date Bond became an oxymoron. Now, his obsolescence was what would make him relevant.\nGadget man: Sean Connery uses a jetpack in \"Thunderball\". As played by Craig – who is now staying mum on whether he'll stay with the franchise – Bond is a flawed creature from another age, weighed down by his past and at odds with the present. He's a \"blunt instrument\" (Dench as M again, but in 2006's Casino Royale ) employed by \"antiquated bloody idiots fighting a war we don't understand and can't win\" (Ralph Fiennes's Gareth Mallory, in 2012's Skyfall ).\nPast masters the present That no one would invent him today, though, turns out to be both the source of his effectiveness, and also what makes him worth preserving. He hits the parts a more enlightened hero couldn't reach.\nThe 24th film in the Bond series, Spectre , arrives in Australian cinemas on November 12 (after opening in most other countries before) –​ and, from what little has been revealed so far, it seems to continue the work of both Casino Royale and Skyfall . ( Quantum of Solace , thanks in part, no doubt, to the 2007-08 Hollywood writers' strike, felt like the franchise treading water.)\nDaniel Craig as James Bond in \"Casino Royale\" – a visual echo of Ursula Andress making a similarly memorable entrance in \"Dr No\" in 1962. Spectre is named after the shadowy cartel that first surfaced way back in Dr No , and riffs on beloved Bond moments of the past. Its debt to Goldfinger , From Russia With Love , Thunderball and more has already been revealed in the trailers. But the particular type of villainy that seems to be at hand –​ the use of trafficked private data for nefarious means –​ is exactly the kind of hazy 21st-century evildoing that Bond can't gun down or chase in a speedboat.\n\"You came across me so many times, yet you never saw me,\" gloats Christoph Waltz's shadowy power broker Franz Oberhauser –​ who, Blofeld or not, appears to be either every conspiracy theorist's worst nightmare, or their wildest dream. Whether it's still possible for Bond to save the day on Britain's behalf when it's no longer clear if Britain itself is friend or foe seems likely to be the meat of Spectre' s mystery.\nThis might sound like a revisionist take on Fleming's creation, but it's actually sharply in line with his beginnings.\nWhen the first Bond novel, Casino Royale , was published in 1953, the British Empire was in steep decline, the comforting convictions of that era washed away by the muddy uncertainties of the Cold War. Bond was a Royal Navy Reserve commander who'd served in the Second World War: a holdover from the stiff-upper-lipped old days, and the champion of a cause that was probably already lost.\nThe many incarnations of 007 (clockwise from top left): Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton. And in Casino Royale , with M waxing nostalgic for the relative clarity of Anglo-Soviet tensions, the anxieties are much the same. Craig's Bond has a disdain for politicians, but as an Establishment icon who's sceptical of too much state control, he's a deeply political figure. He'd almost certainly have voted for David Cameron.\nI spoke to Craig around three weeks after he'd completed work on Spectre , and we discussed the necessity, as he saw it, of harking back to Bond's past in order to push the franchise forward. (The actor has taken an unusually hands-on approach to all four films to date –​ influencing characters, shaping plots, and even reworking half-finished dialogue on the Quantum of Solace set during the writers' strike.)\nBack to the future \"I always had a kind of secret plan when I started doing these movies,\" he told me. And this was it: by starting with the \"stripped-back\" script of Casino Royale , he wanted to reintroduce the series' more familiar elements gradually, in a way that would make sense in a modern-day context –​ and \"do it in as smart a way as possible, so that they're not obvious\".\nBond fans who recognised the references would be delighted that traditions were being upheld in unexpected ways, while newcomers to the series would just see them as part of the \"rich tapestry\" of the world of the films.\n\"And that's a lot harder to do than people think it is,\" he said. \"To do it with subtlety and wit and all of those things takes solid, solid work.\"\nTake the opening to Casino Royale , which was set in Prague and shot on black-and-white film stock. The sequence's unusual visual style evokes the deep-focus, Techniscope compositions of the gritty British spy films of the '60s, like The Ipcress File and The Spy Who Came in from the Cold –​ films that pushed back against the globe-trotting gloss of the early Connery Bond pictures.\nSmall objects like desk lamps loom large in the frame, while faces are shunted to the sides and shrouded in shadow: just a bit of good old-fashioned Cold War paranoia, like Khrushchev used to make.\nWith the franchise's palate now duly cleansed, the \"smart reintroductions\" Craig mentioned can take place. When Bond's mission takes him to the Bahamas, the camera watches him from a distance as he emerges from the ocean in a pair of snug blue swimming trunks –​ a sly visual echo, of course, of Ursula Andress making a similarly memorable entrance on Crab Key back in Dr. No , in 1962.\nOn one level, the shot's a bit of cheeky fun, but its voyeuristic quality was quietly revolutionary. For arguably the first time in a Bond film, the spy becomes the spied-upon.\nThe critic Raymond Mortimer once described 007 as \"what every man would like to be, and what every woman would like between her sheets\". Casino Royale pointed out to its male audience that sorry, but they probably couldn't be Bond at all: just look at him, for goodness sake.\nThat film also introduced a new kind of Bond Girl: Eva Green's Vesper Lynd, who was no squeaking arm candy, but Bond's equal in the field. Skyfall did the same with Naomie Harris' Eve Moneypenny –​ though Raoul Silva's moll, Séverine, was more of a throwback. And Spectre will introduce Léa Seydoux's Madeleine Swann, the Proustian overtones of whose name must be the most highbrow Bond gag to date. (\"It's above my head, that's for sure,\" said Craig.)\nIf Casino Royale suggested female characters could now be three-dimensional, Skyfall finally applied the same thinking to Bond himself.\nThe lack of biographical details in the early Bond films was generally thought of as a strength: again, it fed into the audience's narcissistic fantasy of actually being Bond, rather than just watching him in action. But Sam Mendes' Skyfall gave Bond a life story almost no one could relate to, and made his childhood a significant plot point. (The trailers for Spectre suggest that Bond's early life will continue to play a crucial role.)\nSurely inspired at least in part by Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, Skyfall effectively turns Bond into a British Bruce Wayne.\nLabyrinthine master plan Over the course of the film, we discover he's an orphan who comes from money and is driven into the shadows by his parents' untimely death: he even gets a spooky mansion with its own built-in secret cave and avuncular manservant. Meanwhile, Javier Bardem's cyberterrorist Silva took a leaf out of the Joker's book, allowing himself to be captured by MI6 as part of his labyrinthine master plan.\n(It's easy to spot Nolan's fingerprints on Bond, but the debt is cheerfully mutual: both Inception 's snowy secret base attack and The Dark Knight Rises ' mid-air hijacking rework similar eye-poppers in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Licence to Kill .)\nPerhaps the biggest lesson Bond learnt from Batman, though, was to embrace pop culture's newfound taste for the mythic. When Dench's M Quote: s from Tennyson's Ulysses during the select committee scene halfway through Skyfall , she isn't just giving a rousing speech. Mendes' film is positioning Craig's conspicuously out-of-shape Bond as a modern-day Odysseus, who's returned to his kingdom older and with his energies depleted.\nLike Odysseus and his bow, Bond is also equipped with a weapon only he can fire: a pistol from Q Branch with \"micro-dermal sensors\" in its grip. \"Were you expecting an exploding pen?\" Ben Whishaw's Q says as he presents Bond with the weapon. \"We don't really go in for that any more.\" The last time they did, of course, was in GoldenEye .\nThe final line of the Tennyson poem –​ \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\" –​ was carved by the entrance to the athletes' village at the 2012 London Olympic Games. And in isolation, the words are as glibly optimistic as a motivational poster with a cat on it. But in the context of the poem, they're wistful and nostalgic –​ uncertain about the future, if tentatively hopeful.\nLike Bond, Odysseus no longer possesses \"that strength which in old days/Moved earth and heaven\", and though his will remains strong, he's been \"made weak by time and fate\".\nAll he can do is cast off one more time and hope to recapture the glories of the past. In so many words, that's exactly what we hope for when we go to see a Bond movie. It's Craig's secret plan in action.\nThe Telegraph\nof", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:06:15.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
