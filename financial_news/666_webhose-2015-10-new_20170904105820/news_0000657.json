McCafferty, who was the only member of the Monetary Policy Committed to vote for higher interest rates in the past three meetings, said that the BoE should begin raising rates now to ensure gradual and steady path. \nIn a speech at Bloomberg's headquarters in London, McCafferty said: \"If we on the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) are to achieve our ambition of raising rates only gradually, so as to minimise the disruption to households and businesses of a normalisation of policy after a long period in which interest rates have been at historic lows, we need to avoid getting behind the curve.\" The market is now focusing on the BoE governor Mark Carney's at the Treasury Select Committee Hearing for remarks on policy. \nMeanwhile, a European Central Bank survey showed credit standards for Eurozone companies eased more than expected in the third quarter as banks used additional liquidity from the ECB's â‚¬60bn a month asset-purchase programme to grant loans. Four per cent of respondents in the ECB's Bank Lending Survey said they were easing credit standards on loans to enterprises. \nStateside, Federal Reserve official John Williams said the central bank should raise interest rates in the near future as the economy recovers. Speaking Bloomberg Television with Michael McKee on Monday he said; \"My own view is that the economy is still on a good trajectory.\" Fed official William Dudley speaks at 1400 BST in New York, potentially sharing his views on rates. The US will also see the release of housing starts and building permits figures at 1330 BST. \nOn the corporate front, Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) tumbled after separate surveys from Kantar and Nielsen (Frankfurt: NSLF.F - news ) showed the supermarket has lost market share. \nMining stocks continued to slide after China data on Monday showed a slowdown in economic growth in the third quarter and a worse than expected increase in industrial production.
