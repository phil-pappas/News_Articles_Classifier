The portfolio comprises about 115,000 loans that were packaged into a securitization vehicle called Granite.\nThe sale attracted interest from some of the biggest names in global finance with investment banks seeking to earn fees from providing financing to private equity buyers and by arranging asset-backed bonds. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne plans to sell the mortgages to help pay down the national debt.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. also bid for the home loans with partner CarVal Investors LLC, people familiar with the matter said previously. A third group that included Deutsche Bank AG, Blackstone Group LP and Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC also bid on the assets, the people said.\nPeter Duda, a spokesman for Cerberus at Weber Shandwick, and Morgan Stanley spokesman Hugh Fraser declined to comment. An official at U.K. Asset Resolution , the government body that oversees Granite, wasn’t immediately for available to comment.\n‘Next Phase’ “The next phase, which could include a variety of scenarios from a new securitization to taking over the mortgage business” is where “the money could be made,” said Ruben Van Leeuwen, an analyst at Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht.\nNorthern Rock funded almost 50 billion pounds of U.K. mortgages through Granite before being nationalized seven years ago. The Granite bonds crashed in value as the bank succumbed to the first British bank run in 140 years.\nIn the decade to the 2007 bank run, Northern Rock grew rapidly to become the U.K.’s fifth-largest mortgage lender, with assets in excess of 100 billion pounds, according to the U.K. Treasury. The bank relied on wholesale funding and securitization for its expansion, leaving it exposed when markets seized up during the financial crisis.", "external_links": ["http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/0809298es.pdf\\", "http://www.ukar.co.uk/\\"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:14:53.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
