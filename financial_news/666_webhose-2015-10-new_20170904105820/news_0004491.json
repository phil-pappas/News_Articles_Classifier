The US software titan was likely to make promoting new Windows-powered computers a priority in the all-important year-end holiday shopping season. \nA recent Gartner survey indicated that about half of consumers who took part intend to buy a new PC in the coming year. \nKitagawa expected a \"soft recovery\" for PC sales to begin in the current quarter and a more stable year ahead. \nChinese computer maker Lenovo had a leading 20.3 percent share of the PC market in the third quarter, while US-based Hewlett-Packard is second with 18.5 percent, according to Gartner estimates (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:17:04.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
