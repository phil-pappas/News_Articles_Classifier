Shouldn’t all those rugby league fans in NSW and Queensland get a ‘Friday before the NRL Grand Final’ public holiday each year?\nVictoria is the public holiday capital of Australia after the Labor Government announced holidays for AFL Grand Final eve and Easter Sunday.\nGrand Final Friday, alone, is predicted to cost at least $800 million in wages, lost productivity and penalty rates.\nHalf of Melbourne’s restaurants are expected to close on Grand Final Friday with ­penalty rates at double time and a half, giving visitors to the city few options to eat.\nAccording to the Australian Industry Group, every leisurely free holiday in Australia costs the national economy between $3 and $4 billion , and for business owners the personal costs are enormous.\nChief executive of Australian Industry Group Innes Willox said the disparity in public holiday schedules across the states was hurting businesses and the national economy.\n“Lack of synchronisation across the country is certainly costly and inconvenient, especially for businesses with a national presence or who operate across state borders,” he said in a statement to news.com.au.\nA battle over public holidays certainly isn’t new to Australia, and is regularly cause for debate.\nTERRITORY DAY/CRACKER NIGHT, NORTHERN TERRITORY\nThis is the one time a year that Territorians are allowed to do something most Australians cannot — and when they do, they go a little Troppo.\nThis rare privilege — to let off fireworks on July 1 each year — is in honour of the Northern Territory finally achieving self-governance.\nFor a brief few hours on July 1 every year, Territorians are allowed to go off, quite literally, with a big bang.\nThe tradition has been in place since 1980 after the then government declared the Top End needed another “cracker night” that honoured an occasion more relevant to locals.\nPreviously, they had celebrated Guy Fawkes Day in November. Territory Day seemed more appropriate. However the annual event is not loved by everyone.\nSome Territorians loathe the tradition and would rather see the back end of it.\nBesides anti-social behaviour, locals also have to worry about rogue fireworks setting off fires and damaging properties.\nTerritory night was alight at the annual Mindil Beach Territory Day fireworks display. Source: News Corp Australia\nThe NT Government recently surveyed the public on whether or not Territory Day should become a public holiday.\nChief Minister Adam Giles said the public voted about 50/50 but “slightly in favour” of the holiday but in doing so taking away an existing one.\n“I had floated the idea of making Territory Day a public holiday by swapping it with an existing one but Territorians were divided,” he said.\n“It is clear at this point in time that there isn’t a strong enough desire from the community to create a public holiday to celebrate Territory Day.”\nPEOPLE’S DAY, QUEENSLAND\nGoing to the Ekka is a rite of passage for Queenslanders who watch pig racing and visit cake stalls and buy show bags as part of the event.\nThe Ekka is marked with a public holiday, known as People’s Day, in August each year. It’s Queensland’s biggest annual event which attracts more than 50,000 people.\nBut many have argued that it should fall on a weekend and not be a public holiday.\nQueensland Treasurer and Minister for Industrial Relations Curtis Pitt said the Brisbane public holiday falls in the middle of the week at the request of the show’s organiser.\n“The RNA requests the Wednesday as its show day each year,” he said in a statement. “Wednesday is the traditional show day holiday for the Brisbane region — the community knows and understands this.”\nMr Pitt says there were no plans for a change.\nDown on the farm at Calvary Christian College Carbrook.
