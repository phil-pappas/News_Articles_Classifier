Winters. Wickman, creator of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) and author of the best-selling Traction and Get A Grip , teamed up with Certified EOS Implementer Mark C. Winters to pen RocketFuel , detailing the integral roles of Visionary and Integrator and how an effective relationship between the two can help your business thrive. John Pollock partnered with Paul Boyd over a year ago. At the time Pollock was looking to grow his firm, Financial Gravity, to become the premier provider of tax planning services to business owners, as well as grow the wealth management side of the business. To do so, he needed help, but wasn't sure what to do. \"I'm an entrepreneur and insanely driven. It's just how I'm wired. I need to be running 200 miles per hour all the time or I get bored and frustrated. This is great for me, but it really creates a dysfunctional work environment for my staff,\" said Pollock. \"I realized if I was going to make a reality out of all the stuff I dream about, I needed someone besides me to orchestrate it.\" That's where Boyd comes in. With a successful career making things happen in management and executive roles, Boyd had become a fan of Wickman's EOS, and had started a company, Cloud9b2b, providing fractional COO services to small businesses. Financial Gravity became a client of Boyd's and the two realized they were meant for each other. This led to Financial Gravity's eventual acquisition of Cloud9b2b. In RocketFuel, Winters, whom Financial Gravity uses as their EOS Implementer, uses Paul and John's experiences, relationship, and achievement to illustrate what can be accomplished when the Visionary role (John) and the Integrator role (Paul) are properly aligned and functioning.
