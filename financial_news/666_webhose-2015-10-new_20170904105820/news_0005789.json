It comes during an extraordinary time to be doing business in Africa,” he said from London, United Kingdom. \nIn the 1980s, Masiyiwa (54) emerged as one of the country’s leading industrialists, having built a large electrical engineering business. \nThe emergence of mobile cellular telephony led him to diversify into telecoms, but he soon ran into major problems when the Zimbabwean government refused to give him a license to operate his business. \nHe appealed to the Constitutional Court on the basis that the refusal constituted a violation of “freedom of expression.” \nThe Zimbabwean court, then one of the most respected on the continent, ruled in his favour after a five-year legal battle. \nThe ruling, which led to the removal of the state monopoly in telecommunications, is regarded as one of the key milestones in opening the African telecommunications sector to private capital. \nA devout Christian, he has won numerous accolades and gained international recognition for his business expertise and philanthropy, and is considered one of Africa’s most generous humanitarians. \nMasiyiwa has used his wealth to provide scholarships to over 100 000 young Africans over the past 20 years through his family foundation. \nHe supports over 40 000 orphans with educational initiatives, as well as sponsoring students at universities in America, The United Kingdom, and China. \nMasiyiwa also funds initiatives in public health and agriculture across the African continent. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=9052   23   Featured , Finance , Finance & Banking   .
