You can't put a financial firm in jail.\" \nMr Bernanke, who speaking to the American newspaper ahead of the publication of his memoirs , said that \"we were very, very determined not to let\" Lehman Brother collapse, but that \" we were out of bullets at that point \". The bankruptcy of Lehman in September 2008 sent global markets into a tailspin. \nHis successor, Janet Yellen, now has to decide whether the US economy is strong enough to cope with the first interest rate rise since 2006. \n\"You know, the last thing I want to do is second-guessing Janet Yellen, who I think is doing a really good job and making some tough calls,\" Mr Bernanke said. \n\"But clearly there are some tough decisions to make on how to manage policy at this point, and this is a very important juncture.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:14:18.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
