John Rozentals Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Fancy spending your Sunday cruising over Antarctica in a 747? Or perhaps a lazy afternoon in a Cessna checking out remote areas in the Kimberley? Maybe a fly-by of New Zealand’s highest peak?\nTo help the time-poor but experience-rich here are three of the best educational joy flights in this part of the world.\nAntarctica Imagine walking into work on Monday telling your colleagues you went to Antarctica and back in less than 13 hours over the weekend. That’s easily done, with three planned charter flights (departing Melbourne and Sydney) in early 2016 through Antarctica Flights .\nKimberley Aviation focuses on flying around beautiful but remote areas. Tourism Western Australia “They’re like no other flights you’ll ever experience,” Antarctica Flights’ Phil Asker says. “The air is so clear down there because there’s no pollution. You feel like you can touch a glacier.”\nThe aircraft, flown by Qantas pilots, descend as low as 10,000 feet over Antarctica on one of 19 flight paths. That’s low enough to take spectacular photos and see Antarctic bases, but high enough to ensure the planes stay well clear of mountains – and avoid any damage to the southernmost continent’s pristine environment.\n“You don’t get to see the wildlife,” Asker says. “We’re too high for that. But it is very much a sightseeing flight. The pilots love it.”\nExpert Antarctic expeditioners – some of whom have previously lived on Antarctic bases – are on board to answer questions.\nThere are short sightseeing flights over Franz Josef glacier in New Zealand. Many passengers are keen photographers, while others are after a bucket-list experience. Over the years there have been several marriage proposals and even three weddings on board.\nKimberley Those chasing a warmer climate, perhaps with a pit stop for a waterhole swim, should look at Broome-based Kimberley Aviation . It runs several day-trip options in Cessna 210s and G8 Airvans.\nCompany co-founder Sadie Prendergast says the air safaris focus on beautiful but remote areas, such as the islands of the Buccaneer Archipelago, that can’t be accessed easily by other means of transport.\n“The distances are so great, the roads are terrible, plus people are time-poor,” Prendergast says. “Those factors make flying around the Kimberley very popular.”\nLike Antarctica Flights, Kimberley Aviation includes an educational aspect to its program, offering a ground tour with a local Aboriginal guide as part of its Windjana Gorge air safari; and there’s a 4WD tour and guided walk on the Bungle Bungles trip.\nNZ peaks For those heading across the Tasman, it’s hard to go past the tours on offer from Air Safaris , which include a popular “grand traverse” around Aoraki Mount Cook, the country’s largest mountain, as well as Franz Josef and Fox glaciers.\nWith this option, you get snow-capped scenery, as in Antarctica (albeit less dramatic). However, you fly much closer in a smaller plane. And the tour takes only 50 minutes – perfect for travellers in a hurry.", "external_links": ["http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/home/au/en", "https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://kimberleyaviation.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:05:21.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
