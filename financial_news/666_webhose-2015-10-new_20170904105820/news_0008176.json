Syrian war dominates UN as strained ties hamper Obama, Putin Putin stands by support for Syria’s Assad Assad must go but we may need to talk to him, UK’s Hammond says In this article Companies and organisations: United Nations People: Vladimir Putin MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin has begun air strikes to support his beleaguered Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad, in the country’s first use of force in the Middle East since the 1980s.\nRussia carried out its first strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria, hitting arms and ammunition stores and transport and communication means, Interfax news service reports said, citing the defence ministry in Moscow. French Defence Minister Jean-Yves le Drian told legislators in Paris the targets were not from Islamic State.\nMr Putin gained unanimous approval from legislators in the upper house of parliament to use Russian armed forces in Syria, Kremlin chief of staff Sergei Ivanov said on Wednesday on state television. Russia will use its air force, not ground troops, and the mission will be for a limited period, Mr Ivanov said, without specifying the duration.\nStrikes would also target several thousand Russians fighting for the militant group who could be a threat if they returned to their homeland.\n\"The main task is to fight terrorism and to support the legitimate government of Syria in the fight against terrorism,\" Mr Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said. The Assad government had requested military assistance, he said.\nIt is the second time in as many years that Mr Putin has gained approval to use force abroad as he seeks to carve out a bigger role in global affairs. While his actions in Ukraine last year drew international condemnation, this time he pushed for a wider alliance to counter Islamic State, at a meeting with US President Barack Obama this week.\nThe approval to deploy the Russian military \"helps increase pressure on the US and Europe to accept that the new parameters of a political settlement in Syria must include the Assad regime at the helm of power and that the settlement will be defined by Russia,\" Ayham Kamel, Middle East and North Africa director at Eurasia Group, said.\nIn a speech at the United Nations on Monday Mr Putin called for a mandate for a broad coalition to fight Islamic State that would include Syrian government forces and Iran, Mr Assad’s biggest ally along with Russia. Mr Putin said he supports a parallel political transition in Syria.\nRussian strikes will be in support of operations by the Syrian army and will not target opposition forces other than those of Islamic State, Konstantin Kosachyov, chairman of the international affairs committee in the upper house, told state TV. \"This concerns Syria and is not about achieving any foreign policy goals or satisfying some ambitions, as we are regularly accused of by our western partners ... but only the national interests of the Russian Federation.\"\nRussia, which has its only naval facility outside the former Soviet Union in the Syrian port of Tartus, has been sending troops and weapons to bolster Mr Assad. In recent weeks, it has deployed more than two dozen fighter aircraft, attack helicopters, surface-to-air missile defence systems and hundreds of troops to a base in Syria, according to US officials.\nMr Putin’s administration drafted a request last month for the senate to approve the deployment of 2,000 air personnel to Syria, though it did not immediately submit it, according to sources.\nUS Defence Secretary Ash Carter instructed his staff on Tuesday to open lines of communication with Russia to avoid clashes between US-led coalition planes and Russian aircraft. Russia has established a co-ordination centre in Baghdad to share military intelligence with Syria, Iran and Iraq.\nUS Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN on Tuesday that Mr Putin’s involvement in Syria was a possible \"opportunity\" for the US. Mr Assad had to leave as part of an \"orderly transition\", he said in a softening of previous US demands for Mr Assad’s immediate removal.\nSaudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said Russia would do better to join the existing US-led coalition bombing Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than to start a second coalition in support of Mr Assad. Saudi Arabia supports a political transition away from the Syrian leader, although that could take \"a long time\", he told CBS News on Wednesday.\nThe head of the main western-backed opposition, Khaled Khoja, president of the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, said on MSNBC on Wednesday Russian military involvement in the conflict was an invasion that would demolish talks on a political resolution.\nRussia’s main goal appears to be shoring up the Assad regime, with attacks on Islamic State mainly an effort to \"legitimise their approach in Syria\", US air force Gen Philip Breedlove, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s supreme allied commander for Europe, told an audience at the German Marshall Fund in Washington on Tuesday.\nRussia had sent advanced weaponry beyond what would be necessary to fight Islamic State, suggesting that the hardware was to protect Mr Assad, he said.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:27:33.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
