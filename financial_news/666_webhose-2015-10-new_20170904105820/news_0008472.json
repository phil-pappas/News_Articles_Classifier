But just as production ramps up, the oil price has collapsed. \nThe group of banks that lent Tullow the money have agreed to give the company more time. The firm said yesterday that the six-monthly review of lending, which is based on the reserves of oil still in the ground, has left the borrowing arrangements unchanged. \nTullow said at its half-year results that its TEN project in Ghana was still on track to start production by the middle of next year, and this will increase the companyâ€™s share of West African (Other OTC: EMMLF - news ) production to 100,000 barrels of oil per day during the next two years. \nThe company has also hedged prices to insulate it from sharp falls, and said that during the first half the average hedged price was $70.60 per barrel. \nHowever, unless prices recover and production rapidly increases, equity holders are greatly exposed. \nThe company reported net debts of $3.6bn at the end of June, against net asses of $3.8bn. Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) forecast net debts to rise to $4bn by the end of December. \nThe dividend has already been cut and the banks might eventually see some return on their loans, but the risks for those holding the equity are clear.
