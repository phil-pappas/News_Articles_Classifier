Its index of medium-sized businesses also retreated, declining to 218.1 in August from 229.5 the previous month.\nThe decline in borrowing from the medium-sized businesses was less surprising because those are firms that are tied to the energy sector, said PayNet's president Bill Phelan. But the fall off for smaller companies was unexpected.\n\"It was kind of a surprise because it really means there was a little bit of a step backwards,\" Phelan said. At just 2 percent growth for small business borrowing compared to a year ago, that barely keeps up with replacement needs for worn out equipment or properties, he said.\nBorrowing trends across sectors suggested growth was shifting away from areas related to energy and to more consumer-oriented industries.\nThe borrowing index for companies in accommodation and food jumped to 272.8 from 265.5, while manufacturing edged down to 60.8 from 61.1.\n\"That means that there's this underlying consumer strength in the Canadian economy,\" said Phelan. \"It points to this shift ... it's a bumpy road to shift, it always is, but at least it's shifting into the consumers' hands.\"\nLoan delinquencies edged down in another positive sign.\nModerate delinquencies - those that are behind in payments by 30 days or more - edged down to 1.07 percent from 1.08 percent. Loans that were more than 90 days late similarly declined to 0.32 percent from 0.34 percent.
