Louise Kennerley by Sally Patten The government's decision to allow self-managed funds to continue to borrow is \"defensible\", experts say, given debt is a tiny fraction of the $572 billion industry.\nThe Coalition's decision to reject the financial system inquiry proposal to ban borrowing by small super funds for property arguably puts it at odds with the views of the Reserve Bank of Australia and economists such as Saul Eslake, but other industry observers are less perturbed by the move.\n\"The government is taking a wait-and-see approach. It is quite defensible. You put in a monitoring system so you can assess how much borrowing is going on and that will put you in a good position to restrict the activity if needed,\" Grattan Institute's Jim Minifie said.\nAt June 2015 the self-managed fund industry had $15.6 billion in outstanding borrowing.\nThe figure is a fraction of the $572 billion of assets held by the sector, but it has grown dramatically in the past few years. In March 2013 outstanding borrowing stood at just $2.6 billion.\nEconomists have pointed to the potential for geared self-managed schemes to inflate property prices, but Graeme Colley, of the SMSF Association, said the majority of do-it-yourself funds were invested in commercial, rather than residential, property.\nAnthony Asher, associate professor of risk and actuarial studies at UNSW, said self-managed fund trustees should be able to borrow if they could repay the debt before they retired.\nNot permitted in drawdown \"Debt should perhaps not be permitted in the drawdown phase, when members may start to lose focus,\" he said.\nSydney Business School Associate Professor John Evans said that while the government had no need to play too much of a \"big brother\" role in its regulation of SMSF, the decision to reject the ban on borrowing meant product providers might require greater scrutiny.\nProfessor Evans said it was appropriate for self-managed funds to borrow, given that large, pooled funds invested in geared vehicles, but he accepted that the level of competence among self-managed scheme trustees varied.\n\"Let's strengthen ASIC to deal with the supply side. We need to come down hard on corruption,\" he said, noting that on Tuesday the Supreme Court of NSW found that a property group called Park Trent Properties had been unlawfully carrying on a financial services business for more than five years by providing advice to clients to buy investment properties through a self-managed fund.\nASIC launched legal proceedings in November 2014 against Park Trent, which, by the time of the trial in June 2015, had advised more than 860 members of the public to establish and switch funds into a self-managed fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:53:05.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
