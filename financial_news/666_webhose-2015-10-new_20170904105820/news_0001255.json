Chile became the third Andean nation in just over a month to raise interest rates as a slump in local currencies pushed up inflation across the region. The central bank indicated further increases will follow.\nPolicy makers, led by bank President Rodrigo Vergara, raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3.25 per cent Thursday, as forecast by 19 of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The others expected the bank to keep rates on hold. It was the first increase in more than four years.\nVergara told Bloomberg this month that Chile's \"ultra expansive\" monetary policy was coming to an end. A drop in commodity prices and the prospect of higher borrowing costs in the US have led to a decline in emerging market currencies and pushed the Chilean peso to its weakest level in more than a decade last month. The consequent jump in import costs has kept inflation above or at the upper limit of the target range for the past 18 months, the longest period since 2008.\n\"The future trajectory of rates envisages additional adjustments to ensure convergence to the inflation target,\" the central bank said in a statement accompanying the decision. The pace of increases \"will depend on the new information.\"\nVergara said in an interview on October 2 that the bank is standing by its estimate of three quarter-point increases over the next year. Still, monetary policy will remain expansive, he said, with the benchmark rate remaining below the neutral level of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent.\nLittle change in expansion expected \"The central bank is considering additional hikes, but the bias is less hawkish than previous statements,\" said Antonio Moncado, an economist at Banco de Credito e Inversiones in Santiago. \"It is data dependent, which wasn't explicit in previous months.\"\nThe central bank wants to keep monetary stimulus as economic growth remains subdued. On October 5, Finance Minister Rodrigo Valdes cut 2015's growth forecast to 2.25 per cent, from the previous estimate of 2.5 per cent in June and from the 3.6 per cent estimated in this year's budget.\n On the same day, the central bank said that the Imacec index, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose 1.1 per cent in August from a year earlier, compared with the 2 per cent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nEconomists now expect Chile's economy to expand 2 per cent this year, little changed on last year, according to a central bank survey released Tuesday. That is down from the 2.6 per cent forecast in June and 2.8 per cent in April.\nSome economists had expected rates to remain on hold today after consumer prices rose 4.6 per cent in September from the year earlier, compared with the 4.9 per cent median estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg and the central bank's 2 per cent to 4 per cent target range.\n\"We think the bank is going to hold rates during what is left of 2015 and see the impact in fundamental macro-economic variables like inflation and market expectations,\" Moncado said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:07:17.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
