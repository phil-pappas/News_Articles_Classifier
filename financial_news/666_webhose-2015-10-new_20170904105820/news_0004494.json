RBS Economics IMF 2015 forecasts for growth \nRussia's outlook has been revised down further after the IMF already penciled it in for a decline of 3.4 per cent earlier this year. The economy of the former Soviet state is also expected to suffer more next year than previously thought. Growth is predicted to drop a further by 0.6 per cent in 2016 by the IMF, which in July had believed Russia would have started to recover by next year. Falling oil prices have taken a heavy toll on the former Soviet state, as well as Western sanctions, which were put in place in March 2014 after President Vladimir Putin led an invasion of Crimea and Eastern Ukraine.
