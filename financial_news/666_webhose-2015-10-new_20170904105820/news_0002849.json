Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan The Coalition look set to reverse a major Abbott government push for changes to environment laws to stop green groups mounting legal challenges to resource projects, with Environment Minister Greg Hunt admitting they are unlikely to pass Parliament.\nThe changes were championed by Tony Abbott who said environment groups were \"sabotaging\" developments after the Mackay Conservation Group used legal technicalities to hold up the approval of Adani's Carmichael mine in Queensland.\nThe Abbott government said section 487 (2) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act needed to be tightened to stop 'lawfare' from groups not located in the same area as major resource projects, which they said were damaging the economy.\nNow that the mine has gained approval , and Malcolm Turnbull is in power, the Coalition has now said publicly that the changes are unlikely to go through.\n'Well actually there is a very, very strong national standard which is in line with global standards that is under the administrative decisions judicial review act,\" Mr Hunt said when asked if he is pushing ahead with the EPBC changes.\n\"We will let the process run through the Senate as it currently is. I am realistic that it's unlikely to pass the Senate.\"\nEnvironmental groups are already threatening to mount a new legal challenge to the Adani mine, with the Mackay Conservation Group zeroing in on another threatened species they say the mine would extinguish - the Black Throated Finch .\nTheir first challenge, which saw the approval set aside, was successful after the Environment Department conceded it had not properly considered how the project would affect the yakka skink and the ornamental snake.\n Mr Hunt did not deny there could be new challenges to the Adani approval.\n\"Every decision under the Federal Environment Act is subject to challenge from disappointed proponents or opponents and so the nature of this is that it's like being a judge,\" he said.\nBut Mr Hunt said at this stage a decision not to approve the mine would be invalidated.\n\"Any other decision would certainly, in my view, have been invalidated by a court,\" he said.\nBoth federal Labor and the Queensland Labor government have welcomed the approval, seen as providing a boost to regional employment.\nCritics have said, however, that the biggest challenge for Adani is not receiving approvals but raising the $10 billion in funds it needs to make the investment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://www.facebook.com/mackayconservationgroup/photos/a.483537951748304.1073741830.482378231864276/716870181748412/?type=3", "https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/great-barrier-reef--3/adani-is-back/we-re-taking-adani-to-court-again?t=eVtktLG", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-16T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:51:49.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
