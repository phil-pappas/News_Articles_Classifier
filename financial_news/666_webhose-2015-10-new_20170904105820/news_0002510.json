Written by: Farran Powell 10/12/15 - 9:12 AM EDT NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” Similar to stock brokers feeling queasy over their job security with the advent of online trading, real agents are feeling anxious given that their commissions are expected to change with the rise of consumer savvy real estate sites. \nThe role of this long-standing middleman is expected to evolve with most multiple listing services available online. With many people finding information online, new models for home sales are changing commission rates -- creating some savings for sellers and buyers. \nA recent survey conducted by SurveyMonkey Audience for Seattle-based Redfin, an online real estate brokerage that now operates in 80 U.S. cities, finds that 17% of people bought a house in the last two years without an agent. The same survey also reports that discounting commissions is widespread. A third of those polled said they received some form refund or commission savings of $500 or more. \nListing a typical home with a conventional Realtor costs around 6% of the sales price. On a $230,000 home, which is close to the National Association of Realtor's median value for a single-family home, that commission would tally up to $13,800.
