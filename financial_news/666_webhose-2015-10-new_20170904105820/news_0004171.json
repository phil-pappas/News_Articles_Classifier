Celebrity Mom, Lara stated “My happiness grows twofold when I wake up in the morning to my daughter’s smiling face . As a mother, I know the importance of a good diaper, especially when it comes to ensuring the best night’s sleep and undisturbed playtime for my little one. When a baby has a diaper that not only keeps him dry all night but also is so soft that the baby doesn’t even realize he is wearing one, he may be less likely to be woken up by the need for a diaper change. As a result, he gets the rest he deserves and stays recharged and raring to explore the world.” Sleep Consultant Ajita adds “The skin is not just a baby’s biggest sense organ but also one of the most important part of the body. If a baby’s skin remains wet, it becomes more permeable to irritants which can lead to infection and uninterrupted sleep, thereby affecting his overall development. The nappy area is particularly exposed to irritations and needs special care. Therefore a soft diaper with good absorbency plays a vital role while the baby explores his surroundings.
