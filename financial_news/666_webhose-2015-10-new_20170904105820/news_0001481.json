The ISIS recruit, according to MHA sources, recently called his family pleading with them to save him. Sources also added that the boy has no connection with the Indian Mujahideen. Several of IM's members traced their roots to Azamgarh. Many of the IM members have joined forces with ISIS.\nImportantly, the security agencies have established the identity of an Indian-origin handler who working from Dubai who lured the Azamgarh youth to ISIS through online. \"We will bring back the boy as well as get the handler extradited,\" a senior official said. The youngster first flew to Turkey from where he was guided to Syria. His call was traced to Raqqa on Syria-Iraq border. He called his family a couple of weeks ago, saying that \"he wants to come back\" but is not allowed to leave.\nThe security establishment remains tightlipped about the recruit's background. His profession or family details have not been revealed. MHA sources did not reveal whether the latest ISIS recruit will be arrested if they are able to bring him back. \"We will have to interrogate him and see the level of indoctrination,\" senior official added. Till now the government is following \"hands-off\" policy. The aspiring ISIS recruits have been let off in the past if established that they have been 'misled' and have not entirely crossed over to IS ideology. 17 men from Telegana who headed to ISIS but caught well in time by Indian agencies have not been arrested.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:54:07.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
