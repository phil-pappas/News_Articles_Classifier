By using this application in house, business owners and HR will save money on check paper and outsourcing paycheck processing to an expensive company. Banks often times will offer a no cost checking account option to customers when direct deposit is put into place for payroll checks. “ezACH direct deposit solution saves both team members and payroll specialists time and money with updated version.” Halfpricesoft.com founder, Dr. Ge says.\nEzACH creates an ACH (automated clearing house) file from payroll data and sends it to the user’s bank to authorize transfer of funds to an employee’s bank. Depositing paychecks directly means employers don’t have to worry about lost paychecks. The software imports payroll data directly from Halfpricesoft.com’s ezPaycheck or ezCheckPrinting, or it can import from a .csv file generated by third-party software.\nAdditionally, ezACH version 3.0.1 can save multiple groups of settings. If one file is generated for hourly employees and a different file for salaried employees, ezACH Deposit Software can remember the settings for both. The user simply tells ezACH which group of settings to apply to each imported data file.\nEzACH Deposit Software — Affordable direct paycheck deposit for any business — free 30-day trial\nEzACH is priced at just $199 one time fee, per installation.
