Realtors and banks are winning the war against zombie foreclosures.\nSome 20,050 U.S. residential properties in the foreclosure process — but not yet repossessed by the foreclosing lender — were vacant or “zombie” homes at end of the third quarter, down 27% from 27,508 the previous quarter and down 43% from 35,113 a year ago, according to real-estate website RealtyTrac.\nVacant residential properties in the foreclosure process accounted for 1.3% of all vacant U.S. residential properties in the third quarter, with bank-owned homes accounting for another 1.9% of all vacant properties at the end of the third quarter, the RealtyTrac study also found .\nOverall, there are still more than 1.5 million vacant U.S. residential properties, representing 1.8% of all the nation’s 84.7 million residential properties. More than 6% are seriously underwater, meaning the combined value of loans secured by the property is at least 25% more than the market value, and only 3% are bank-owned or in the foreclosure process.\n“The overall inventory of homes in the foreclosure process has dropped 36% over the past year so it’s not too surprising to see a similarly dramatic drop in vacant zombie foreclosures,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac, which analyzed over 130 million property records.\nRead: 30% of homes lost value over the last year\nPerhaps a more perplexing statistic for realtors: More than 63% of vacant homes are not in financial distress and/or not even encumbered by a loan. “The fact that the homeowners are not selling given the recovering real estate market in most areas indicates that many of these properties are in poor condition and in neighborhoods that have been left behind by the housing recovery,” Blomquist says.\nAmong metropolitan statistical areas with at least 100,000 total residential properties, those with the most vacant residential properties were Detroit (84,291), Miami (67,139), Chicago (48,181), Atlanta (36,396), and New York (35,200).\nThe reduction in empty and foreclosed homes is good for neighborhoods and the health of the property market, experts say, particularly in areas hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis like Florida, Nevada and Arizona. Foreclosed homes not only are more likely to fall into disrepair, but might also reduce the value of nearby homes.\nOn average, each foreclosure that takes place within 0.05 miles of a house lowers the price of that house by about 1%, according to one study released by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.
