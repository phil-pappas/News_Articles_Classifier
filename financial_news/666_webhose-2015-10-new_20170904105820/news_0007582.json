AP by Andrew Kramer and Anne Barnard Ratcheting up the confrontation over the Syria war, Russia said on Monday that its \"volunteer\" ground forces would join the fight, and NATO warned the Kremlin after at least one Russian warplane trespassed Turkey's airspace.\nThe sabre-rattling on both sides reflected a dangerous new big-power entanglement in the war, as longstanding differences between Russia and the United States over President Bashar al Assad of Syria and his opponents increasingly plays out not only in the halls of the United Nations but on the battlefield in Syria.\nRussia squared off with Turkey and its NATO allies, calling the air incursion on Saturday an innocent mistake because of foul weather -- a claim US officials rejected.\nNews services said late Monday that a second airspace violation might have been committed on Sunday, but that report could not be immediately confirmed.\nThe Russian air and ground deployments in Syria challenge the regional policies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Barack Obama and NATO.\nA Russian ground force could fundamentally alter the conflict, which has left 250,000 people dead and displaced half the country's population since it started in 2011.\nAlthough President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he would not put troops in Syria, the plan for so-called volunteers was disclosed on Monday by his top military liaison to the Parliament, Adm. Vladimir Komoyedov. It seemed similar to Russia's stealth tactic in using soldiers to seize Crimea from Ukraine in March of 2014 and to aid pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine.\nMoreover, US military officials said they believed more than 600 Russian military personnel were already on the ground in Syria, not counting aircrews, and that tents for nearly 2,000 people had been seen at Russia's air base near Latakia, in northwest Syria near the Turkish border.\n Russia intensified the airstrikes it began in Syria last week, with new attacks on territory near Palmyra that is indisputably held by the Islamic State. But Russian targets remain a matter of deep contention.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:10:46.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
