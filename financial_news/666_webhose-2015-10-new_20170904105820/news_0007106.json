According to the statement, “the airline is unable to service and repay its debt, as well as fund its operations. That does not meet certification requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).” The decision was made by the authorities after the Russian carrier’s unscheduled audit took place on Oct. 6-20.\nAeroflot had planned to acquire Transaero, but later dropped plans, saying Transaero shareholders failed to consolidate 75% plus one share. It was supposed to save the second biggest airline, which has suffered a growing debt burden. According to Russia`s Sberbank president Herman Gref, Transaero`s overall debt to creditors reached RUB250 billion ($4 billion).\nThe day before authorities announced the Transaero AOC decision, Russia´s RBC Daily reported Vladislav Filev, S7 Group co-owner, bought 51% of Transaero shares. New shareholders will try to escape the Transaero bankruptcy, the RBC Daily reported, quoting Filev. Sberbank has already filed a bankruptcy claim against Transaero. The claim was registered in Saint Petersburg City Arbitration Court on Oct. 19.\nAfter news of the S7 deal, shares of Transaero at Moscow Exchange grew from RUB6.8 to RUB17.51 per share by 5:30 p.m. Moscow time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:41:12.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
