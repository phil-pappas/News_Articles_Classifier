Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) has offered $30bn for Baxalta as the company wants become a leading business in rare diseases. However, the value of the offer has fallen by more than a fifth. \nExane BNP Paribas analyst Kerry Holford said the proposed acquisition remains a \"significant overhang\" for Shire. \n\"Whilst we continue to favour the underlying business model, the uncertainties surrounding the future of Shire-Baxalta remain significant,\" Holford said. \n\"We detect little investor appetite for this proposal, exacerbated by the recent performance of both stocks (given the all-share nature of the deal), and expect this to remain a cap on stock performance in the near term.\" Exane has forecast a 4% increase in group net product sales of $1.6bn and a 6% rise in core earnings per share of $2.98, driven by Vyvanse, a treatment for binge eating disorders. \nMeanwhile, UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) believes there could be a positive price reaction if there is any perception that Shire is cooling off on Baxalta. \n\"A worst-case outcome for investors we've spoken to is the prospect that Shire overpays,\" said UBS analyst David Evans. \nEvans also highlighted the added wows over Shire's struggles to launch lifitegrast, a medicine for dry eye disease. \nThe US Food and Drug Administration decided against approving the drug last month and has asked for more information. Shire's chief executive Flemming Ornskov said the FDA will be given data from a Phase III trial later this year that could satisfy the regulator . \n\"We reiterate our view that lifitegrast has a very good chance of succeeding in OPUS-3, and the path to approval seems to be laid out now,\" Evans said. \n\"We adjust our EPS down 1-2%, mainly on slightly more negative FX since end June.\" Friday 23 October INTERIM DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE AA , Burford Capital (Other OTC: BRFRF - news ) , Costain Group (LSE: COST.L - news ) , Epwin Group (LSE: EPWN.L - news ) , Fairpoint Group (LSE: FRP.L - news ) , Flowtech Fluidpower (LSE: FLO.L - news ) , Gamma Communications (LSE: GAMA.L - news ) , Good Energy Group, Green Reit (Other OTC: GREEF - news ) , Henry Boot (LSE: BHY.L - news ) , Indivior (LSE: INDV.L - news ) , Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) , Interserve (LSE: IRV.L - news ) , Iona Environmental VCT, Iona Environmental Vct 'B' Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) , Keywords Studios (LSE: KWS.L - news ) , Lighthouse Group (LSE: LGT.L - news ) , Morgan Sindall Group, Pendragon (LSE: PDG.L - news ) , Proven Planned Exit VCT, Real Estate Investors, Servelec Group (LSE: SERV.L - news ) , Stadium Group (LSE: SDM.L - news ) , Vitec Group (Other OTC: VTEPF - news ) INTERIM EX-DIVIDEND DATE Zhejiang Expressway Co 'H' Shares Q3 Shire Plc, William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) ANNUAL REPORT James Halstead (LSE: JHD.L - news ) IMSS TSB Banking Group , William Hill EGMS Treveria (LSE: TRV.L - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:05:10.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
