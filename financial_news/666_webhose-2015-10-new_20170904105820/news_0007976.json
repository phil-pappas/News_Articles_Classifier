Over the medium term, we expect commodity prices to recover as the global oil supply and demand forces re-balance, sparking some early activity improvements in the second half of 2016. Pricing will continue to remain weak until 2017. \nWe will take advantage of this environment and continue to aggressively rationalize our cost base, upgrade our talent bench and generate positive free cash flow from operations. We will continue to exhibit spending restraint and discipline right through 2016 and 2017. Counting all of the cost reduction measures we have undertaken in 2014 and 2015, by the end of this year, we will have generated total cost savings of $2 billion , of which $600 million is as permanent as it is structural. We believe we can exit this down cycle, as a leaner, de-layered, more efficient and streamlined organization, ready to respond to market needs. Our actions will ensure very strong incrementals when the recovery unfolds, both in earnings and in free cash flow. \nIn the first nine months of 2015, we have recorded overall company decrementals of 28% when compared to 2014. We believe this statistic is among the best in the industry and reflects the focus and discipline we have exhibited this year. In the last downturn in 2009, the comparative number was a poor 140%, meaning that our operating income declined more than revenue. \nOur balance sheet will be managed pro-actively with debt paydowns out of free cash flow over the next three years. We feel confident in our ability to de-lever the balance sheet.' \nReclassifications and Non-GAAP Financial Measures \nReclassifications have been made among the Company's reportable segments due to a reorganization of our business into five reportable segments. All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and other financial information in the following pages. \nUnless explicitly stated to the contrary, all financial measures used throughout this document are non-GAAP. Corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures have been provided in the following pages to offer meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior periods. \nAbout Weatherford \nWeatherford is one of the largest multinational oilfield service companies providing innovative solutions, technology and services to the oil and gas industry.
