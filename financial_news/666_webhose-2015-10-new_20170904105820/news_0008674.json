At the top end of the range, the sale would value the company at about $17.58 billion, based on the 879 million million shares of common stock that will be outstanding after the offering. \nFirst Data processes payments for banks and merchants and offers a variety of other services and products, such as systems for accepting credit cards and preventing fraud. \nThe company has proved to be the biggest equity bet for KKR , the private-equity firm that acquired First Data in 2007 for $29.8 billion, including debt and fees. Proceeds from the IPO will be used to prune the company’s about $21 billion of debt, which KKR used to finance its buyout. An IPO priced at the $19 midpoint would value KKR’s stake at $5.3 billion, or about 35% higher than its $3.9 billion investment, its biggest equity position in a company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:56:14.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
