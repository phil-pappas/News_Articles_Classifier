NFLX 1.61 % raised the price of its most popular streaming plan in the U.S. by $1 for new customers as it ramps up investment in original shows and movies.\nNetflix said its “standard” plan that allows for two simultaneous streams will now cost $9.99 a month , up from $8.99 previously. The increase won’t impact its other plans, which include a “basic” one at $7.99 a month that allows for one stream and a “premium” plan at $11.99 a month that permits four streams at once.\n“To continue adding more TV shows and movies including many Netflix original titles, we are modestly raising the price for some new members in the U.S., Canada and Latin America,” a Netflix spokesman said in an emailed statement. “As a thank you to existing Netflix members -- who aren’t already benefiting from grandfathering -- we will maintain their current price for a year.”\nNetflix shares rose about 1.8% in late-afternoon trading to $110.09.\nThe streaming service rolled out a similar increase across its European territories in August, increasing the cost of its standard plan by about a euro.\nWall Street analysts and investors have closely been monitoring Netflix’s pricing power. About a year ago, investors balked after the company disclosed slowing U.S. subscriber growth in the third quarter and largely blamed a price increase it had rolled out over the summer. Later, Netflix said it believed the downshift in U.S. subscriber additions would have happened regardless of the price increase and said it was a “natural progression” as it grows. Netflix shares have soared this year.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali said in a September research note that investors shouldn’t expect to see a negative impact on customer retention or acquisition as a result of Netflix’s price hike in Europe. Mr. Squali said that Netflix’s move to raise rates implied “strong adoption of the service” in those territories.\nNetflix is pouring money into original programming and writing big checks for global rights to content that appear on its service. The company is also investing in marketing and programming as it pursues a rapid global expansion that it aims to complete by the end of next year.\n“We’re going to continue to have incentives for people to move up in the plans as suits their usage pattern, but we want to take it very slow,” said Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings during Netflix’s second-quarter earnings call in July. “Over the next decade, I think we will be able to have more and more content and add more value, and then be able to price that appropriately.”\nThe company’s plan at $9.99 a month is still cheaper than that of Hulu ’s no-commercials plan at $11.99 a month . Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime Instant Video is free along with a $99-a-year Prime membership.\nWrite to Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://www.netflix.com/?"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:29:37.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
