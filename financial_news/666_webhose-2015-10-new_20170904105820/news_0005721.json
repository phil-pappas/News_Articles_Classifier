This is a winning strategy and we are determined to stick with it. \n\"Over the last two years, we have shown that we are ready to make necessary and early changes to match that ambition to the demands of our customers, especially at a time when the market is clearly undergoing permanent and rapid structural change.\" @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:23:58.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
