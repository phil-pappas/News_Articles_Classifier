Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is demanding that credit agency Experian provide answers on how it is handling the data breach that affected 15 million T-Mobile customers. ADVERTISEMENT “Experian has files on more than 220 million people. Protection of this information is of the utmost importance, especially because the scope of the information is vast and virtually no consumer can apply for credit without entering your system,” Brown wrote in a letter to Experian CEO Brian Cassin on Tuesday.\nThe ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee asked that Cassin provide details about how the company is protecting victims and shoring up its systems. \nBrown also demanded more information about previous breaches at Experian. \n“Recent reports indicate that Experian’s T-Mobile customer information had been breached before, possibly as early as December 2013,” Brown wrote. “Can you provide more information about previous breaches and what may have been done to address earlier weaknesses?” \nT-Mobile revealed earlier this month that hackers had compromised encrypted data at the vendor, which processes the telecom carrier’s credit applications, sometime between Sept. 1, 2013, and Sept. 16 of this year. \nThe stolen data includes Social Security numbers and other ID numbers, such as driver’s license or passport numbers. \n\"As we have seen repeatedly over the past few years, large companies are vulnerable to breaches of consumer information and the financial industry is a prime target for such attacks,\" Brown wrote Tuesday. \nBrown joins other lawmakers who have pressed for more information following the hack. \nSens. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Bill Nelson (Fla.) and Brian Schatz (Hawaii) — all leading Democrats on the Commerce Committee — wrote both T-Mobile and Experian last week requesting information on how the two firms were handling fallout from the hack. \nAs large-scale hacks on private companies including Target and Home Depot continue to make headlines, lawmakers have scrambled to pass legislation to address the issue. \nThe Commerce Committee is considering a bill from Nelson that would set national data security requirements and require companies to notify customers of a data breach involving personal information within a set time frame, one of at least five proposals in the upper chamber. \nThe White House has put forward its own proposal, which like Nelson’s bill would require companies to notify customers if their information has been compromised within 30 days of discovering a breach. It would also set minimum security guidelines for companies handling sensitive data. \n“Experian and T-Mobile’s recent incident demonstrates the need for legislation,” the Commerce Committee members’ letter said.
