According to a poll conducted by the American Institute of CPAs, more than half of CPA financial planners report that their clients are fearful of depleting their savings in retirement.\nTo mitigate these concerns, many advisors have turned to tax-planning strategies as a means to help clients maximize their retirement income. It’s a topic that Nate Wenner , Principal and Regional Director at Wipfli Hewins Investment Advisors (Wipfli Hewins), a CPA-based financial advisory firm, addressed as a featured speaker for the Roseville Area Senior Program (RASP)’s Investment Forum, which took place on Friday, September 25. The forum is a weekly seminar for investors of all experience levels interested in learning more about managing their money.\nMore than 30 investors attended Wenner’s presentation, which focused on the role of tax-efficient investing strategies, such as tax-loss harvesting, in retirement income planning. An engaging discussion and Q&A session followed the presentation. As a CPA-based firm, Wipfli Hewins has always taken a tax-aware approach to investing — a practice that has been elevated through the launch of its Tax-Smart IndexingTM service for clients.\n\"Many investors are unaware of the impact taxes can have on investment returns,\" says Wenner. \"I enjoyed sharing new ideas with the group and explaining how our firm uses tax-efficient strategies to help improve our clients' investment experiences.\"\nAbout Wipfli Hewins Investment Advisors\nWipfli Hewins Investment Advisors currently has offices in California, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and is growing across the U.S. with partners that share its philosophy.
