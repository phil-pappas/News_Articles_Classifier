Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Tim Binsted Cochlear chairman Rick Holliday-Smith said the Turnbull government should raise the $100 million cap on research and development concessions to keep innovative companies and ideas in Australia.\nHe said that Cochlear, the $4.8 billion world leader in hearing implants, is already bumping into this \"artificial cap\", and there is an incentive to perform additional R&D overseas where the company can qualify for incentives.\n\"Cochlear has long been seen as an example of an Australian invention that has successfully transitioned to a global advanced manufacturing success story.\n\"The question today is: how can Australia continue to encourage new similar success stories while at the same time ensuring that companies like Cochlear continue to be Australian based?\n\"We would recommend the government to reward appropriately defined innovative companies for their incremental R&D spend by increasing the concession for additional R&D expenditure,\" he said at the company's annual meeting in Sydney.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has put economic matters and innovation at the centre of his government's plans and appointed Christopher Pyne to lead the innovation, science and industry portfolio.\nAlliances vital Mr Holliday-Smith also said that increased collaboration between the corporate and university sectors is critical to foster innovation and create more global success stories like Cochlear.\n Cochlear employs 2800 people and has operations in 20 different countries, although its $941 million revenue is generated from sales in more than 100 countries. The company itself is based at the Hearing Hub at Macquarie University in Sydney.\n\"This is a unique alliance of over 2500 academics, business and hearing health professionals â€¦ Cochlear strongly urges all parties to continue to strengthen and develop these alliances,\" Mr Holliday-Smith said.\n\"It should mean government-oriented funding, including into tertiary education and research, should have a clear objective of creating collaborative centres of excellence. It should also have a clear objective of keeping as much of the ensuing value and work opportunity in Australia.\"\nCSL chief supports cap ban Paul Perreault, the CEO of Australian and global blood products giant CSL, also called for the cap on R&D tax incentives to be removed.\nHe said the government should allocate a significant portion of the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund to turning research into actual products and solutions.\n\"Australia has a lot of good innovation and research [but] Australian world-class R&D [often] goes offshore,\" he said.\n\"Really what you want is something that is going to transform human health. It is something that gets out of the test tubes, out of the labs, and into patients. At least 20 per cent of the Medical Research Future Fund in translational research would be a good start, in my view.\"\nNew Cochlear chief executive Chris Smith , who is just six weeks into the job, also gave the first indication of his plans for the company.\nConsumer focus Unveiling a four-point plan to expand the core, shape the organisation, build a service business and create value, he said raising awareness and a deeper commercial focus will be critical to his strategy.\n\"Science and technology, clinical and regulatory, we are fantastic at that. But I would argue we need to be a consumer company,\" he said.\nMr Smith said that many potential customers have simply never heard of a cochlear implant.\n\"I call this the Chilli's phenomenon. Chilli's is a restaurant chain in the United States, and if you walked into a Chilli's on any given day and asked anybody in the room if they knew what a cochlear implant is, no one would know,\" he said.\nAbout 360 million people worldwide suffer from a disabling loss of hearing. Nearly one in three people over the age of 65 are affected by hearing loss, but very few adults use the cochlear technology.\nServicing these customers will be key to reviving the flagging growth in sales of cochlear implants.\nMr Smith said that he wants to build deeper engagement between implant recipients and the company. In the US engaged recipients spend three to four times as much as disengaged recipients.\nCochlear has a network of 3000 recipient volunteers who are available to share their stories with potential recipients.\nThat network has bolstered the North American business and Mr Smith plans to roll the program out in other markets.\nThe new Cochlear boss is also developing a detailed Chinese market strategy.\nThe board expects Mr Smith to pitch his China growth strategy internally by the end of the 2015-16 year.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/cochlear-appoints-chris-smith-as-new-ceo-to-succeed-chris-roberts-20150525-gh9j0b.html", "https://twitter.com/timbinsted"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:17:09.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
