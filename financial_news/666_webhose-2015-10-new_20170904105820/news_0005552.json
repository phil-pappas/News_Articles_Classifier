That's not always the case specially for Australian companies that don't always have a proper understanding of the Chinese market.\"\nThe move comes even as Australia is making efforts to open up trade with China after the two countries signed a trade agreement late last year.\nShares in IAG, which has a market value of A$12.2 billion ($8.93 billion), have fallen nearly 15 percent this year, underperforming the broader market's 3.4 percent decline.
