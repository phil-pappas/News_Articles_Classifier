If enacted, the new rule will impact companies that fall within the CFPB’s broad interpretation of businesses that provide financial products and services for consumer purposes. \nThe announcement comes on the heels of the CFPB’s publication of a three-year study on arbitration that concluded that consumers generally are better served through litigation. According to CFPB Director Richard Cordray, arbitration clauses amount to “a free pass to sidestep the court and avoid accountability for wrongdoing.” \nThe CFPB does not intend to ban all arbitration agreements in consumer contracts. However, under the proposal, businesses within the CFPB’s jurisdiction will be required to include language in each consumer contract stating that the arbitration agreement does not apply to cases filed as potential class-action lawsuits unless a judge denies class certification or a court dismisses the underlying claims. \nBy its terms, the proposal will apply to arbitration agreements entered into 180 days from the effective date of any regulation. The CFPB indicated that it will set an effective date of 30 days after the rule is published. The proposal will drastically impact businesses. If passed, businesses will be required to revamp arbitration clauses contained in their consumer contracts within 210 days after the rule is published. Businesses also will likely shoulder increased class-action litigation costs because companies will no longer be able to rely on an arbitration agreement to support a motion to compel arbitration in a class-action case (until after class certification is denied or class claims are dismissed). \nThe proposal diverges from several Supreme Court decisions that have held that mandatory arbitration clauses can include class action bans, such as AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion and American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant , as well as the Federal Arbitration Act enacted by Congress in 1925. \nAdditionally, the CFPB’s rulemaking seeks to impose a reporting obligation on businesses related to arbitration. Specifically, businesses will be required to report all new arbitration claims filed by consumers to the CFPB as well as each arbitration award. The CFPB has considered publishing the claims and awards to its website. This runs contrary to the confidentiality associated with arbitration actions that companies typically value. According to the CFPB, such publication will monitor “problematic business practices” and generate more transparency in the arbitration process. \nThis announcement marks the first step in the rulemaking process. The CFPB released its proposal and has invited comments from the public. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© McGuireWoods LLP \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email… * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website \nUsers who opt in to receive emails may choose to no longer receive e-mail updates and newsletters by selecting the \"opt-out of future email\" option in the email they receive from JD S \nIf you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at info@jdsupra.com \nExcept as otherwise described in this privacy statement, JD Supra will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of JD Supra, users of the Service, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms & \nIn the event there is a change in the corporate structure of JD Supra such as, but not \nIf you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, your dealings with this Web site, or if you would like to change any of the information you have provided to us, please contact us at: info@jdsupra.com * With LinkedIn, you don't need to create a separate login to manage your free JD Supra account, and we can make suggestions based on your needs and interests.
