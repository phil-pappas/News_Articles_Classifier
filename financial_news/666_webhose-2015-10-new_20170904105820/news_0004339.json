It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) may well have to, for it would only require a major outage for large areas of the country to lose power. \nIn order to cope, businesses up and down the land are already being lined up and paid to unplug the mains and use their own generators instead, or otherwise reduce their demand. It’s an extraordinary situation for a major advanced economy to have got itself into, which has been decades of incompetence in the making. \nSuccessive governments have dithered, prevaricated and confused, constantly chopping and changing policy for often unfathomable political goals. The result is an investment strike which now threatens real damage to the economy and the Government’s credibility. \nAn auction by National Grid last December of new capacity saw only one company come forward with plans for a new plant, and even that one has been delayed by lack of funding. Almost unbelievably the Government now plans to fine companies that promise capacity for failing to deliver. Bet that has them queuing round the block to sign up. * Blackout risk rises as UK energy crisis deepens You might have expected some improvement now that the Tories are freed from the shackles of tree-hugging, Liberal Democrat dictated, energy policy, but if anything, matters have deteriorated further since the election. \nRenewable subsidies have been widely slashed by the new energy secretary, Amber Rudd which might be counted a blessing in terms of the very high electricity prices they were locking consumers into, but for now has only heightened the sense of uncertainty and further deterred investment. \nMeanwhile the tragi-comedy of Hinkley Point continues unabated. The Government hopes EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) can agree heads of agreement with state backed Chinese investors in time for President Xi Jinping’s visit to Britain this week, but it’s not yet a done deal, and even insiders worry about China’s true intentions. As for the security implications of giving Chinese state controlled enterprises charge over such a large part of the nation’s infrastructure, they don’t even bear thinking about. \nThe original timetable for Hinkley Point C was for it to open in 2017, yet work has still to begin, and meantime costs have nearly doubled. \nMs Rudd promises her first big speech on energy policy this week amid reports of crisis meetings among cabinet members on what to do about Britain’s looming energy shortfall. Don’t hold your breath for answers. \n= Boris and the taxi wars = \nThe London mayor, Boris Johnson, and the new Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, have clashed over stiffer regulations for Uber , the taxi hailing service which has taken the London cab market by storm. \nRightly, Mr Javid is all in favour of the “shared economy”, and hopes to make Britain a pioneer in this new form of economic activity. \nLike most new industries, however, it has grown up under the radar of customary regulation, and indeed might not work at all if subjected to the same standards as incumbents. \nThe point is particularly obvious in the hotels sector, which is subjected to all manner of health, safety, disability, tax and labour market requirements. To the fury of traditional hoteliers, the same is largely untrue of Airbnb, and other room-sharing intermediaries. After much initial praise for the new kids on the block, Boris seems to have sided with the incumbents, and though in view of still relatively recent altercations it is perhaps hard to fathom the London mayor’s newfound fondness for the black cab driver, he actually raises a very good point. \nThe more competition the better subject to obvious concerns about traffic congestion but it is unfair when the new entrants don’t have to obey the same costly rules as the old timers. The trouble is that consumers can’t get enough of Uber. All of a sudden, using a cab is quick, easy and affordable. \nThe solution is fairly obvious, and it is not to put Uber on the same regulatory footing as black cabs. Rather it is the other way around to deregulate the existing cab industry and put it on the same footing as Uber. \nUnfortunately, you are not going to get a lot of love from black cab drivers for an idea like that. First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) there were mini-cab drivers and now Uber. It’s never easy to watch your long-held monopoly go up in smoke. * Sajid Javid attacks 'heavy-handed' Uber crackdown = Lord Hill’s mountain = \nBritain’s European Commissioner for financial services was in London last week to talk to City practitioners about his plans for a “capital markets union”. As a former special adviser to Kenneth Clarke, you’d expect him to be a convinced Europhile, and indeed he is. But that doesn’t make him a Brussels patsy, and he knows if Britain is to remain a member of the EU, and prosper, then he has to deliver. \nTheoretically, it should be a relatively straightforward task. The European banking system the overwhelming source of finance for business in Europe is still struggling, but the capital markets, a rich source of alternative finance in the US, remain fragmented and underdeveloped. \nLord Hill should be pushing at an open door, and he does indeed sense a lot more sympathy than there used to be. We can only wish him luck, because if he pulls it off, it’s a huge opportunity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:03:06.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
