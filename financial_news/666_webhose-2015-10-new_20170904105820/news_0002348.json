In the absence of QE, the selling will resume and we wouldn't be surprised to see another 10-15% shaved off stocks,\" he added.Orbison's comments flew in the face of the strong rally in stocks on \"Jobs Friday\" when, despite the weak data, stocks recovered from 1-1.2% falls to end the day up by as much as 1.3%. \"The reversal was based on hope and, perhaps, a realization that the poor nonfarm payrolls data could mean US interest rates remaining lower for longer and, potentially, lay the ground for another round of monetary stimulus further out into next year. Regency Associates thinks that's a distinct possibility but there's much more Fed theater to come before we get to that point,\" explained Orbison.About Regency AssociatesWhen you make the decision to invest for better returns, you naturally want to make sure that your encounter with the markets is a long and prosperous affair.
