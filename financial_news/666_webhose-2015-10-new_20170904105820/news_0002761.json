Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Philip Baker When trying to figure out what's going on with interest rates, the sharemarket or the Australian dollar, BT Financial Group's chief economist Chris Caton would sometimes say that if you weren't confused by it all, you clearly didn't understand what was going on.\nHe would also add that at times it was OK to be confused.\nWhile there is always something to worry about, investors could be excused for feeling confused this week, and maybe even a little queasy, because it looked like analysts were falling over themselves to make the next big call.\nOne day it was UBS talking about the Australian dollar heading to US80¢, the next day it was Citi warning that it would fall to US60¢.\nIt didn't stop there.\nLike many experts, Maverick Capital, a big-name US hedge fund, was surprised and very disappointed that the Federal Reserve didn't hike rates a month ago. Best to just get it over and done with.\nBut on Thursday former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers, President Barack Obama's first choice to head up the Federal Reserve instead of Janet Yellen, was out there warning that the global economy was in such serious trouble that the Federal Reserve wouldn't be making a move any time soon.\nAll eyes on Federal Reserve There's no doubt all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and what it will do with interest rates, if anything at all, but perhaps what's more important is trying to second-guess what everyone else will do after any decision.\nThat can be confusing, but will help explain the herd-like behaviour that will inevitably play out.\nIf the Federal Reserve keeps rates where they are it probably means deflation is more of a problem than inflation and the economy isn't strong enough to deal with higher rates.\nThat's good news for government bonds and yields, despite being close to historical lows, will probably fall further.\nIt's not so good for stocks, because companies don't have much pricing power and earnings will take a hit.\nInvestors might not be so keen to spark a rally led by an expansion in the price earnings ratio this time around, although the current US reporting season hasn't been quite as bad as expected.\nState of confusion Backing up the state of confusion, analysts at Credit Suisse noted that when meeting fund managers from around the world, never before had they seen \"so many clients who just do not know what is happening and have cashed up\".\nDespite that the broker reckons the S&P ASX 200 index will be 6000 by the end of 2015, while others like Morgan Stanley and Macquarie see it at closer to 5100 in 12 months.\nThere's a growing school of thought that suggests the world has so much debt now, about $57 trillion, that interest rates won't be jacked up any time soon.\nUnlike the four big banks, or any other listed company, governments can't really raise equity from shareholders to cut their leverage and so getting the debt down takes time.\nAs Perpetual's Matthew Sherwood highlights, taxing is taboo and governments like to deliver handouts rather than bad news, but at some stage voters will have to understand governments can't spend and lower tax rates at the same time.\n\"Sacrifices in the budget sense will have to be made and the sooner it starts, the sooner it can end,\" Sherwood said.\nWhile debt has been heading higher, a number of specialised surveys are showing that US households are saving less.\nNo savings account About two-thirds have less than $US1000 ($1381), while one-fifth don't even have a savings account, the personal finance site Gobankingrates.com says.\nA smaller survey, by Bankrate.com, showed that 62 per cent of Americans have no emergency savings, so if something went wrong with their health, car or if a household appliance had to be replaced unexpectedly they'd have nothing.\nAll up, over the past 35 years the amount of consumer debt per person in the US has increased by about 700 per cent.\nPerhaps the last word should go to Caton. When asked his thoughts on what's happening right now in financial markets and if he is confused, he replied: \"Yes or no. Not sure.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:08:34.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
