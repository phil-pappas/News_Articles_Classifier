Jessica Sier The most widely recommended wine selection app, with good reason, is Vivino . This is basically a wine encyclopaedia with a splash of social media. Take a snapshot of the wine label and the app will pull up information on the community's rating of the drop and price. Vivino has more than 10 million users, which allows for a great cross-section of reviews and opinions.\nIf the app cannot match the wine, which only happened on a few occasions while I was strolling through my extensive wine collection (read: bottle shop), it offers to manually find the label. Imagine my surprise when I was alerted minutes later that my local cleanskin shiraz had been found. Turns out it wasn't local in the slightest.\nIn addition, Vivino provides tasting notes and information about the winery, region and country's history of wine making. It also offers did-you-know titbits. Did you know 20 years ago, unscrupulous Barbera producers were found to be adding methanol to the wines, killing over 30 people and blinding many others?\nI also enjoyed the food pairing suggestions. Having evolved from simply having wine in lieu of a meal, knowing a glass of 2013 Emilia Romagna is best served with game (deer or venison), rich fish (like tuna and salmon) and hard cheese made ordering dinner less fraught with judgment.\nPlonk has a wonderful periodic table of wine which visually represents wine by its hue. Jessica Sier Vivino has also embedded an online shopping feature, allowing you to compare the price at the restaurant with what it retails for. If users were to boycott severely marked-up prices around Australia, some restaurants may genuinely go out of business.\nIt's important to note there are millions of wine-related apps and since many are based on general contributed reviews, the quality may be erratic. Like Yelp and Trip Advisor, your best bet is to look for consistency over the one irate guy damning everything from the grape to the vine it grew on.\nPlonk Plonk is for vino-novices, which many people are but insist they aren't. Like Vivino it sorts wines by countries, styles and food pairings. It also has a wonderful periodic table of wine which visually represents wine by its hue.\nThere is also a nifty audio function showing you how to pronounce the names of some wines. This is worth celebrating as for years I've watched my German mother cringe over the Australian accent brutally murdering the word \"gewurztraminer\".\nIt also has tips and tricks on how to best serve various wines and champagnes. Seriously, taking direction from these apps can turn a mixed, unpalatable table into a pleasant, yummy experience.\nSo open your new, tasty wine and let it breathe. And if it doesn't seem to be breathing, follow that age old adage suggesting you quickly give it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.", "external_links": ["https://www.vivino.com/", "http://www.plonk-app.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-09T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:06.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
