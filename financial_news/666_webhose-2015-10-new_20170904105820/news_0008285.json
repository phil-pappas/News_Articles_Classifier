Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nI still remember those famous Sunday lunches of roast lamb, baked potatoes, mint peas and sometimes cauliflower with white sauce â€“ all gathered around the table at dear old Aunty Sam's.\n\"That's a funny name for an aunt,' says Louise. Her real name was Samantha, or Sammy to us. Her husband and my cousins were clever working-class people with saw-milling backgrounds who were keen to do well. And they did.\nWe need to recognize that the Australian economy needs to be completely remade.\nWhat I learnt at those Sunday lunches as an eight-year old-was to not worry about the past, but to work hard to make a great future possible.\nIllustration: Cathy Wilcox.\nSo Aunty Sam came to mind this week when Charlie came in with his preview of the economy in 2016. I was all ears because, as we know, Charlie picked the downturn in 2008 and every other major move in markets everywhere.\nAdvertisement He's a clever, but humble, bloke. So when he summarises the period ahead I start to pay attention.\nHe's come up with another three p's to add to last week's \"partnerships of positive people\". This week, and for the foreseeable future, it's population, productivity and workforce participation.\nI daren't enter too deeply into this area because I'm in constant awe of Ross Gittins, with whom I share a page in the Fairfax papers on a Saturday. He's one of the cleverest economists around.\nBut Charlie makes the point that we are in trouble unless we change. Our population growth is slowing and its growth rate is at its lowest level in a decade and is forecast to slow further. That's bad news.\nNet migration is the major cause, because although births peaked in 2013, we will have fewer people than a vibrant economy needs.\nWorkforce participation has been at a standstill since 2008 and is forecast to decline over the next 15 years as the proportion of the population aged 15-64, our workforce, has peaked.\nProductivity has also been at a standstill since 2004 and personal expenditure, which keeps the economy ticking over, is sluggish and may fall further. Only government consumption kept GDP from declining in the last quarter.\nPrivate capital expenditure has been in recession for two years. Exports, which have been keeping us alive for the past 15 years with our mining boom, are a problem; the volume has grown, but the money earned has fallen due to declining prices.\n\"In other words we're selling more, and getting less,\" says Louise. \"I think I'm starting to get this economics stuff.\"\nAnd although employment growth has picked up, it's still not fast enough to reduce unemployment and after overpaying ourselves for so long, growth in wages is the weakest in at least 17 years.\nThat could make you feel really bad about life, but I remember those Sundays with Aunty Sam and how that great big working-class family decided that we all needed to work harder to improve our lot as well as the lives of all the people we knew.\nAunty Sam's five kids ended up with a brood of 13 children, 29 grandchildren and a better Australia. That's good news and, even better, the decline in the value of the Australian dollar is starting to boost international tourism, and overseas education participation; two of our top four industries.\nAnd then there is the growing need of the Asian middle-class for our high-quality health industries. Add to that our unique ability to provide clean fresh food and you have a new Australia.\nSure we have to worry about building new railway lines and be concerned about our national security but if I was the new Prime Minister in Canberra right now, I'd be more worried about our economy and if we're doing everything we can to fix it fast enough.\nCharlie doesn't think we are. Malcolm Turnbull is a good bloke, and may well be a great Prime Minister, and Louise, who has met him, says he could sell ice to the Eskimos. We need to recognise that the Australian economy needs to be completely remade and that all we need now is for our national leaders to sign on.\nStop picking on each other and just get on with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:15:56.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
