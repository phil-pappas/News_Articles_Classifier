We do not expect the board to decide to cut rates,\" he said. \n\"A rate cut in early next year would require the bank to be forecasting growth in 2016 to be 2.5 per cent or less without a policy response.\" \nMr Evans added that the key drivers behind expectations of a modest lift in growth in 2016 included a rise in consumer spending, increased exports and improvements in investments outside the mining sector. \n\"These positive factors will be partly offset by a slowdown in dwelling investment from 10 per cent to 2.2 per cent as the residential building boom reaches its peak.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Packer wants Crown to lift its game AAP \nJames Packer wants to see greater returns on the billions of dollars going into his Australian casinos and hotels …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:51:21.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
