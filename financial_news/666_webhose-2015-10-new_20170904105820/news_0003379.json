Peter Braig Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Resources companies said unions would have less power to stall major new projects, such as mines, following the passage of the Coalition's first piece of industrial relations law since coming to government two years ago.\nAmendments to the Fair Work Act approved by the Senate on Tuesday afternoon represented a breakthrough in encouraging more investment, the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) said.\nAMMA executive director Scott Barklamb also welcomed the fact the government had reached a compromise with independents and minor parties in the Senate, where many of the government's proposals have been blocked.\nThe changes mean if negotiations between employers and unions about wages and conditions for a new project have been deadlocked for six months, the Fair Work Commission will be able to make a determination.\n\"This is essentially the only change that has been achieved under the Abbott and Turnbull governments,\" Mr Barklamb said.\n\"This is offering a safety valve for where new project negotiations stall.\n\"We can't afford to have workplace relations relations negotiations hold up those investments.\"\nThe Fair Work Amendment Bill 2014 was originally tabled in February 2014.\n Crossbench senators proposed a range of amendments before agreeing to pass the bill.\nAMMA had been pushing for changes relating to individual flexibility agreements and right-of-entry arrangements but these were dropped.\nUnion power curtailed The bill does, however, limit the ability of unions to take strike action before genuine bargaining has begun.\nThe Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association (APPEA) said the changes were long over due.\n\"The improvements passed by the Senate... mean investors will have greater certainty about construction costs before they commit to a project,\" APPEA chief executive Malcolm Roberts said.\n\"This is a crucial if we want to attract investment in major projects. Investors have other options than Australia and we must improve our competitiveness to attract footloose capital.\"\nMr Roberts said industry was disappointed at the rejection of an amendment by Family First senator Bob Day that would have required greenfield agreements to take into account individual project's circumstances, not just prevailing industry standards.\nIndependent senator Ricky Muir said elements of the bill which would have negatively affected low-paid workers and restricted the rights of unions to enter workplaces had successfully been removed.\nOpposition employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor said the bill was heavily amended but some bad elements were retained.\n\"Unfortunately for workers across the country, Labor's amendment to remove the [government's] bogus claim that a 'strike first, talk later loophole' exists was not supported by a majority of senators,\" he said.\n\"The government's proposal could have the consequence of allowing any employer in the country to refuse to bargain, leaving no legal recourse for the many millions of Australian workers who wish to bargain in good faith with their employer.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:56:29.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
