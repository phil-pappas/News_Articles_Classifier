Christopher Pearce He has done this often and is open about the type 2 diabetes he can't defeat, but manages with an iron will.\nFor most of his career he worked in investment banking at Societe Generale and by the time he was 50 he was well settled in New York as its managing director and global head of securitisation.\nAbout that time he was sitting at his desk when the phone went. It was the doctor who, a few days earlier, had overseen his annual company health check.\nHaving always been healthy and having sailed through many of these checks before, he didn't anticipate any issues.\n A bit heavy But he did weigh 97 kilograms, which was substantial for a man of 175 centimetres, although he was no slouch. He had been a bit heavy his entire life, and despite having \"laid it on\" in Wall Street, he was still playing energetic tennis and loved to ski.\nHe had spent much of the past year in a plane between Australia, Europe and the United States, wining and dining for the French bank and exercising less than usual.\nThe doctor was blunt. He told Medcraft he had diabetes and suggested he see his family doctor immediately to confirm the diagnosis.\nKnowing almost nothing about the condition and having no idea if he had even been pre-diabetic, Medcraft was in for unwelcome news.\n\"She told me I had a chronic condition and that it was probably going to kill me,\" he said.\nHis shock deepened when she sent him to an institute for the blind to get advice about damage to his vision and where he also learned diabetes was a significant cause of amputation of limbs in the United States.\n\"The objective was to shock me and it worked. I researched the condition, I went to the gym, took on a trainer and changed my diet completely.\n\"They take this very seriously in America. A dietician taught me what to eat and how to read labels. Then I went to a specialist, who taught me to read my blood sugar every day and manage my health. It was intense.\nBest wake-up call \"It was also pretty depressing, but my doctor said it was possibly the best wake-up call I could have, and if I did what I needed to do I would probably live a lot longer.\"\nMedcraft wished he'd had the call earlier, because once he was over the threshold he was told he could never go back. His pancreas was damaged and no matter how diligent he was he would always be a diabetic, even if he was a very disciplined one.\nHe dropped to 82 kilograms and kept a strict regime, measuring his blood sugar daily, remaining vigilant about his diet and taking 500mg of the drug metformin daily.\nFor the next five years he remained stable, but diabetes type 2 is a progressive disease.\nAbout two and a half years ago, the sugar level in his blood started to creep up again. Already exercising at maximum capacity, the only thing he could do to stop the disease evolving was to lose more weight.\n\"Once you get to the point where your pancreas can't process the sugar efficiently, the only way you can deal with it is to put less pressure on the pancreas and reduce its work load by getting your weight down.\"\nNeeded help He needed help and, after overcoming his scepticism, turned to Shaquan Liu, the Chinese doctor in Bondi Junction who had helped Malcolm Turnbull and other celebrities slim down.\nThe plan was to lose more weight than he needed to, so that maintaining the loss would be a little easier.\n\"I went to him and lost 18kgs. I did his three-month program. The hardest thing is to reduce the weight because it's all about eating. Exercising doesn't lose weight because it makes you hungry.\n\"It was like a reset. The first month you only eat herbs which reset your appetite. It's almost like a clean start.\"\nIt was during this first month that he declined all food at the Hong Kong meeting.\nFollowing the plan, he dropped to 64 kilograms and then stabilised at about 69. This loss made such an impact on his system that he went from a rising dose of metformin to being taken off the drug entirely.\nIt also had an impact on his cholesterol, and after 20 years on a statin, his endocrinologist took him off that too.\nFor the past two years he has been managing his diabetes with exercise, diet and adequate sleep.\nChanged entirely It's nine years since his diagnosis and his perception of eating has changed entirely.\n\"I don't regard it as a celebration to eat. Occasionally, if I am in France I'll have a croissant, but don't eat bread any more. As a diabetic you know that every bit of carbohydrate is sugar.\n\"And attitudes are changing. I was at a dinner the other day and a woman handing rolls around the table asked if we would like some carbohydrate!\"\nMedcraft's vigilance is not primarily about weight. It's about dealing with diabetes, a day at a time, because if his blood sugar is high, he feels fuzzy and less effective.\n\"I'm proactive at looking at everything I eat. I think about what I eat and don't have potatoes or pasta. Often people will give me fruit, but it's full of sugar, so I eat a small piece.\"\nOccasionally, he will lash out at dinner but will inevitably feel bad in the morning. It's like aversion therapy and he does it less often.\nLooked puffy \"I look back at myself at 50 and I think I looked puffy. My wife says I am too thin but I just want to push out my medication for as long as possible and keep my diabetes under control.\n\"By taking my blood daily, it reminds me what I am living with. You have to face it. If I travel and put on a kilogram, I know I have to whack it off.\"\nThe day Medcraft talked to The Australian Financial Review he'd had a small bowl of Bircher muesli for breakfast and was planning on 100 grams of smoked salmon for lunch, on a plate with nothing else.\n\"We all eat too much. I feel great to be so light. I have a lot more energy and am more alert.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:16:33.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
