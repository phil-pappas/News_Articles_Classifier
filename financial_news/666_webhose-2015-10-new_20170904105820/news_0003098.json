About 6.7 million bags of IV fluids were used in Ghana in 2014, and this is expected to grow by approximately 50 percent in the next five years. \nThe launch of the IPO will give Intravenous Infusions the opportunity to consolidate its market leadership position in Ghana and further increase its footprint in the ECOWAS region. \nThe expected injection of capital will allow IIL to complete installation of a new production plant to increase capacity from the current 4.5 million bags to 15 million bags of IV fluids per year (installation is currently 90 percent complete), fully exploit untapped market opportunity in ECOWAS by growing export revenue from 10 percent to 45 percent over the next five years, improve its balance sheet and working capital and further diversify its business to the sale of over-the-counter medication. \nRichard Okrah, Managing Director of Intravenous Infusions Limited said, 'IV fluids are not products most people think about on a daily basis. However, it is critical in the treatment of tropical diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and cholera and emergencies including accidents, burns and food poisoning. IIL is also the only local producer of Magnesium Sulphate, which is used to treat pregnant mothers with hypertension. This product is critical as the government works to implement its Zero Maternal Mortality Policy and Intravenous Infusions is well-positioned to be a key partner.' \nInvestors are invited to be shareholders with as little as GH ¢ 80 (i.e., 1,000 shares), and continue to purchase additional shares in multiples of GH ¢ 40 (i.e., 500 shares). \nDatabank and CAL Brokers are the listing brokers.
