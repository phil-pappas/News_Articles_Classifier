The negotiating countries represent nearly 40% of global gross domestic product from the Americas to Asia. The agreement represents the largest regional trade accord yet.\nThe agreement promises to deliver more prosperity for citizens of the partner nations through increased economic and individual liberties.\nThe main aim of any free-trade agreement is to allow goods and services produced within partner countries to flow more freely across political borders without artificial constraints and hold-ups.\nMany large multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have regularly promulgated advice based on the belief that freer trade generates predictable and positive consequences for economic growth and poverty alleviation. This premise is based on the theory of comparative advantage, that member countries are able to specialise in goods and services that they can produce relatively more efficiently than their trading partners and hence reap the benefits of mutual exchange.\nThe partner nations to the agreement have also realised that, although trade liberalisation is a necessary condition for growth, it is not necessarily sufficient. There are complementary conditions — macroeconomic stability, credibility of policy, enforcement of contracts and the respect of private property rights — without which the benefits of openness may fail to materialise.\nThus, in addition to phasing out thousands of tariffs and other barriers that hamper trade between the partner countries, the partnership agreement also includes provisions that uphold private property rights, including intellectual property rights, as well as including provisions that improve individual liberties in countries such as communist Vietnam by increasing a citizen’s access to the internet, which has traditionally been severely restricted.\nThe South African government would do well to recognise that while the rest of the world is moving towards increased economic freedom and civil liberties, SA’s trajectory is largely sending the country in the opposite direction. The country has plummeted in the ranks of indices such as the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom of the World index. The index demonstrates countries with greater levels of economic freedom tend to grow faster and be more prosperous.\nThe foundations of economic freedom are personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete and security of privately owned property. SA’s decline in both absolute terms, from a rating of 7.09 in 2000 to 6.88 in 2013, and relative terms, from a ranking of 42nd to 96th over the same period, is of great concern as the decline has correctly predicted a worsening of conditions in SA.\nGovernment would do well to take steps to stop the slide down the economic freedom ranking, but has given no indication of taking note of the indicators that show clearly that the economy is becoming less free and is paying a heavy price — a result that is reflected in a drastic decline in economic growth and in persistent high unemployment.\nSA is lacking basic institutions of economic freedom that include its fundamental foundations, personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to compete and security of privately owned property. Without increases in these central freedoms, it is difficult to envisage how SA will grow and become more prosperous.\nThe commitment by each of the partnership nations to uphold basic economic freedoms as well as personal and civil liberties through this historic agreement, shows a willingness to change their economic policies and should be applauded.\nSA’s government, watching the partnership pact unfold, must realise that it has it directly within its power to reform the South African economy and adopt policies that will increase growth and reduce poverty.\n• Urbach is a director of the Free Market Foundation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:54:21.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
