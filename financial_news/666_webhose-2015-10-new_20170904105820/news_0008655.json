Michele Mossop by Joyce Moullakis Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Citigroup's head of general industrials and sponsors, Aidan Allen, formerly a UBS banker, has been promoted to lead Citi's local investment banking division.\nMr Allen joined Citi in May 2013 as a managing director and head of general industrials and financial sponsors .\nHis promotion was revealed by AFR.com on Friday and was later confirmed by a Citi spokesman. Mr Allen – who also retains his current role – will assume more of a leadership position in the re-established role across advisory and capital markets, reporting to Tony Osmond, head of corporate and investment banking.\nShane Taylor, the local head of corporate banking, continues to report to Mr Osmond.\nA replacement for Citi's country head and chief Stephen Roberts, is however, yet to be announced. He moved into the role of chairman for Australia and New Zealand in March. Mr Osmond held the head of investment banking role ahead of stepping into his current position when Chris Knoblanche flagged his retirement from the firm.\nCiti ranks fourth so far this year for merger and acquisition work, advising on deals amounting to $US25.6 billion ($35.1 billion), according to Dealogic. That compares to sitting in fifth spot with deals of $US13.1 billion at the same time in 2014. In equity capital markets, however, Citi has slipped to sixth place as at October 8, from fourth at the same time in 2014.\nCiti was this week part of a four-bank debt syndicate helping fund QIC's acquisition of the Iona Gas Plant.\nMr Allen has worked on deals this year including the sale of Energy Developments to DUET Group, the float of accounting software company MYOB, and is also involved in the upcoming listing of Link Group.\n \"It's an appointment well-made... Aidan is one of Sydney's best young investment bankers,\" said Roger Corbett, Mayne Pharma chairman and the former chair of Fairfax Media, publisher of AFR Weekend .\n\"Aidan has been advising us on deals for over 10 years. He has integrity, is creative and, importantly, has an ability to get deals done,\" Rickard Gardell, co-founder and principal of Pacific EquityPartners, said.\nAt the time Mr Allen was lured away from UBS, following a 10-year stint, Mr Osmond labelled him a possible future leader of Citi.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:05:11.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
