The significant opportunity in cloud computing has attracted many companies to build out cloud infrastructure and establish themselves as leading service providers. E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN has emerged as a key player in the space with its Amazon Web Services (AWS). \nYesterday, AWS launched various new services including AWS Snowball, QuickSight, AWS Database Migration Service and Amazon RDS for MariaDB. \nAWS Snowball is a shippable storage product, which is designed to let companies securely move huge amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud very quickly without requiring high bandwidth to transfer it over the Internet. Each unit can store up to 50 terabytes (TB) of data. \nAnother service the company launched yesterday was QuickSight, which will help organizations in quickly analyzing their data and shipping large amounts of it for storage on AWS. \nApart from this, AWS introduced new database tools and services, AWS Database Migration Service and Amazon RDS for MariaDB. As per the company, these will “make it easier for enterprises to bring their production databases to AWS and break free from the cost and complexity of traditional commercial databases.” \nTo better serve its clients, the company is also working on enhancing its capabilities. AWS recently formed a new business group in collaboration with Accenture plc ACN, aimed at helping its clients to quickly move their business to the cloud. \nAccording to Amazon, the Accenture AWS Business Group “will offer integrated consulting and technology solutions designed to help enterprise clients take greater advantage of the flexibility and economics of an “as-a-service” operating model where IT and business services are delivered on-demand, via the AWS Cloud.” \nCloud Prospects \nThe exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. \nThere is also an ongoing revolution in the way people use devices and communicate with each other, which is leading to the proliferation of mobile devices by consumers. The convenience and accessibility enabled by mobile is also driving employers across many sectors to move toward Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD). However, the nature of work differs across organizations and broader adoption of BYOD can only be possible through the utilization of cloud resources. \nBefore getting into the growth prospects, it might be helpful to understand what exactly cloud computing represents. So here goes- \nCloud computing consists of the entire gamut of computing intelligence required to carry out day-to-day operations by companies and professionals. This basically means that other than the hardware, which could be of any shape or form, all the supporting technology involved in creating, storing, retrieving, transporting, protecting, sorting, processing, analyzing and presenting information from multiple sources and formats, which when available from a shared (private) or public pool, could be referred to as cloud computing. \nCloud service providers therefore help organizations to store data and applications remotely in this pool, which can then be accessed from anywhere and at anytime via the Internet. Therefore, users have access to their files and settings from different devices and at all times. \nGiven its scope and advantages (cost, scaling, convenience, etc), it’s not surprising that the demand for cloud computing software and applications is on the rise. Cloud vendors usually offer the infrastructure or other technology as a service, which further reduces costs for adopters. \nAccording to Centaur Partners, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%. Moreover, Computerworld forecasts that 42% of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing in 2015. \nAnother research firm, IDC projected last year that public IT cloud services spending will grow at a five-year CAGR of 22.8% to over $127 billion in 2018. The growth rate is six times higher than the broader IT market. In 2018, public IT cloud services will make up over 50% of the global software and storage development. \nAs mainstream adoption gathers steam, infrastructure has to be built out rapidly. It would therefore be more advantageous for leading vendors to collaborate or even merge their capabilities to capture a larger share of the pie. \nStocks to Watch Beyond Amazon \nUndoubtedly, Amazon is the investors’ darling as it has a Growth Style Scores of ‘A’ and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but investors can also tap the high-flying cloud computing industry via a few more promising stocks. \nThe cloud computing space has several promising stocks to choose from.
