(Photo: Paul Sancya, AP) \n1 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE DETROIT — The UAW said Thursday its members overwhelmingly ratified a new four-year agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , giving the union its first new contract with the Detroit Three since formal negotiations began in July.\nWorkers at Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ) voted 77% in favor of the agreement, the UAW said in a post on the UAW Chrysler Facebook page. Production workers were 77% in favor; skilled trades 72% and salaried workers 87%.\nRatification of the new contract comes just three weeks after the union's members soundly defeated the first agreement that the UAW recommended to its members. That defeat forced the union to go back to Fiat Chrysler and negotiate bigger raises and bonuses along with several other key changes to the contract and also caused the union to overhaul its communication strategy.\n\"The recent bargaining process that took place on behalf of our members at FCA is a testament to the UAW’s democratic values and commitment to our members,\" UAW President Dennis Williams said in a statement.\nUSA TODAY\nFiat Chrysler workers appear to favor new UAW pact\n\"The resolve of our membership and the dedication of our negotiating team has produced an agreement that affords UAW members a strong wage package and job security while still allowing the company to competitively produce high quality vehicles for our customers,” Williams said.\nUAW Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US Vice President Norwood Jewell said, “UAW members at FCA have obtained a strong agreement that provides substantial wage gains, fairness in the workplace, and job security. Because of the strength and support from our membership, our bargaining team was able to negotiate a contract which promises a secure future for our members, their families and their communities.”\nAs reported Wednesday night by the Detroit Free Press , workers at almost all local UAW units from Belvidere, Ill., to Kokomo, Ind., to Detroit all voted in favor of the proposed contract.\nThe new agreement delivers signing bonuses and raises for both entry level workers and longtime workers and provides entry level workers with an eight-year path to $29 per hour, making them nearly equal to workers hired before 2007 and effectively eliminating the two-tier wage system.\nThe key question now is whether the pattern set by the UAW with Fiat Chrysler will be followed by Ford and General Motors and which automaker the union will turn to next.\nHistorically, the UAW has used the agreement it reaches with the first automaker it selects as a pattern for its contract with the two other automakers.\nWhile the agreement the UAW reached with Fiat Chrysler provides a long-term pathway to the top wage it also effectively eliminates a cap on the number of entry-level workers the automaker can hire and renames them \"in progression employees.\"\nUSA TODAY\nUAW workers more positive about new Fiat Chrysler contract\nFord ( F ) and General Motors ( GM ), in contrast, currently have contracts that include a cap on the maximum number of entry-level workers. Those agreements automatically bump entry-level workers up to full pay when either automaker exceeds the percentage and Ford and GM may be reluctant to eliminate the cap.\nWilliams also has said he expects to extract more generous agreements from both of those automakers because they are financially healthier than Fiat Chrysler. GM reported a profit of $8.3 billion on Wednesday from its North American division and said Thursday it would add 1,200 workers at its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. Ford will report its earnings next week.\nThe new agreement ratified by Fiat Chrysler members provides entry-level workers with a $3,000 signing bonus and elevates their wages from $15.78 to $19.28 per hour to a new range of wages that starts at $17 per hour and tops out at about $29 per hour in eight years or less.\nWhile some workers objected to the length of time of the wage progression, the UAW was able to win over many workers by emphasizing that all workers are guaranteed to see their hourly pay rise at least to $22.50 within the length of the four-year contract. Workers hired before 2007 will now get a $4,000 signing bonus, 3% raises in the first and third years of the contract and 4% raises in the second and fourth years of the contract.\nUSA TODAY\nUAW steps up social media to avoid another failed vote\nThe second agreement also eliminated a controversial proposal to form a health care cooperative that members feared would lead to higher health care costs and a more flexible attendance and vacation policy.\n\"I think this contract was presented much more clearly,\" said Kristin Dziczek, director of the labor and industry group for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. \"It included larger raises for the people who were considered tier two before and are now called 'in progression workers,' and it was much more clear about what changes were being made to health care.\"\nThe UAW also hired BerlinRosen, an influential New York-based public relations firm, and adopted a more aggressive social media communication strategy and improved its communication with members at informational meetings as it explained the second agreement to members.\n\"I think they packaged it in a way that was much more appealing even though it likely doesn’t cost Chrysler more money than the first agreement,\" Dziczek said.\nRelated: \nUSA TODAY\nFiat, UAW reach deal; union claims 'significant gains'\nUSA TODAY\nFiat Chrysler work schedules helped kill UAW deal\nUSA TODAY\nUAW vows to 'to tell whole story' to members\nUSA TODAY\nUAW, Fiat officials miscalculated young worker angst\nUSA TODAY\nUAW votes down Fiat Chrysler contract\n1 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RYBGIw TOP VIDEOS Tech Five: Shares of Twitter, Yahoo slammed 00:36 Turn any car into a smart car 02:12 Americans spend HOW much on Halloween candy?!? 00:58 Smaller bonuses for Wall Street 01:47 This DeLorean is in pristine condition 01:01 Ferrari's $9.8B Valuation: How Investors Are Reacting 02:25 Cuba open to \"all type of businesses\" with US oil companies 00:58 Western digital is dropping $19B to acquire SanDisk 01:00 Uber - no plans to file for IPO soon 00:44 EU: Starbucks, Fiat profited from illegal tax breaks 01:47 Subway agrees to start measuring bread to ensure 12-inch footlongs 01:07 Ferrari is off to the races, to start trading on NYSE today 01:54 'Guitar Hero Live' lets you rock on stage 01:28 Apple lost millions of Music users when trial ended; 6.5M remain 01:05 Facebook will tell you when A government hacks your account 01:20 Yum plans to split its China business 01:03 IBM falls short in revenue estimates, cuts profit forecast 01:42 Selfie pay?
