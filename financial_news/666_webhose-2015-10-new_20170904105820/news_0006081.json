Last week, Infrastructure Ontario, the agency tasked with delivering the Province of Quebec’ \nFor the past three years, Infrastructure Ontario has commissioned an independent, third‑party consultant to review and report on infrastructure projects delivered through the agency’s Alternative Financing and Procurement (AFP) program. AFP is the public-private partnership (P3) model frequently used in Ontario to deliver social infrastructure such as health care and justice facilities, as well as transit and transportation projects. The annual Track Record reports review AFP projects that reached substantial completion in the prior fiscal year and provide an objective analysis of their on-budget and on-time performance. But this year’s report added a new metric. In addition to AFP projects, this year’s report expanded the scope to include seven projects completed in the last two fiscal years under Infrastructure Ontario’s traditional Direct Delivery model. The inclusion of Direct Delivery projects in the report provides a unique opportunity to compare the performance of AFP projects to projects procured under the agency’traditional model. \nThis year’s report, completed by cost consulting firm Hanscomb, found Infrastructure Ontarios on-budget and on-time performance to exceed the generally accepted industry standards for AFP and Direct Delivery projects. In the report, Hanscomb analyzed 45 AFP projects that reached substantial completion before March 31, 2015 and found that 44 of them were delivered on budget. A project is “on budget if its final project cost (awarded contract amount plus utilized post contract contingency) is less than or equal to the awarded contract amount plus the budgeted post contract contingency set at financial close. \nThe 98% on-budget rate is consistent with the previous years reported 97% on-budget rate (36 out of 37 projects) and remains well above industry standard benchmarks. \nFor comparison, 71% of the projects (5 of 7 projects) procured using the Direct Delivery model during the past two years were found to have been delivered on budget. \nThe report also found that 73% of AFP projects (33 of 45 projects) were delivered on time or within one month of substantial completion, with eight of those projects having been delivered early. It was noted that for 12 of the 14 AFP projects that experienced schedule delays (more than five business days over schedule), the private sector retained full or shared responsibility for the delay. \nAs for Direct delivery procurements, 86% (6 of 7 projects) were delivered on time or within one month of substantial completion. \nIn addition to the cost and schedule analyses, the report also provided an interesting look at post contract contingency utilization, which will be discussed in a future blog post. \nA full copy of the 2015 Track Record Report can be found . \nThe second post on the Infrastructure Ontario 2015 Track Record Report can be found \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email\" » * - hide Privacy Policy \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.
