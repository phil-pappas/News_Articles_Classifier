The central bank's head of exchange control, Morris Mpofu, said the price reduction should not only target goods but even services, including interest rates, utility and labour costs and raw materials. It will, however, take a little bit of effort for authorities to convince an entire value chain pregnant with price distortions to appreciate this policy thrust after spending six years with the current price regime, which had not been helped by government, which has also been at the forefront of increasing fees and tariffs. The latest such hike in fees was the 100 percent increase in tollgate fees by government, which had the effect of raising the cost of logistics thereby impacting on the pricing structures for a lot of commodities and services in the country. RBZ governor, John Mangudya, has previously implored local producers to lower prices, saying Zimbabwean products were overpriced. There are fears of economic contraction after the country's power utility ZESA introduced load shedding last month, just after the International Monetary Fund downgraded growth forecasts to 1,5 percent, from 3,2 percent. The global lender warned that a confluence of downside risks had remained endemic on the markets and could slam the brakes on output. However, it is the \"overvalued\" real effective exchange rate (REER) of the greenback, the country's anchor currency since adoption of a hard currency regime in 2009, which has made exports expensive compared to regional competitors that has unsettled authorities at the central bank. \"A recent study by the RBZ established that the real effective exchange rate for Zimbabwe is overvalued to the tune of 45 percent,\" said Mpofu, who presented a paper at the Zimbabwe Economic Review & National Competitiveness conference in Harare. \"This implies that domestic prices have to be reduced by a factor of the same magnitude to restore competitiveness. \"The appreciation of the US dollar against our trading partner currencies has made our exports more expensive while making our imports cheaper. Depreciation of the South African rand has made imports from South Africa much cheaper resulting in loss of competitiveness of locally produced goods and services. South Africa is our major trading partner, accounting for about 70 percent of the country's imports.\" The REER measures the value of a currency against a basket of other currencies. It takes into account changes in relative prices and shows what can actually be bought. In the past year, the United States dollar, which is the dominant of a basket of foreign currencies adopted by the country in 2009, has been tremendously appreciating against most global currencies. Quite markedly, it has appreciated against the South African rand, Zimbabwe's major trading partner, reflecting the progressive loss of export competitiveness. Zimbabwe exported US$1,2 billion worth of goods and services during the half year to June 30, 2015 against US$3 billion in imports. This translated to a trade deficit of US$1,8 billion. Weak growth has been tempting many countries in the world to devalue their exchange rates to prop up their economies. Zimbabwe does not have an exchange rate policy since 2009, when foreign currencies replaced a free falling domestic unit, after hyperinflation hit 500 billion percent at the height of economic turmoil in 2008. \"Under normal circumstances the country would consider devaluing its exchange rate to improve export competitiveness and discourage imports,\" Mpofu told the conference. \"The main challenge is that Zimbabwe does not have an exchange rate policy given that we are in a multiple currency environment,\" he said. Zimbabwe's central bank lost control over the country's monetary system at dollarisation and does not have room to print money to pull the economy out of a deadly deflation that started in October 2014, or set interest and exchange rates. The country is, therefore, now dependent largely on policy decisions made by the United States' Federal Reserve, due to the dominance of the greenback in the multi-currency regime. But Mpofu said there were several options that government was exploring to enhance competitiveness. These are fiscal devaluation, which involve such measures as increasing tax on imports to discourage consumption of foreign goods and services, as well as reducing income taxes. Fiscal devaluation also involves improving efficiencies in public administration, as has been happening in strife-torn Greece. Zimbabwe is also pursuing internal devaluation, which involves reducing the cost of doing business. \"The case of Greece is particularly incisive in the sense that the country, like Zimbabwe, is using the euro and has no option to use the exchange rate mechanisms to address the domestic imbalances,\" said Mpofu.
