During the 2014 World Cup, for example, Twitter suspended multiple Vine accounts belonging to SBNation.\nThe dust-up also comes as the NFL makes an increased digital push, including a deal to bring more game highlights to Twitter. The league also launched a YouTube channel this year.\nTwitter did not respond to a request for comment.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/653723439954554880"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:37:58.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
