Still, things will depend on the industry’s performance in H2,” SBI General’s managing director and chief executive Bhaskar Sarma said.\n“Growth is not happening in segments like fire and engineering. Though growth is there in health, still the growth was slack when it comes to motor. But I do hope that the growth will pick up in motor in H2,” he said.\n“Corporate recovery is yet to take place. If it happens so, then segments like fire and engineering will also start growing. Economic growth has to pick up and awareness towards different kinds of insurance protection has to increase,” he added.\nAll the four public sector general insurers — New India Assurance, National Insurance, United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance — at 11 per cent have shown better growth than their peers in 17 private sector general insurers in the reporting period.\nFour general insurers have mobilised a total premium of Rs 23,600 crore while the private sector general insurers, led by ICICI Lombard, have earned a total premium of Rs 19,200 crore during the first half of the fiscal.\nSpecialised health insurers, at 42 per cent, maintained their huge growth during the reporting period.\nThe five health insurers have gathered a total premium of Rs 1,670 crore during the period.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 4:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:27:14.109+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
