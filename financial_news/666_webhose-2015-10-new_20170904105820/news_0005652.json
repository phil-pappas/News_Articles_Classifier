(Photo: General Motors) \n2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE DETROIT — General Motors said it would introduce a fleet of autonomous Chevrolet Volts in late 2016 on its Warren Technical Center campus for employee use.\nThe company also announced a New York City ride-sharing project and unveiled a concept electric bicycle as it expanded its efforts to provide alternative mobility options .\nIn addition, CEO Mary Barra said, GM's joint fuel-cell work with Honda will produce a fuel-cell vehicle by about 2020.\nBarra and other senior GM executives spoke to analysts and large investors Thursday at the company's Milford Proving Grounds.\nUSA TODAY\nAutonomous car future will demand tech company and automaker collaboration\n\"We're working to redefine customer's choices and the future of mobility,\" Barra said. \"The convergence of rapidly improving technology and changing consumer preferences is creating an inflection point for the transportation industry not seen in decades.\"\nWhile moving in these new directions, GM also intends to cut $5.5 billion in costs from its traditional car and truck business between now and the end of 2018, mostly by reducing purchasing, manufacturing and administrative expenses.\nGM and other established automakers have been introducing a variety of features in recent years aimed at enhancing safety and improving traffic flow in large cities. But the urgency has increased with Google's development of a fully automated car, Apple's intentions to develop its own vehicle in the next four to five years, and growing media attention devoted to Tesla Motors battery-driven luxury cars.\nThe growth of ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft, as well as the expansion of car-sharing networks such as ZipCar, have driven traditional manufacturers to expand their own visions of transportation.\nUSA TODAY\nVisiting the future in Mercedes' F 015 autonomous car\nGM launched a ride-sharing app in partnership with Google last year through which drivers and riders can be matched for rides in Chevrolet Spark EVs, but it was essentially an experiment.\nNow the automaker will offer \"Let's Drive New York,\" a small-scale service initially available to eligible residents of the Ritz Plaza, a 479-unit luxury apartment building at Times Square. The residents can reserve a vehicle and access parking in one of 200 parking decks across Manhattan that are owned by Icon Parking Systems.\nThe fleet is small, with only eight Chevrolet Trax small crossovers and two Chevrolet Equinoxes, but GM expects to expand it.\nResidents who participate will receive electronic credits valid for three hours of use per month. After that, they can pay slightly less than $10 per hour of uses, or pay $75 for a 24-hour reservation.\nGM tested the program this summer, and Ritz Plaza residents made more than 100 trips covering about 20,000 miles in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey.\nUSA TODAY\nBusiness travelers embrace the sharing economy\nIn Europe, GM's Opel brand has deployed a service called CarUnity that enables dealers and fleet operators to provide a variety of vehicles for sharing. Earlier this year, GM placed a fleet of EN-V 2.0 electric concept vehicles in service at Jiao Tong University in Shanghai.\nThe eBike concept Barra announced at GM's global leadership conference was created at its development center in Oshawa, Ontario.\n\"We are on the cusp of a sea change that will result in a new business model,\" said Mark Reuss, executive vice president of global product development and supply chain. \"But it is a change we will anticipate and we expect to lead.\"\nMajor rental companies, as well as automakers, are getting into car-sharing.\nDaimler launched Car2Go. BMW has Drive Now. Earlier this year, Ford introduced “Peer-2-Peer, a car sharing option being tested through November in Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco; Portland, Chicago and Washington, D.C., as well as London.\n“Traditional automakers that don’t keep up with emerging autonomous vehicle technology will be left behind over the next five to 10 years,\" said Karl Brauer, senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.\nThe challenge is to provide new options that don't rely completely on personal ownership without shrinking demand for the vehicles that generate the industry's profits. GM President Dan Ammann showed a slide at Thursday's conference showing that while large trucks, SUVs and luxury cars account for 14% of new vehicles sold globally, they generate 60% of the industry's profits. With a few exceptions, they aren't shared.\nA study released last month by McKinsey consultants projected that global new-car sales will soar from 70 million in 2010 to 125 million by 2025, but the way those cars are used and who will own them is going to change rapidly.\nGM is investing $5.4 billion in 40 U.S. manufacturing sites over the next several years, but about two-thirds of that will go to three assembly plants in Flint, Fort Wayne, Ind., and Arlington, Texas, that build large pickups and large SUVs.\nThe pressure to update those traditional vehicles won't let up. For example, GM said Thursday that 26% of its global sales volume this year has come from vehicles updated or replaced in the last 18 months. The company expects that percentage to reach 39% next year and 40% in 2017.\n2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1KPXSSF TOP VIDEOS New Chevy Volt could spark competition with Tesla model S 03:47 Teva Agrees to Purchase Rimsa in $2.3 Billion Deal 00:40 The Top 3 business news stories to watch for today 02:42 Glencore wipes out Monday's record loss 02:38 Google, Microsoft drop patent disputes, agree to collaborate 01:21 What to watch Thursday: investors eye Micron Technology earnings 01:12 Take a spin behind the wheel of Tesla’s Model X 02:15 How it all went wrong for Glencore 01:10 'Falcon wing doors' a highlight on the new Tesla X 00:38 What to watch Wednesday: how will Paychex do? 01:48 Tesla Model X innovations 01:04 Icahn warns of 'Danger Ahead' 00:18 Axel Springer Buys 88% of Business Insider for $343M 01:22 A boat for Bond?
