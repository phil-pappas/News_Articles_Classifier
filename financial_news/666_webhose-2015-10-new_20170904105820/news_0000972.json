That's the key to this,\" Morningstar analyst David Ellis said.\nAustralia's four major banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - have ROEs of between 12.2 percent and 17.9 percent, among the highest in the developed world.\nWestpac set the price of the fully underwritten rights issue at A$25.50 per share, a 16.1 percent discount to Tuesday's close. The fund raising will add about 100 basis points to Westpac's common equity Tier-1 ratio, taking it to over 14 percent on an internationally comparable basis.\nIt also announced a full-year cash profit of A$7.8 billion, a record profit for a sixth straight year, up 3 percent from a year ago and in line with analysts' expectations. It will post detailed results on Nov 2.\nTrading in Westpac shares will resume next Monday.
