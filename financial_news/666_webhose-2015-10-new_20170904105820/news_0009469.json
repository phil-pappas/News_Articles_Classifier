The children are our future, so anything we can do to make their holiday season that much happier is a blessing to be able to do so.”\nToys for Tots Foundation is the fundraising and support organization for the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program. The foundation was created at the behest of the U.S. Marine Corps and has supported Toys for Tots since 1947. The mission of the program is to collect new, unwrapped toys during October, November and December each year, and distribute those toys as Christmas gifts to needy children in the community.\n“What we do as an office, rather than exchanging gifts, is pull an angel from an angel tree from Kmart (which has a child's name and age on it) and collectively equip a few children with gifts and other needs,” Roberts said, before adding, \"we are on Highway 49, which is a major thoroughfare. We place the Toys for Tots box on display, and each year we receive so many gifts that it overflows. We look forward to participating again this year.”\nAbout EJ Roberts\nEJ Roberts has been a State Farm Agent since 1984, and is licensed by the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance.
