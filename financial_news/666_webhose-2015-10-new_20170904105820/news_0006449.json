Rule 9A allows for deduction of tax relief on taxable income in respect of the cost of production of a feature film certified by the censor board.   A senior official told reporters here on the sidelines of the CII Big Picture Summit on Tuesday that the latest order came after earlier court rulings in favour of filmmakers seeking that expenditure made on an abandoned film be treated as revenue, rather than capital expenditure.   The CBDT order raises the issue of films completed that have, however, not had a commercial release for some reason.   An example is the Anurag Kashyap produced \"Michael\", starring Naseeruddin Shah and Mahie Gill, which had only an initial release at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, but has not officially hit the screens.    Meanwhile, actor-producer Ajay Devgn was felicitated for his valuable contribution to Indian cinema at the Confederation of Indian Industry's Big Picture Summit that concluded on Tuesday.   \"The two-time National Award-winning film actor is today among Bollywood's most bankable box office stars,\" CII said in a statement.
