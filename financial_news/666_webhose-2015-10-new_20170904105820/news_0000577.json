It was also a trigger for leasing tenants to take advantage of the cheaper debt and turn into owner-occupiers.\nHead of research at Ray White Commercial, Vanessa Rader​ said the Lower North Shore strata office market is about 93,000 square metres, with very little new supply added.\nThe North Shore total market vacancy is currently 8.5 per cent, the best performer being Chatswood 6.8 per cent followed by North Sydney at just 8 per cent.\nAdvertisement \"Typically strata property is borne from secondary assets being subdivided, however this has not been an exit strategy applied by owners and the attraction of redevelopment or reuse to residential has been far more attractive,\" Ms Rader said.\n\"Demand for office stock across the broader North Shore has been robust recorded at 11,498 square metres over the last six months with North Sydney the most active followed by Chatswood.\" Investors are still in the market with sales amounting to $75 million during 2014, the highest volume on record and 2015 to July has seen $18 million change hands, but further growth is anticipated through to the end of the year.\nMs Rader said capital values have remained steady over the 2014 and 2015 periods, currently on average representing $4620 a square metre when parking is included.\nIn the Sydney central business district, capital values are enjoying strong growth for the second successive year.\n\"The average capital value has seen good levels of growth over the last 12 months across all precincts of the CBD,\" Ms Rader said.\n\"This highlights the quest for assets during this low interest rate period and the range of investors keen to invest in the Sydney CBD strata market.\"\nMs Rader said the greatest increase in the Sydney CBD strata market has come from the Southern precinct at 37.04 per cent, although given the limited investment pool and the low base of 2014 this result was in line with the volatile nature of this region.\n\"Midtown has the greatest volume of sales yet achieved the lowest rate of growth of 3.20 per cent to $5821 per square metre, nearing closer to the high of the Core, which has had a healthy 6.89 per cent increase since 2014 to $6912 per square metre,\" she said.\nMs Rader said investment activity in the Sydney CBD strata market reached $75.07 million, which represents 11,862 square metres across 96 transactions.\nStrata leasing is also in the ascendancy with The Rialto, a mixed-use building located at 327 Pitt Street near Sydney's Town Hall, according to Ray White Commercial's John Skufris​.\nThe Australian Visa Consultancy recently relocated to an area of 98 square metres at Level 16, 327 Pitt Street on a three-year lease.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:14:15.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
