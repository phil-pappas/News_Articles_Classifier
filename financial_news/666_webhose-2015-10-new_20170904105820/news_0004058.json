Robert Shakespeare Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup ASX-listed enterprise software provider TechnologyOne has acquired asset management and consulting firm Jeff Roorda and Associates (JRA) for about $10 million, making it the third acquisition for the company this year.\nThe acquisition will strengthen TechnologyOne's offering for asset-heavy clients such as segments of government, universities, mining and utilities companies.\nExecutive chairman Adrian Di Marco said the JRA acquisition would allow the business to leverage its strategic asset management product.\n\"It's able to forecast what's going to happen to your assets over time, what the financial impact will be and what you have to do,\" he said.\n\"We've been doing asset management, but we haven't been doing this sort of forecasting. It's quite a complicated algorithm.\"\nBuy or build Mr Di Marco said TechnologyOne was faced with a decision to either build the strategic asset management platform themselves, or acquire a business that already had that capability.\n\"We're going to rebuild the platform but we've picked up all this really great intellectual property,\" he said.\n \"It will take 12-18 months to integrate the business, the software and rebuild the system... but when you look at 18 months, it's not as long as the four to five years it would have taken us.\"\nTechnologyOne expects the deal to be worth $10 million, factoring in earn-outs that JRA is likely to achieve.\nEarlier this year TechnologyOne also acquired Digital Mapping Solutions for $12 million and ICON Strategic Solutions for $10 million, with the deals subject to earn-outs.\nPrior to these acquisitions TechnologyOne had not made any for about five years. Mr Di Marco said there were more in the pipeline.\nGood time to buy \"The market is consolidating and people want to deal with one enterprise vendor. We're hugely profitable and we have the cash,\" he said.\n\"We're letting the market dictate to us [what we acquire]. As we deliver the TechOne cloud we're finding things they want us to include.\"\nMr Di Marco said this was a paradigm shift for the enterprise services industry.\n\"Being a niche player even in the cloud will be very tough in the end. It will come down to which businesses have software-as-a-service offerings that are truly broad and deep,\" he said.\nThe Queensland-based company expects its cloud business to double in the next six months.\nFor the half-year to March 31, TechnologyOne's net profit after tax dipped 10 per cent, falling to $8.86 million.\nBut at the time it maintained a strong full-year earnings outlook of 10 to 15 per cent profit growth thanks to a stronger second half sales pipeline.\nIts investment in research and development has been increasing since 2012 and for the full-year it expects to have spent over $40 million on R&D, more than 10 per cent year-on-year.\nOn Friday its shares closed at $3.85, down 1.03 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:09:03.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
