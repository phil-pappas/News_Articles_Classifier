The prosecutor is seeking three times that amount in damages and penalties.\nSchneiderman said Sprint's decision not to collect and pay taxes was part of a nationwide effort by the Kansas-based company to lure customers from rivals such as AT&T Inc and Verizon Wireless, and saved Sprint customers in New York $4.6 million a month.\nThe case was stayed pending the outcome of Sprint's appeal.\nA Sprint representative could not immediately be reached to comment on the court's decision.\nThe case is the People v. Sprint Nextel Corp, New York State Court of Appeals No. 127.
