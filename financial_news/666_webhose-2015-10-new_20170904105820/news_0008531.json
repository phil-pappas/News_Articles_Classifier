The regulator said it has requested more information by a deadline of Nov. 12.\nThe ACCC on Thursday also postponed a final decision on Royal Dutch Shell's $70 billion takeover of BG Group by a week, its second delay for a ruling on that deal, amid a flurry of M&A activity in the global energy sector that ias increased its workload.
