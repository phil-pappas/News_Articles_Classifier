Patrick Scala Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Every time I go to Bunnings, I walk out with more than I had planned. Admittedly, my purchases will never add up to more than half a thumbtack's worth of commercial significance for my local store. I am hardly a natural fit in the hardware category.\nElectric drill? Careful, careful … oops. Painting the walls? Not after too many splotched disasters. Putting the (Bunnings) outdoor table and chairs together? Call a handyman to come around.\nBut that's the point. Even the most hapless hardware shopper still buys more than anticipated. Which helps explain why I seem to be the proud owner of so many $2 solar lamps stuck in my flower boxes that my (Bunnings) petunias are outnumbered. And which also helps explain why Bunnings' sales are up by 11.6 per cent in the first quarter of this financial year to $2.5 billion.\nIt makes me just one of the millions of small cogs in the Bunnings chain, lining up with all the tradies at the counter. No need to feel intimidated. No customer is seen as too small, or inept, to be unimportant to John Gillam's juggernaut at Bunnings.\nBunnings' sales are up by 11.6 per cent in the first quarter of this financial year to $2.5 billion. Glenn Hunt It also means I have never found the need to enter a Masters store. Apologies to Gordon Cairns. That's unlikely to change, even as Woolworths tries to figure out what to do with the company's troubled and very expensive hardware experiment to compete with Bunnings.\nNot that it is just relying on a solid base in hardware. Wesfarmers might be a conglomerate but its massive Coles business has been consistently beating the once seemingly invincible Woolworths in food, though not liquor, for the past several years.\nKmart has stopped being a financial basket case under Guy Russo. Now Target too is finally finding its brand and business direction again. And Officeworks continues to perform.\nRisks developing complacency Little wonder Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder struggles not to sound over-confident. As he said in announcing the Wesfarmers sales figures, it's easy to get used to such strong numbers continuing. And that always risks developing the sort of complacency about market leadership that got Woolworths into so much trouble.\nIn this era, any business can be abruptly knocked off-course by shifts in consumer tastes, technology, competition or government regulation.\nThe Wesfarmers' retail momentum might show no signs of slowing, but Goyder and his team have to appreciate the constant need to adapt and try to stay ahead of ever-accelerating challenges and changes. That's only likely to get harder.\nNor is any business independent of the economic environment in which it operates.\nWesfarmers' sales figures were strong in July and August but Goyder says he has noticed more consumer confidence recently, coinciding with the change of leadership.\nAs for improved business confidence, he maintains it's too early to call, because this will be reflected in investment and \"time will tell\" on that.\n\"I would be hopeful we will get reform, not just advocacy, implemented,\" he says, citing tax, retirement savings and infrastructure as some of the most obvious areas. \"I'd have a degree of confidence that is very much on the agenda of the government and business will respond fairly positively if that's the case.\"\nConvert talk into action Goyder says he spoke to Malcolm Turnbull at the AFL grand final and the Prime Minister had made clear his intention to convert talk into action.\nNot that Wesfarmers, along with the rest of the big-business community, wants reform action in all areas – most particularly when it comes to the area of competition law.\nAlong with Rod Sims at the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the now very former small business minister Bruce Billson strongly backed a recommendation from the Harper review to change Section 46 of the act.\nThis was to alter wording saying that a \"corporation with a substantial degree of market power shouldn't take advantage of that power … for the purpose of eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor.\"\nInstead, the Harper review suggested changing this to whether the conduct had the purpose or \"would have or be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition\".\nThis idea of such an \"effects test\" is hugely popular with small business, as well as the smaller competitors and suppliers to the two big supermarket chains – and, of course, their backers in the National Party.\nIn contrast, big business was deeply alarmed about what it argued would amount to damaging uncertainty and constraints on daily business decisions, let alone prospects for growth and expansion.\nLarge block in cabinet The Harper recommendation also faced a very large block in cabinet in the shape of Joe Hockey. So this proposal looked set to disappear under the Abbott government, along with most other recommendations from the Harper review.\nThat was until Turnbull's negotiations with the Nationals to back his prime ministership led to his offer to have cabinet reconsider the effects test. Think of it as political cause and effect.That doesn't guarantee anything beyond talk, of course.\nBig-business leaders, including Goyder, are relieved competition issues have reverted to Treasury rather than the Minister for Small Business and that there's also a much greater prospect of more sensible Harper recommendations taking shape.\nBut Goyder insists the current Section 46 works well, arguing no one has made a compelling case for changing it. Take that, Ian Harper and Rod Sims.\nJust the possibility of cabinet looking again at the effects test, however, means a new lobbying campaign is gearing up against the Business Council of Australia. This campaign involves everyone from Master Grocers Australia to the Pharmacy Guild to the National Farmers Federation to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nFighting off that renewed threat might prove harder than Bunnings fighting off Masters.
