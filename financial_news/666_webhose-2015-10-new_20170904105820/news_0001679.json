With the Clearent virtual terminal, merchants have the flexibility they need to securely process credit card payments in an office setting on a computer or when they’re on the go from their smartphone or tablet. Clearent’s virtual terminal is a simple and cost-effective payment solution for many businesses, including healthcare providers, nonprofits, and membership organizations. It is also a great solution for merchants who provide business and professional services, property management firms, and educational institutions. Merchants can add a card reader so they can securely process swiped transactions to lower their processing costs. These card readers deliver another layer of protection because they use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) so sensitive card data is encrypted right at the device and stays encrypted until it reaches Clearent’s secure, PCI-compliant processing platform.\nUnlike most virtual terminals on the market that have a dated design and were built for use exclusively on computer displays, the Clearent virtual terminal has a simple, responsive design. This means that the screen layout automatically changes and optimizes based on the size of the screen being used. Merchants have the flexibility of using the device that works best for their business, ranging from a mobile phone all the way up to a desktop computer monitor.\nBecause the Clearent virtual terminal is fully integrated with the merchant’s payment processing services, merchants receive one log in and statement for both their virtual terminal and their merchant account, which helps simplify their business operations. The Clearent virtual terminal also helps merchants streamline their operating costs by eliminating the need for a separate third-party gateway.\nPerfect for businesses of any size, the Clearent virtual terminal is a scalable solution that offers numerous features. For example, merchants can easily manage multiple accounts and user permissions, batch out when it’s most convenient for their business, capture digital signatures on touch screen devices and print and email receipts. It’s easy to access, learn, and use and helps merchants process the most common types of transactions. Plus it’s compatible with all major web browsers and includes a robust search feature, making it easy for merchants to research transactions and answer questions from their customers.\n“We’re excited about the response we’ve received to our new virtual terminal,” said Dan Geraty, CEO of Clearent. “It’s a great solution that gives merchants the flexibility they need to process payments anytime, anywhere. Plus it helps merchants tap into the other unique benefits that Clearent is known for, such as our next day funding service, best-in-class online reporting tools, transparent pricing with no hidden fees and one of the clearest, most detailed statements in the industry.”\nAbout Clearent\nClearent is a complete payment processor that leverages its proprietary payments platform to make doing business easier and more profitable for its sales partners.
