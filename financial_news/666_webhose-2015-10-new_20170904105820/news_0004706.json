The company's McArthur River and George Fisher mines will remain open but will scale back output, with Glencore's global zinc operations reducing mine out put by 500,000 tonnes.\nAdvertisement \"This decision will ensure that our zinc operations are sustainable well into the future,\" said Glencore in a statement.\nMMG's Century zinc operation is in the same broader region of Queensland as Glencore's Lady Loretta, and Century was believed to provide close to 4 per cent of world zinc supply.\n\"Completion of mining at century is a considerable factor in the shrinking of global supply of zinc,\" said MMG's chief operations manager Marcelo Bastos last week.\nGlencore's Australian zinc mines collectively produced 394,000 tonnes of zinc in concentrates during the first half of 2015. The division had adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $US209 million in the six months to June 30.\nMMG is already preparing to replace Century, and submitted plans for expansion of its Dugald River zinc and lead mine to federal regulators earlier this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:49:07.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
