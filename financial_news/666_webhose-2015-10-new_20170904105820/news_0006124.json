We will, however, closely examine any future increases in these shareholdings, including where this is made possible through changes to the existing media diversity and control rules,\" Mr Sims said.\nWhile approving the deal, the ACCC said that because the transaction does not result in Ten being a subsidiary of Foxtel, any arrangements between the two will still be subject to the Competition Act.\nMr Sims said that the remaining free-to-air broadcasters, pay TV platforms and online services would have \"sufficient alternatives\" to allow them to get content to attract viewers.\nStreaming services will also likely play an important part in the sale of sports rights in the future, Mr Sims said.\n\"The ACCC took into account the anti-siphoning regime and considered that it reduced competition concerns with this transaction. With a near monopoly pay TV provider in Foxtel, the anti-siphoning regime could well currently have a positive effect on competition in the market for television viewing,\" Mr Sims said.\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority also confirmed that it would not stand in the way on the deal, stating \"at this time\" it will not breach media diversity and control rules, as foreshadowed by Fairfax Media.\n\"The principal issue considered by the ACMA was whether the arrangements would put Mr Lachlan Murdoch in a position to exercise control of commercial television broadcasting licences held by Ten,\" ACMA Chairman Chris Chapman said.\n\"If so, an \"unacceptable 3-way control situation\" would result in the four licence areas where Mr Murdoch is already in a position to control the Nova commercial radio broadcasting licences and the News Corporation associated newspapers.\n\"However, the ACMA considered that, while Mr Murdoch was in a position to exert influence on Ten, that level of influence fell short of \"control\" as prescribed by the BSA.\"\nFoxtel chief executive Richard Freudenstein welcomed the ruling that will see Foxtel purchase its up to 15 per cent stake for $77 million.\n\"These transactions will provide much needed capital for Ten and help it to grow revenues by building scale and enhancing services to clients by working with MCN,\" Mr Freudenstein said.\n \"A stronger Ten will further enhance competition in an increasingly competitive local and international media industry.\"\nTen will raise an additional $77 million through a entitlement offer to shareholders. It will use the money to reduce debt and invest to content to continue its ratings improvement.\n\"By entering into the transaction with Foxtel and completing our proposed entitlement offer to all TEN shareholders, TEN will receive the capital it needs to continue its turnaround. Through the arrangements with MCN, our advertising clients will receive the benefit of new efficiencies, improved data capability and broader integration opportunities,\" Ten non-executive chairman David Gordon said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:21.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
