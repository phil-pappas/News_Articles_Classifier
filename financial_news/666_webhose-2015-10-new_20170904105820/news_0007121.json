The flash crash saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly plunge more than 1,000 points, temporarily wiping out nearly $1 trillion in market value. \nSarao's team is looking to block extradition on the grounds that the US charges would not be offences under English law and, if they are, that he should be tried in Britain. \nAt a hearing on Thursday to consider whether a US trading expert could give evidence when the case is decided next year, Sarao's lawyer, James Lewis, said his testimony was needed to debunk the US extradition request because it demonstrated there was nothing unusual in traders cancelling orders. \n\"Americans had to create the crime of spoofing,\" Mr Lewis told the Westminster Magistrates' court, citing a report by Professor Lawrence Harris from the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. \n\"The (US extradition) request is false and misleading,\" he added. \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's simply not the reality of what happens in any market. It's arrant nonsense.\" \nMark Summers, representing the US authorities, said they were not suggesting cancelling trades was in itself wrong, but that Sarao had never planned to execute the orders he had posted. \n\"His intention was to manipulate the market process by creating a false impression of liquidity. It was bogus from the outset,\" Mr Summers said, adding the United States disputed the report by Professor Harris, a former chief economist at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \nMr Harris had also given a differing views on the issue on other occasions, Mr Summers told the court. \nDistrict Judge Quentin Purdy indicated he would allow some of Mr Harris's report to be considered at the full extradition hearing next February, but agreed to a further hearing on Dececmber 18 to allow a detailed US response to be taken into account.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:18:34.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
