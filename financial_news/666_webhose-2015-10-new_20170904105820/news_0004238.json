Aishwarya Rai has returned to Bollywood with ‘Jazbaa’ (inspired by the Korean film ‘Seven Days’) after a 5-year sabbatical since ‘Guzaarish’ in 2010. Will Aishwarya Rai’s ‘Jazbaa’ manage to spread magic with her presence? As far as rivalry is concerned, there are no big-ticket rivals releasing alongside it today, but there is the week-old Akshay Kumar starrer ‘Singh Is Bliing’, whose box office collections are heading for the Rs 100 crore mark, looming in the background. Here is all you wanted to know, in 5 points, about the basic facts regarding the film that will make it or break it at the B.O.\n1. ‘Jazbaa’ starts off with the introduction of the super fit and health conscious Anuradha Verma (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), who is Mumbai’s topnotch criminal lawyer having burnished her reputation with an unblemished track record.\n2. In ‘Jazbaa’ Aishwarya Rai Bachchan also happens to be a single mother to her daughter Sanaya (Sara Arjun). And the reason for her to be a single mother is because she got separated from her husband and her in-laws because they wanted a son instead of a daughter. Needless to say, Anuradha Verma happens to be extremely close to daughter Sanaya.\n3. During Sanaya’s annual sports day meet, she gets kidnapped in broad daylight. Rather than asking for ransom money, the kidnappers lay a condition that they will release Sanaya only if Anuradha fights the case of the dreaded criminal Nayaaz (Chandan Roy Sanyal) and free him from jail.\n4. Left with no choice, Anuradha starts collecting evidence from all sources possible in order to free Nayaaz, the very man who has raped and murdered Sia (Priya Banerjee), the daughter of a respected college professor Garima Chaudhary (Shabana Azmi).\n5. Amidst all this drama, ‘street-smart’, but suspended, cop Yohaan (Irrfan Khan) makes his entry – he has been suspended on the basis of corruption charges against him. When all his repeated requests to his ‘good friend’ (secret lover) Anuradha Verma to fight his case yields no results, he suspects something is amiss. Is Yohaan successful in freeing Sanaya; who are the kidnappers; what ultimately happens to the ‘unspoken love’ between Anuradha and Yohaan… forms the rest of the story.\nWill Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s ‘Jazbaa’ box office collections score a Rs 100 crore hit? take the poll:\nTake Our Poll Keep watching this space.\n 09, 2015 7:50 pm", "external_links": ["http://polldaddy.com/poll/9120751"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:20:44.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
