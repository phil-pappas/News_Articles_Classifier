Should you invest first, draining your cash flow and capital, in anticipation of new business coming through the door? In almost every case the answer is no.\nThe other alternative is to work hard on the sales initiative and then work out how you will fulfil those ­orders. Again, an emerging business has to be careful: if you disappoint your customers by not delivering the right quality, on time, you risk losing sales in the future.\nNo matter which option you choose, both carry a great deal of risk that could be terminal for a new ­enterprise.\nIn truth, most businesses with little capital will lean more towards the second tactic rather than the first, mainly because they’ll have limited funds to begin with.\nThe next problem comes as the company gears up for the business it’s won. Decisions about fixed capital costs must be taken very carefully. The problem for a new business is that if you buy or lease new plant or equipment you must be confident that the work will continue for the foreseeable future. The worst case scenario is that you commit capital for equipment or staff, only to find the work dries up.\nIn some ways this is where the ­desperation of the small and medium sized business owner comes in. They are constantly playing a game of catch-up with their own operating costs. If ever the sales slip behind then their capital reserves will start to dwindle or debts will start to rise. Big business plays the same game but the survival of small business depends upon it.\nBut there’s one other aspect of this desperation for business that can cause long-term financial problems. In many competitive industries, ­especially where tendering is a typical way to win business, there is a tendency to reduce Quote: s to simply win business to keep the cash flow coming through the door.\nFor an emerging small business the obvious problem is not knowing exactly how much a new job will cost when tendering for it.\nThe key to business success is knowing when to knock back work, because it is unprofitable or ­detrimental to the company’s ­ongoing ­survival.\nBut most companies do not have the luxury (or capital reserves) to ­easily refuse business and so they must resort to their own skills of ­managing costs to scrape out a profit.\nThis is why so many emerging companies tend to use more casual ­labour, serviced office space and equipment hire than mature businesses. The success of labour hire companies such as Skilled; equipment hire companies including Coates and serviced office companies like ­Servcorp are testament to the precarious nature of emerging businesses.\nThe mere fact that such companies exist also provides some answers to the ongoing problems of managing cash flow and capital in a new ­company.\nA LITTLE PASSION CAN GO A LONG WAY\nMark Gadd is the general manager of Autonomous Energy at Frenchs Forest / Picture: Annika Enderborg Source: News Limited\nMARK Gadd started his business 12 years ago in the spare bedroom of a rented flat. He had an idea and passion, but little else.\nToday his business — Autonomous Energy — has 50 people and specialises in a range of energy-saving projects. He won awards from the Clean Energy Council in 2013 and was a finalist in 2014 and 2015.\nBut that’s not how it started. Mark concedes that when it started he had a shortage of financial resources ... and resources in general.\n“In the beginning it was like we were walking on a cash-flow tightrope,” he says.\n“We are a project-based business with no ongoing revenue source. This means that every ­\nday we have to win and deliver new projects, just to keep the wheels turning. There were times when if we didn’t get a sale next month, we didn’t have a business,” he says.\n“In a business like ours to hire more people you need to win more projects and to win more projects you need more people.\n“We solved this riddle by always trying to do both concurrently and investing in people. You have to be determined and persevere.”\nThat passion goes all the way back to Mark Gadd’s school days, where he was fascinated by the concept of converting sunlight\ninto electricity.\nHe started Autonomous Energy while studying for his Masters degree, having had experience working for another solar\npower company.\nYet strangely, for a company that relies on hand-to-mouth continual business, it has\nevolved to a point of having no sales people.\nInstead — going back to his days of study — Gadd hired engineers and electricians: the people\nwho do the installations and\nwho solve the puzzles that generate the work.\nHis theory has been that his best form of marketing is the work his people are doing in the field.
