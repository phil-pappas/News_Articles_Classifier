PKN said it it will annouce a tender offer for FX Energy by Oct. 23.\nKicking Horse, an oil and gas explorer, produces around 4,000 boe a day from its Alberta-based unit. Its market value on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange stands at C$199 million.\nBesides U.S. producing assets in Montana and Nevada, FX Energy has concessions around Poland, partly co-owned with Poland's state-controlled gas group PGNiG. Its curret market value equals $59 million.\nPKN, which runs a refining and gas-station business in Poland, Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Germany, has not yet produced oil at home. It has been trying to build a foothold in shale gas but its efforts have so far come to naught.\nThe group plans to delist both takeover targets and finalise the deals in the first quarter of 2016. According to PKN, they do not alter its dividend policy.
