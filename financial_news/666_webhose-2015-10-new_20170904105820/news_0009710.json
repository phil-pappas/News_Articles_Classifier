Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Truly conservative investors, who want to reduce risk to near zero, are in the minority. But for those at the bottom end of the risk curve, the options to keep that capital safe in a diversified way have multiplied in recent years.\nIn some cases you can even get semi-decent returns with an assortment of defensive asset classes, while still being able to sleep at night.\nTake for instance the iShares Conservative Model portfolio. If risk-averse investors had followed the formula since its inception, they'd be looking at a return of 6.57 per cent before costs. Not a bad pay off for playing it safe.\nHere's what the breakdown of investments would look like: almost half in cash (45 per cent), more than a third (38 per cent) in iShares' composite bond exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the remaining 17 per cent in three iShares' equities ETFs.\nThe composite bond ETF holds a certain number of securities, just as the share ETFs do, but in this case they are bonds not stocks, with a tilt to Australian government options, says Jon Howie, head of iShares Australia.\nThe three equities ETFs – iShares MSCI Australia 200 ETF (ASX code IOZ), iShares Core S&P500 ETF (IVV) and iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (IVE) – offer exposure to the S&P/ASX200 index, the S&P500 benchmark in the United States and the developed world as represented by the MSCI EAFE index (for Europe, Australasia and the Far East).\nBut the safety comes from the cash and bond elements. More than four fifths of the bond ETF's holdings are government bonds, which Howie says have tracked well over the past few years and could account for the portfolio's perhaps surprisingly high returns given the safe haven asset mix.\n\"Obviously we won't assume that will continue in the future, but that's largely the reason it looks reasonably good,\" he says.\n \"Returns are still considerably lower than the portfolios that have taken on more risk.\"\nHowie won't speculate on potential scenarios for the portfolio when global conditions change, but he says there are no promises about returns, primarily because the portfolio is designed to protect savings rather than grow them.\nPart of that means putting a lot of eggs in cash, which means retirees planning decades out of the workforce may need to forget it.\n\"[Investors] may actually be able to do better through some term deposits, but part of the reason the cash component is so high is they may need that money to live on, so locking it away for one or three years somewhat defeats the purpose of investing it in a conservative portfolio,\" Howie says.\nThe RBA cash rate hasn't been kind to savers for the past couple of years, which further positions the portfolio as a short-term solution.\n\"These types of conservative portfolios suit investors who have quite short time horizons, they're looking out two, three, maybe even five years and making sure they maintain the balance of their portfolio instead of seeking growth in their investment portfolio,\" Howie says.\nInvestors are frequently told past performance is no guarantee of future performance and with bond yields now looking sketchy, it's not worth banking on moderate to high returns with the conservative route.\nThat said, the real selling point for this portfolio is the fact that you can get access to thousands of securities via just four trades on the ASX and build a bit of diversification into your safe haven.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-10-05T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:07:19.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
