Photo: Joe Armao\nThe $7 million pocketed by the mastermind behind Australia's biggest insider trader scam who later bought an apartment from The Block television show was \"less than a drop\" in the market's ocean of liquidity, a court has heard.\nBarrister Christopher Boyce, SC, told the Court of Appeal on Thursday that Lukas Kamay, 27, a former NAB banker, was appealing his jail sentence because it was manifestly excessive, especially given the size of the highly volatile foreign exchange derivatives market he was dealing in at the time.\nThe barrister said a guide for dummies to the forex market revealed daily trades were worth up to $US4 trillion a day, so the $7 million Kamay had taken was not very much money at all.\nAsked by Chief Justice Marilyn Warren if he was claiming this was a victimless crime, Mr Boyce said there was no doubt Kamay's insidious offending had affected the market's integrity but it was a question of degree.\nAdvertisement Mr Boyce said Kamay had done everything he could to put things right after he was caught, having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and co-operated with authorities. He was remorseful and had lost everything.\nKamay was jailed in March for seven years and three months with a non-parole period of four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to insider trading, money laundering and identity theft charges between August 2013 and May 2014.\nThe sentencing judge, Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth, said Kamay's offending had been carefully planned and premeditated and he deserved to be jailed.\n\"Apart from your early plea of guilty, Mr Kamay, and some very minor allowance for your age and immaturity, there is relatively little that can be said by way of mitigation,\" the judge said.\n\"Unlike in some other cases involving insider trading, neither of you was driven by a gambling or other addiction, or some sort of financial pressure.\n\"Although the corporate culture that existed in NAB's foreign currency division when you, Mr Kamay, were working there may have been unduly focussed on making as much money as possible, that does not justify your behaviour.\"\nKamay's co-accused, former Australian Bureau of Statistics employee Christopher Hill, who had met Kamay at Monash University in 2007 where they both studied for commerce and economics degrees, was jailed for three years and three months with a non-parole period of two years after pleading guilty to insider trading, identity theft and abuse of public office charges.\nThey had decided to set up the scheme during a meeting at a Fitzroy North pub in 2013 with the aim of making a $200,000 profit in a year to split between them.\nHill agreed to use his position at the ABS headquarters in Canberra to send Kamay employment, trade and retail figures moments before they were released to the market.\nKamay, based at the NAB in Melbourne, used the data to make trades on currency markets based on which direction the Australian dollar was expected to go.\nKamay ended up making more than $7.2 million while Hill pocketed a total of $19,500 in cash.\nKamay later successfully bid $2,375,000 at auction for the three-bedroom Albert Park loft on The Block. Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions Robert Bromwich, SC, said Kamay did not conceal his identity when buying the apartment because the purchase gave his crimes \"a cloak of respectability\". Kamay's $237,500 deposit was later seized and the apartment re-sold.\nThe appeal hearing before Chief Justice Warren and Justices Robert Redlich and Stephen Kaye continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:36:11.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
