The Speedy Trial Act was waived because Judge T.S. Ellis III found the case \"unusual and complex,\" the statement said.\nSimmons had appeared on Fox News, the top-ranked U.S. cable television news network, as an unpaid guest analyst on terrorism since 2002.\nA grand jury indicted him last week for portraying himself as an \"Outside Paramilitary Special Operations Officer\" for the CIA from 1973 to 2000.\nThe indictment said Simmons allegedly tried to use that claim to get government security clearances and work as a defense contractor. At one point he was deployed overseas as an intelligence adviser to senior military officers.\nHe faces charges of major fraud against the United States, wire fraud and making false statements to the government. A federal judge has ordered Simmons held in jail, citing arrests for driving under the influence and assault and firearms convictions.\nThe prosecutors' statement said Simmons' lawyer, public defender Whitney Minter, was seeking a top secret clearance.
