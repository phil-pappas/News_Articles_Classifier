AMP will begin running in Google Search early in 2016, he said.\nGoogle gets about 90 percent of its revenue from ads.\nGermany's biggest newspaper publisher Axel Springer last week banned readers who use ad blockers from its Bild tabloid website, stepping up a fight by publishers to stop online advertising revenues being eroded.\nSome 200 million people used ad blockers last year, up 40 percent from a year earlier, resulting in $22 billion in lost advertising revenue, according to a recent study by Adobe and PageFair, an anti ad-blocking technology company.
