Photo: Andrew Quilty\nA takeover bid for Santos was the highlight of the Australian sharemarket on Thursday, with takeover talk reviving interest in the energy sector and pushing the benchmark ASX 200 index into the black.\nLed by a 3 per cent gain in the energy sector, the ASX 200 finished 0.3 per cent higher at 5263.8 while the All Ordinaries closed 0.2 per cent higher at 5299.6.\nEarlier in the day, the market was down 30 points following a poor session on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 index finishing at a one-week low following a sell-off in Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\nBut shares rallied after Santos rejected a $6.88 per share takeover proposal from private equity firm Scepter Partners as \"opportunistic\" and failing to reflect fair value for the company's assets.\nAdvertisement \"The excitement of the day is the Santos bid, it's all about that,\" said Morgans senior dealer Luke McElwaine.\n\"From what I can gather it's a formal bid and shows a bit of value in that sector. I'd be surprised if suitors weren't interested at these levels. These stocks have fallen a long way and it shows there's bit of interest.\n\"Maybe the Australian dollar strengthening a little bit has forced someone's hand. Maybe people are thinking, it's stabilised - time to look at a few distressed assets.\"\nThe market was also buoyed by news in the afternoon that Chinese shares didn't continue Wednesday's late slump, although they were back in the red after the Australian market closed.\nWednesday's \"sudden weakness (led by small-cap stocks) has renewed investors' fears,\" said Citi's Asia-Pacific lead economist, Johanna Chua. Still, \"the most recent equity market recovery relied far less on margin financing than previous rallies.\n\"In fact, outstanding margins as a share of market cap have now fallen back to last year's levels.\"\nSantos rocketed 16.2 per cent to $6.32 following the takeover proposal. Among other energy stocks, Oil Search gained 1.6 per cent to $7.44, Woodside put on 0.8 per cent to $30.95, and Origin leapt 5.7 per cent to $5.92.\nDrillsearch Energy shares jumped 2.3 per cent to 65 cents after the oil and gas producer said production has increased 3 per cent but revenue slumped 12 per cent due to lower oil prices.\nBut despite the excitement surrounding the Santos bid, overnight the prices of oil, gold, copper and iron ore all fell amid concerns about inventory build-up and soft demand growth, weighing on local minings stocks.\nAmong the big miners, BHP fell 0.5 per cent to $24.10 while Rio Tinto dipped 0.2 per cent to $52.66.\nSouth32 is set to make good on its promise to take significant costs out of the business, revealing it would shave 25 per cent off its group costs during the 2016 financial year, part of a plan to reduce costs by $US350 million by the end of financial year 2018.\nAmong the banks,ANZ closed 0.1 per cent higher at $28.60, Commonwealth Bank lifted 0.8 per cent to $76.39, National Australia Bank gained 0.3 per cent to $31.83 and Westpac firmed 0.9 per cent to $31.03. Fellow blue-chip stock Telstra gained 0.4 per cent to close at $5.49.\nWesfarmers-owned supermarket chain Coles has increased its share of the $90 billion grocery market, lifting same-store food and liquor sales by 3.6 per cent in the September quarter despite Woolworths' attempt to \"neutralise\" its rival by cutting grocery prices.\nTotal sales rose 4.7 per cent to $7.6 billion in the three months ended September 30, exceeding market growth around 2.8 per cent, as Australia's second-largest supermarket chain reinvested supply chain savings into reducing grocery prices, improving its fresh food offer and lifting customer service.\nWesfarmers finished 0.5 per cent higher at $40.92 while competitor Woolworths sank 0.6 per cent to $26.79.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:18:28.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
