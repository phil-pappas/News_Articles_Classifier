The Court refused to order an ex-parte stay on ASCI’s decision upholding the complaint and has posted the matter for hearing on 24 February 2016 after sending notice to the Council. Havells challenged ASCI decision to uphold a complaint against its tagline claim “Wires that do not catch fire” based on the opinion of a technical expert, followed by a review by its complaints council. Havells rushed to the Delhi High Court and tried to get an ex-parte order against the decision. The judgement is interesting, because large advertisers as well as tele-marketing companies have been increasing challenging ASCI’s decisions, even as the government (Ministry of Consumer Affairs as well as the Cable Television Networks [Regulation] Act,) have been working at giving more teeth to the advertising watchdog. The issue in this case was simple — were the wires merely fire resistant as per the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) requirements, or could Havells go so far as to claim that the wires do not catch fire. ASCI referred the matter to its experts and upheld the complaint against the claim. Havells challenged ASCI’s \"legal jurisdiction to pass orders” and claimed that it ought to have been given a “personal hearing” in accordance with the principles of natural justice. The High Court order (IA No22368/2015, under Section 149 CPC) quotes from ASCI’s decision on “wires that do not catch fire” as being \"misleading by exaggeration\". ASCI’s order had said, \"The advertised product is made of fire retardant material but the wires will burn when put in flames and continue to burn as long as a flame is maintained by other combustible materials. There being a clear difference between ‘do not burn’ and ‘are fire retardant’ or ‘do not aid in continuation of fire’, the headline claim is misleading regarding the nature of the produce i.e. it being fireproof. The TVC contravened Chapter 1.4 of the ASCI Code. The complaint was UPHELD”. While the details of ASCI orders are normally confidential, in this case, the Delhi High Court in its order has recorded ASCI’s proceedings in some detail. The order then says, “In my opinion, the tagline ‘Wires that do not catch fire’ is as the present more so at the ex parte stage in causing/ permitting of misleading advertisements, which are in absolute terms though they should not be. Once rights of the consumers and third party purchasers, and whose rights are being protected by the defendant, are in issue, by an ex-parte injunction, if this Court allows the plaintiff (Havells) to carry on the advertisement with the tagline/ slogan in question, then, a grave injury may occur to the consumers who may be lead into purchasing the wires of the plaintiff (Havells) in terms of the tagline/slogan ‘Wires that do not catch fire’.” “So far as the impugned order not being in accordance with the principles of natural justice, as plaintiff (Havells) has not been given a personal hearing is concerned, nothing has been pointed out to me on behalf of the plaintiff (Havells) that rules requires personal hearing in all situations. The impugned order shows that the written response of the plaintiff (Havells) was considered, the impugned advertisement was considered and thereafter the impugned order has been passed by the defendant (ASCI) that the plaintiff (Havells) should not have the tagline/slogan ‘Wires that do not catch fire’,” the order says. The judge further observes, \"The contention of the counsel for the plaintiff (Havells) that since the plaintiff (Havells) is carrying on its advertisement since the year 2007 and hence the plaintiff (Havells) should be allowed to continue with the advertisement with the tagline/slogan, the same is a wholly misconceived argument inasmuch as no one has a continuous right to show/ issue bring advertisements, which when read in absolute terms amount to misleading of the general public and consumers”. What is interesting about the case is Havell’s aggressive attempts to get a stay from the Court. In the order dated 19 October 2015, Justice Mehta has made it a point to record in detail that on the first call and the Court had \"observed that prima facie the facts of the present case do not call for grant of ex-parte orders”. The company’s lawyers requested time to consult its client on whether they should demand a speaking order from the Court, but came back and tried to ask Justice Mehta to recuse himself and transfer the case. The Court has recorded in detail the reasons for turning down the recusal. “In my opinion, this is a highly unfortunate stand of the plaintiff (Havells) and the same is against the categorical observations of the Constitution Bench in the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Supreme Court Advocates- on-Record-Association and Another Vs. Union of India, Writ Petition (Civil) No. 13 of 2015, decided on 16.10.2015. The Supreme Court in this judgment has, in fact, observed that Courts should not unnecessarily recuse from matters. I note that I would have to recuse from the present suit if I had appeared for the plaintiff (Havells) in a suit, but the fact of the matter is that I have in fact, appeared not for the plaintiff (Havells) but against the plaintiff (Havells), and that too in a totally unconnected case and which was with respect to rights in the trademark whereas the present suit is a suit for infringement of alleged designs of the plaintiff (Havells). There is hence no need for this Court to recuse from the matter …”. Justice Mehta goes on to say, \"The conduct of the plaintiff (Havells) in asking this Court to recuse itself is deprecated in the strongest possible terms because the aspect as to whether this Court should recuse or not was not mentioned when the case was first taken up”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:25:26.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
