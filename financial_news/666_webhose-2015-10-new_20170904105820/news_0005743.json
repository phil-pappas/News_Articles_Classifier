If you're lucky, a couple of them just might even send some more money your way. them move those assets back into your pocket. \n“As we enter the end of the year, taxes are on many of our clients’ minds,” says Mike Lynch, vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. “We encourage reps and clients to think about this all year long, so that we aren't scrambling at the end of the year by discussing being tax diversified.” \nGranted, this year Congress is making advanced planning for the 2015 tax season a little more difficult than it has to be. With no budget in place and the threat of a government shutdown still looming, a whole lot of your potential deductions are still in limbo.

We don't have that, we don't have the $250 educator deduction and we don't have a lot of the student loan deductions, because they expired at the end of '14.” \nJust don't use Congress's intractability as an excuse. It typically helps if you've been taking a sound approach to your taxes year-round. Rebecca Pavese, a certified public accountant and financial planner with Palisades Hudson Financial Group’s Atlanta office, notes that a healthy first step involves getting organized and taking a look at tax contributions you may not have changed since your employer hired you. Even if you have tinkered with your withholdings, make sure the IRS is getting enough of a cut to keep them from looking for more after you're filed. \n”If you adjusted your tax withholding during the year in order to keep a cash buffer on hand, make sure you haven’t fallen short of meeting your obligations for the year,” Pavese says. “If necessary, adjust your December withholding, which may help eliminate the prospect of estimated tax penalties and interest. You can adjust your withholding by submitting a new W-4 form to your employer.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:33:24.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
