Stephen Russell by Simon Evans Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke followed the ABC rule religiously for one part of the $754 million acquisition of most of Diageo's wine business. Anything But Chardonnay.\nTreasury was able to leave the chardonnay-focused Chalone Vineyards brand in California behind as part of the broader acquisition after lengthy negotiations and it will stay with Diageo for now. But it was forced to take the much larger United Kingdom commercial brand Blossom Hill, the No.2 brand in the UK market which sells 5 million cases annually, because Diageo made it a non-negotiable in the deal announced on Wednesday.\nMr Clarke said Chalone's business is heavily centred around chardonnay, and Treasury didn't want any extra chardonnay brands in its portfolio.\n\"They're long on chardonnay,\" he said of the Chalone business, which had been acquired by Diageo in 2004 for $US260 million on an EBITDA multiple of 17.1-times earnings.\nThe phrase Anything But Chardonnay was coined in the early 2000s after the market in both Australia and the United States was awash with the white wine variety, which was extremely popular among drinkers. But fashions and trends shift and its popularity waned.\nTreasury is already well catered for with chardonnay in its United States business via its existing Chateau St Jean brand.\nBeing forced to take the big-selling commercial brand Blossom Hill alongside the real prize of higher-end red wine brands such as Sterling Vineyards and Beaulieu Vineyards has prompted Mr Clarke to publicly air potential plans to split off the entire Treasury business into a high-end operation, and a low-end commercial arm to be sold off.\nBut his major focus is on revving up the US brands led by Sterling, Beaulieu, Acacia and Provenance, by investing more behind those brands in the same way he's been able to supercharge growth of Australian brands such as Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Wynns.\n \"We can polish up those brands,\" he said of the American stable.\nChina sees red The preference in the fast-growing Asian markets such as China is for red-wine brands.\nMr Clarke won't say what the timetable is for the pursuit of a sale of the commercial, lower-end wine brands across the entire Treasury business, but in a broad sense he points to how fast he's been able to lead a transformation of Treasury since taking the helm in late March, 2014.\n\"I want to create value quickly.\"\nTreasury shares remain in a trading halt while the institutional component of an entitlement offer is undertaken as the company raises $486 million in a 2-for-15 pro-rata accelerated renounceable entitlement offer to help pay for the acquisition at an offer price of $5.60 per share, a 14.8 per cent discount to the closing price of $6.57 on October 13.\nCitigroup analyst Craig Woolfordâ€‹ said the Diageo wine brands which Treasury is buying have lost volume and value share over the past four years according to Nielsen data. He also says the average price per case for Diageo's US portfolio of $97 is \"substantially higher\" than Treasury's.\nHe estimated the Sterling and Beaulieu Vineyards brands account for about 60 per cent in total of the US volumes that Treasury is acquiring. Citigroup has lifted its Treasury target price to $7.10 per share in what it describes as a \"logical and value accretive acquisition\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:01:40.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
