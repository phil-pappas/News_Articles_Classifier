Naomi Rovnick ©Bloomberg \nEmerging markets, particularly in Asia, have suffered a savage sell-off over recent months as investors panicked over China’s slowdown. While nobody can predict the future of the Chinese economy, sentiment among the money managers and bankers who move the mood of the markets has turned a corner, with many investment analysts now arguing that Asian stocks are too cheap. \nThe MSCI index of Asian stocks has slumped to near the level it reached in the late 1990s, the time of a deep financial crisis in the region, with indebted companies going bankrupt after currency meltdowns prevented them from repaying loans they had taken out in US dollars. \nAs this chart shows, these equities are almost the cheapest they have been so far this century — setting aside market shocks such as that generated by the September 11 terrorist attacks — on a price-to-book basis that compares market values to businesses’ net assets: \nToday, Asian companies are also constrained by “high levels of corporate debt,” analyst Joyce Poon of independent research house Gavekal points out in a note, after many binged on easy credit made possible by the US central bank’s money-printing campaign, which began in the wake of the credit crisis. \nBut Asian equities have now become oversold, Ms Poon argues, explaining that “the extreme nature of the summer sell-off,” which will have hurt private investors who own Asian index tracking funds, “assumes a far higher level of financial stress than is observed”. \nThe Gavekal analyst believes the market has “priced in a hard landing for China and the rest of the region,” which does not, in her view, appear possible. \nShe is not alone. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg mostly expect Chinese economic growth to stay at least above 6 per cent in coming years (the numbers in the chart beyond 2014 are their forecasts) instead of any major economic crash occurring in future: \nAsian nations are stronger than they were in 1997-98, even withstanding the debt companies have taken on, Ms Poon argues, as they are mostly net creditors to the rest of the world, meaning they hold more in foreign exchange reserves than they owe to overseas lenders. Think, for example, of China’s massive holdings of US government bonds, which are estimated to be worth more than $1tn. \nHSBC’s head equity strategist for Asia, Herald van der Linde, has published a research note arguing that now could be the time to buy Chinese stocks again. \nLike Gavekal’s Ms Poon, he reckons they have been oversold, and “there is an upside risk that signs of stabilisation in growth in China could lead to a sharp reversal in fortunes”, for stock markets, particularly if the Beijing government decides, as it often does during slowdowns, to introduce extra economic stimulus measures, such as cranking up the pace of infrastructure investment. \nChina’s housing market, which for several years has been the growth engine for global commodities demand, has also stopped declining quite so much in recent months. \nThis comes after efforts by the Chinese central bank to make it easier for lenders to approve mortgages , which are now “starting to have an impact,” Mr van der Linde writes. \nBut what should private investors, who may not have large amounts of money for high-risk investments in uncertain Asian economies, do with all this information? \nFor those that already hold Asian funds, it could strengthen confidence to hold on, instead of joining the panic selling. \nAnd for investors with enough risk appetite, Asian-focused investment trusts that either offer a high dividend yield or trade at a discount to their net asset value, may be worth exploring. \nJohn Newlands, an investment trusts expert at Brewin Dolphin, is currently recommending Aberdeen Asset Management’s Asian Income trust. \nAs the chart below shows, the trust is trading at a slight discount to the market value of the stocks that it holds, with a dividend yield of around 5 per cent. \n“The presence of a decent dividend yield tends to underpin the [stock’s] rating,” Mr Newlands says, explaining that this — combined with Aberdeen’s “experienced” Asian management team — may attract new investors into the trust, “despite the volatility in this uncertain part of the world”.
