The results of this study will form the basis of a trust index deriving from further surveys in future. \nThe results of the first survey show that most (70%) customers in the UAE have a high level of trust in their banks, especially compared to customers in other international banking markets, and that UAE banking customers are five times more likely to say their view of banks has improved rather than worsened in the past six months. \nThe study is based on responses from 1,040 adults with bank accounts who are resident in the UAE. The survey was conducted in August and the sample of respondents reflected a representative cultural and gender mix. The interviews were conducted using a variety of channels to ensure an optimum level of representativeness. The survey found that while banks can do more to understand customers' needs, to offer them products that they want, and to offer more reasonable fees and charges, only a quarter (23%) of expatriates believe banks at home are better than those in the UAE. \n\"As the organization which advocates best practice for banks in the UAE, the Federation has a duty to gauge whether the efforts that banks make to meet their customers' needs are effective and being felt by their customers,\", said HE AbdulAziz Al Ghurair, Chairman of the UAE Banks Federation . \"More importantly, we want to know where the banks need to up their game, from the point of view of their customers. This project forms the beginning of a process whereby we will be able to better understand whether we are improving our service performance or not, and how we can pinpoint the actions that need to be taken,\" he added. \"While we are delighted to see that these results bear out our own expectations, we accept that there is still room for improvement, not least in terms of giving customers what they really want, and in delivering it in a way that provides them with the best value\", he said.\nThe findings of the survey were presented to the recent meeting of the Federation's CEO Advisory Council, and agreement was reached on an action plan to communicate the outcome of the survey and to address areas identified in which the banking sector can improve its reputation among its customers. \nAdditional information from the survey \nMost of the UAE banking customers questioned have confidence in banks to behave responsibly (74%) and trust banks to do what is right (70%). \nIn terms of top of mind responses about their banks, customers placed good customer service, loans and safety and security significantly ahead of excessive interest rates, high profits and poor customer service. \nCustomers are five times more likely to say their view of banks has improved (41%) than worsened (8%). They are also more likely to say that banks in their home country are worse (38%) rather than better (23%) than banks in the UAE. Arab expats (56%) are especially likely to say banks in their home country are worse. \nMajorities of consumers feel that banks are dealing well with a variety of issues facing the sector, especially keeping up with digital innovations (78%), responding to new regulations (71%) and preventing cybercrime (71%). \nAn International trust barometer carried out by an independent agency (Edelman), states that the UAE comes 4 th with a rating of 81%, after Indonesia, China and India. This barometer has an average median of 53%, and countries such as the US (51%), UK (32%) and Australia (51%) fail to meet the average ranking. \n-Ends- \nAbout UAE Banks Federation Established in 1982, the UAE Banks Federation , a professional representative body comprising 49 member banks operating in the UAE.
