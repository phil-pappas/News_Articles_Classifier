Mario Draghi said the ECB will re-examine its quantitative easing programme in December and would consider extending €60bn monthly purchases past the planned 2016 September if needed. \nDraghi also revealed that the ECB had discussed furthering lowering the deposit rate, which sent the euro below $1.12 for the first time since early October. \nHowever, he said there was \"no specific preference to one instrument or the other, they were all considered\". \nThe president noted that falling commodity prices and concerns about emerging markets meant inflation pressures remained negative. \n\"We have tasked relevant committees to work on different monetary policies to monitor pros and cons of different instruments,\" he told journalists at a press conference following the ECB's announcement that it would keep policy unchanged. \nAs expected, the ECB decided to maintain interest rates, the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility unchanged at 0.05%, -0.20% and 0.30%, respectively. \n\"We believe the ECB could very well deliver on more Quantitative Easing in December,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight . \nEconomic data UK retail sales rose 6.5% year-on-year in September, well above analysts' expectations of 4.7%, according to the Office for National Statistics.

The report showed consumers in the 19-country bloc became less optimistic, as the index slid 0.6 points to -7.7.
