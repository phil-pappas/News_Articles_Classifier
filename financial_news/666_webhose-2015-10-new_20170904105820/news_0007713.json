The two-track approach is required as it is not feasible to roll out CO2-based air conditioning technology across the fleet by January 2017, Daimler said. \nThe Commission was not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Christoph Steitz and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:53:36.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
