Yet if every global company is as honest as, say, Volkswagen, we might surmise the actual figure is a fair bit higher.\nSo, I estimate that around 75 per cent of all modern Aussie companies don't really know what to do when hit by social media attacks or online crises.\nWe only have to look at cases such as the Nanna's Berries Hep A scandal and the Woolworth's \"Lest We Forget\" online disaster to see how Aussie businesses can be easily outflanked by online outrage.\nThat's when modern PR disasters start to stick – because when \"big media\" or a high-traffic website publishes a social media critique, the search engines will find, index, store and republish that story – allowing many more people to read and redistribute it, and so redefine your online repute.\nOn the other hand, David Jones is adeptly riding the waves of transmedia indignation related to its appointment of retired Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes as a brand ambassador .\nAs embarrassing as the social media barbs at Goodes - and some of the responses - are, the furore actually helps DJs surf a swell of \"controversy communications\", adding visibility for their new positioning campaign.\nTheir role model sponsorships - and even the social spat - assert DJ's new brand posture: \"The right-on choice for cashed-up consumers with a conscientous rock 'n roll spirit\", I'm guessing? Goodes' recruitment is an adept PR manouevre. Round 1, and both store and sports legend are countering with all the right moves.\nIf your firm is caught in a social media controversy, here are four ways to minimise the damage:\n1. Monitor the extent and influencers Social media monitoring is the best way of affording you the widest possible understanding of what's being said about your company and any issues you may be about to face.\nBy monitoring social media channels, key influencers and media you will quickly be able to get a broad picture of the situation and what the potential ramifications are. This can then feed into your strategy on how to minimise damage and communicate the company's stance and any solutions you have at that stage.\n2. Practice makes perfect Responding to a viral video that's just hit 20,000 views in 30-minutes with a corporate press release that takes two days to get approval is just not going to cut it nowadays. Every crisis, emergency and risk plan needs to be re-configured and tested to effectively handle online threats and crises.\nOrganisations often tend to rote-repeat their 3 messages; yet in social media, you can only effectively respond if you put yourself into the \"emotional\" shoes of the affected stakeholders.\nBe well-rehearsed and drilled and use crisis simulations for your relevant C-Suite executives. What will people a) think b) feel c) say and d) do as this issue blows up? Will engaging in dialogue inform or inflame the situation? How will we respond? Who will speak for us? What should they say? What format best/most effectively gets our position understood?\n3. Sort it, or shut it If you can't be seen to be trying to fix it, engage only as necessary and generally lay low. If you do sort it out, let everyone in all key affected stakeholder groups know how well you sorted it.\n4. Ensure your content is optimized for search Modern media and communications are increasingly going online. And what's said online often influences search engine reputation.\nAnd because search engines archive, retrieve and regurgitate old and bad news – it's imperative to know how to influence social channels in the short and long term, if you want to protect your reputation.\nCrises happen; but what is said on social media today becomes search engine findable forever. It pays to arm yourself.\nGerry McCusker is founder of online media and PR consultancy Engage ORM.
