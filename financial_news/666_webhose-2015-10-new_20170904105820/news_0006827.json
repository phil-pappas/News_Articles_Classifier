Oliver Astrologo Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Doubling the length of time an asset has to be held before it is eligible for a capital gains tax break is being floated as a fix for sky-high property prices.\nA new Deloitte report says while negative gearing gets all of the bad press, it is in fact the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount that has been responsible for driving frenetic property speculation, along with low interest rates and a lack of housing supply.\nOptions for reform put forward include reducing the size of the discount to 33.3 per cent and extending the holding period requirement from 12 to 24 months.\n\"The currentâ€¦discount is too generous, to the extent that it undermines the very principles of this nation's progressive income tax system,\" the report says.\nIt nominates 33.3 per cent for no other reason than this is what super funds are eligible to receive. The precise figure should be a matter for debate, the report says.\nAt present, a capital gain on an asset sold within 12 months is not eligible for the CGT discount.\n\"One way to wind back the over-reliance of Australians on earning capital gains is simply to shift that dividing line from 12 to 24 months,\" the report says. A reduction to 33.3 per cent would generate more than $2 billion.\nIt is the second \"myth-busting\" report released by Deloitte as part of its contribution to the tax reform debate.\n The first said replacing taxes that weigh heavily on economic activity, such as stamp duty, with more efficient ones, like the GST, could add 2 per cent to national income.\nThe latest report, released on Monday , suggests changes to super tax concessions and the capital gains tax discount.\nNegative gearing not 'evil' While over-used, negative gearing is not the \"evil\" force many believe it to be, it says.\nA property is negatively geared when the mortgage interest repayments exceed the net income from the property.\nThe taxpayer can apply this loss against other income, such as salary. Shares and other assets can also be negatively geared.\nIf a particular asset is sold after being held for more than a year, it is taxed at half of the owners' tax rate. So for an individual on the top marginal rate, the effective tax on capital gains is 23.5 per cent. By contrast, bank savings for that same person would be taxed at 49 per cent (including the Medicare and budget repair levies).\nThe CGT discount is intended to account for inflation and encourage savings. Since it was introduced at the end of the 1990s, investor activity in housing markets has skyrocketed from $1 billion in 1995 to nearly $15 billion in 2015.\nAs Deloitte and others note , the rich benefit most. Those who earn more than $180,000 a year account for 53 per cent of the capital gains earned by all individual taxpayers. This is far in excess of their share of taxable income and share of interest deductions against rent.\nThe Greens have called for a major overhaul and released Parliamentary Budget Office figures showing a reduction in the discount to 25 per cent would generate $5.7 billion over four years.\nWhen questions of fairness were raised about negative gearing, ousted treasurer Joe Hockey was fond of saying that many middle-income earners had negatively geared property. New Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer made the same point on Sunday .\n\"I think a lot of people say that only wealthy Australians take advantage of negative gearing,\" she told the ABC's Insiders program.\n\"When you look at the facts that's not the case. Average income earners largely are the people who do get to take advantage of negative gearing.\n\"Nurses, policemen and women on an average wage investing, for instance, in a property. Most of them hold only one property, which adds to the housing stock that's available for people as well,\" she said.\nAnother \"skeleton in the closet\" for the system is the carried forward capital losses, the Deloitte report says.\n\"The ATO lists carried forward losses as at 2012-13 at $8 billion for individuals, $35 billion for companies and $33 billion for super funds,\" it says.\n\"Any reform which led to these losses being rapidly utilised might be expensive, even if those reforms were otherwise worthwhile.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-26T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:41:32.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
