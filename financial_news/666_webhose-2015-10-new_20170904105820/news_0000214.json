Brendan Esposito Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans The grand old dame of Australia retailing does corporate turbulence better than anyone .\nIt seems there's no other board like David Jones. Those loyal retail servants manning the cosmetics counter at the venerable 177-year-old department store chain could be forgiven for wondering just what on earth is going on upstairs.\nDavid Jones has now had four chief executives in just over five years, as yet another boss heads for the exit.\nThe abrupt departure of Ian Nairn in mysterious circumstances after just 14 months in the role continues the extreme volatility in the executive suite at the company. It comes at a time when stability of management would be a plus in an industry where traditional business models are being completely up-ended by the relentless onslaught of the digital age. It makes a \"bricks and clicks\" strategy central to success, albeit with a smaller \"bricks\" component, and getting it right is tricky as rival Myer is finding out as its share price wallows.\nMark McInnes was forced to step aside after a scandal in 2010. Michel O'Sullivan Questions are now being raised about just how sustainable the impressive David Jones turnaround is under its new owners, South African Woolworths, following the $2.1 billion takeover of David Jones in 2014. South Africa's Woolworths also shelled out $215 million to gain full control of clothing retailer Country Road at inflated prices to rid itself of long-time nemesis, billionaire Solomon Lew, who helped himself to a handsome $200 million profit by some stubborn wheeling and dealing in both takeovers.\nRevolving door The up and down escalators to the chief executive's office at David Jones have hosted some heavy traffic.\nMark McInnes, who has since been a winner running Mr Lew's sector-leading Premier Investments retailing group, had been a consistent performer and at the helm for seven years when he departed in a shock exit in mid-2010. He departed abruptly amid a sexual harassment scandal involving a staff member and a $37 million law suit. Then chairman Bob Savage launched an independent review of the company's human resources policies and culture, and negotiated an $850,000 settlement with McInnes' victim, Kristy Fraser-Kirk.\nPaul Zahra replaced Mark McInnes, and is pictured here with Jessica Gomes at David Jones' 175th birthday gala event. Belinda Rolland A fresh-faced Paul Zahra, who had been at David Jones for 12 years, was elevated to the top job. He ran smack bang into some of the worst retail trading conditions in 20 years, wrestled through a series of profit downgrades and had to deal with a hoax takeover offer in 2012 from what was eventually discovered to be little more than a British post-office box company called EB Private Equity, headquartered in a terrace house next to a noodle restaurant.\nThe pressures of running David Jones are immense. It is high-profile and every mis-step is very public. Zahra on October 21, 2013, announced he was burnt out and was quitting, but would stay on until a successor was found. Fund managers urged him to stay. He did.\nJust a week later, David Jones received a confidential merger proposal from rival Myer to create a $3 billion department store giant. There was also controversy because two David Jones directors, Steve Vamos and Leigh Clapham had bought shares a day later, but that move was later defended by then chairman Peter Mason.\nTakeover battles Iain Nairn took over after running Country Road for parent company Woolworths of South Africa. Arsineh Houspian Months of negotiations and intrigue behind the scenes followed. But in the end the boards couldn't agree. In 2014, South Africa's Woolworths marched in and seized the opportunity. Zahra was still at the helm. A bold price won the day, with fresh David Jones chairman Gordon Cairns central to some cold and clinical negotiations.\nIan Nairn, who had been running Country Road, was then given the job in August, 2014, of running David Jones with the full imprimatur of South African Woolworths chief executive Ian Moir, himself a former Country Road boss.\nMarks & Spencer executive John Dixon has a strong pedigree in British retailing and is set to take the helm in January, 2016.\nIt's been a rollercoaster ride for David Jones, which had 19 years as a separately listed public company after being cut free in 1995 from the debt-plagued Adelaide Steamship Company controlled by John Spalvins.\nJohn Dixon, who spent nearly 30 years at UK retailer Marks & Spencer, is the latest to take the DJs hot seat.
