PUBLISHED: 14:30, Wed, Oct 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:38, Wed, Oct 21, 2015 GETTY Starbucks has been ordered to repay cash in tax \nDeals struck between the coffee chain in the Netherlands and carmaker in Luxembourg effectively amounted to illegal state subsidies that must be repaid, an inquiry by the European Commission found. In a further outrage to the taxpayer, most of Starbucks' coffee roasting company’s profits are shifted abroad, where they are also not taxed, the year-long investigation found. \nFiat's financing company only paid taxes on underestimated profits.The Netherlands and Luxembourg will now have to recover the unpaid taxes from the two firms.The landmark ruling has been seen as a major step forward in the battle against tax avoidance deals used by global multinationals.The Commission is now investigating similar tax practices in all of the 28 nations, including Britain.EU antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager said: \"Tax rulings that artificially reduce a company's tax burden are not in line with EU state aid rules. They are illegal. \n\"All companies, big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax.\"Catherine Bearder MEP and chair of the Liberal Democrat EU referendum campaign, said: \"This is a game-changer in the fight against corporate tax avoidance.\"By working together across Europe, we can clamp down on tax-dodging and get a fairer deal for British taxpayers and businesses.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:53:58.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
