(NASDAQ: ARRS) today announced its first DOCSIS® 3.1 modems for operators and retailers—leading the way for gigabit speeds in the home. These devices complement ARRIS's globally deployed DOCSIS 3.1 network portfolio as well as the company's unmatched expertise in the DOCSIS 3.1 standard, which it helped pioneer. \nARRIS's new DOCSIS 3.1 devices include a dedicated cable modem for operators and a retail cable modem: Touchstone CM8200 – This ultra-fast DOCSIS 3.1 modem delivers unprecedented data rates of more than 5 Gbps downstream and 2 Gbps upstream. Switchable filters with full 204MHz upstream and 1218MHz downstream support reliable gigabit performance, while reducing interference in the home network. SURFboard® SB8200 Cable Modem – This modem offers the same DOCSIS 3.1 performance and features as the CM8200, but is intended for retail customers, who can take advantage of its 32x8 QAM channel bonding capabilities on DOCSIS 3.0 cable systems. \n'DOCSIS 3.1 is the solution for delivering tomorrow's gigabit speeds on today's networks, and ARRIS is in a unique position to bring this technology to market in scale,' said Larry Robinson, President, Customer Premises Equipment at ARRIS. 'We have a legacy of DOCSIS leadership—from our pioneering work in developing the standard itself to deploying DOCSIS-based network solutions around the world and delivering a full suite of compatible CPE to operators and retailers alike. Our new line of DOCSIS 3.1 devices extends our industry leadership, making ARRIS the obvious choice for future-proofing investments in cable networking and delivering on the full promise of gigabit.' \nThe Touchstone CM8200 and SURFboard SB8200 modems will be on display in ARRIS's booth (#551) at the SCTE Cable-Tec Expo between October 14-16, 2015 and become available in 2016.
