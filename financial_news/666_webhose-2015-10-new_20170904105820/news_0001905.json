We expect underlying inflation to remain around 5 per cent, although higher food prices will push YoY CPI inflation to above the underlying trend in coming months,” the report said.\nAccording to the global brokerage firm, the Reserve Bank has already “front-loaded” rate cuts, and the central bank is likely to keep policy rate on hold until end-2016.\nReserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan on September 29 effected a more-than-expected interest rate cut of half a per cent to boost the economy.\n 13, 2015 2:00 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:36:40.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
