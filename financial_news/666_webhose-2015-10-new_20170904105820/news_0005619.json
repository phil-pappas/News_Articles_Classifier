But a source close to Congo Airways said last month that this could take place \"around mid-October.\" \nInternal air transport in the immense country -- half the size of the European Union -- is currently operated largely by the United Nations, chiefly for its own use or for humanitarian purposes. \nThe small local airlines that do operate are all on a European Union blacklist, which means that they cannot fly into EU airspace. \nAir France (Paris: FR 31122 - news ) is providing technical assistance to the new airline, which is being financed with public funds. \n- Infrastructure overhaul - \nAir transport (Other OTC: AITG - news ) infrastructure is also being overhauled in the DRC, one of the least developed countries in the world and where air accidents occur frequently due to ageing fleets, lack of security controls and poor weather conditions. \nCongo Airways will initially fly to eight towns and cities, and this will be expanded to 14 after three years. \nCongo Airways \"aims in the short term to acquire other aircraft in order to serve the whole country,\" said Kirongozi. \nThe two Airbus planes - which now bear the airline's colours of red, yellow, blue and white and a flying leopard on the tail fin -- were bought second-hand from Italy's Alitalia for around 50 million dollars (44 million euros). \nOne of them was impounded for almost a month in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) following legal proceedings launched by DRC creditors, but finally arrived in Kinshasa on September 26. \nThe company's launch follows the desire of DRC authorities to develop the country and to gradually open up some regions that are inaccessible by road, despite a national budget of only around 9.0 billion dollars for 2015. \nOne lawmaker taking the flight to Lubumbashi, Romain Kalonji, complained about the \"exorbitant\" cost of flights in the country and hoped that Congo Airways would help make flying more affordable. \nKirongozi said that \"everything has been implemented to ensure reasonable fares.\" \nBut flying is still likely to remain beyond the financial reach of most Congolese. \nThe DRC was torn apart by two wars between 1996 and 2003, and some regions remain in the grip of violence by militias. \nBut the fact that an airline can serve Goma, capital of Nord-Kivu, the province that is emblematic of the suffering of eastern DRC, bears witness to some improvement in the security situation. \nEthiopian Airlines in July launched the first regular international service to Goma for many years, from Addis Ababa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:21:07.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
