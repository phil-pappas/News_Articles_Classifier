( GM - Get Report ) stock is gaining by 0.21% to $35.49 in late morning trading on Thursday, after the company announced it will nearly double its workforce at the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant following third quarter financial results that beat analysts' estimates.\nThe auto maker will add 1,200 hourly and salaried jobs, as well as a second shift, to boost the total workforce to 2,800 and meet the forecasted demand for the vehicles produced at the plant.\nGM has invested $1 billion in the plant that builds the Chevrolet Volt, Impala and Malibu, and the Cadillac ELR. Production of the Cadillac CT6 will begin early next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, GM reported earnings of $1.50 per share on revenue of $38.84 billion for the 2015 third quarter.\nAnalyst surveyed by Thomson Reuters had estimated for earnings of $1.18 per share on $38.55 billion in revenue.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL MOTORS CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM) a BUY. This is driven by multiple strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations, solid stock price performance and impressive record of earnings per share growth. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.\nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: GM \nGM data by YCharts Check Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:22:04.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
