Berger would retire by April 13, 2017, and that the company's board of directors \"has initiated a process to review potential strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value.\"\nOn this news, GLDD shares have fallen by as much as $1.55, or more than 29%, during intraday trading on October 19, 2015.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Florida, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
