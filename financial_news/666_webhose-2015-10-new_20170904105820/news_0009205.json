If no determination had been made by the first respondent (provincial mining director) there is no way he would have ordered suspension of operations pending appeal. \n\"In the first place they would not have been any appeal to talk about,\" Muremba ruled. \n\"That they went to commence preparatory work in anticipation of the issuance of the certificate of registration is a personal risk they took and cannot blame anyone other than themselves. \n\"The least the applicants (Marumahoko and Crevixs) should have done was to insist on being issued with a certificate of registration before they commenced any work. The application is therefore dismissed with costs,\" the judge said. \nIn November last year, in the run-up to the Zanu PF elective congress, Marumahoko was removed from the party's Mashonaland West provincial \nexecutive committee and banned from holding any party position on the grounds that he supported the then Vice President Joice Mujuru's alleged bid to topple President Robert Mugabe.
