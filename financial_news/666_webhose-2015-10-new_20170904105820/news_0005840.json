Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Dominic White Former News Corp Australia boss Kim Williams and Sky News chief Angelos Frangopoulos are among media executives who have been approached by headhunter Egon Zehnder as it seeks interviewees for the position of managing director of the ABC.\nOther likely candidates for the high-profile role include Glyn Davis, the vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, and, internally, the ABC's director of television Richard Finlayson and its chief operating officer David Pendleton.\nIt is understood that the ABC board plans to wrap up the selection and interviewing process by the end of 2015 and announce the new managing director in the new year.\nThe timetable is designed to give the winner time to withdraw from any roles they have before the incumbent Mark Scott's term expires at the end of June. Mr Scott has been in the role for 10 years.\nSky News chief Angelos Frangopoulos is one of a number of media executives who headhunter Egon Zehnder has been in contact with. Supplied Egon Zehnder will help to draw up a list of candidates for interview by collating those people it has contacted who wish to take part in the process, and any other applicants who it and the ABC board deem worthy of interview.\nThe deadline for applications for the Sydney-based job passed on Sunday at 5pm. A final shortlist of candidates for the role is not expected until mid to late November.\nMr Williams was travelling and declined to comment. Mr Frangopoulos declined to comment. Egon Zehnder did not return calls.\nOther executives who were rumoured in industry circles to have been approached included News Corp chief executive Robert Thompson and Foxtel chief executive Richard Freudenstein but that speculation is understood to be wrong.\n Potential candidates will watch closely this week as the ABC appoints a director of news to replace Kate Torney who left to run the Victorian State Library in mid-September.\nThere is speculation that veteran ABC journalist and executive Craig McMurtrie may get the role, which he has been filling in an \"acting\" capacity since Ms Torney's departure.\nCommunications Minister Mitch Fifield told Fairfax Media last month Mark Scott has been a \"terrific\" managing director and his successor should be \"endlessly curious and endlessly inquiring\".", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/abcs-mark-scott-has-been-terrific-says-fifield-20150927-gjvrk1.html#ixzz3osS4X5wo", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:04:07.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
