Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Malcolm Turnbull has distanced himself further from Tony Abbott by leaving open the option of adopting Labor's superannuation tax increases , or something similar, and taking them to the next election.\nAnd, in his first party room address to Coalition MPs since he rolled Mr Abbott for the leadership last month, the Prime Minster pointedly promised an end to the command and control style of Mr Abbott's office under chief of staff Peta Credlin.\n\"My chief advisers will be my ministers,\" Mr Turnbull told the meeting.\nHe said his office's duty was to \"support and liaise with ministers and ensure we get the best out of the Australian public service\".\nLabor leader Bill Shorten has also reacted to Mr Turnbull's ascension by unveiling a frontbench reshuffle slightly larger than anticipated. As well as promoting Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher into shadow cabinet to replace the retiring Bernie Ripoll and Jan McLucas, he has also brought in Michelle Rowland as shadow small business minister.\nThis will match Mr Turnbull's 21-member cabinet and ensure Labor has more women in its executive.\nLabor's election tax promise Labor promised in April that if it won the election, it would impose a 15 per cent tax on the super income of retirees on all earnings of more than $75,000. Also, the 30 per cent tax rate on contributions would apply to those on incomes from $250,000 and more, down from the current threshold of $300,000 .\n Until that point, the Abbott government had kept open the prospect of changes to super taxes as part of the white paper process, but it swiftly changed tack.\nMr Abbott ruled out super tax changes this term and beyond.\n\"We have no plans for further taxes on superannuation beyond this term of Parliament, because we do not believe the people's savings are a piggy bank to be raided by government whenever it is in trouble,\" Mr Abbott said.\n\"Unlike members opposite, we do not regard people's superannuation savings as an emergency fund to be raided by government whenever government is short of money.\"\nBut in Parliament on Tuesday, Mr Turnbull confirmed super taxes were firmly back in the mix for tax reform and even that Labor's proposal could be adopted.\nMatters 'under consideration' \"They are very substantial tax concessions,\" he said in response to a question from Mr Shorten about the $38 billion supposedly foregone because of the concessional rates that apply.\n\"All of these matters are under consideration by the government.\"\nMr Turnbull said the government would consider the proposal by the opposition and others as it prepared its tax reforms policy.\nAs he pledged the day before – when he advanced the case for cutting weekend penalty rates, which was another debate Mr Abbott chose to avoid – Mr Turnbull promised any changes to super taxes would be taken to the 2016 election.\n\"We are not dealing with minor matters here,\" he said.\nDuring Tuesday's party room meeting, Mr Turnbull warned his troops that while the government was off to a good start, \"the expectations on us are massive\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:52:02.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
