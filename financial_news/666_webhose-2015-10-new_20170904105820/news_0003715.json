Virginia Star Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian dollar is widely tipped to remain under pressure this year, but a leading fund manager warns investors risk missing a possible sharp rebound in the currency, which could lead to a rally towards US80¢ as global interest rates remain stuck at record low levels.\nDavid Sokulsky, UBS Wealth Management head of investment strategy, said the investment bank's base case was for the Australian dollar to trade at US71¢ by year's end and US65¢ in 12 months.\nThe market has forecast the Aussie to hit US70¢ in the fourth quarter of 2015 and US69¢ for the bulk of 2016, according to Bloomberg.\nBut the moves of the world's central banks remained uncertain and could reverse the recent depreciation in the Aussie, Dr Sokulsky said.\nIt was quite possible that the US Federal Reserve would keep interest rates on hold indefinitely amid global volatility, while the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan launched fresh quantitative easing measures and the Bank of England eased monetary policy to fight deflation, Dr Sokulsky said.\nThose moves would drive capital to Australia, he said.\n\"Australia will be attractive due its higher relative interest rates, and as a consequence the Australian dollar will likely rally.\"\nThat scenario was not being priced by the markets, he added, meaning a rally could be sharp if China's economic growth defied gloomy expectations.\n On Monday China released its third-quarter gross domestic product figures. At 6.9 per cent year-on-year the number is marginally below the Chinese government's growth target of 7 per cent but above consensus estimates of 6.8 per cent.\nUncertainty over central banks The good news was that the dollar was unlikely to hit as high as US80¢ unless the Fed reversed its tightening cycle and dove back into QE, a possibility flagged by leading Australian bond fund manager Vidal Gor earlier this month .\nBut investors needed to factor in the risk of seeing the Australian dollar in a US75¢ to US77¢ handle, Dr Sokulsky said.\n\"The key issue for investors in the current environment is that nobody knows what the major central banks will do over the coming months,\" he said.\n\"The uncertainty is heightened as none of the banks have a clear directional stance and quantitative easing remains a possibility for most of them.\"\nThe comments come after Royal Bank of Scotland analysts last week warned of an environment of \"QE infinity\" where monetary easing went on forever and investors expected low returns.\nA stronger Australian dollar would put pressure on bright spots in Australia's sluggish economy which were benefiting from its depreciation, namely its manufacturing, education and tourism exports, Dr Sokulsky said.\nA reversal could send Australia back to the \"capex cliff\" from earlier this year, when non-mining investment was stagnating, and lead Australia closer to a recession.\nThe Australian dollar rally may be one catalyst for the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates, but was also under pressure from the housing sector, which is showing signs of easing, and Australia's economic growth, with gross domestic product coming in at a sluggish 0.2 per cent for the June quarter.\nIn the minutes of its October meeting, released on Tuesday, the RBA board said the weaker Australian dollar was helping the economy to rebalance, reducing bets of a rate cut at its November meeting.\nBut Dr Sokulsky said a rate cut may not stop the Aussie from rallying amid deflationary pressures and an environment where central banks were unilaterally easing monetary policy.\n\"This would have a not insignificant impact on our economy, the local equity market and value of offshore investments in Australian dollar terms,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/bt-says-forget-fed-rate-rise-faltering-recovery-could-mean-more-qe-20151008-gk4jkf.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:08:30.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
