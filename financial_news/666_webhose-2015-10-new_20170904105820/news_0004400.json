Philip Gostelow Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow When inbound tourism operator David Armour heads to Europe next week to pitch for business he will be going with a spring in his step.\nThe plunge in the currency over the past 18 months into his self-described \"sweet spot\" of US70-75¢ will make an Australian holiday an easier sell.\nThe managing director of Southern World Australia – who specialises in bringing Western markets, rather than emerging Asian markets – says he will have his foreign exchange app on his phone ready at the World Travel Market fair in London to show potential customers how much cheaper an Australian holiday is now compared to two years ago.\n\"It's a big selling point because we're not a cheap destination. We never will be a cheap destination,\" Armour told AFR Weekend .\n\"People who want to come to Australia seriously have to think about it. It's not like doing a Bali or a \"stop and flop\" holiday. They have to really want to come and do it properly.\"\nAs the mining boom fizzles, the tourism industry is experiencing a resurgence just at the right time. The lower dollar is luring more international visitors and, more importantly, getting them to spend more money when they are here.\nDomestic tourists who were once tempted offshore to Bail, Fiji, Thailand or Hawaii for a beach holiday are now heading back to local options such as the Gold Coast.\nArmour, who has run his privately owned inbound tourism business since 1991, says business has picked up significantly in the past 12 months on the back of the weaker dollar. The spend per person for one key US client is up 38 per cent.\n Jump in spending The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show international arrivals in Australia were 6.5 per cent higher in the 12 months to August. Last financial year, international visitors spent a record $33.4 billion – up 10 per cent – according to Tourism Research Australia.\nTourism Australia managing director John O'Sullivan says big jumps in consumer expenditure in the March and June quarter are the real bonus of the latest tourism boom.\n\"The key driver out of source markets is consumer confidence. What we are seeing for the first time now is our growth rate in terms of expenditure is almost double in terms of arrivals, which suggests people are spending more when they're here,\" says O'Sullivan on the phone from China.\n\"For the first time ever we've seen more than 7.2 million international visitors come to Australia in a year.\"\nTourism consultant Peter Hook, whose client base ranges from the Sunshine Coast in Queensland to Kakadu in the Northern Territory, says there weren't enough rooms for tourists in the capital cities of Darwin, Perth and Brisbane during the mining boom and the tourism business suffered as a result. But that pressure has now eased and new hotels that expected to cater to mining executives find they are filling up with tourists.\n\"You can see it in the last six months – it really has begun,\" Hook says.\n\"There is a direct correlation between the reduction in the mining boom and the regrowth of tourism. All the places that were constricted by the mining boom now have rooms available. Darwin was effectively closed to tourism for a few years because of the ridiculous prices. That has now changed. It has also changed in Perth.\"\nHigh-end market The luxury boutique hotel group COMO – which has only 12 hotels worldwide, including London, Bali, the Maldives and Phuket – opened its first hotel in Australia this week. COMO the Treasury in Perth will target high-end travellers and the corporate market.\nIt is part of a wave of hotels set to open in Australia over the next few years.\nThe iron ore boom may have come off the boil but there is still plenty of money in Perth from tourism and business travellers, COMO general manager Anneke Brown says.\n​In a bid to attract wealthy travellers, the hotel in the city's old Treasury building will offer top-end restaurants, bars and shopping experiences for guests. The entry point for its 48 rooms is $595 per night.\n\"Discerning high-end travellers will not stop travelling regardless of the currency, but the lower dollar does help,\" Brown says.\n\"Sydney and Melbourne are key markets for us and we are also targeting the south-east Asian feeder markets of Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur.\"\nAhead of the 30th anniversary of the Crocodile Dundee movie, which ignited America's love affair with Down Under, in the competitive world of international tourism is Australia suddenly cool again?\nMore competitive airfares from new operators in the Australian market have taken the country off the one-off bucket list and attracted return customers who are spending up big once they exchange their currency at the airport.\nTotal outbound visitors still exceed arrivals, but the rate of growth of inbound traffic in the past year is almost three times higher than outbound traffic.\nChina's middle class The return of traditional markets such as North America and Europe has many tourism veterans excited, but the unlimited potential of the fast-growing Chinese middle class remains the focus of many in the industry.\nChina now accounts for 951,000 international visitors a year, Australia's second-biggest inbound market behind New Zealand (1.2 million). The United Kingdom (670,700 a year) and the United States (580,000) are next, in figures for the 12 months to August.\nChina has been recording growth rates of 20 per cent a year for the past few years and is set to overtake New Zealand to become Australia's biggest market for international tourists.\nReder Wang, international travel service general manager at Shenzen CEPT, which is one of Australia's key distribution partners in China, says the lure of big open spaces, clean air and good shopping was bringing city-dwelling Chinese tourists to Australia.\nThe drop in the currency, which is making a trip 10 per cent cheaper than a year ago, is a bonus.\n\"Most outbound travellers are city dwellers. They are attracted to the clean air and good beaches. The Australian landscape is most attractive and the lifestyle is very different,\" says Wang, who helps co-ordinate group and individual tours of Australia.\n\"We are definitely trying to tell our consumers they will get to spend more because of the lower currency.\"\nSovereign Hill chief executive Jeremy Johnson, who runs an open-air museum and historical park in Ballarat in Victoria, recognised the potential of the Chinese market before many others. He first made a move into China in the late 1980s, on a hunch the Chinese would be interested in learning about their ancestors' involvement in the Victorian gold rush in the 19th century.\nJohnson, who is also on the Victoria Tourism Industry Council board, says the hard work has paid off. One in three inbound Chinese visitors to Victoria now visit Sovereign Hill. He now has 20 Mandarin-speaking guides and an office in Shanghai.\n\"We do a lot of marketing in China selling the cultural connection to the Victorian goldfields. But the numbers coming out of China are huge. The outbound market was 100 million this year, 80 million last year,\" he says.\nDevelopers also can't keep up with demand for hotel space in the key markets of Sydney and Melbourne. Sydney hotel tycoon Jerry Schwartz is adding two floors to his Rydges Sydney Central hotel, while the $340 million Sofitel Sydney Darling Harbour hotel is due for completion in 2017.\nThe Sunset Strip of the Gold Coast is also experiencing a boom, courtesy of Chinese investment. Brisbane's Queens Wharf integrated resort and casino, due to start construction in 2017, will be targeting wealthy travellers.\nResorts need upgrade While the lower dollar is helping bring tourists back to Australia, critics bemoan tired old resorts and ageing infrastructure, especially along the Queensland coast. They worry the quality of the products pales by comparison with the five- and six-star offerings in Asia.\nAnyone who has been to some Queensland coastal resorts where the staff still appear to be wearing Ken Done-inspired uniforms – which match the lurid curtains and bedspreads – will agree.\nQueensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind says criticism of a lack of investment in tourism assets was valid.\n\"The [criticism was] legitimate because there was a low rate of re-investment and new investment in tourism. That's absolutely true,\" Gschwind says.\n\"But we're heading in the right direction now. Tourism is looking like a much more attractive place to invest and there's $6.5 billion in investment in hotel accommodation in Queensland over the next two and a half years. And with that comes jobs.\"\nO'Sullivan defends the campaign slogan \"There's nothing like Australia\" which Tourism Australia has run since 2010, and he says it's been a success. (New Zealand's phenomenally successful \"100 per cent pure\" brand has been in use since the late 1990s).\nTourism Australia also runs category campaigns such as for food and wine, shopping and coastal assets to key markets, with some local variations.\n\"We don't believe it needs to be refreshed because it's worked for us. If you look at the numbers since the launch they have been very positive,\" O'Sullivan says.\nHe says Tourism Australia fell victim prior to 2010, chopping and changing its brand, including the doomed campaigns \"Where the bloody hell are you?\" and \"See Australia in a different light\".\n\"We were launching something every 18 months, two years. It doesn't allow the consumer to identify a brand. But we have become more targeted with things like food and wine, coastline aquatic and the premium side of things,\" he says.\nThe good news for tourism operators is that the best is yet to come. The lag-time of a fall in currency is normally 18 months to two years before it flows through as travellers organise their next big overseas trip.\nArmour believes the future is bright and there's money to be made in tourism again.\n\"It's funny because when the dollar is high you have travel agents come to us and ask to get the rates down and reduce margins, and we tried to do that a lot,\" he says.\n\"But when the dollar's low – and it works in their favour – you don't hear a squeak from them.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:06:25.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
