This has led to a decline in the diesel generator market in Europe. The diesel portable generator market is facing competition from gas generators, fuel cells, and biofuel-based equipment. \nAccording to the report, the industrial sector is a major end-user of stationary gas generators. Many industrial units, factories, plants, and manufacturing facilities use stationary gas generators. Continuous disruptions in electricity supply have forced industrial users to install high power rated stationary gas generators for uninterrupted electricity supply. Owing to the huge dip in natural gas prices, industrial users have shifted their focus to stationary gas generators. These gas generators help industrial users comply with emission standards. \nFurther, the report states that one of the challenges hindering the market growth is many end-users of generators, including the residential segment, are looking at alternative forms of energy rather than depending only on generators. \nThe report includes the present scenario and the growth prospects of the global stationary gas generator market for 2015-2019. The market can be segmented into three divisions on the basis of product range: less than 60 kW, 61-1,000 kW, and above 1,000 kW stationary gas generators. In addition, the report includes the segmentation of the global stationary gas generator market on the basis of geography. \nKey vendors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:18:45.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
