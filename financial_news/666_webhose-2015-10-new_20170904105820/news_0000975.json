It covers trade among countries that account for roughly 40% of the global economy and more than $1 trillion in goods and services.\n\nMuch of Asia is growing at a healthy rate of between 4% and 8%, as both population and purchasing power are expanding quickly. Thanks to the TPP, many companies will find they can reach nearly 500 million new Asian customers much more cheaply.\nFor instance, while Ford ( F - Get Report ) and General Motors ( GM - Get Report ) aren't pleased that the TPP will phase out tariffs on cars and parts from countries participating in the deal, it also means that the duo of American auto makers will also eventually have freer access to those markets as well. In 2012, the Big Three U.S. automakers only sold 13,637 cars in the Japanese market. That's less than Japanese companies sold in a single day here in the U.S., despite the fact that Japan is the third largest automobile market in the world.\n\nSo while Asia Pacific accounted for just less than 7.5% of Ford's sales last year and even less for General Motors, American automakers will find a move level playing field in the those markets over time, thanks to the TPP.\nMust Read: Clinton on Trans Pacific Partnership at #DemDebate: 'It Didn't Meet My Standards' \nWhile Japan doesn't actually impose tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles, American car companies have found it difficult to secure distribution networks in the country and have been subject to separate safety certifications. The TPP sets up a dispute settlement mechanism, including financial penalties, which will ultimately open that market. Granted, while the protections that have prevented American automakers from really penetrating the Japanese market will phase out over the next two decades, it does mean there should be steady sales growth there in the coming years.\nThe opportunities in the auto industry aren't just limited to American companies, though. North America is already a major market for Toyota Motor Corp.   ( TM - Get Report ) at more than a third of sales and the company has set up a number of production plants here in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.\nWhile Toyota probably won't see a noticeable uptick in its U.S. sales thanks to the agreement, it will see its profit margins expand. That's because it will be able to source more of the parts used in its U.S.-made vehicles from lower cost countries, while still complying with requirements that a certain percentage of parts used come from the U.S., Canada or Mexico. In time, that could boost profit margins on vehicles sold in the U.S. by 5% or more.\n\n1 of 2 Check Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:05:06.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
