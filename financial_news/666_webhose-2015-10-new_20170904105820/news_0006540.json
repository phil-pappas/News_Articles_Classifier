Of course, we'll raise all these issues. That is what our relationship with China is all about.\" \nHis pledge came as UK-based firm Caparo became the latest company where steel jobs were facing the axe as it announced is was entering partial administration. \nSome 1,700 jobs are at risk at the company, which is owned by Labour peer Lord Paul and produces a number of steel and associated engineering products. \nThousands of jobs have been lost in the steel industry after redundancies at Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland earlier this month. \nDue to overcapacity in the Chinese market the price of steel has fallen by 40% from around £318 a ton to under £191 in the past year, meaning that domestic firms are no longer able to compete. \nMr Cameron said: \"Of course, we're doing everything we can in Europe to help our steel industry. \n\"That is why we voted in favour of dumping tariffs against the Chinese and we'll do everything we can to help our steel industry, including looking at how we help on high energy usage and the clearances that we need with that.\" \nDirector of trading body UK Steel, Gareth Stace, urged the government to take action in the \"next few days and weeks not months and years\". \nHe told Sky News at least 10% of steel jobs were at risk, adding: \"We are vital as a sector that feeds into a number of very important supply chains…We need to think about the wider cost to the UK economy if the government on its watch lets us wither on the vine and disappear.\" \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) sources have said that administrator PwC is looking for buyers for the business, but prospects are bleak given the failure to find a buyer for the Redcar steel works. \nCaparo Industries reported a £800,000 operating loss in 2014, down from a profit of £3.1m in the prior year. \nThe Government held a summit last week to address the future of the ailing UK steel industry. \nThe economic slowdown in China has weighed on steel demand with volumes down 4% last year and likely to be 5-6% lower this year, according to Richard White at the International Steel Statistics Bureau. \nThis translates to a huge glut of Chinese steel which is no longer required domestically, prompting Chinese steel exports to double in 2014. \nThis means that China is now exporting 100 million tons of steel per year at prices which are below the Chinese cost of production, let alone the costs associated with UK steel production. \nThe majority of Chinese steel makers are currently loss making, with very few mills refusing to cut production and even fewer considering shut down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:03:53.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
