It faces tough competition online from Amazon.com Inc and from grocery retailers and dollar stores.\nWal-Mart's stock, which fell 1.2 percent to $63.53 on Friday morning, has lost a quarter of its value this year.\nMcMillon has said he wanted to eliminate bureaucracy and focus on the stores.\n\"There are no cash registers in the office,\" McMillon told analysts in June after the company's annual shareholders' meeting, setting off speculation he was considering cuts.\n\"Our customers are changing, retail is changing and we must change. We need to become a more agile company that can easily adapt to shifting customer demand,\" McMillon said in the memo, which gave no details on what business areas would be impacted.\nThere had been speculation about layoffs in Bentonville for weeks, fueled in part by local media reports.\nRecruiting firms reported an influx of resumes from Wal-Mart executives concerned about their jobs, and suppliers have braced for a possible knock-on impact on their local operations.\nThe company holds an annual meeting with investors and analysts later this month, where McMillon and top executives are due to present their strategies and investment plans.\n(Reporting by Nathan Layne in Atlanta; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Bernadette Baum)\nWal-Mart Stores Inc Arkansas Doug McMillon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:55:42.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
