Reputation is built in the way that you respond and how you care for people ... We have shown a great amount of efficiency and carefulness in the way that we have managed this incident,\" said Minister Gordhan, who visited the scene on Thursday. The M1 highway was re-opened to traffic on Thursday afternoon after it was closed for about 24 hours following the collapse of a pedestrian bridge under construction near the Grayston Drive off-ramp on Wednesday afternoon. Two people died and more than 20 others were injured. The construction company responsible for the bridge, Murray and Roberts, says it is still investigating the cause of the collapse. Minister Gordhan says government will await the results of various investigations to establish the root cause of the accident. The company said it will work closely with a team of independent counselling and trauma practitioners to ensure the injured and the families of the deceased are given the necessary assistance.
