Andrew Quilty Share on twitter by Karen Maley Has David Murray really done enough to ensure the robustness and efficiency of Australia's $2 trillion-plus superannuation system?\nThat's one lingering question after the Turnbull government endorsed the overwhelming bulk of the Murray inquiry's recommendations for overhauling the country's superannuation system.\nCertainly, the Turnbull government's decision to ask the Productivity Commission to quickly work out ways to hold competitive tenders for selecting the best default funds has been widely praised as a way to shave the fees that people are charged on their super accounts.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison this week said the move would boost competition and put an end to the \"closed shop\" that mostly delivered control over default super accounts to industry funds.\nFinancial systems inquiry chairman David Murray questioned the asset allocation of most super funds, which are heavily weighted to equities, not fixed-income products. Louise Kennerley Similarly, the Turnbull government's decision to endorse the Murray inquiry's recommendation that superannuation trustee boards have a minimum of one-third independent directors should improve governance standards.\nBut the super shake-up recommended by the Murray inquiry is unlikely to be the last word when it comes to overhauling the country's super system.\nThe Grattan Institute's Jim Minifie says there are two relatively easy ways to improve the efficiency of the industry that weren't explicitly addressed by the Murray inquiry.\nApply 'scale test' more rigorously The first is to encourage smaller, inefficient funds to merge with their larger, more efficient rivals. Minifie argues that one way to do this is for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the body responsible for regulating super funds, to apply its so-called \"scale test\" more vigorously.\n\"APRA can be more aggressive in [its] questioning of funds that are lagging their competitors in terms of what they are able to deliver to their account holders\", he says.\n\"The scale test was set up to put pressure on smaller, high-cost funds, and that is a good thing.\"\nAnother way to increase efficiency would be by reducing the number of people who hold too many super accounts, which means they are losing a lot of money in unnecessary fees.\n\"At present, there is an opportunity to close more than 10 million excess accounts, which are costing members hundreds of millions each year\", Minifie says.\n\"And while the Australian Tax Office has taken some important steps in helping people close unwanted accounts, there is still no process that is designed to confront people starting a new job that they'll pay two sets of fees if they set up a new super account on top of their existing account.\"\nMinifie also points out that it is a difficult philosophical question as to how far governments should interfere in people's super decisions.\n'People do what they want' \"People do what they want to do. Sometimes their decisions are not what an expert would recommend either in terms of cost, or in terms of risk.\n\"Of course the sale of really egregiously harmful super products should be stopped, but beyond that, there is a limit to how far you can go in terms of restricting people's right to exercise choice.\"\nBut what impact will the Murray inquiry have in terms of stripping out costs from the notoriously bloated industry?\nMinifie says the Grattan Institute has calculated the MySuper reforms will reduce account fees from just over 1 percentage points to just over 0.9 percentage point.\n\"So average fees have fallen to about 0.9 percentage points, and we estimate they should be under 0.7 percentage points. And that means they are still 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points too high on average, with many more far above that level.\"\n(Although this sounds a small amount, these higher fees will reduce the amount of money in an average super account by tens of thousands of dollars over several decades.)\nMinifie points out that retail competition between super funds contributes to higher fees because they spend heavily on marketing and member engagement.\nCompetitive tender mechanism But he says that Murray's recommendation of having a competitive tender mechanism for default funds is likely to put downward pressure on the overall level of super fees.\nOther industry players argue that the Murray inquiry did not put sufficient emphasis on the importance of developing better retirement income products.\nAlthough its final report recommended that super trustees be required to pre-select comprehensive income products for their members' retirement, this is already happening, as major funds respond to the demographic pressure from their members.\nIn a speech to the Whitlam Institute in Sydney on Tuesday, Murray explained that his inquiry had sought to avoid mandating annuities because there had been a backlash when other countries had tried that approach. However, he said, the evidence suggested that people tended to purchase annuity-style products if trustees were required to offer them at the right time.\nMurray also questioned the asset allocation of most super funds, which is heavily weighted towards equities rather than fixed income-style products. This pattern, he said, \"didn't make sense\" to the inquiry, because logic would suggest a higher allocation to fixed interest as the population aged.\nHe also took aim at the politicisation of the Australian system, and queried whether it was producing as much value – either for its members, or for the Australian economy – as it could.\nA well-functioning super system could make a huge difference to Australia as its population ages, he said. But, he added that the super system could not be looked at in isolation. \"It is clear the tax system has a very large role to play.\"\nSignificant number of assets Interestingly, the government did not accept the Murray inquiry's recommendation to ban self-managed super funds from borrowing to buy assets.\n\"The issue for us with calling for a ban on borrowing in superannuation funds, was that we didn't want to see the leverage risk, which is necessarily present in the banking system, also present in the superannuation system,\" Murray told T he Australian Financial Review on Tuesday.\n\"In the self-managed sector, the reality is that there are already a significant number of assets that have been leveraged into property. While most of that is into business property, it is notable that SMSF borrowing for residential investment properties is on the rise.\"\nBut while some critics argue that the Murray inquiry should have attempted a more radical overhaul of the super system, the Grattan Institute's Minifie is sanguine.\n\"The changes recommended by the Murray inquiry may be less than one would have liked, but these processes take a long time\", he says.\n\"I think that a tough and vigorous implementation of the Murray recommendations will make a great deal of difference, particularly if they are combined with measures that lead to the closure of excess super accounts and to the merger of small super funds.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:52:00.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
