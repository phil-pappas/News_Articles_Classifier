The news comes at the time government is experiencing cash flow problems. Finance minister Calle Schlettwein confirmed that government had directed GIPF to recall between N$5 billion and N$10 billion invested in South Africa. He said the money is supposed to improve the country's reserves and that it has nothing to do with the government's cash flow problems. Schlettwein said it will be a win-win for GIPF and government as the fund will invest in Namibia and government will not touch it but the local economy will benefit from it being in the country. The move comes after government passed regulation 28 and 29 to the Long-term Insurance Act and the Pension Funds Act last year. The two regulations compel insurance companies and pension funds to invest between 1,75% and 3,5% of their fund value into locally unlisted entities. GIPF chief executive officer David Nuyoma yesterday confirmed that they are in consultation Bank of Namibia for the possible swapping of some of the Fund's foreign money to invest in Namibia. He said the move was also guided by regulation 28, which would compel them to reduce the Fund's duel listed investments to below 10% of the Fund's total assets by 2018, because currently assets listed on the Namibia Stock Exchange and abroad are considered locally listed assets. This will not be the case in 2018. Nuyoma said the current move is a proactive one to avoid having to move assets back to Namibia only in 2018. \"This transaction will not be detrimental to GIPF from a return or risk point of view. We wish to put it on record that the government of the Republic of Namibia did not influence this transaction and Trustees of the Fund do not expect any undue risk associated with this move,\" Nuyoma reassured GIPF members in his response to The Namibian. Research firm IJG Securities said in a report that Namibia's stock of foreign reserves decreased slightly by the end of August. International reserves stood at N$14,07 billion at the end of August, down from N$14,3 billion at the end of July. August tends to see a slight decline in reserves due to the lack of significant inflows during this month, the firm said. This means that the country only has enough foreign currency to pay for one month's imports. The norm is that at least three month's foreign reserves are kept. \"The Namibian reserve position remains a concern as the hard currency value (US dollar) of reserves continues to decline. The rand has experienced a 15% decline against the US dollar this year, a trend that is expected to continue in the long term. International reserves should appreciate in local currency terms due to the depreciation of the local currency but the fact that reserves are not is cause for concern,\" IJG said. Despite government denying that it has been facing cash flow difficulties, The Namibian has learned that a directive has been issued to government agencies, ministries and parastatals to cut down on spending. Apart from being asked to cut their spending by up to 50% in some cases, government has been withholding money it disperses to some of these institutions. Schlettwein said the move is aimed at \"improving government's prudent financial management\" by cutting on wasteful costs. He said government's drive is to reduce spending and improve productive spending. He said government will only be targeting wasteful expenditure which include travelling, paying travelling and subsistence allowances, entertainment budgets and government's furniture budget and the way it acquires furniture. He insisted that it is not the whole budget that is being targeted or going to be reduced. Schlettwein promised to soon clarify everything and give a comprehensive report to the National Assembly on what will be cut and by how much. The Namibian also recently reported that government was forced to borrow money from international markets because there is not enough from local sources. A document obtained by The Namibian dated 18 August 2015, compiled by the finance ministry, was also quoted saying government could not meet its planned funding requirements from April 2015 and July 2015 because of the liquidity crisis in the domestic market. \"In the current fiscal year, it was not possible for the government to raise the supposed borrowings from the domestic market,\" the report said. According to the report, for government to meet its funding requirements, Treasury should raise N$12 billion from international markets within the next 12 months. The situation, the report says, has been worsened by the government's limited borrowing capacity and debt sustainability when expenditure through the last fiscal years has driven the state debt towards critical ceilings. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also warned that the current situation could negatively affect the country's credit ratings.
