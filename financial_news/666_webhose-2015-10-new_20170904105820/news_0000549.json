The Republican-led legislature and new Democratic Governor Tom Wolf are at odds over Wolf's proposed tax increases and ways to fix the state's ailing public pension system. Expenditures exceed revenues by about $2 billion, Moody's said.\nThe rating action affects $10.9 billion of outstanding general obligation bonds. It does not impact certain special tax bonds.
