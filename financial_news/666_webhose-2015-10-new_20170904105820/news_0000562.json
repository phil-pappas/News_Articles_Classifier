At the same time, as the regulator, we must ensure that regulatory requirements are met and are developed in a way that delivers the high standards customers deserve,\" he said. \nUber has launched an online petition against the changes. \nLondon is one of many cities where San Francisco-based Uber has sparked legal battles and opposition from taxi drivers. \nTfL said the number of minicabs in London has risen from around 59,000 in 2009-2010 to more than 89,000. \nAt the current rate of growth, it said the total number could rise to 128,000 within two years. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Uber wins UK court case on taximeters AAP \nEngland's High Court has ruled that the ride-sharing smartphone app Uber does not infringe a law on the use of â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:26:31.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
