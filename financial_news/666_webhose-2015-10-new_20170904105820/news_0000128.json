The group said a restructuring undertaken after the financial crisis took longer to take effect in Europe than many other parts of the world.\nWPP also said trading had improved slightly in China, although the world's second largest economy remained under pressure.\n\"We don't expect any major changes to consensus,\" Liberum analysts said in a note. \"We remain cautious on the agencies but we do see WPP as the best positioned of the agencies and see these results as confirmation that Publicis recent weak results are likely due to firm-specific issues.\"\nAnalysts said WPP should benefit from more favourable comparatives in the fourth quarter as it did in the third. This would help the company to hit its full-year forecast of net sales growth of more than 3 percent. This was at 2.6 percent for the first nine months.\nShares in the group were down 1.8 percent by 0811 GMT. In the last month, they rose 8 percent.
