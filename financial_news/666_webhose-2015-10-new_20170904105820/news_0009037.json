Sam's Club is the warehouse arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT.\n\nAccording to the agreement between the two companies, customers will now be able to make payments through American Express at more than 650 warehouse club locations.\n\nOn this occasion, American Express is also providing a special offer to eligible Card Members from Oct 1--31, of a one-time $25 statement credit, to spend $45 or more on a new Sam's Club in-store membership. The offer will be open to those who use an enrolled, eligible American Express Card.\n\nSam's Club serves nearly 500,000 small businesses on a daily basis. These businesses will benefit from frills such as Small Business Saturday, Shop Small, OptBlue and Merchant Financing provided exclusively by American Express.\n\nThe partnership with Sam's Club -- the eight largest retailer in the U.S. -- reflects American Express' persistent efforts in expanding its network to make up for the lost revenue, after it failed to renegotiate its partnership with retail prime Costco Wholesale View photo\n. Corp. earlier this year. The contract with Costco will expire on Mar 16, 2016.\n\nGiven the magnitude of the relationship with Costco, management does not anticipate reaching its earnings per share growth guidance until 2017. The business implication will be negative as the Costco U.S. co-brand partnership accounts for about 8% of total card member spending, 10% of worldwide cards and 20% of worldwide loans. At a conference call with analysts, management stated that it now expects earnings to be flat in 2015.\n\nAmerican Express' move to tie up with new partners signifies it efforts to sustain earnings growth amid numerous headwinds faced by it including uneven global economic growth and intense competition. In addition, American Express' results continue to be significantly impacted by a strengthening U.S. dollar. The company expects foreign exchange to have an adverse impact for the remainder of 2015. American Express' results could also be affected by increases in interest rates, which the Fed will probably consider in its next meeting.\n\nAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in this space are SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. SSNC and StoneCastle Financial Corp. BANX. Both these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
