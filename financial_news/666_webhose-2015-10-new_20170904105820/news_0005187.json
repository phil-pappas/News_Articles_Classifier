Photo: Josh Robenstone\nNew ANZ chief to put focus on returns The environment facing new ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott is a far cry from what Mike Smith inherited when he took the reins at the Asia-focused bank in 2007.\nReturns are being crunched by competition, the pile of outstanding debt doesn't grow like it used to, and there is no sign of an end to rule changes designed to make finance more resilient – but also less profitable.\nAll these factors suggest that Elliott's time running ANZ will be more focused on squeezing returns out of the business, rather than radically reshaping or expanding it.\nAdvertisement Eight years ago, when Smith was appointed to the top job, running a big Australian bank was a different ball game.\nANZ's return on equity – a key gauge of shareholder returns – was 19.6 per cent, compared with 14.7 per cent today. About 10 per cent of its profit came from overseas, compared with 17 per cent today.\nThe board opted for an outsider to build a bank with tentacles across the region, hoping to cash in on the rise of a middle-class who would fuel demand for financial services.\nHowever, since then, the global financial crisis has fundamentally changed the economic forces that affect banks, and that is forcing them to tread a more cautious path.\nBanks can no longer rely on credit growth of 10 per cent a year or more; today's rate of about 6.3 per cent is probably near the peak. So, they are trying to be more efficient with shareholders' money.\nThe other sweeping change in banking is the rise of digital finance: technology-based rivals that want a cut from the banks' juicy profits.\nElliott said responding to this competition would be one of his top priorities, though, when budgets were being tightened, he did not say it would necessarily spend more money.\nThis tougher environment helps to explain why the most recently appointed bank chief executives – such as Westpac's Brian Hartzer and National Australia Bank's Andrew Thorburn – are keeping a tighter rein on costs and focusing on domestic businesses that generate the bulk of profits.\nElliott is likely to follow suit: pushing for more savings and targeting investment towards the most profitable areas of the bank.\nInevitably, this has put the market's focus squarely on ANZ's \"super-regional\" strategy, which has never been popular with the dividend-loving local investors.\nWhile ANZ's Asian presence allows the bank to grow, it does not generate the fat returns the big banks enjoy from lending to domestic households and businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:17:35.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
