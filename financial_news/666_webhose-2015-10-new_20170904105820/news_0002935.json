Strategize a plan to defeat student loans now. You have to crunch a lot of numbers to find the right college. You have to do even more homework to find a school that won't land you in debt.But most college seekers are going to the wrong places to find the most important information. To find a debt-free degree, you have to search for information that counts.According to the New America Foundation , which recently published a \"college decisions\" survey, nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they \"feel lost\" when searching for college and financial aid information. Wouldn't it be nice if there was one-stop shopping for this useful data?I'm not going to pretend that you can find everything you need in one site, because it's not all in one place as it should be. When looking for colleges, those surveyed by New America said the most popular routes for college background were college web sites, online searches and friends. College visits, high school counselors and parents also proved useful. So let's say you had your list of \"dream,\" \"acceptable\" and \"safety\" schools. This is the holy trinity for most college seekers, identifying highly selective, mainstream and sure-to-accept colleges. It's not a bad way to start.Here are some alternative ways of working through your search process. 1) Get a Scorecard This is a basic list of schools to consider for their financial aid potential. Okay, I've turned the process upside down, but bear with me.Do any of your dream or acceptable schools make this list? By looking at financial aid, I don't mean how much in loans a school will offer.I'm referring to grants, scholarships, tuition discounts and work study. None of these forms of aid have to be paid back. Loans do.The best site I know of is the dullest: The College Scorecard , run by the U.S. Department of Education (DE). The site will allow you to search by school, degree, location and size. 2) Do a Detailed Search with Schools in Mind This part of the search will tell you if the schools you're interested in will help you graduate debt-free. Some city/state colleges are great bargains, but don't exclude private colleges, which may have generous endowments and programs to cover your costs in full.Let's say you're interested in Stanford, the dream school for millions. You already know their acceptance rate is in the single digits.What's important to know about Stanford if you're a superior student? College Scorecard will tell you their average annual cost is $15,7113, well below the national average.How can that be when Stanford charges $46,000 per year (three quarters) for undergraduate tuition alone ? Drill down in College Scorecard and you'll see that only 13% of Stanford's students carry student loans. The rest are either paying full fees or getting generous grants. That's essential to know. Remember, \"list\" price is not necessarily what you will pay. 3) Will A Degree Be a Good Return on Investment? In real life, it may take decades for you to answer this question. But College Scorecard has already crunched the numbers for you on every college in its useful database.You'd want to know the average salary of graduates from a particular college. The higher the better. For Stanford, that number is $80,000, which gives you a great start in your career. By comparing graduate salaries, you can make an early decision on whether a college -- and specific degree program -- is worth taking on loans. By the way, this is not a commercial for Stanford. There are hundreds of smaller, liberal arts colleges that may work for you. Do your homework and you'll find a great school at an affordable net price.4 ) How Well Does A College Support Students? This is not something you'll see on a tour when you are paraded in front of shiny, new recreation centers, dorms and dining halls. That's window dressing.The single-most powerful figure for college success is a school's graduation rate. That means they provide lots of counseling and guidance. If you need help you can get it. Stanford's graduation rate, by the way, is 95%. Given a choice between a college with a gorgeous campus and a high graduation rate , I would choose the latter figure. It means you'll pay less over time for total fees.So start your college search with your dreams, but keep in mind some numbers. Dreams cost money, although they don't have to get you into debt.", "external_links": ["http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/highest-grad-rate", "https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/", "http://www.edcentral.org/collegedecisions5/", "https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/registrar/students/tuition-fees_15-16", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015NLA8BQ"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:12:53.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
