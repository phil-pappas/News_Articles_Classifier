(Copyright: MRCPhoto) The pair were (and still are) living at Shenley Wood Retirement Village in Milton Keynes when a woman from the company who administers the property asked residents how they could raise some money for the facility.“We used to live in Florida and when I was there I saw a calendar that people had made where the funds went to the village where they lived,” recalls Peter, now 83. “I said we could do that.”The woman soon roped in Peter as organiser, who leaned on his career experience as company director for a shoe retailer as well Jean, his wife of 63 years.“This idea came up at the end of October and I said we hadn’t got much time,” he explains. “We asked for volunteers and there were quite a few, so we had a selection committee. And it just started to rumble.”The plan was for the retired residents to re-enact famous movie scenes, including ‘Reservoir Dogs’, ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and ‘Singing in the Rain’.

She does some dancing!”Bringing everything together proved to be very hard work, with Peter heavily involved in arranging the photoshoot and choosing which shots should make the final cut.“Every day you had to do something and there was a deadline,” he remembers, “but lo and behold, it all got finished by the beginning of December.”Once it hit the public domain, news of the calendar soon spread around the world, featuring on radio in Australia, and in the papers in the UK and America. (Copyright: MRCPhoto) “It’s interesting how it got worldwide fame,” says Peter. “Everyone congratulated the village for doing it. We had people turning up asking if we had any calendars for sale. It was published in a newspaper where we used to live in Florida and all our old friends phoned us up. It was hectic.”Still, he admits he wasn’t a village celebrity as a result.“I’ve been called some funny old things over this calendar,” he says. “I got my leg pulled so much it’s not true. The Aussies were probably the worst.”But as 2015 winds towards its end, does he fancy doing another one? Although he admits his health has slightly deteriorated and he might not be quite as involved, the effervescent retiree reckons a 2016 version could be on the cards.“It would be nice to have Part 2, they would learn a lot from our mistakes,” he says. “But we’ve got to get cracking.”He grins. “Now you’ve phoned, I might have a word with a couple of people and see if we can’t get it going.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:05:16.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
