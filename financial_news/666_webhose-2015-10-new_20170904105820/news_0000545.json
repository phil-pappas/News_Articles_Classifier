Rob Homer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Larry Schlesinger As price growth slows in Sydney's established housing market, the heat may also be coming out of the pricing of new land subdivisions with the latest HIA-CoreLogic RP Data Residential Land Report showing median lot prices unchanged at $350,000 over the June quarter.\nThis was the first time since September last year that Sydney lot prices have not risen sharply from one quarter to the next â€“ surges which have pushed up Sydney lot prices 18.6 per cent over the 12 months to June and created new million dollar median house price suburbs in the outer west.\nNationally, the number of sales rose, 17.6 per cent over the quarter and the best result since the September 2014 quarter. But the median lot price was unchanged at $217,000.\nOn Tuesday, Reserve Bank deputy governor Philip Lowe told a business conference the rate of price growth in Sydney appeared to have slowed a little t. He said this was not surprising because \"when the supply of housing increases, the rate of house growth eventually responds\".\n\"I think we are on the cusp of seeing the supply response finally kick in, moderating price growth,\" Mr Lowe said.\nHIA economist Diwa Hopkins said an increase in lot supply in Sydney had taken the pressure off pricing. But she said it was too early to say whether Sydney lot prices had peaked.\nAccording to the HIA-CoreLogic RP Data report, sales of Sydney lots rose 24 per cent over the June quarter to 1222, but were still 14 per cent lower than the 1400 sales achieved over the same period last year.\nMelbourne surges By contrast, Melbourne lot prices surged 5.2 per cent over the quarter to a new record median lot price of $228,000, with lot sales rising almost 20 per cent to 2000, prompting developers like Stockland and Villawood to snap up new greenfield land parcels.\nAnother developer Five Squared Property Group said it had sold 80 per cent of land released at Bloom, its Clyde North residential community in the south east. \"We're seeing a spillover of buyers, particularly young families, who have been priced out of established suburbs,\" said Five Squared marketing director, Ashley Lewis.\nThe Brisbane land market was also buoyant over the quarter with quarterly lot sales totalling more than 1500, the best result since September 2014, and lot prices up 2.2 per cent to a new high of $230,000.\nIn Perth, where the established housing market is weakening amid a wider economic downturn, land prices were relatively resilient, down 0.7 per cent to $268,000 with sales volumes rising to about 2500 lots.\nLot prices fell by five per cent or more in the more volatile Adelaide ($195,000) and Hobart markets ($134,000).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:05:05.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
