Wise Bread Picks 0% Balance Transfer Credit Cards \nDo you have a bunch of airline miles that you're not going to use? Hoping to get rid of them or help someone less fortunate? You've come to the right place. Here are six different ways that you can part with your hard-earned miles without violating the frequent flyer terms and conditions of airline loyalty programs. Donating Miles \nGood for you! You've decided to use your airline miles for a greater purpose. Note that donating your miles truly is an act of charity — that's because the IRS considers airline miles a gift to you from the airline, and donated miles are therefore not tax deductible. 1. American Miles for Kids in Need \n(1,000 Miles Minimum Donation) \nYour AAadvantage Miles can be used to give an advantage to children and families in need of help. American Airlines supports a variety of child and family focused charities including Miles of Hope, Miles for Kids in Need, and more. \nThrough these programs AA focuses on food, clothing, shelter, health, education, and employment. Their goal is to benefit organizations that provide a strategic focus on children and/or those afflicted by unexpected adversity. \nFor more information, call 1-800-882-8880 or visit American's Giving webpage . 2. United Charity Miles \n(500 Miles Minimum Donation) \nUnited Airlines works with a number of charities that focus on youth, humanitarian, health, community, and military aid. There are nearly 50 charities to choose from including American Red Cross, American Cancer Society, Americares, and many more. \nCheck out the United donation page for the full list of Charities. 3. Delta Donate Miles \n(Minimum Donation Varies by Charity) \nBy donating your Delta Miles you can help children and animals in need, struggling communities, and breast cancer patients. Delta has a wide variety of wonderful charities to choose from, but each one has its own minimum donation requirement. \nWith charities in the U.S., Latin America and around the world, you can put your points where they are needed most.

Trading or Transferring Miles \nMost programs will allow you to gift miles to other users. Check with your program’s options for transferring miles. If that’s not available, there are still other ways to move your points. 5. Redeem or Transfer Miles Through Points.com \nYou can trade miles with other frequent flyers through Points.com. You can also transfer miles between frequent flyer programs, or redeem miles into Paypal credit, merchandise, dining, or gift cards. \nThis may sound a lot like bartering miles, but airlines are okay with customers using Points.com because when you trade on this site, they're collecting fees every step of the way. \nWhile it is perfectly acceptable to trade your points in at Points.com, it's definitely not the best way to redeem them. You will not get as much as your miles are worth and you will be charged hefty fees, similar to the ones that airlines charge. \nIf your miles are about to expire, or you're sure that you'll never use them, then this service could be right for you. But if you can use them on travel, you'll get much more bang for your buck. 6. Book Awards Tickets for Your Family & Friends \nTechnically this is still a grey area when it comes to frequent flyer program regulations, but it is perfectly okay to fly your friends and family using your points, if they just so happen to give you something in return at the same time, that's a complete coincidence... right? \nSpending your miles on friends and family is a great way to use miles that would otherwise expire. \nSee also: Best Credit Cards that Offer Companion Tickets The Bottom Line \nI personally have never (and will never) sell my air miles to a broker and neither should you. There are just too many risks: Ticket confiscation; Confiscation of all accumulated miles on your accounts; Strongly worded emails and accusations; Ban from rewards program. \nYou can trade in your miles, use them to help make the world a better place, or fly your family and friends around the planet for a visit. Don't ever let your points go to waste. Use Points.com or credit card donation services to ensure that you're making the most of your unused miles. \nHave you ever donated or transferred airline miles?
