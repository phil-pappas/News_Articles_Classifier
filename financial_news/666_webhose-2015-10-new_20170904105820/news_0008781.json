The non-executive director personally purchased 1.7m shares on Thursday at a price of 90.91p per share and cost him a total of nearly £1.55m. He's the latest in the long line of directors to front up cash to vouch for the mining company. \nHowever it's only a fraction of the £118m of shares that FR Galaxy Holdings, of which Macaulay is a connected person, sold up in May and June. \nDerwent London (LSE: DLN.L - news ) chief executive John Burns and executive director Simon Silver also took home a nice top up in time for the weekend, as they cashed in 43,746 and 30,000 shares respectively. \nThe company has seen steady growth in the share price over the last twelve months, and the pair took nearly £1.6m and £1.1m each to the bank. \nTop Director Buys Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) Director name: Mr William Macaulay Amount purchased: 1,700,000 @ 90.91p Value: £1,545,470 Camper & Nicholsons Marina Investments Ltd.
