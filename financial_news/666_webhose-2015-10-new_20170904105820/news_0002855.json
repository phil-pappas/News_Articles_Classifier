Among their notable purchases is the Sony Building on Madison Avenue which sold for $1.1 billion in 2013. That edifice is slated to be converted into a retail, residential and hotel site next year.\nThe two companies also jointly own a Brooklyn Hospital building in Prospect Park South and the former Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, with plans to turn those properties, as well as the former New York Telephone Co. building in Brooklyn into condos.\nNow Clipper Equity’s chief operating officer, 34 year old J.J. is working with his father David to get the IPO off the ground. He reflected on his very first project at Clipper, a Brooklyn rent-regulated complex now named Flatbush Gardens, which had over 12,000 violations and was on then Public Advocate de Blasio’s watch list for its deplorable conditions.\nAcquiring the complex was “a huge undertaking,” J.J. remarked. “There was no focus on management at the company and how everything comes together.”\nToday, nearly all the violations have been corrected, and the Bistricers are considering expanding the complex to increase the number of affordable housing units in the City. “It’s not so much that I changed,” said David, who first joined the company at the age of 24. “The business changes.”\nAt least $100 million of the proceeds will be earmarked for acquisitions and $30 million will go towards restoring existing properties.\nPhoto Caption: J.J.
