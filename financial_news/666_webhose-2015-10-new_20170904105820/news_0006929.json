James Brickwood by Jamie Freed Qantas Airways Leigh Clifford has warned that the company wants to hoard enough cash to meet the next crisis in the airline industry, even if that disappoints some investors hoping for a huge payout from the recent turnaround in the airline's fortunes.\n\"We have got to recognise this is an industry that is a cyclical industry,\" Clifford tells the AFR Weekend . \"You are not buying an annuity. We are determined to make sure we are the best performer we can be, but the economic environment, etc can impact our business and factors outside our control.\n\"The first couple of years I was here we had a couple of volcanoes, which impacted the business. So we have got to be conscious that stuff happens in the airline industry.\"\nIn the short-term, Clifford tempered expectations the airline could be preparing to return more capital to shareholders at its annual meeting next week, saying the board seriously deliberates on payouts only in tandem with its financial results in February and August.\nThe rapid improvement in Qantas' financial position, which included a $975 million underlying pre-tax profit in the year to June 30, and analyst forecasts the figure will rise to a record $1.69 billion this financial year, have led to calls for it to return more cash.\nBut Clifford says he is conscious that many investors do not like unfranked dividends. That is an issue for Qantas shareholders, given many analysts forecast it won't have enough franking credits for a franked dividend until at least the 2017 financial year.\n\"Many shareholders are quite resistant to unfranked dividends,\" Clifford says. \"We have other options on capital management and they are things we will look at at the half-year and the full-year [results]. I think we are fortunate with the current program for consideration at the AGM, as it is something that steps outside that.\"\nEffective return of equity raising At the annual meeting in Perth on Friday, Qantas will seek approval from shareholders to return $505 million of cash through a 23Â¢-a-share payment that is structured as the effective return of an equity raising it conducted during the global financial crisis.\nShareholders will not need to pay tax until they sell their shares and it will reduce the overall share base by 6.1 per cent, making it accretive to earnings per share in a similar manner to a buyback.\nQantas is unlikely to be able to repeat that structure, which points to a buyback as the most obvious alternative option.\n\"Well, that is one of the options,\" Clifford says of a buyback. \"I'm not going to be drawn beyond that.\"\nQantas' conservative cash position helped it ride out the global financial crisis and retain an investment-grade rating until late 2013, albeit at the cost of not paying dividends for six years.\nUBS analyst Simon Mitchell expects the airline could return $500 million more this financial year through a buyback and a further $1 billion the following financial year. He says each $500 million buyback could be 6 per cent accretive to earnings and take about six months to complete.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Cameron McDonald has told clients the carrier could afford to hand back up to $2.4 billion in the current financial year alone and retain $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet, historically the amount needed for it to have an investment-grade credit rating.\nQantas had $2.9 billion of cash at June 30. It lacks an investment-grade credit rating but the carrier has said it is comfortable with its balance sheet position and believes that will be recognised by the ratings agencies over time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:31.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
