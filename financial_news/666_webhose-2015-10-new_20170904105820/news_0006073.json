That’s why they’re beginning to think more cautiously about how much content to license to the streaming behemoth, and why Hulu (which is owned by media giants) is landing more big deals. But Netflix will have none of that narrative. On the company’s third quarter earnings video chat, when it reported slower-than-expected subscriber growth, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said Hulu is “much more disruptive” to the pay TV ecosystem than Netflix, The Wall Street Journal reports. He cited that Hulu now offers an ad-free version of its service, which lets people watch current seasons of broadcast network shows a day after telecasts air. Netflix generally doesn’t get content until later-- so it shouldn’t be as much of a threat, right? “Hulu is even more of a cord-cutter’s dream than Netflix is,” he said. Well, that may be a stretch, given that Netflix has about 43 million U.S. subscribers and Hulu’s ad-free service just got off the ground.\nTV TRIALS: Earlier in the week, it looked as though the broadcast TV business got some much-needed good news in that several recent big premieres exhibited big jumps in audience once delayed viewing from DVRs and video-on-demand was factored in. That’s the glass-half-full way of looking at it. Here’s the glass-half-empty way: Nielsen revealed that when it was all said and done, the total audience for broadcast TV shows during the decreasingly important premiere week was down 9% versus last year , reports CMO Today. And that drop factors in all that delayed viewing. So in other words, yes, people are watching big network series, and many of them are watching on a delayed basis. But overall, fewer people are showing up to see what NBC, CBS, ABC and Fox have to offer during a week when the big four are supposedly showcasing their best stuff, which is not good news for networks or advertisers.\nDEBATE DRAMA: The biggest thing on TV these days outside of the NFL is the presidential debates. You knew that the presence of Donald Trump--a true TV star (like him or not)--was going to boost the first two Republican debates. But did you think Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders vs. a few other long-shot candidates would deliver a big audience? CNN commanded an average of 15.3 million viewers on Tuesday night for its telecast of the debate, reports CMO Today, the biggest audience ever for a Democratic debate (which is kind of amazing, considering the last go-rounds for the Democrats featured Mrs. Clinton and then-senator Barack Obama going head to head). How fast are advertisers looking to lock in whatever ad inventory is left for the next few broadcasts, starting with the Republicans’ Round 3 on CNBC on Oct. 28?\nINSTAGAMES: While some major marketers are still a bit unsure of how much they want to advertise in mobile and social media, for mobile game companies, it’s their lifeblood. These companies, like Gree and Supercell and CrowdStar, track every dime they spend on platforms like Facebook and gauge how many people download their games onto their phones after seeing ads. More importantly, they track how much those people end up spending in those games on things like virtual goods and extra lives. So you might not expect these companies to bother with Instagram, where shots of pretty sunsets and Cobb salads rule, and where people might not be in the mood for “download to play now” ads. But game companies are quietly running ads on Instagram, and they’re having to seriously step up their creative chops, reports CMO Today. These game companies say that at least early on, Instagram’s brunch-loving crowd is delivering.\nElsewhere Twitter’s new executive chairman is a well-respected executive who helped build Google’s ad business [ WSJ ]\nA Supreme Court case about unsolicited text ads could have a big impact on class-action litigation [ CMO Today ]\nNetflix may explore getting into news content [ Variety ]\nJosh Tyrangiel, who most recently served as Bloomberg’s chief content officer, is headed to Vice News [ New York Post ]\nThe DOJ and FBI are investigating the legality of daily fantasy sports [ WSJ ]\nThe mobile payments company Square has filed to go public [ WSJ ]\nSnapchat is telling advertisers its new sponsored lenses will cost up to $700,000 a day [ BuzzFeed ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox, at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JZ420_0824NE_F_20150824182548.jpg", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/snapchat-expects-sponsored-selfie-filters-to-reach-up-to-16#.ju936A2aj", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-expresses-interest-in-expanding-into-news-programming-1201618182/", "https://twitter.com/perlberg", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/14/tyrangiel-officially-joins-vice-to-head-up-hbo-show/", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:02:03.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
