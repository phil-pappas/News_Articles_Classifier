There are about one million scheme members.\nConsumer groups and advisers have raised concerns that borrowing through super to purchase real estate is potentially risky, particularly in booming markets, and could jeopardise retirement savings if there was a default, or market crash.\nIt is likely that aggrieved property purchasers that have lost money as a result of their property purchase through Park Trent could seek compensation, according to lawyers.\nParties involved in the case have until 29 October to file submissions about final orders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:18:43.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
