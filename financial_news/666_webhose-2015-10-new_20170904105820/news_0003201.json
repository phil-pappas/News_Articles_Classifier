Jessica Shapiro by Jonathan Porter The diversity dividend, addressing the gap in retirement savings between men and women serving as role models, and using their unique communication skills with clients during economic uncertainty are just some of the reasons women should seek a career in banking and finance.\n\"We have known for some time that diverse workplaces and diverse teams outperform homogeneous teams,\" Women in Banking and Finance chief executive, Amanda Dobbie says.\n\"What is probably more interesting are the reasons,\" she says.\n\"Recent research highlights that we all perform at a higher intellectual output when we are eyeballing people who are different from us.\n\"This is not just about gender diversity, but about age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and any other difference. So there is a real economic benefit from diverse teams and inclusive cultures.\"\nShe urges more women to consider banking and finance as a career.\nKirsten MacDonald, program director at Griffith University Business School says women are attracted to banking and finance for a number of reasons.\nNumerous opportunities She says there are numerous opportunities to connect with people in client-facing roles and the ability to apply their analytical skills in a wide range of roles across personal, corporate, government and research sectors.\n\"It's fulfilling to know that you can make a contribution to lives of families, success of businesses, government policy or education of future professionals.\"\nMacDonald says more women in the industry would serve as role models and encourage women to seek financial advice to improve their retirement savings.\n\"For example, there is a gender gap in retirement savings as women lag men in seeking professional financial advice.\n\"It's great to see women of all ages and walks of life pursuing finance and financial planning degrees.\"\nShe adds that if they reach out into their communities, engagement with women and financial outcomes for women should improve over time.\n\"We also need women in banking and finance to inspire other women to get involved.\"\nRole models and mentors Role models and mentors play an important part in the development of professional identity for emerging financial professionals.\n\"This in turn improves self-efficacy and persistence in reaching goals.\"\nMacDonald says women perceive banking and finance as lacking flexibility and inclusivity as the industry has tended to be dominated by men.\nShe believes women are well-placed to assist the industry confront some of its current challenges, such as working with retail clients or businesses during periods of volatile financial market performance and dealing with the public perception of financial advisers and bankers in the wake of recent financial advice scandals.\n\"Integrity and skill will go a long way in any industry, but is especially strong in finance.\n\"Those with excellent communication and technical skills, along with a strong sense of professional ethics, will thrive no matter what the market conditions.\"\nDobbie says the sector has undergone significant regulatory changes and is beginning to experience a huge amount of technological disruption.\nSuccessful integration gains most \"Those players that successfully integrate diverse teams with an inclusive culture will stand to gain the most.\n\"Women represent 50 per cent of the population and having them represented in 50 per cent of the leadership positions in all industries is critical for long-term sustainability.\n\"We need to build capacity for meaningful, interesting work and to be able to provide adequately for our own retirements,\" Dobbie says.\nDobbie cites the statistics of women over 50 years old, living below the poverty line in Australia, as appalling and something not spoken of enough.\n\"Career breaks, disruption in careers, being underpaid compared with men and early termination from the workplace are all reasons.\"\nAccording to Dobbie, women still face challenges gaining access to the sector.\nGet established, competent \"First, one has to work very hard to get established and competent,\" she says.\n\"Developing and maintaining strategic networks is something that many women do not prioritise in their busy lives.\n\"This is something they need to understand the importance of early in their career and make time for it.\"\nShe says the mission of Women in Banking and Finance is to improve the gender balance in the banking and finance sector, particularly at leadership levels.\n\"We do this through both an education and event series,\" Dobbie says.\nThe programs range from mentoring undergraduates, to tackling voice and presentation skills.\nBespoke programs WiBF's education programs are bespoke and designed to deliver a unique experience for women, delivering skills not typically covered in many leadership courses.\n\"Our event series is designed to bring innovative and topical business discussions to our members so we assist our members to bring smart business solutions to their roles.\"\nThe Women in Banking and Finance Mentoring for Success program is now in its 11th year and becomes more and more popular, Dobbie says.\nFor Griffith University's MacDonald, the next step is e-learning.\n\"Working with researchers from different universities and industry experts increases the potential to influence product design and government policy.\n\"It's important for me to work on applied research that can make a difference to people's financial wellbeing,\" she concludes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:54:33.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
