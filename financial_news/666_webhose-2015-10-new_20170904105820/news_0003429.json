U.S. stock index futures indicated a lower open on Thursday, with traders looking to the release of Fed minutes. \nU.S. stock index futures indicated a lower open on Thursday, with traders looking to the release of the Federal Open Market Committee's minutes for its September meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET. \n\nAlthough the minutes won't reflect the central bank's view on last Friday's weaker-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report, analysts said they will be watching to see how much the Fed was concerned about conditions overseas, particularly in China. \nMany market analysts expected the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade at its September meeting. The central bank's decision to hold off on a hike caused great uncertainty in markets about the Fed's view on domestic and global economic conditions. \n\nOn the data front, weekly jobless claims declined to 263,000 , a near 42-year low. \nOn the earnings front, Domino's Pizza ( DPZ ) reported results that missed on both the top and bottom line. Alcoa ( AA ) , Helen of Troy ( HELE ) and Ruby Tuesday ( RT ) are all due after the bell. \nRead More Early movers: COST, DPZ, CC, SHAK, EMC, BMR, MCD, LL, DB & more \n\nIn oil markets, Brent crude (Intercontinental Exchange Europe: @LCO.1) traded at around $51.64 a barrel, up 0.6 percent, while U.S. crude (New York Mercantile Exchange: @CL.1) was at around $48.17 a barrel, up 0.75 percent. \nIn Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index ( ^STOXX ) was flat on Thursday. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei (Nihon Kenzai Shinbun: .N225) finished 0.99 percent lower. Mainland Chinese markets reopened after a week-long holiday, with the Shanghai Composite (Shanghai Stock Exchange: .SSEC) closing 3.0 percent higher. \nâ€”CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report. \nCorrection: An previous version misstated the length of time since the previous record on weekly jobless claims.
