Bloomberg by Alan Mitchell Did you notice the dog that didn't bark?\nThe International Monetary Fund has again downgraded its forecasts of global growth and says 2015 will be the weakest year since the global financial crisis.\nThe slowdown is centred on the emerging market economies that are struggling with the end of global credit boom compounded, in the case of commodity producers, with falling export prices.\nBut among all the downward revisions and pronouncements of deep recession there is one emerging market economy forecast that remains unchanged. It is that of China.\nChina, whose bursting share bubble and depreciating currency have had global markets in turmoil, is still forecast by the IMF grow by 6.8 per cent this year and 6.3 per cent in 2016, which is what it has been forecasting all this year.\nWhat's going on?\nThe emerging conventional wisdom is that fears about China have been overdone.\nAccording to the American economist, Nicholas Lardy, the Chinese economy actually has been on a fairly stable footing.\n \"The growth model has changed. The service sector is now the driver of growth,\" he says.\n\"So the fact that industrial growth has slowed down quite a bit does not mean, as it would have meant 10 years ago, that the economy is falling off a cliff.\"\nStill there is no denying that the risks attached to the Chinese outlook have increased and that confidence in the economic management of the Chinese authorities has been shaken.\nToo early for a verdict Angel Ubide, a Spanish economist who, like Lardy, is associated with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says it still is too early to issue a verdict.\n\"The problem is that China needs multi-dimensional reforms. China is undergoing multiple transitions from industry to services, from investment to consumption, from external demand to domestic demand, from large state enterprises to the private sector, all while reducing its very high level of debt: a labyrinth of transformations that is impossible to manage without making mistakes and while guaranteeing a stable rate of growth.\"\nThe IMF says the risk of a severe downturn in China in the near term is still low, but that the vulnerabilities – the levels of public and private debt, the inflated asset prices, the declining efficiency of investment, the oversupply of housing – are continuing to rise despite the government's reforms.\nThe objective now is to reduce those vulnerabilities while maintaining reasonable rates of growth. Growth is a critical part of the economic cure as well as a political imperative.\nWhile China's slowdown so far is in line with the IMF's earlier projections, its economy has to slow to a more sustainable rate in the medium term. No country can keep growing on over investment.\nAccording to the IMF analysis, another two years of the current near 7 per cent growth would require another substantial increase in investment and debt.\nBut that slowdown should be seen as investment in continuing future growth.\nThat's the soft-landing scenario, although economists warn us to expect a good deal of volatility. The transition will not be seamless. It will be marked by policy mistakes and financial market miscalculations. But the Chinese government has the foreign reserves and the fiscal capacity to navigate the transition.\nThe bigger problem will be if China's leaders are not prepared to accept the slower growth consistent with reducing the economic risks.\nPolitical risk avoided Slower growth is politically risky when the ruling Communist Party regards strong growth as essential for its survival.\nThe unemployment rate remains at a low 4 per cent, but that probably is not sustainable. Nor is it necessarily indicative of the level of popular satisfaction.\nEconomists say the low unemployment rate is partly due to labour hoarding by the state owned enterprises and rural migrant workers retreating from the cities back to underemployment and rural poverty.\nChinese and IMF economists have been urging Chinese governments to curb the over-investment and accept lower, more sustainable growth targets since 2013.\nThe government reluctantly accepted 7 per cent growth this year. But the question is, will it accept growth slowing to 6 per cent next year.\nSo, we come to the IMF's hard-landing scenario.\n\"In this case, the authorities would use their policy space to prevent growth from slowing by shoring up investment through credit and public resources,\" the IMF says.\n\"Vulnerability from booming credit and investment would continue to increase, and policy space would shrink. This could mean a sharper growth slowdown in the medium term when the vulnerabilities would be more difficult to manage\".\nSo, investors beware: in these circumstances, the symptoms can suggest the very opposite of the true prognosis.\nSlowing growth can indicate the \"soft landing\" and continuing prosperity that everyone wants, while rapid growth driven by a renewed acceleration of debt and investment may lead to disaster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:03:23.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
