It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) roasts high-quality coffee in the UK and guarantees nationwide next-day delivery, growing 11pc per month, according to founder Stephen Rapoport. \n“We’re not interested in building a small lifestyle business,” he said. “We want to change the very nature of one of the largest commodity businesses in the world.” \nMind Candy has seen sales flag over the past three years but the relaunch of Moshi Monsters and new game World of Warriors, which has made £4m so far, may prop up future revenues. \n“I’ve made lots of mistakes before but I will hopefully do it without the mistakes this time,” said Ms Knowles. “Pact has had lots of success already, which I will build on.” \nMs Knowles will oversee Pact as it grows from 50 people to 500, Mr Rapoport said. “We need like professionals like Divinia in the business. We can really draw on her experience selling multiple products in multiple markets.” \nPact has spent the last 18 months designing a new Nespresso-compatible coffee capsule to help the speciality coffee start-up generate mainstream appeal . “We’ve been iterating different roasts and grinds to make it the best on the planet,” Mr Rapoport said, adding that the final product was “95pc there”. \n“We need to be 1,000 times our current size to make an impact on the market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:47:48.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
