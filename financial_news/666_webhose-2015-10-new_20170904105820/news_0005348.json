That lessened the need for the ECB to ramp up its 1 trillion euro asset purchase programme, this week at least.\nSeparately, current account data from the euro zone showed portfolio inflows continued at a brisk pace, a factor that has been supporting the euro in recent months.\n\"This latest release (of the lending survey) should give the ECB's Governing Council a little more breathing space as it continues to assess the broader recovery picture,\" said Timo del Carpio, an economist at RBC Capital Markets.\nThe euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.1385, recovering from a 10-day low struck on Monday. It had started to edge up after ECB governing council member Christian Noyer said late on Monday the European Central Bank's quantitative easing programme was well calibrated and did not need to be adjusted, following similar words from Austrian central bank chief Ewald Nowotny.\nNowotny had pointed to the need to look at further ways to stimulate a still struggling euro zone economy, and major banks including Barclays and Goldman Sachs started this week by calling for the euro to weaken into Thursday's meeting.\n\"The Noyer comments are important,\" said a senior trader at one international bank in London.\n\"It does seem as if they're trying to back the market away from thinking there's going to be another easing announcement. The market is still short, and it will probably need a push up to $1.15 to burn those guys out.\"\nLOONIE FINE-TUNING\nThe Canadian dollar, a big loser on Monday ahead of election results that gave a shock victory to Liberal leader Justin Trudeau over Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives, was back in positive territory in European trade.\nThe senior trader said the market had judged any selling on concerns that Trudeau's centre-left was promising to overspend was overdone, and indeed that anything that gets the Canadian economy going could be seen positively.\n\"I'm not one of these believers in selling a currency just because a left-leaning government has come in,\" said the trader.\n\"At this stage, putting a bit more into the country fiscally may not be the worst idea. I'm not in the (Canadian) dollar at the moment but for me, if anything this morning it's a buy.\" (Additional reporting by Anirban Nag ; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:30:48.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
