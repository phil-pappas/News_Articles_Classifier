Photo: Arsineh Houspian\nInsurance comparison website Compare The Market has secured one of Australia's largest private health insurers, Bupa, as one of its key partners for the next year which will see the insurance aggregator exclusively sell the insurer's policies online to clients.\nCompare The Market, which appointed former iSelect chief executive Matt McCann as its CEO earlier this year, secured Bupa as its cornerstone partner for at least the next 12 months.\nOur challenge becomes creating a better customer service and that's the area we're investing in now.\nMatt McCann The deal means consumers will be able to compare how Bupa's health insurance policies stack up against other providers on its website. The partnership is a win for Compare The Market, which faces stiff competition from companies such as iSelect, Choosi and Canstar.\n\"Having them as a cornerstone partner is a really big step forward for us. In the past 18 months it's been very much in a trial capacity, they have been testing [the service],\" Mr McCann said. \"That shift from trial to cornerstone partner is a very important one for us.\"\nAdvertisement \"Bupa's decision to extend our previous agreement builds on the good relationship with Compare The Market, and ensures that we are represented alongside other health insurers when consumers make web-based enquiries about health insurance,\" a Bupa spokesman said.\nBupa will join other private health insurers such as Australian Unity, ahm Health Insurance, and Budget Direct Health on the Compare The Market panel.\nFuture priorities Mr McCann said one of his biggest priorities in the immediate future was to ramp up the group's customer service and infrastructure. The company is looking to recruit more people, and has added iSelect alumni including Jo Thomas and Trevor Jeffords respectively as Compare The Market's chief operating officer and general counsel.\nMs Thomas was previously the operations director at iSelect, while Mr Jeffords was general counsel. Joining Mr McCann are Steven Tassone and Tony Laing, who were respectively sales and operations manager, and head of analytics at iSelect.\nMr Tassone is now general manager sales and operations while Mr Laing is general manager of data science at Compare The Market.\n\"Our challenge becomes creating a better customer service and that's the area we're investing in now,\" Mr McCann said.\n\"We are committed to building trust for both CTM and the comparison industry as a whole, which will result in benefits for all. Consumers will get a better deal on their insurance needs, and our product providers will get access to bigger markets as more people use our services,\" Mr McCann said.\nMr McCann resigned from iSelect four months after the comparison website's disappointing public float in 2013.\nHe started his new role in May and took over from managing director George Meligonis who continues as an executive in Auto & General, a sister company to Compare The Market.\nDisappointing debut Mr McCann was consulting with insurance company clients in the UK and South Africa after leaving iSelect. The company made a disappointing debut in 2013 when its share price plunged from its $1.85 start to $1.56 after investors dumped more than 11 per cent of the stock.\nThe corporate regulator launched an investigation into the company for potential breaches of the Corporation Act following the IPO. Mr McCann left iSelect after disagreeing with the aggregator's board about the direction of the company's growth strategy.\n\"The [insurance aggregator] sector has grown quite substantially in the past two years as people's awareness to review all types of insurance increased,\" he told The Australian Financial Review at the time of his appointment at Compare The Market.\n\"You've got above-average increases in premiums, and affordability is a critical issue for insurers. We want to take this business from a strong challenger brand to compete with market leaders.\"\nThe company's share price has since recovered to close at $1.56 on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:26:38.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
