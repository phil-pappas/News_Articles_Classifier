They are due to rule by Jan. 13.\nAnalysts doubt regulators will block the deal, although in 2013 the Commission blocked a takeover of TNT by United Parcel Service.\nHowever, a FedEx-TNT merger would still make it only the third-largest express delivery company in Europe, behind UPS and DHL, a unit of Deutsche Post.
