FDC by Trevor Sykes Gina Rinehart and her fractured family will benefit when Roy Hill comes on stream, but subcontractors on the job are suffering. However, NRW Holdings is finally seeing a ray of light in its long, costly battle with Samsung C&T of Korea.\nThe battle has been a disaster for NRW shareholders – including my super fund – who have watched its share price be trashed from $2 in early 2013 to 9¢ a few days ago. Their cold consolation is that the losses being suffered by Samsung look even larger.\nThe conflict with NRW – and several other battles being fought by Samsung – all relate to the Roy Hill iron ore project. The 55-million-tonnes-a-year project was due to be completed at the end of September but Samsung C&T, as the lead contractor, didn't make the deadline.\nSamsung was given a grace period, which is due to expire at the end of October. My spies in the Pilbara say Samsung has 1500 workers billeted at Mount Newman and has been bussing them 80 kilometres to Roy Hill and back every day in a desperate effort to finish the contract on time. If the work slips into November the penalties will be about $56 million a month.\nRoy Hill is 70 per cent-owned by Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd, with the remaining 30 per cent held by Marubeni Corporation of Japan, China Steel Corporation of Taiwan and Posco. Samsung won the contract in 2013 with a bid of $US5.8 billion ($7.9 billion), which cannot be varied.\nPosco, like Samsung, is one of Korea's mighty chaebols and presumably has an excellent knowledge of the project, yet it appears to have been well beaten in the tendering. The gossip in Western Australia is that Samsung made a cheap bid a lot less than the nearest competitor, and is facing a loss of up to $1 billion on the job.\nDealing brutally It could be a symptom of Samsung's desperation that the company has been dealing brutally with its subcontractors. It Samsung seemed to have been meeting their claims for work in progress until early in 2015, when it changed suddenly.\n Since about February, Samsung has been refusing to pay subcontractors, on the grounds that the work was unsatisfactory, or wrongly invoiced, or whatever. It has had disputes with Thiess, Leighton, McConnell Dowell and Central Systems.\nTypically, Samsung will refuse to pay a subcontractor's claim, forcing it to take the claim to adjudication. If the subcontractor succeeds, Samsung will then appeal the adjudicator's determination in court. It appears to be deliberately forcing its subcontractors to either settle for less than they are owed, or face expensive and time-consuming legal battles to get their money.\nThe only alternative for most subcontractors is to take their claim to arbitration in Singapore, but that would probably be an even longer and more expensive process.\nOne well-publicised dispute was between Samsung and the global engineering group Laing O'Rourke, which was installing piping, electrical and instruments for the mine, as well as car dumpers, conveyers and transfer stations. After a dispute, Laing O'Rourke lost the contract in February and had to lay off 200 workers.\nNRW's main contract was to build the 344-kilometre railway line connecting the mine to Port Hedland. The line was completed in April and has trains running on it, but Samsung is still refusing to pay NRW. The dispute became public last week, when Justice Robert Mitchell, in the Western Australia Supreme Court, handed down a judgment granting NRW leave to pursue enforcement against Samsung for claims totalling $26 million.\nThe judgment revealed that Samsung still owed NRW $93 million, including a $30 million insurance bond. To put that in perspective, NRW shares hit a low of 9¢ early in October, at which price their market capitalisation was $25 million. Following the judgment, they bounced to 14¢. Nice to see a small recovery, but the company has been badly damaged by the contract, and by Samsung.\nTrevor Sykes has an interest in NRW Mining shares.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:51:41.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
