Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) there appears to a similar facility producing UK bank chief executives. It’s called JP Morgan. \nJohn McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , looks set to offer the bank’s top job to Jes Staley , who worked at JP Morgan for over three decades before he quit in 2012 to join the hedge fund BlueMountain Capital Management. \nIf confirmed, and subject to regulatory approval, Staley will become the second JP Morgan “alum” to take charge of a UK bank in a matter of months. In June, Bill Winters, who was Staley's predecessor at the top of JP Morgan’s investment bank, took over from Peter Sands as the chief executive of Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) . Tushar Morzaria, the finance chief at Barclays, also came off the JP Morgan conveyor belt. \nThat the US banking giant produces so many executives with the ability to take on these top jobs is a testament both to its model and the longevity of its boss Jamie Dimon. \nJP Morgan was one of the few banks in the world to sail through the credit crunch relatively unscathed (although it did suffer a mild case of dyspepsia after swallowing Bear Stearns). It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has also held firm to its belief in universal banking offering most things to most clients in most countries even after that model fell out of vogue and came under regulatory pressure. Such strategic consistency is one of the reasons JP Morgan is now the biggest lender in the US by assets. It also means that senior executives can circulate around the firm, gaining broad experience by running different arms; Staley’s time heading up both the asset management and the investment banking divisions is a case in point. \nPart of the reason JP Morgan’s top lieutenants swap seats and then leave is the immovable object blocking their route to the top job: Dimon, who reigns supreme as chief executive, president and chairman. Both Winters and Staley were at one time touted as possible pretenders to the throne. But, as Dimon has never shown any inclination towards abdication, they ended up seeking new worlds to conquer. \nIt is tempting to discern a clear pattern in the backgrounds of the last three chief executives of Barclays: an investment banker from Boston (Bob (Shanghai: 601169.SS - news ) Diamond), replaced by a retail banker from Stoke-on-Trent (Antony Jenkins), who is now about to be replaced by an investment banker from Boston (Staley). \nIt made sense for the bank to enter a period of penitence following the Libor scandal, which culminated in the defenestration of Diamond; the hair shirt suited St. Antony. But that didn’t alter the fact that investment banking is still a huge part of the business, albeit one with a return on equity of just 2.7pc last year (compared to the 12pc bar that Jenkins had said each part of the bank must clear in order to prove its worth). \nStaley, should it be him, will certainly have to lay out a clear vision for the division. At the half-year results in July, McFarlane said merely that there was a “refined plan” for the investment bank , which had shown “ongoing improvements”. Staley will hopefully be less coy, not least because many shareholders are unlikely to be hugely enamoured by the prospect of a renewed emphasis on investment banking. \nThe American will also have to explain how Barclays plans to tackle America. The US capital markets are wider and deeper than those in Europe and the fees that can be earned there are fatter. No international firm is better placed than Barclays to crack investment banking’s Promised Land thanks to the UK bank’s acquisition of the domestic operations of Lehman Brothers in 2008. But there remains a them-and-US attitude at the firm with many of the New York-based bankers never quite shaking off the Lehman identity or attitude. \nThe investment bank presents other conundrums that Jenkins never quite solved. How do you shrink assets and raise capital while maintaining the scale necessary to compete with the likes of JP Morgan? How do you hold on to expensive investment bankers while also trying to cut costs? Should you continue to focus on your core strength of fixed income (especially with traditional European rivals like UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) and Deutsche Bank apparently scaling back ) or accept that new rules have made irrevocably wrecked the economics of the business? \nStaley will also have to deal other regulations that will require the separation of the firm’s retail and investment banking operations. No UK bank faces a bigger threat from these so-called “ringfencing” rules than Barclays. \nBut the presumptive new CEO isn’t just an investment banker. And the broader experience that he gained at JP Morgan will be needed to solve other problems Barclays faces. Many of the largest global banks have big asset management operations or custody arms. The former provides a captive audience to whom the bank can sell a range of services; the latter extends the range of services into boring but important things like clearing, settlement and fund administration the increasingly important plumbing services of the financial markets. \nUBS, for example, manages nearly $2 trillion in its wealth unit; BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) has nearly $9 trillion in assets under custody; JP Morgan has both. Barclays, thanks to the sale of Barclays Global Investors in 2009, has neither (actually it has a wealth management arm but it’s a 10th the size of UBS’s). \nStaley is, thanks to his time at JP Morgan, well aware what makes a good universal bank tick. He will need all of that experience to either turn Barclays into one or work out how to split it up. \nben.wright@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:02:24.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
