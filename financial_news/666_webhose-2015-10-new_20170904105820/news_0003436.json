The changes will result in 265 job losses at its headquarters and corporate functions, and Hudson's Bay will incur a charge of $20m in the third quarter of 2015 related to the realignment. \nNonetheless, Hudson's Bay says the initiatives are designed to enable the business to invest greater resources in the areas of the business offering the most significant return on investment potential, while leveraging strengths across its retail banners and increasing efficiencies. \n\"By enabling our teams to work smarter, faster and more effectively, we expect to achieve substantial cost savings and continue to invest in our core strategies to build our business, drive further improved financial performance and support the long-term vision of HBC,” explains CEO Jerry Storch. \nSeparately, Canadian retail group Hudson's Bay has completed its EUR2.5bn (US$2.8bn) acquisition of Galeria Holding , operator of Germany’s Galeria Kaufhof department store chain and Belgium’s only department store, Galeria Inno.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:00:54.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
