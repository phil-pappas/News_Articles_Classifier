Hurricanes can bring especially costly damage as they batter roofs, windows and landscaping.

While inspecting the roof, look for tree branches that could cause damage during a storm and have them removed.\nIf costs are a concern, The Federal Savings Bank suggests looking into a home equity line of credit for longer term payment. Home equity lines of credit are often used for payment of home repairs or improvements. The rates on these loans are just as affordable in terms of a rate as a purchase loans.\nBracing for wind\nOne should help fragile doors and windows withstand heavy winds by installing shutters, roof clips and garage door braces. This is especially crucial for areas that frequently see hurricanes or other wind storms, such as tornados, which can cause wind gusts of up to 200 miles per hour. Florida, Southern Georgia, and South Carolina are perfect examples of high wind areas.\nWhether customer, reality, or trusted referral source, The Federal Savings Bank understands how important every purchase or refinance transaction is to help our clients optimize the purchase or refinance of their home.", "external_links": ["http://t1947869.omkt.co/track.aspx?id=402|1DB8DD|E52C|0|2C5|0|450|1|67CF81E4&destination=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thefederalsavingsbank.com&dchk=E082074", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy50aGVmZWRlcmFsc2F2aW5nc2JhbmsuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:41:30.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
