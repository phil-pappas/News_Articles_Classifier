He has featured with A R Rahman and virtuoso singer Rashid Ali in the rebooted unplugged version of the song ' Kabhi kabhi aditi '.\nSays Arjun, \" One word I use to describe my approach to music is explorer . I believe we all discover music in our own way and I try and use composition, arrangement, production, lyrics, vocals et al as tools to document the same.\"\nAbout his sound, he says, \"I like trying to convey ideation through my music, and my effort is to ensure my sound always has something new for a listener to discover each time they hear a piece.\" Arjun is excited about an upcoming release with KK. He says, \"It's a track I've written lyrics, arranged composed programmed and designed. New territory is a tough realm without people believing in your vision. The support KK sir lent to this track has been a humbling experience.\"\nA special moment has been the reception that Voctronica's version of Fitzpleasure received because, \"a lot of people I look up to, who know sound gave it a thumbs up, and having mixed it, it was certainly a big moment for me.\"\nAsk him what he likes about being on stage and he says, \"To go up on stage and put up your heart on display, if you're in a band then you be the best you can be for and to your band on stage, and if alone, you owe the crowd that much more. The only primary difference needs to be understanding the concept of 'less is more' when playing with others. It's about the unit, and one vision in the performance.\"\nArjun always keeps in mind the first reason he quit everything to pursue music is expression. The learning never stops, neither does the imagination. \"Hopefully, the world will have room for a dreamer, and I'm sure each person hopes to stay content with their constantly evolving definitions of success.\"\nFor latest Music updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Music news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Music news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Music updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:33:42.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
