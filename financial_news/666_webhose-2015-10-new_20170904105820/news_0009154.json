The Trepp CMBS Delinquency Rate fell 17 basis points in September, which is the largest single-month improvement in the last 12 months. The delinquency rate for US commercial real estate loans in CMBS is now 5.28%, down 47 basis points year-to-date. Compared to the year-ago level of 6.03%, the rate is down 75 basis points.\nIn August, $1.4 billion in CMBS loans became newly delinquent, bringing total delinquencies to $27.5 billion. About $700 million in loans were cured last month while loans that were previously delinquent but paid off either at par or with a loss totaled over $1.3 billion.\n“After negligible rate movement during the summer months, the CMBS delinquency rate’s slow march downward continued in September,” said Joe McBride, Research Associate at Trepp. “We still expect an uptick in delinquencies in the near future as the brunt of peak era maturities come due, but the Fed’s rate hike procrastination should push off an increase. If rates stay lower for longer, borrowers will refinance more easily with higher DSCRs all else equal. ”\nThe percentage of seriously delinquent loans, defined as 60+ days delinquent, in foreclosure, REO, or non-performing balloons, decreased along with the overall delinquency rate. The rate of seriously delinquent loans dropped 13 basis points to 5.15% in August. If defeased loans were removed from Trepp’s delinquency calculation, the 30-day delinquency rate would be 5.58%.\nBy property type, delinquencies for all but one of the five major sectors descended in September. Industrial loans posted the largest month-over-month rate improvement, falling 144 basis points to 6.18%. While multifamily remains the worst performing major property type, the delinquency rate for the sector plunged 79 basis points to 8.20%. The only property type to weaken month-over-month was retail, as delinquencies jumped 20 basis points to 5.73%.\nFor additional details, such as delinquency status and historical comparisons, download the August 2015 US CMBS Delinquency Infographic at http://info.trepp.com/september-2015-cmbs-delinquency-infographic .
