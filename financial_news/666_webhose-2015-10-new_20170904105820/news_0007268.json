The PayAnywhere Mobile reader, which was launched in August, is the first and only mobile credit card reader on the market to accept all three forms of contactless payments. The reader is available in Apple Stores nationwide and at apple.com. For individuals and businesses of all sizes who want to accept contactless payments, PayAnywhere is the optimal solution – merchants can cater to how their customers want to pay, whether it be cash, credit, or contactless. PayAnywhere turns an Android phone or tablet, iPhone, or iPad into a mobile POS system that accepts all major credit cards, including Android Pay and Samsung Pay transactions, for one rate with no setup or monthly fees. It also offers merchants robust features and functionality, including a seamless checkout experience, faster funding, real-time reporting and live customer service..\nIn addition to Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay and other contactless payments, PayAnywhere also accepts traditional magnetic stripe credit cards, and is EMV-capable. PayAnywhere is optimized for the following Android phones, but can also work on other Android phones with NFC capabilities:\nPhones:\n Google Nexus 5 HTC One M8 LG G3 Motorola Droid Razr HD Samsung Galaxy S3 Samsung Galaxy S4 Samsung Galaxy S5 Samsung Galaxy Note 3\nTablets:\n Google Nexus 9 Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 - 8\" Verizon Ellipsis 8\nPayAnywhere has also been optimized for the following Samsung Pay-ready Samsung Galaxy devices:\n Galaxy S6 Galaxy S6 edge Galaxy S6 edge+ Galaxy Note 5\nApple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay are not only more convenient for customers to use, they can also be safer and more secure than using cash, credit, or debit cards. Contactless payments generate a one-time-use virtual account number for each transaction, which keeps the customer’s credit and debit account details safe. The payment details are not stored or shared, providing peace of mind for customers. Additionally, all three allow for remote device lock, password change, or personal data deletion, should the device ever get lost or stolen.\n“North American Bancard strives to be at the forefront of the payments industry, and when we first introduced our PayAnywhere mobile payments solution, there was nothing like it. Again today, we are leading the way with our new NFC reader,” said Marc Gardner, founder, president and CEO of North American Bancard. “We are thrilled that PayAnywhere is the first mobile reader on the market that allows merchants to accept Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Apple Pay. This speaks to the innovation and ingenuity of our company, and our never-ending quest to provide the most advanced, cutting-edge products and services for our merchants.”\nPayAnywhere is available in Apple Stores and online at http://www.apple.com . The device retails for $39.95, and the PayAnywhere Mobile app is free in the Google Play and App Stores.\nFor more information on Android Pay, visit: https://www.android.com/pay/ .
