Is Pleased to Present Its Current Position in the Digital Currency Arena \nNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Oct 26, 2015) - Costas Inc. ( OTC PINK : CSSI ) Costas Inc. (CSSI) or \"Costas\" has focused over the last year and invested heavily in Distributed Asset Technology; \"DAT\" is the systemic foundation to what is now known as Digital Currency \"DC\". DC has taken the world by storm and created a new class of asset. Quite simply, the world economy has evolved from gold and silver as the only accepted form of payment to paper currency and now DC has started to weave itself into the fabric of our global economy. \nThe public generally associates DC with the market's preferred digital coin, Bitcoin. Bitcoin and its peers, have fascinating properties that Costas strongly believes will accelerate the speed at which a store of value can move regionally and/or globally. Decentralized currency without borders is now a viable option for consumers. DC and the institutions that bridge the gap between merchants, consumers and investors stand to capitalize exponentially as investment floods into the space. \nThere are very few opportunities in the realm of DC available to investors through public markets. Investment in the space, to most, is out of reach apart from purchasing DC coins. Costas intends to create a portfolio of diverse DC businesses under its umbrella. Costas will offer a unique opportunity to invest in a cross-section of companies in what The Company believes is the most exciting investment vehicle made available in the realm of Distributed Asset Technology. Through the acquisition of Authentatrade, Costas now has a foundation to build out the balance of its plan, as the management and platform of Authentatrade furthers The Company's reach into global markets. Costas, through Authentatrade, is now regionally positioned in the heart of the Digital Currency revolution. \nCostas will acquire companies in full, or a take a significant position in a variety of companies, then facilitate their growth. Costas is also open to creating businesses by putting capable people together, giving them an equity stake and capitalizing them. In the event that there is no pre-existing company with whom to partner, Costas would create its own company to fill that investment vacuum. We are actively searching for strong innovative leaders with an entrepreneurial spirit to either join our board of directors or to offer their services to targets we are looking to acquire and thereby incentivizing them to partner with Costas. \nCostas, through its relationships, has the ability to raise capital for the companies it chooses to acquire or create. The management at Costas has built relationships with investment groups that focus on funding, incubating and growing potential business ventures. This network spans the globe and truly has very few limits. We feel confident we can pair any opportunity with the appropriate funds and management, preparing them for their entry into any competitive market. \n2015 has been a huge year for Digital Currency as billions of dollars have flooded into the space.
