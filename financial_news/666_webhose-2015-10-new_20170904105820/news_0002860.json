While Dodd-Frank did add 35,000 pages and over 38 million words to Uncle Sam's financial industry regulatory \"to do\" list, the evidence that it's cut consumer banking fees is less clear. Take bank checking overdraft fees. According to a brand new study by Pew Charitable Trusts of 50 major U.S. banks, more than 80% of them still charge fees on ATM and debit card-triggered overdrafts, earning those banks 400% more in revenue than the limited number of banks that don't charge those fees. 67% of banks charge a healthy sum for each overdraft, between $35 and $38 per overdraft, and each $1 charged by banks on such fees translates into a 6% uptick in overall draft fee revenue. Banks better be careful, Pew says - as normal banking customers are getting so fed up with fees they're leaving the banking system in favor of other financial savings, borrowing and investing models. \"[Our] research has shown that many of the largest U.S. banks engage in practices that increase costly debit card overdraft fees, although some have voluntarily opted not to do so,\" says Pew in its report . \"Overdraft fees are a major reason that many checking account holders exit the banking system, which reduces their access to lower-cost, mainstream financial services and puts them at greater risk of loss or theft of their funds.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:11:39.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
