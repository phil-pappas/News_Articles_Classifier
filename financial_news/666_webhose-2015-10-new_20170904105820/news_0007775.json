In this regard, management and staff of the company have designed innovative, insightful and fun ways to drum-up public awareness throughout the month of October. \nLast year Airtel Ghana supported The Sweden Ghana Medical Cancer Foundation and The Judith Ellen Awuah Darko Foundation with cash donations raised through employee donations. This year Airtel employees are embarking on a social media campaign dubbed Airtel Cares - a call to action for employees, customers and Ghanaians in general to be assertive in the awareness and prevention of breast cancer in Ghana. Airtel Cares will run throughout the month of October. \nHannah Agbozo, Airtel's Legal and Corporate Affairs Director said, \"Airtel is a company devoted to the well-being of its employees and the development of meaningful initiatives around the needs of customers and the communities we operate in. This makes our support for breast cancer awareness such a great fit for the business and we're delighted to be building on our support from previous years, to reach our employees and customers alike with the important message of early detection\". \nShe continued, saying, \"this month of October, we at Airtel are making a change in the lives of many, by fighting breast cancer. We are thinking pink, buying pink, donating pink and wearing pink every Friday this October and together we will win this fight because Airtel truly cares. To be part of this exciting campaign follow us on Facebook at Airtelghana and twitter @airtelghana to add your voice.\" \nThis year, all funds raised internally from the campaign will be donated to an establishment to support the course.
