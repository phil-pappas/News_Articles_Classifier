The Defined Access Isa (Issue 3) is a best buy, while the One Year Fixed Rate Isa offers a competitive rate. \n• Leeds Building Society launches 'unique' escalator savings bond \n• How to achieve a £31,600 tax-free retirement income \nVirgin’s Defined Access Isa is the top-paying easy-access account on the market with a rate of 1.56pc. However, the rate drops to a mere 0.75pc if customers need access to their funds more than three times in a year. \nThe Isa is designed to appeal to customers who don’t need regular access to their savings, but have access without notice if needed. \nVirgin Money has also launched a second product in its savings range, which is a strong contender but not a quite a best buy. \nThe One Year Fixed Rate Isa offers a competitive rate of 1.81pc. \nThis rate is beaten by the market-leading 12-Month Fixed Term Cash Isa from Al Rayan Bank, which pays 1.9pc on a minimum deposit of £1,000. \nHowever, in line with Sharia principles, Al Rayan doesn’t strictly speaking pay interest, instead it pays customers an \"expected profit rate\", which Al Rayan claims always to achieve. \nVirgin Money’s fixed rate Isa is also beaten by Shawbrook Bank, which offers 1.85pc on its One-Year Fixed Rate Cash Isa Bond (Issue 8). But the account requires a hefty minimum £5,000 deposit. \nVirgin Money’s 1.81pc is the third best rate on the market and requires a balance of only £1. Customers can transfer money from existing Isas and can make additional deposits within 30 days of opening the account. \nRachel Springall, a financial expert at Moneyfacts said: “Savers who have a small amount to put away, even to start at just £1, and who have yet to take advantage of their tax-free Isa allowance can achieve a decent return with Virgin Money’s one-year fixed Isa paying 1.81pc. \n\"Savers would have up to 30 days from opening the account to add additional funds, but as it is a fixed Isa any withdrawals before the year is up will result in a penalty of 60 days’ loss of interest. \n“If savers want an Isa as their emergency savings pot, then Virgin Money also offers a Defined Access saver and pays a top easy-access rate of 1.56pc from as little as £1. However, as the name suggests the access to funds is limited to three withdrawals per year and only 0.75pc is paid for the remainder of the year if that limit is breached. So it’s worth keeping this in mind at the outset and making a note of any withdrawals made.” \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nHave a question for our experts?
