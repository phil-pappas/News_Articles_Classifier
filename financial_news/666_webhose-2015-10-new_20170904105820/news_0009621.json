Paychex stock, now around $47, climbed almost 4% after its results were released. \nNot only did the Rochester, N.Y.-based company beat Wall Street's earnings projections for its fiscal 2016 first quarter , Paychex offered a business outlook that suggests it plans on taking market share from its competitors. Paychex has now beaten earnings estimates in nine of the last 10 quarters. And investors with a long-term perspective would do well to ignore Paychex's premium stock price and focus on the value the company is building. \nThe 45-year-old company provides payroll processing , human resource services, insurance and benefits outsourcing services for roughly 600 thousand small- to medium-sized businesses. These services helped Paychex earn 58 cents a share in the just-ended quarter. It's enough to beat analysts' estimates of 51 cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the company earned 47 cents a share.
