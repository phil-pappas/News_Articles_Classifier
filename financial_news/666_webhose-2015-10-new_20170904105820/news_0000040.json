The watchdog announced in July that it was examining ways of boosting competition to drive down fares. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also comes as Virgin and Stagecoach face the threat of open-access competition on the East Coast between London and Edinburgh. \nWhile open-access operators already run services on parts of the main line, Virgin Trains, the consortium of Stagecoach and Virgin, currently has the monopoly on the London to Edinburgh route. However, FirstGroup (LSE: FGP.L - news ) and Alliance Rail have both submitted open-access proposals to offer rival services. \nA decision from the Office of Rail and Road is due by the end of the year. \n“The current confused and damaging mix of both open-access services and franchised networks does not provide a level playing field, with biased track access and ticketing regimes,” Stagecoach and Virgin said. \n“This hybrid 'cherry-picking’ arrangement offers poor value for money for taxpayers, is an inefficient use of network capacity and, at worst, risks franchise failure.” * Questor share tip: Stagecoach has a chance to pick up steam They argued that revenue growth from the East Coast had been “significantly lower” than other comparable franchises over the past 15 years because of open-access operators. \nInstead, the two companies have called for a new licensing system to be introduced on inter-city routes that would involve bidding for bundles of so-called “train paths” in an auction that would be “based on a nationally agreed capacity statement”. \nA train path is the infrastructure capacity required for a train to run between two locations in a given time-period. Virgin and Stagecoach offered to run a pilot on the East Coast, West Coast or Great Western (Other OTC: GWMCF - news ) lines. \n“It would allow for multiple operators to compete on a route on a level playing field,” they said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:00:24.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
