Photo: iStock\nA national database of payday loans should be established and laws tightened to ensure payday lenders more carefully assess vulnerable borrowers, a timely report from the Australian Centre for Financial Studies has said.\nBut with a review of the maligned sector due to be delivered to Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer by the end of the year, the ACFS warned that stronger regulation in the form of tighter interest rate caps risks suffocating a market used by a significant proportion of the Australian population to fund their day-to-day living expenses.\n\"Lower caps on fees, for example, may have the unintended consequence of encouraging illegal lending activity – and so other policy initiatives should be trialled,\" the report by RMIT University academics Marcus Banks, Ashton de Silva and Roslyn Russell said.\nThe market for \"small amount credit contracts\" (SACC) – loans of up to $2000 for periods of between 16 days and 12 months, made at relatively high interest rates, colloquially known as payday loans – has grown dramatically in recent decades, the report said, driven by a 20-fold increase in demand.\nAdvertisement Over 1 million Australians are estimated to take out a SACC-type loan each year, with the market in 2012 estimated to be between $800 million and $1 billion.\nSuch growth propelled the share prices of listed players Money3 and Cash Converters during 2013 and 2014, but earlier this year sentiment soured as the corporate regulator issued a damning report suggesting some major players were not meeting responsible lending obligations. Westpac said in August it would cease funding the sector.\nBut \"eliminating the industry is not a viable solution, unless a cheaper option is found for the 1.1 million Australians who currently take out payday loans each year,\" co-author of the report Dr de Silva said.\nReflection of higher default risks A broader understanding is required, that growing income inequality and poverty are the crucial drivers for the growing demand for small loans, the report said. SACC products are often provided to customers in precarious employment, who have a lack of alternative credit products. The major banks have largely vacated the space, although National Australia Bank supports the \"no interest loan scheme\" distributed by Good Shepherd Microfinance.\nThe high cost of payday loans is \"a reflection of the higher risks of default in this segment of the market,\" the report said, suggesting that the creation of more \"affordable small loan alternatives, which are priced at similar annual percentage rates to secured loans or credit cards, would require policy interventions\".\nThe 52-page report, to be released on Tuesday, has been provided to members of the committee appointed by the government in August to review payday loans and consumer credit contract laws, which is being chaired by Danielle Press, CEO of Equipsuper.\nA database or comprehensive reporting regime for payday loans should specify the number of loan contracts written or revenue received, customer profiles and borrowing frequencies, default rates or the sector's employment levels. This would boost knowledge of the sector allowing better policy to be created and would allow lenders to be monitored to ensure they are meeting responsible lending obligations.\nCash Converters and Money3 have assured the sharemarket all regulations are being adhered to and they support the government review of the sector. However, the boards of both companies have been in turmoil. Last month, the ousted former managing director of Money3, Robert Bryant, failed in his attempt to roll the company's board, which had been considering a wind-down of its payday lending business, while former Bank of Queensland chief Stuart Grimshaw was appointed interim executive chairman of Cash Converters after its long-time chairman and chief executive departed.\nOn Monday, Cash Converters told the ASX the Federal Court had approved settlement of a class action that forced it to pay $20 million in compensation after 50,000 customers argued they were charged exorbitant interest rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:08:35.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
