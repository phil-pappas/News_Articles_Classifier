There was nothing worse than all those grey politicians. But in the new Turnbullian époque, the monochrome world of black and white is the one going out of favour.\nThere has been a lot of disparaging talk in Canberra in recent two weeks about the old black and white dichotomy of the Abbott era where you were either on team Tony or not, where anything Labor did was bad and anything the Coalition did was good, and where you could not change direction in any circumstances, lest you appeared to be making a concession to the other side.\nNow everyone seems to be looking for the in-between ground, the compromise, the reasonable.\nThe change in tone starts at the top, and it remains the striking thing about talking to the Prime Minister in his office five weeks after he got the top job. Both the awful Howard-era chesterfield and the orange armchairs that were part of the original bespoke furniture have gone from the PM's office, replaced by a more pragmatic table adorned with Chinese tea cups, all the better for letting the PM pour himself tea as he talks to the AFR Weekend . There are no pictures of the Queen. A Lloyd Rees painting that adorned the PM's office in the Keating era is back.\nMalcolm Turnbull isn't wasting any time tiptoeing around avoiding saying things that might be seen as a criticism of his predecessor, or of the government led by John Howard (whom Tony Abbott used to refer to as the \"sainted leader\") of which Turnbull was a part.\nEqually, not everything that was associated with Labor needs to be spat on from a great height.\n\"To be an innovation nation you need a lot of changes\", he says. \"Some of them are cultural. We need leaders – whether they are running a small business or as prime minister. In an age of rapid disruption and volatility you've got to be much more agile and that means you have to be prepared to embrace different ways of doing things. You can't just assume the way you did things last week will work, and that requires in some ways a different style of leadership\n\"One of the really good things about being prime minister is that people listen to what you say and you can use that as a bully pulpit to be able to try to affect some change.\"\n For Turnbull, particularly at this point when he is still in the process of subtly repositioning the Coalition while constrained by commitments given to its conservative wing, language is everything.\nFor example, he says \"when a government recalibrates policy, what's the point of calling it a backflip?\".\n\"You are better off saying a government that does that is actually demonstrating it is responsive, and it is agile. Why would you keep heading down a track that is not successful? You've got to try something else to achieve your objectives\".\nHis government's goal will be to set Australia up \"to remain and be secure as a high-wage, generous-social-welfare-net, First-World economy\".\n\"That requires us plainly to be more competitive, more productive, more innovative, more technologically sophisticated\".\nInnovation statement before Christmas Before Christmas, there will be an innovation statement that Turnbull says will be much more broader in sweep and scope than just a few measures on high-tech start-ups.\nEducation is obviously a crucial part of making a smart nation, and Labor's education reforms – broadly labelled at the school end of things as the Gonski reforms – were an early and savage target of the Coalition when it won government in 2013.\nProposals to move to a funding scheme based on individual students' needs were dropped, despite earlier pledges. Just what the Coalition will do on school funding – as well as higher education funding – remains a big question mark to be sorted by new ministers between now, the next budget, and the election.\nBut what does Turnbull think of the underlying idea of student-based funding itself?\n\"You could well understand in an ideal world that funding would be individually targeted to individual students\", he says. But \"managing that in an administrative and financially affordable fashion is another thing.\"\nThe real challenge is resourcing, he says, even as he concedes that under the current system, governments are spending more and more, and outcomes seem to be deteriorating.\nA crucial part of the reappraisal and repositioning of policy will come when the government releases its mid-year budget review in December. Turnbull is not getting into any specifics. But he is also determined to get a bit more grey in the debate about the budget.\nTurnbull watched – in fact as opposition leader he helped force – Wayne Swan and two Labor prime ministers chain themselves to explicit surplus promises that became political nightmares.\nThe continuing collapse of the revenue base and sluggish economy have made such forecasts the territory of madmen. But Turnbull charges that, in making such forecasts, Swan, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard \"essentially underestimated the intelligence of the public\".\n\"All the sloganising and representing the forecasts as though they were promises . . .\n\"A forecast is by definition a hypothesis. You are saying 'Based on what we know at the moment, and based on these assumptions which we think are reasonable, we should end up here . . . all other things being equal, brackets, which we know will not be the case.'\n\"If you go went into the business world and said to a chief executive of a public listed company 'Will you guarantee that your net profit after tax three years from now will be X as represented in the brokers' reports?', he would say 'You are nuts. You are completely nuts.'\n\"Nobody would ever ask them [to do that], but politicians have got themselves into this unrealistic position where they are purporting to make promises about things which are inherently uncertain.\n\"The least politically painful way is obviously to constrain spending growth in circumstances where the economy, ie GDP, ie the tax base, is growing at a faster rate. But you have got to be in the right point in the cycle to do that.\"\nFiscal outlook with budget review Turnbull says he will be able to form a better judgment on the fiscal outlook once the government has gone through the budget review. But the Abbott government's aspiration of budget balance by the end of the decade \"was reasonable, that's certainly a good goal\".\n\"We certainly need to get the budget back into balance over the cycle,\" and, he says, in that apparently distant day when we get back into surplus, the money should go in to a sovereign wealth fund.\nThe point at which the balance swings from deficit to surplus is trend growth, currently thought to be around 2.75 cent, compared to growth around 2 per cent.\n\"When you are achieving trend growth you should be more or less in balance\", he says.\nTurnbull concedes that \"if you look back at the history you would have to be honest and say that we in government, the Howard government, we paid off debt, we ran big surpluses [but] with the benefit of hindsight we should have run bigger surpluses.\nHe says the \"terrible tragedy\" was \"the wasteful spending under Rudd and Gillard\". \"They created what we've inherited: a big structural deficit.\"\nBut wasn't that a lot of boom time revenue locked into unsustainable spending during the Howard years of 'entitlement'?\n\"They are all hard things to get rid of\", Turnbull concedes. \"Labor undoubtedly enhanced them. There's been a lot of additional spending since. And all of it has its merits.\"\nWhoever, is responsible, \"we have built in a very big cost base\". And now Malcolm Turnbull has to find a way of reducing that in a very grey way.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:36:56.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
