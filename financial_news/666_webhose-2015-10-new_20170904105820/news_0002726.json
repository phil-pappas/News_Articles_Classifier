ECB president Mario Draghi on Thursday said policymakers would re-examine its €60bn a month asset purchase programme in December and consider extending it past September 2016 if needed. \nDuring a press conference on Thursday after the ECB announced it was keeping policy unchanged, Draghi noted that falling commodity prices and concerns about emerging markets meant inflation pressures remained negative. \nHe revealed that the central bank had also discussed furthering lowering the deposit rate and interest rates. Although Draghi said there was \"no specific preference to one instrument or the other, they were all considered\". \nOn another positive note for equities, Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) revealed the Eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers' index held at 52 in October compared to a month ago, beating expectations for a reading of 51.7. A reading above 50 signals expansion in sector activity. \nHowever, Germany's manufacturing PMI declined from 52.3 in September to 51.6, slightly below the 51.7 reading analysts had forecast. \nIn China, the latest survey from the Conference Board showed its index rose 1.6% month-on-month in September compared with a 1% gain in August and a 0.9% climb in July. The coincident index slid 1.2% after rising 0.7% in August and 1% in July. \nLooking ahead, Markit will release its manufacturing PMI on the US at 1445 BST. \nOn the company front, TalkTalk was under pressure after saying a criminal investigation was launched by the Metropolitan Police cyber crime unit on Thursday following a \"significant and sustained\" cyberattack on the company's website Pearson (Xetra: 858266 - news ) slipped after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'outperform' and cut the price target to 1,000p. \nWilliam Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) slumped after the bookie warned that full-year operating profit will come in at the bottom end of analysts' forecasts as a result of additional taxes on the gambling industry and a tough comparison with last year. \nTelecity gained after the European Commission said it has begun a period of market testing for the proposed takeover by Equinix (NasdaqGS: EQIX - news ) . \nEntertainment One (Other OTC: ENTMF - news ) climbed after completing the acquisition of a 70% stake in Peppa Pig creator and producer Astley Baker Davies Limited for £140. \nDechra Pharmaceuticals (LSE: DPH.L - news ) jumped as it posted a strong first quarter update, with a substantial increase in revenue. \nMarket Movers FTSE 100 (UKX) 6,447.16 1.11% FTSE 250 (MCX) 17,168.96 0.73% techMARK (TASX) 3,104.35 1.34% FTSE 100 - Risers Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 349.10p 3.41% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 296.60p 3.17% Schroders (SDR) 2,941.00p 3.12% WPP (Swiss: OXWPP.SW - news ) (WPP (LSE: WPP.L - news ) ) 1,463.00p 3.10% Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) (TPK) 1,902.00p 3.09% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,017.00p 3.04% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,068.00p 2.99% CRH (CRH (EUREX: 558474.EX - news ) ) 1,835.00p 2.92% Dixons Carphone (Other OTC: DSITF - news ) (DC.) 455.00p 2.87% easyJet (EZJ) 1,769.00p 2.85% FTSE 100 - Fallers Pearson (Amsterdam: PR8.AS - news ) (PSON) 913.50p -3.84% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,210.00p -0.41% Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) (RMG (LSE: 0HC8.L - news ) ) 444.10p -0.34% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 595.00p -0.32% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 175.00p -0.23% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 542.00p -0.09% Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) 3,511.00p -0.06% Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.) 6,307.00p -0.05% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 738.70p -0.04% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,468.00p -0.02% FTSE 250 - Risers Cable & Wireless Communications (LSE: CWC.L - news ) (CWC) 76.60p 9.43% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 132.00p 7.06% AA (AA.) 274.40p 4.53% Carillion (CLLN) 313.20p 4.33% Ocado Group (Other OTC: OCDGF - news ) (OCDO) 360.30p 3.95% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 165.80p 3.95% Debenhams (DEB) 87.00p 3.82% Henderson Group (LSE: HGG.L - news ) (HGG) 279.40p 3.56% Inchcape (INCH) 814.00p 3.37% Telecity Group (LSE: TCY.L - news ) (TCY) 1,168.00p 3.09% FTSE 250 - Fallers William Hill (WMH) 323.00p -6.49% TalkTalk Telecom Group (TALK) 252.50p -5.96% Micro Focus International (Other OTC: MCFUF - news ) (MCRO) 1,168.00p -5.12% Circassia Pharmaceuticals (CIR) 270.70p -3.70% SIG (Stuttgart: QIG.SG - news ) (SHI) 137.40p -2.90% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 207.50p -2.58% Cineworld Group (LSE: CINE.L - news ) (CINE) 580.50p -2.44% Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) (TLPR) 341.00p -2.01% Crest Nicholson Holdings (CRST) 536.50p -1.65% Rank Group (RNK) 274.30p -1.61%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:06:24.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
