By Richard Evans | Telegraph – 2 hours 33 minutes ago 16.58 +0.21 \nComment: What level of offered return should make you suspicious: 10pc, 5pc, or even a mere 3pc, asks Richard Evans \nIt’s one of the oldest clichés in managing your money: if it looks to good to be true, it probably is. \nWith luck, most savers who came across the 12pc returns offered by a peer-to-peer website called TrustBuddy (Other OTC: TBDDF - news ) will have applied this test and steered well clear. As we reported last week, TrustBuddy (Swiss: OXTBD1.SW - news ) went bust last week and customers are expected to lose some or all of their money. \nIn the current environment of ultra-low interest rates, 12pc is so far above the returns available on savings accounts and also so far above the yields on high-risk shares as to ring the loudest of alarm bells. \nBut it does prompt the question, what is the level of return at which we need to start feeling sceptical? \nThere are a handful of truly safe places for your money: bank and building society savings accounts, if you stick to the limit (currently £85,000) of the protection scheme; NS&I accounts; and short-term gilts (which few private investors will venture into). \nOf these options, the one that pays the most is the first the best rate I could find today was 3.11pc on a five-year savings bond from Secure Trust Bank (I’m disregarding options that involve severe restrictions, such as high-interest current accounts and regular savings accounts). \nSo I would say this is our first threshold: if you see a rate offered that is higher than this, be a little surprised and satisfy yourself that there are no hidden risks (reliance on an overseas protection scheme, for example). \nThe higher the return, the more searching your questions need to be. If you put money into a “tracker” fund that replicates the FTSE 100, for example, you’ll currently get a yield of about 3.8pc. With such a diversified spread of shares the chances of a total loss of capital are negligible, but clearly there is a risk that the value of your investment will fall. \nSo let’s make our next milestone 4pc: above this level, appreciate that the risk of capital loss is becoming significant. \nMany investors are suspicious of any share that yields significantly more than the market as a whole. Very often a high yield is a warning sign of a future cut in the dividend. \nWhile 5pc doesn’t sound a great deal higher than 4pc, it actually amounts to 25pc more return. So 5pc can be the level beyond which alarm bells should be almost deafening. Investors’ attitude should be that they will avoid the offer unless they can prove that the risks are reasonable and adequately compensated for by the return. \nFinally, these thresholds aren’t fixed when Bank Rate was 5pc there was no danger at that level. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , as rates continue to fall (see our story on Poppy Bonds ), we may have to become cautious even sooner. \nrichard.evans@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:42:49.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
