Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Karen Maley Australian politicians' new-found enthusiasm for infrastructure spending is likely to spread offshore as policymakers in developed countries lose faith in the ability of zero interest rates to bolster flagging growth.\nAt the weekend, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said direct government spending was not the only way to fund infrastructure projects, and it was important to \"look creatively\" at ways to allow private-sector investors to share in the increase in property values in the areas around new projects.\nLast week the federal opposition unveiled an ambitious plan for a $10 billion \"bank\" to help encourage private-sector investment in new infrastructure projects.\nAustralian politicians are trumpeting the benefits of infrastructure spending as a way to spur economy activity and improve productivity at a time when growth is slowing as the mining boom draws to an end.\nExperts estimate that Canberra could borrow about $50 billion to invest in infrastructure without jeopardising the country's prized AAA credit rating. But most believe this is not enough to cover the nation's shortfall, and that it is important to find ways to encourage greater private-sector involvement in funding new infrastructure projects.\nBut Australia is not the only country where infrastructure spending is on the brink of becoming fashionable.\nSea-change in economic policy Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett says developed countries could be about to undergo a sea-change in economic policy, under which they will rely more on government spending – particularly on infrastructure – than near-zero interest rates to boost economic growth.\n In a report to clients, Hartnett predicts \"a massive policy shift in 2016\" if economic growth in the developed world stumbles. Recession and rising unemployment would exacerbate the strains already being felt as a result of rising income inequality and growing deflationary pressure.\n\"Seven years after the West went 'all-in' on QE [quantitative easing] and ZIRP [zero interest rate policy], the US/Japan/Europe would shift toward fiscal stimulus via government spending on infrastructure or more aggressive income redistribution.\"\nHartnett says such a big policy shift will have a huge impact on investment strategies. Investors should look to assets that are likely to do well in reflationary times, such as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), gold, commodities and small-cap Chinese stocks. In addition, investors should look for stocks that benefit from an improvement in Main Street rather than Wall Street – for example, mass market retailers rather than luxury goods makers.\nAggressive monetary stimulus adopted by the world's big central banks in the wake of the financial crisis has propelled global sharemarkets higher – in the US, the S&P has risen by about 200 per cent since the March 2009 lows – even though global growth has been anaemic, in what Hartnett describes as \"the most deflationary expansion of all time\".\nGrowing push But there is a growing push to spread the wealth more broadly, which is being reflected in the rise of populist US presidential candidates such as Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in the United States, and Jeremy Corbyn in Britain.\n\"Deflation exacerbates 'inequality' of income, wealth, profits, asset valuations,\" Hartnett says. \"The gap between winners and losers is being driven wider and wider by excess liquidity and technological disruption [trends synonymous with the 1920s, another period infamous for 'inequality'].\"\nBank of America Merrill Lynch says the top 0.1 per cent of the US population controls 22 per cent of the wealth now, up from 7 per cent in the late 1970s, while the bottom 90 per cent of US households control just 23 per cent.\nHarnett says policy-makers will potentially be able to take advantage of what is an \"optimal time to finance infrastructure spending\", given that interest rates are likely to remain low, while commodity prices have slumped.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:01.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
