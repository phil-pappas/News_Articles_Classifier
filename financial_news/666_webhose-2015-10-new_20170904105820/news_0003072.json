He went further about American's lack of support for parental leave: \"That is an international embarrassment.\" More Headlines Debt Ceiling Alert: This Time It's Really Scary \nThis issue has increasingly become part of the national conservation, particularly as major tech companies are attempting to one-up each other when it comes to generous parental leave benefits. In August, for example, Netflix announced it would offer leave up to one year for new mothers and fathers -- a policy in stark contrast to typical offerings nationwide. \nAmong the top 10% of wage earners in the U.S., about 25% get paid time off for parental leave. By contrast, only 4% at the bottom get the luxury of this benefit. Ultimately, the less money you make, the less generous your leave practice. \nThat can be deleterious to a person's earning power -- particularly so for women. Studies have found that women all too often earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less than men over the course of their lifetimes--an inequality attributed to losses suffered when women reduce their professional commitments or vacate the work force completely to care for their children. But the road to effecting change faces large obstacles, and Clinton and Sanders are up against a few major challenges. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:27:13.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
