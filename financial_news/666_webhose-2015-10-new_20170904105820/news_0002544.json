The S&P healthcare index (.SPXHC) was last down 0.7 percent. \nShares of Valeant (VRX.N) tumbled by nearly 28 percent after a short-seller released a report critical of the company, causing the stock to be temporarily halted due to the decline. \nGloomy quarterly reports dragged on European shares, while confidence over a positive close to the year and continued central bank support ahead of a European Central Bank meeting on Thursday capped losses. \n\"During the course of the third quarter, we actually saw consensus estimates drop for both revenue and earnings,\" said Eric Weigand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. \n\"You could make the point that there is a low hurdle for companies to exceed on these diminished expectations.\" \nChinese bourses gave up earlier gains to close down 3 percent, the biggest fall since Sept. 15. \nMSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 0.08 percent. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index (.FTEU3) was last down 0.03 percent. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average (.DJI) was last up 0.4 percent at 17,286.33.

The American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a rise in U.S. commercial crude stocks of 7.1 million barrels to 473 million barrels in the week to Oct. 16, trumping expectations for an increase of 3.9 million barrels. \nRising supply from the largest-producing countries, along with slowing demand from emerging nations, has cut the price of oil in half over the last year. \n\"There is a surplus everywhere,\" Torbjorn Tornqvist, chief executive of Gunvor, told the Reuters Commodities Summit. \nU.S. Treasury yields slumped after disappointing Japanese exports revived worries about sputtering world growth and dimmed prospects for a quick hike in U.S. interest rates. U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were last up 1-4/32 in price to yield 2.87 percent, from a yield of 2.92 percent late Tuesday. \nThe dollar rose against emerging-market and commodity-linked currencies as Chinese stocks slid, while the yen dipped after the Japanese trade data.
