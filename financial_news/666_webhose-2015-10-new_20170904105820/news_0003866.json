That means the bank has a market share of 3.5pc so far this year, up from 3.1pc in the second half of 2014. \nOutstanding mortgage balances hit £24.5bn in the quarter, up 12pc on their level at the start of the year. However, the bank did warn that increased competition as yet more challenger banks enter the market is keeping mortgage interest rates low, putting pressure on profitability . \nVirgin Money is also expanding its credit card business, and outstanding balances on the plastic now stand at £1.4bn. The challenger bank wants to increase that to £3bn by the end of 2018. \nAt the same time retail deposits increased 3pc in the quarter to £23.7bn. \nThe challenger also hired George Ashworth from rival lender Aldermore , to launch its small- and medium-sized business banking operations. \nVirgin Money floated on the stock market in November 2014, and its share price has risen by 45pc in the 11 months since the initial public offering. \nMeanwhile, fellow challenger bank Secure Trust , which is part of the Arbuthnot Banking (LSE: ARBB.L - news ) Group, also reported very strong lending figures. \nNew (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) lending volumes rose 93pc, taking Secure Trust’s loan book to above £900m, with growing volumes across consumer and motor finance arms, as well as its small business operations including asset finance, invoice finance and real estate finance. \nSecure Trust Bank has also poached a senior executive from a rival to bolster its operations. It has hired Ian Henderson , formerly chief executive at Kensington Mortgages and at Shawbrook Bank, to head up its strategy, personal lending and mortgage units   .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:15:17.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
