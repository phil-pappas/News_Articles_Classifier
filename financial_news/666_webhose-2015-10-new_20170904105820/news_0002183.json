It was the third raid of 7-Eleven stores by the regulator in the past six years.\n7-Eleven founder and former chairman Russ Withers (left), former general manager operations Natalie Dalbo, and former chief executive Warren Wilmot.

The company has set up an \"independent\" panel to review payroll claims and outlined changes to its business model after Fairfax Media revealed many franchisees did not earn enough income to pay their staff the legal award wages.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman's action against Ms Gu, Mr Xu and their company Hiyi is the fourth time the agency has put a 7-Eleven operator before court since July 2009. It recently took action against the operator of a store in Blacktown in Sydney's west.\nMs Gu and Mr Xu sold the Parkville store earlier this year, soon after the raid, but continue to own a store in the Melbourne CBD on the corner of Flinders and Spencer streets that they bought in 2013.\n7-Eleven head office has turned a ''blind eye'' to the exploitation and underpayment of employees at franchises.

The couple also allegedly did not pay penalty rates to staff who worked on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays and allegedly failed to pay staff who worked night shifts the legal minimum, which during the period was $22.39 to $24.07.\nA directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on November 17.\nMs James said that while it was pleasing all but $500 of the underpaid wages bill had now been rectified by the employer, legal action was initiated because of the alleged deliberate exploitation of vulnerable overseas workers.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Ms Gu, Mr Xu and Hiyi made \"multiple breaches of workplace laws\".
