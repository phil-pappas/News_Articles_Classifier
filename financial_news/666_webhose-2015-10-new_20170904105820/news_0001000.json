However, the ecommerce major was able to fix it successfully in due course, before going on to sell 10 lakh products in a 10-hour span on Tuesday.\nIn fact, Flipkart registered six million visits from across the country for its ‘Big Billion Day Sale’.\n“We faced some technical glitches for 15-20 minutes. But we quickly took care of it and everything went fine post that,” a Flipkart spokesperson told FE.\nAmazon on the other hand launched its early morning delivery service on Tuesday, which the company said gave it a good lift. On the other hand, competitor Paytm has changed the look of the website to attract customers. At the time of going to the press, Snapdeal (which had held its ‘Monday Electronics Sale’, lasting 24 hours, on the 12th) and Amazon were yet to come up with further sale details.\n“Big Billion Days Sale has started off with a bang this year. We have sold 1 million units already and expect to do a higher number by the end of today’s fashion sale. We are extremely thrilled to see customers from across geographies shop with us. It is great to see 1.6 million app installs in the last two days – which is a great indicator, that India has been preparing well for ‘The Big Billion Days’,” said Mukesh Bansal, Head of Commerce Platform, Flipkart.\nFor most of the products, delivery time seemed to be an issue at Flipkart as products at the check out page had a message saying, “Delivery times may be longer than usual due to high demand currently”. Ananth Narayanan, CEO at Myntra, a Flipkart unit told FE the company doesn’t have any special plan to make the delivery time shorter for the festive period sale. However, Amazon has launched next morning delivery by 11 am of the products bought the previous night. Morning delivery service is present across Mumbai, Delhi /NCR, Bengaluru and Hyderabad at Rs120 flat charge for it.\n“With Amazon.in’s Morning Delivery service, our customers are now assured of delivery between 8 am to 11 am the next morning across lakhs of products. We are excited to launch this service in time for the festive season so that customers can benefit from a variety of fast and reliable delivery options and enjoy shopping on Amazon.in,” said Akshay Sahi, Head Customer Experience, Amazon India.\nPaytm, the payment gateway focused company that jumped into e-retail in 2014, is participating in the festive season sale for the first time this year. In its bid to attract more customers, it gave a new look to its website on the day of the sale, making products clearly visible and sidelined the mobile recharge option on its website.\n“Our product intent is to ensure that the consumers are able to find what they are looking for easily and merchants are able to showcase their products to consumers. The new design has been able to achieve both these objectives very well. We saw a significant jump in both traffic and sales on our platform. A lot of consumers landed on Paytm after exploring other ecommerce platforms and were surprised to find great deals that our merchants had offered,” said Saurabh Vashishtha, VP, Paytm.\nE-commerce majors riding on the festive season shopping euphoria started their sale Tuesday and collectively kept mobile apps as the most discount friendly platform. Though, Flipkart and Myntra had their sale only on mobile apps, other players such as Snapdeal and Amazon that had sale on other platforms too, promised special discounts for app-users.\n 13, 2015 8:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:49:27.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
