Trade Show Executive’s Gold 100 Awards & Summit honors the 100 largest trade shows that have set the gold standard for the trade show industry. CES is the world’s gathering place for all who thrive on the business of consumer technologies. It has served as the proving ground for innovators and breakthrough technologies for more than 45 years—the global stage where next-generation innovations are introduced to the marketplace. As the largest hands-on event of its kind, CES features all aspects of the consumer technology industry. “We work hard to create an event experience that keeps exhibitors, attendees and press coming back year after year and it means a lot to be recognized by TSE, a leader in the events industry,” said Karen Chupka, senior vice president, CES and corporate business strategy, Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®, owner and producer of CES. “These awards recognize our innovative thinking and strategic efforts aimed at making CES the world’s must-attend technology event.” In total, 160,498 industry influencers attended the 2014 CES, including 6,575 media and 40,828 international attendees from 144 countries. The highest number of international attendees came from Canada, South Korea, China, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Taiwan and France; each country represented by more than 1,000 attendees at the 2014 CES. CEA works closely with the Las Vegas Convention Visitors Authority (LVCVA) to ensure smooth travel and accommodations for all guests. In 2014 international travel to Las Vegas got a tremendous boost, with the Las Vegas McCarren International Airport’s opening of Terminal 3 and its seven dedicated international gates. CEA promoted the new terminal and the fact that the Customs and Border Protection area could process 2,000 international passengers an hour, made CES even more accessible and attractive to a global audience. The 2015 CES was even larger than 2014 with 176, 676 industry influencers in attendance. Including 48, 833 international attendees from 153 countries. CES 2016® will take place Wednesday, January 6-Saturday, January 9, 2016, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Registration for CES 2016 is now available. Please visit CESweb.org for more information.
