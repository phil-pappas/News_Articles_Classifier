Share on twitter by Patrick Commins The major problem for the global economy is there's an excess of just about everything. You name it, there's too much of it: too much debt, too much iron ore, too much oil, too many factories. And to top it all off, there's too much money washing around the globe looking for a productive home.\nLet's call it the \"plenty problem\", and it's a growing one.\nTake debt. The sub-prime crisis was a story of too much borrowing mixed with negligent lending, followed by a spectacular housing bust and global financial crisis. Yet global debt has increased since then, from $US142 trillion ($194 trillion) at the end of 2007 to $US199 trillion in the middle of last year, according to McKinsey research, which looks to have the most recent numbers on the topic.\nHere in Australia, household debt to gross domestic product in Australia has pushed to a record high of 133 per cent, despite the fact that economic growth is sub-trend and wages after inflation are going backwards. Australian household debt to income is also at a peak.\nIt's why households are reluctant to open – and quick to close – their wallets.\nDon't just look at demand \"What we are seeing all around the world is capacity surges and if you experience one in your industry and you've borrowed during the boom period, you're in trouble,\" Mark Burgess, who ran the Future Fund during 2012 and 2013, told a panel discussion during the week.\n\"This is a theme all investors have to manage. Whether it's a house or an apartment in Melbourne, don't just look at the demand side; think about how the market is going to respond on the supply side. It's supply that will kill your investment rather than some other factor.\"\n It certainly rings true in the commodities complex, where supply has swamped dwindling demand. There is overcapacity in iron ore and miners continue to ramp up production. The US shale oil revolution created a wave of new crude supply that halved the global price in short order.\nThe likes of BHP and Rio will swear until they are blue in the face that they didn't over-invest in expanding their output, but the fact is that BHP's annual profits went from $13.8 billion in the 2014 financial year to $1.9 billion in the next – the big miner's lowest profit since 2003.\nMeanwhile, China's factories this week recorded their 43rd straight month of year-on-year deflation. That means Chinese manufacturers in aggregate haven't enjoyed higher prices for their goods since early 2012.\n\"An environment where there is plenty of everything means we are in an investment spending vacuum,\" explains Tracey McNaughton, head of investment strategy at UBS Asset Management in Australia.\nNew investment creates jobs, which leads to more spending, which in turn inspires further investment and the virtuous circle is complete. But that circle is now working in reverse, depressing prices and profitability of businesses around the world.\nPricing power So for investors, the obvious question is what is there not enough of? Or, at least, where is supply and demand more evenly matched? Surely that is where the money will be made in the coming few years.\nIt's easier said than done, but it's a useful starting point.\nSpecialist fund manager Cooper Investors, in its latest newsletter, identifies the global dairy market as one where the market is moving away from overcapacity as supply reduces and prices (which have fallen heavily over the past two years) stabilise and start to improve \"in the medium term\". Growing incomes in developing economies should underpin increased demand for milk products.\nThe Melbourne-based boutique is invested in MG Unit Trust, which provides economic exposure to Murray Goulbourn, an unlisted public company and a dairy co-operative of more than 2500 supplier-owners, mostly in Victoria.\nThe team at Cooper also highlights the attractiveness of the aged care industry, underpinned by growing demand from Australia's ageing population. Their picks are Regis Healthcare and Summerset Group.\nPricing power For Bruno Paulson, who runs the Global Brands fund for Morgan Stanley Investment Management, the answer to the plenty problem is immediate (and satisfyingly alliterative): pricing power. Businesses with the ability to raise prices to offset the deflationary pulse of excess supply are the best positioned to reward shareholders.\n\"In a disinflationary and slow-growth world, being able to grow steadily either through volumes or through pricing power is valuable,\" Paulson says.\nPaulson, visiting from London, says he won't go near banks and miners, describing both industries as populated by highly leveraged, highly cyclical price takers. He is unimpressed with our big supermarket owners: \"[Food retailing] is not an attractive industry; it's very low margin and very capital intensive if you capitalise the leases, as you should.\"\nInstead, Paulson identifies ratings agency Moody's and Visa as two businesses with \"very, very strong market positions\".\n\"Moody's has some of the best pricing power around, [the company raises prices] 4 to 5 per cent a year, even through the financial crisis,\" he says.\nFast money The final facet of the plenty problem is this: there is too much fast-moving money rushing in and out of financial assets, a legacy of years of central bank largesse. Desperate for return and with few or no opportunities, that fast money gets overexcited then ultimately disappointed by lumbering economic and profit growth.\n\"There is a lot of liquidity built up in the system which then creates a lot of overcrowded trades, which unwind quickly and violently and then crunch prices – before central banks step in again,\" McNaughton says.\nMcNaughton reckons there have been four such \"tantrums\" since the original example in May and June 2013 when investors reacted violently to news that the United States Federal Reserve would begin to taper its bond-buying program. The most recent was the general freak-out over China in August. Depressingly, she expects this environment to continue for a number of years.\nThe plenty problem looks here to stay.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:55.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
