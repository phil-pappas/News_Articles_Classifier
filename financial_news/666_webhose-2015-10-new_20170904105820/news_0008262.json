They also say ISDS is unnecessary. \n\"Given the advanced judicial systems of both the US and EU, ISDS is an unwarranted risk to domestic policy-making at the local, state and federal levels,\" said the US labor federation AFL-CIO. \nFaced with a public outcry, the European Commission, in charge of the talks, proposed as an alternative a special court of magistrates to handle such foreign investor litigation. \nEU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem said in early August that the general atmosphere of distrust was a barrier to reaching a pact. \n\"For now, the negotiations are very difficult to sell in the European Union because they have yielded nothing concrete,\" she told AFP. \n\"We will put everything on the table, see where we are and how to advance,\" she said. \n\"I hope we will be in a position to make joint announcements with Mr. Froman to give substance to the negotiations,\" she added, referring to her negotiating counterpart, US Trade Representative Michael Froman. \nThe Miami talks will not cover ISDS, as the EU develops its alternative proposal. They will focus, for one, on government procurement standards that favor local businesses. US states are especially resistant to pushes to open their contracts to foreign competitors. \n\"State-level procurement in the US is very important for us,\" said an EU Commission official this week. \nOther issues under discussion are \"very technical,\" the official said, including technology-related regulations, and more tariff issues. \nPut off, probably to the final rounds, will be farm issues, extremely contentious as Europe holds substantial barriers to US products and are loath to weaken their standards (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:19:09.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
