That has now got under way and is going well.\" \nHe added: \"The pace will now quicken and I'll be again setting out the four vital areas where we need change and laying down what those changes will be at the start of November… \n\"I'm confident we can get a good deal for Britain, we can fix those things that need to be fixed and I'm confident this process is well under way and making good progress.\" \n:: Should The UK Stay Or Go? \nMr Schulz had called for Mr Cameron to make his position clear. He said: \"I hope that, as far as the UK Government is concerned - and certainly with individuals, including David Cameron - we can make steps forward. \n\"Above all, we need clarity on what we are going to be discussing over the next few months.\" \nMr Cameron met European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker for lunch for talks over the technical discussions on the renegotiations which Mr Juncker said had not made huge progress. \nMr Juncker, with whom Mr Cameron has had a strained relationship in the past, told MEPs \"our British friends have to dance\" and said that it took \"two to tango\". \nHe had already sparked controversy after appearing to say that Britain didn't need Europe and Europe didn't need Britain but has said that his words were misheard because of the noise in parliament on Wednesday. \nHe told Sky News: \"Britain needs Europe and Europe needs Britain\" and said progress had to be made on renegotiation talks. \nThe most likely date for the referendum is expected to be autumn 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:01:50.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
