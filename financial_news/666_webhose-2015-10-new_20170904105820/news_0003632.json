The stock closed at Rs. 140.45 on BSE while the benchmark Sensex index rose 0.7% to close at 27,470.81 points.\nIdea Cellular’s consolidated revenue fell 1.2% and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) fell by 5.3% sequentially. Idea Cellular’s note to investors cited “pressure on mobile data realized rate as the competition intensifies” as one of the reasons industry growth has fallen to mid-single digits in the first half of this year, from double-digit levels a year ago, Mint reported.\nIdea Cellular reported a 4.9% sequential drop in average price realization in the data business; on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, average realizations are down 11.7%. Voice revenue per minute fell by 0.6% sequentially and as much as 9.7% y-o-y. The continued drop in realizations is worrying. When Reliance Jio launches its services, it is expected to lead to further price cuts by incumbents, the report added.\nRating firm Elara Capital has downgraded the stock to “reduce” and fixed its target price at Rs. 155.\nEmkay Research also downgraded the stock to “reduce” and retained its target price to Rs. 143 a share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:32:23.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
