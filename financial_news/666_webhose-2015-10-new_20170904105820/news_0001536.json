We are the biggest palm oil producer. Why (should) the consumers from the developed countries set the standard for us as they want?\"\nIndonesia and Malaysia, which account for 85 percent of the world's palm output, have since late August been discussing the plan to set up an intergovernmental organisation called Council of Palm Oil Producer Countries.\nThe move comes after major palm oil firms, including Cargill , Golden Agri-Resources and Wilmar International, signed the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) following pressure to adopt better practices.\nIndonesia, which is home to the world's third-largest tropical forests, has been criticised by green activists and other Southeast Asian nations on forestry policy and for failing to stop the region's annual \"haze\" problem from forest-burning.\nRamli said IPOP protected the interests of developed countries' vegetable oil markets, and the new council would set a standard that would also consider the welfare of smallholders.\nTop palm buyers India and China would be lobbied to accept the new standard, he said.\nIPOP officials could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, a national holiday in Indonesia, but have previously said they are working with smallholder suppliers to help them meet the pledges.\nThe new Council would also look to promote the image of palm oil, stabilise prices, improve cooperation between top producers, and coordinate on production, stocks, biodiesel mandates and re-planting schemes, industry groups have said.\nFurther details are expected to be announced from late October. Previous attempts to develop better palm relations between the two countries have had limited success.\n\"It really depends on the will power of both governments, and I suspect they will come together more when prices are low than when prices are high,\" said Ivy Ng, analyst at CIMB Investment Bank.
