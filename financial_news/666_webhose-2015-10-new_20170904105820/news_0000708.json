The transport ministry said it had been assured by the company that the deadline would be met. \nTransport minister Alexander Dobrindt said authorities were examining whether to make additional demands of Volkswagen. \n\"My expectation is that the KBA will analyse this report rapidly and comprehensively, and submit possible questions to Volkswagen,\" he told reporters in Berlin. \nIn written testimony to a U.S. congressional oversight panel, Volkwagen's top U.S. executive said the carmaker has withdrawn its certification application for some 2016 model year vehicles due to a software feature that should have been disclosed to U.S. and California regulators as an auxiliary emissions control device, or AECD. \nAECD is a regulatory term that includes defeat devices, like the software logarithm Volkswagen has admitted using in model years 2009-2015. Michael Horn, who testifies before lawmakers on Thursday, provided no further details but said Volkswagen is working with regulators to continue the certification process. \nBoth events come as investigations and lawsuits against the company continue to pile up. \nAccording to a letter released on Wednesday, top senators on the U.S. Senate Finance Committee are investigating Volkswagen's actions related to federal tax credits designed to reward consumers for buying environmentally-friendly vehicles. \nStephan Weil, the prime minister of the German region of Lower Saxony which is Volkswagen's second-biggest stakeholder, denied suggestions the company was responding too slowly. \n\"The investigation is indeed running at high speed. We are not doing this by German rules, we are doing this by American rules,\" he said, noting U.S. law firm Jones Day was leading an external investigation into the test rigging too. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel also told the European Parliament she believed Volkswagen was doing its best to address its problems, and urged a Green party politician not to use them to condemn the entire car industry. \n\"It puts thousands and thousands of European jobs at risk,\" she said. \n\"DEGREE OF FRIGHT\" \nPoetsch addressed reporters after the carmaker's 20-person supervisory board met at its headquarters in Wolfsburg to discuss the progress of its internal investigation into the biggest business crisis in the company's 78-year history. \nThe scandal has wiped more than a third off its share price, forced out its long-time chief executive, led its new CEO to predict \"massive cutbacks\", and sent shockwaves through both the global car industry and the German establishment. \nOne source close to the matter said there was a \"certain degree of fright\" among management ahead of Horn's appearance before the congressional panel. \nHowever, the source said it was too early to name those responsible for installing software in some diesel engines to manipulate emissions tests. \nPoetsch, 64, promised U.S. law firm Jones Day was \"leaving no stone unturned\" in its investigations. \nBut U.S. lawmakers may have to settle for little new information from Volkswagen or the Environmental Protection Agency. Horn said in his written testimony that the Jones Day probe is still at a preliminary stage and asked the panel for \"your understanding as we complete this work.\" \nTwo senior EPA officials also told the committee that they would not be able to review new details without jeopardizing the investigation that their agency is pursuing with the U.S. Justice Department. \nVolkswagen has said it may have to refit up to 11 million cars and vans worldwide, and new CEO Matthias Mueller said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday recalls would start in January and would be completed by the end of 2016. \nBut owners are anxious to know whether the refits will affect the fuel-economy and performance of their vehicles. \nVolkswagen has said the illegal software was not activated on the bulk of the 11 million vehicles, most of which are in Europe, leaving uncertainty over whether it rigged tests there. \nGermany's transport ministry has said it did manipulate European tests too, but has not given details, making it unclear whether the company faces the same level of fines and lawsuits in Europe as in the United States. \nEquinet analysts said the cost of refits could range from less than 100 euros ($112) per vehicle to as much as 10,000 euros, depending on whether software can be upgraded or new hardware is needed. \nUBS analysts estimated the total bill for the scandal, including potential fines and lawsuits, could be around 35 billion euros, though they added this was more than factored into Volkswagen's share price after its recent plunge. \nCOMPANY VETERANS \nIn his newspaper interview, Mueller rejected the suggestion Volkswagen informed financial markets too late about the test rigging despite having told EPA officials weeks before it went public. \nHe also said he believed only a few employees were involved in the manipulations. \nIn private, other German executives have expressed surprise at the appointment as chairman of Poetsch who, in his previous role as chief financial officer, would have had responsibility for deciding when to inform markets about the emissions rigging. \nGermany’s financial regulator Bafin has launched a preliminary probe into the circumstances around the announcement. Were it to determine that Volkswagen violated strict communication rules, Poetsch could come under scrutiny. \nU.S. lawmakers will press for detailed information on the emissions cheating. \n\"We have a lot of questions. We have very few answers,\" complained Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, the top Democrat for subcommittee. \nOfficials in Germany, where Volkswagen has been held up for years as a model of the country's engineering prowess, are also anxious for news. \n\"I now expect a very transparent investigation of the circumstances. I am convinced that we will get more and more clarity,\" Klaus Mohrs, the mayor of Wolfsburg where Volkswagen employs around 70,000 people, told Reuters. \nData on Wednesday showed German industrial output fell at its steepest pace in a year in August, suggesting Europe's largest economy may be losing momentum just as the Volkswagen scandal casts a cloud over manufacturing. \nSome analysts and investors are worried company veterans such as Mueller and Poetsch will not introduce the sweeping changes in business practices they think are necessary to restore the company's reputation. \nThey are also concerned about the complexity of Volkswagen's investigations. \nOne source close to the matter said the supervisory board of the company's flagship Audi brand would also meet on Wednesday, and has hired accountants to help investigate the scandal too. \n(This story corrects paragraph 8 to show that VW has withdrawn its certification application, not a software feature) \n(Additional reporting by Caroline Copley, Barbara Lewis, Jan Schwartz, Noah Barkin, David Morgan and Reuters bureaus; Writing by Mark Potter; Editing by Susan Thomas, Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:54:11.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
