The bank helps finance sales of U.S. exports to foreign customers.\nThe bank's charter expired June 30, and it has been unable to approve new applications to help overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. products like airplanes and heavy equipment, which the bank says helps sustain tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs.\nSupporters of the bank have been stymied by team party opposition.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
