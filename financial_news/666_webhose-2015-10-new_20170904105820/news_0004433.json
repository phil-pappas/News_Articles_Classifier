Will they deliver any profits? And will they actually employ any staff, and thereby contribute to the economy in which they exist, save the handful of engineers who founded them? \nBut amidst such questions around these start-ups, and this constant angst about whether the UK will ever deliver a technology champion, there is one British technology-focused company which is delivering real profits and substantial shareholder growth. \nThe only problem is that rather than delivering fuel cells or multi-player video games, it delivers pizzas. \nFor Domino’s Pizza Group, the FTSE 250 constituent, is growing swiftly on the back of its substantial investment in technology. \nIn fact, based on the rather ridiculous unicorn definition, it is 2.6 unicorns, given its market capitalisation of £1.7bn equates to $2.6bn. \nFictional horse-like horned mammals aside, however, the Domino’s Pizza story is one of digital investment benefitting shareholders to an increasing degree. \nOne need only look at Domino’s share price graph to see that benefit. Seven years ago, in October 2008, its shares were languishing around the 166.5p mark. \nOn Wednesday, its shares closed at £10.02 ending above £10 for the first time - having risen 112p on the day following a profit upgrade. \nIts third quarter trading statement reflected just how much that digital investment is paying off. \nLike-for-like sales in the three months to September 27 rose 14.9pc in the UK, leading the company to say it would beat previous 2015 profit expectations and prompting analysts to increase earnings expectations by 5- 6pc for this year. \nThe reason for that upgrade? Digital investment. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is easy to see Domino’s as an old economy business, which is involved in simply making pizzas in small retail units, and delivering them to customers’ homes. \nBut that would be an archane and outdated view of a company which is much changed. \nYes, it still delivers pizzas from those same confined spaces but it does so in an increasingly digital way. \nAlthough the company won’t disclose how much it has spent on digital investment other than to say it doubled its technology investment this year compared to last year and next year will increase it by a further 75pc - the results speak for themselves. \nNearly 80pc of its orders are now made online, compared to less than 30pc just five years ago. \nAnd although Domino’s only took its first order on a mobile device five years ago, some two-thirds of its digital orders are now made on a smart phone or a tablet. \nThe efficiencies digital orders bring to a business whose main cost is staff is significant. \nAlthough Domino’s doesn’t own any of its UK stores they are all franchised those costs are meaningful to its franchisees, who have been important in suggesting key upgrades to Domino’s mobile app. \nThe next step, according to chief executive David Wild, is to deliver an app which allows for one-click ordering, which could be as early as next year, and to try and fine tune payment options to allow for credit card details to be saved. \nThe company uses social networks such as Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) to entice customers \nHe argues that while many consumer facing businesses are still on a path to digital transformation, Domino’s is already thinking like a business that is digital. \nOut of 230 head office staff, some 85 are software engineers and technologists. From a current base of 860 stores, Wild think there’s potential for 1,200 across the UK, meaning considerable room for growth. \nYes the company has had its fair share of problems in Germany, which it’s now working on stabilising, but unlike many technology-focused companies it’s throwing off cash (it had net cash of £19.2m at the end of June) and is due to generate pre-tax profits of approximately £69m this year. \nToo much time is spent by commentators and civil servants wondering why the UK doesn’t have any real technology champions it can shout about. \nForget the unicorns. This is a much revolutionised company which owes it increasing success to its understanding of the digital revolution and investing to make sure it stays at the forefront of those changes. \nIn a few years, Domino’s Pizza Group could be knocking on the door of the FTSE 100. And when it does, it will be technology that has got it there. \njames.quinn@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:15:24.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
