Mr. Dorsey will also remain CEO of his payments startup Square, making him a double threat not unlike Deion Sanders, who played in the World Series and Super Bowl, according to one venture capitalist . Twitter’s revenue chief Adam Bain, who was on the CEO short list, will become chief operating officer. Mr. Dorsey’s return comes amid pressure from Wall Street about its user growth and questions from marketers about the effectiveness of ads on its platform . His split attention may also draw concern from investors when Square goes on an expected IPO roadshow later this year, WSJ reports.\nCLOCK THE VOTE : Many marketers’ online video strategies still amount to something along the lines of “let’s make our 30-second TV ad into a 15-second Web ad.” Now political campaigns are facing the same problem of how to fashion creative in the “attention-deficit era of politics,” the New York Times NYT 3.08 % reports. A super PAC supporting John Kasich, for instance, drew up a 10-second ad on Snapchat. Rand Paul opted for the self-aware Geico approach to skippable YouTube ads, beginning a 15-second spot with an appeal to “please don’t skip this video.” As campaigns and causes try to get more creative online, it’s worth keeping in mind that they will still spend most of the advertising money on the tried and true TV spot.\nWAKE UP : McDonald’s All Day Breakfast is off and running, with the burger giant employing multiple agencies to help guide an advertising and marketing blitz , Ad Age reports. McDonald’s U.S. Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl told Ad Age that the campaign was “one of the biggest platforms that we’ve launched in quite a long time,” and that it would use All Day breakfast as an advertising topic through all of next year. They sure need to do something! Sales have been soggy, and it’s unclear whether all-day Egg McMuffins can make a measurable difference (especially since many restaurants will not be offering hashbrowns ).\nBIG GAMBLE : If you know the names DraftKings and FanDuel, it’s probably because they have been drilled into your head thanks to millions of dollars of television ad spending this football season. The two services are the top “daily fantasy sports” sites, where fans can win cash and prizes by developing one-off fantasy teams every week. The problem with all that advertising is that it also brings scrutiny. And now, as the New York Times reports, both sites are embroiled in a scandal as to whether employees at their companies had access to data that other players did not. As WSJ reports, the issue was sparked by a DraftKings’ employee’s premature release of game data . It remains to be seen if there will be any legal or regulatory fallout, but DraftKings and FanDuel have officially made a name for themselves in the public consciousness, for better or for worse.\nElsewhere What native advertising and product integration does to television [ New Yorker ]\nLionsgate and Starz are in advanced merger talks [ L.A.
