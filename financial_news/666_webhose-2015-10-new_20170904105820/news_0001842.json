The FTSE 100 ended up 67.80 points (1.06%) to 6,444.08 - the highest level it has been since August 19. The FTSE 250 rose to 17,240.70, up 196.16 points (1.15%). \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) announced it will cut its one-year deposit rate and one-year lending rate by 25 basis points each to 1.5% and 4.35%, respectively, as it looks to bolster the slowing economy. The rate cut in China, one of the world's biggest metal consumers, is the sixth since November last year as authorities there strive to prop up the flagging economy, and gave a boost to the London markets. \nThree-month futures contracts on base metals on the London Metal Exchange were higher including copper (+0.3%), lead (+0.4%), nickel (1.3%), tin (+0.2%) and zinc (+1.1%), although primary aluminium was flat. Mining company Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) led the FTSE 100 risers, with Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) also featuring in the top 10, largely thanks to news of the rate cut in China, one of the world's biggest metal consumers. \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) propped up the technology hardware & equipment sector as it continued to rise since it released its third quarter results on Wednesday. Pre-tax profit rose 27% on a normalised basis from the same period last year to £128.4m, on revenue of £243.1m, up 24%. Processor royalty revenue was up 37% on the year, while processor licensing revenue rose 5%, and it indicated it has entered the final quarter with strong royalty momentum. \nThe pharmaceuticals sector also ended the week on a high, led by Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) on the FTSE 100. In its third quarter earnings statement released on Friday, the Irish firm posted a 20.8% year-on-year drop in third quarter pre-tax profit to $455.5m, as an increase in integration and acquisition costs offset a 3.7% increase in revenue to $1.66bn. But the company said its research and development costs surged 11% year-on-year, as a result of continued investment in the group's pipeline product and the costs related to its acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals. \nThe construction sector benefitted from Michelmersh Brick Holdings ' 5% share price rise. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) followed building materials peer Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) rebounding from news earlier in the week its full-year earnings are likely to be at the lower end of market expectations due to weakness in the repair, maintenance and improvement market. But on Friday, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) upgraded Travis Perkins stock to buy, boosting the company and the construction sector as a whole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:38:10.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
