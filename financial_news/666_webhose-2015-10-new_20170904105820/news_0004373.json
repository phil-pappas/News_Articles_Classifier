Photo: Brendan Esposito\nBig W bungled the rollout of its new stock management system this year, leaving suppliers furious and millions of dollars out of pocket while also denting its own bottom line.\nThe new system was part of a software upgrade across the Woolworths empire, which was designed to make it cheaper and easier to source products.\nThe overhaul, known as Project Galaxy , involved introducing management software from German company SAP for stores and suppliers to use for ordering stock.\nBig W 's earnings before tax dropped 25 per cent to $114.2 million in 2015. Photo: Viki Lascaris\nThe new project was first announced six years ago and introduced to supermarkets before rolling out to Big W in mid-March 2015.\nAdvertisement Orders for new stock soon dried up after its rollout to the discount department store, according to one supplier, while Big W's shelves became emptier.\n\"It wasn't because they didn't want to [order stock], but because they couldn't get [orders] through,\" said the supplier, who asked not to be named.\n\"From a vendor's point of view, it was just incredibly frustrating to lose so much in sales … the whole thing cost suppliers millions of dollars.\"\nVendors vent anger Tensions boiled over at a \"suppliers' summit\" at the Four Seasons Hotel, in Sydney's The Rocks, in May as irate vendors vented their anger over lost sales.\nSmaller companies were reportedly the angriest at seeing their stock disappear from shelves.\nBig W's then managing director, Alistair McGeorge, apologised to vendors for \"what they had been through\", according to the supplier, who had been there.\nMr McGeorge left the company and Australia in August under a cloud, with Woolworths saying he had resigned for health reasons while also disclosing that a staff member had complained about his behaviour.\nPacific Brands, owner of Bonds, saw sales of its underwear at discount department stores \"significantly\" hit last year, in part due to \"system implementation issues\" at stores that damaged stock availability, according to its end-of-year results.\nPacific Brands did not mention any retailers specifically, but the industry speculates it was a veiled reference to Big W's new system.\nTotal sales at Big W fell by $240 million last financial year, while same-store sales dropped 7.2 per cent.\nSales hurt by transformation plan Woolworths pointed to problems with the Project Galaxy rollout to Big W in its own end-of-year results, saying sales were hurt by \"the ongoing Big W transformation plan\".\n\"Issues with implementation … led to low stock availability in a number of categories, impacting sales,\" the company said.\nWhen asked about the problems with Project Galaxy on Tuesday, a Woolworths spokeswoman said the issues were mostly resolved.\n\"BIG W has worked with suppliers through this process and thanks them for their patience during this time,\" she said.\nThe struggling chain's earnings before tax dropped 25 per cent to $114.2 million in 2015.\nBefore leaving the company, Mr McGeorge had forecast a return to profit growth in 2016 off the back of revitalised product offering.\nHead of retail services Penny Winn is Big W's acting managing director while Woolworths looks for a permanent replacement for Mr McGeorge, along for a replacement for chief executive Grant O'Brien.\nSome retail analysts have called on Woolworths to sell Big W along with hardware chain Masters, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's David Errington has said it would free up more than $3 billion of capital and $1 billion of working capital .\npatrick.hatch@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:35:57.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
