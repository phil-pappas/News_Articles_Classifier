While I lack a background in \"rocket propulsion\" I have shared my concerns on several occasions foreshadowing this uncomfortable volatility. The word uncomfortable, for many investors especially those in or near retirement age, is a spot-on description of the market volatility this year as the S&P500 has swung from a high of +3% YTD gain in May 2015 to a low of -9% YTD loss in August 2015.\nWhen the market gets tough it's time to ask the tough questions of whoever is helping you manage your wealth. As this market volatility accelerates and you see more \"minuses\" on your monthly statements here are 3 do-or-die questions you must get the answers to right now so you're prepared the next correction or crash.\n1) How Much Could I Lose In Another 2008 Crash?\nThis is the million dollar question! Now that the last crash is far behind us we are likely closer to the next crash because the market goes through boom-bust seasons every 7-8 years (it's been 7 years since the last crash began). If you're 45 years old, or older, it's important to understand exactly what kind of risk you're taking with your investment savings. If your advisor can't answer this question or they give you vague response like, \" you're invested pretty conservatively ,\" or \" don't worry about it you'll be ok ,\" you should demand more detail of a potential loss (like -28.4%) because your (not his) life savings is on the line. You can stress test your portfolio for vulnerabilities to a market crash or correction by using tools like Hidden Levers . By simply entering your portfolio holdings you can assess what kind of risks you're taking with your life savings...of course exceptional advisors would already be doing this for you proactively!\n[caption id=\"attachment_490445872\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Know The Answer To This Question: How Much Could I Lose In Another 2008? (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)[/caption] 2) How Can I Diversify AWAY FROM The Market and Hedge My Risk?\nThere's a common belief that if you lower your market risk you also lower your return, but that's simply not true, it can actually be quite the opposite. The stock market, while over the very long-term can help you build wealth, it's not the only gig in town...and that's what the \"smart money\" and Ivy League endowments like Yale, Columbia, and Harvard know. The average financial advisor uses bonds, or worse yet bond funds, to diversify away from the market - both of which are poor options in this environment. You pay a hefty premium to own traditional bonds (which are generally unaffected by the stock market) and you earn next to nothing in interest because bonds are inversely affected by interest rates meaning when interest rates are high, bonds are very attractive and cheap to own, but when interest rates are low bonds are very risky and expensive (where are interest rates now?). It's not that bonds are bad investments, they're just bad to own right now . Bond mutual funds, or fixed income funds, compound the risk of owning bonds in this environment because bond funds are actually bought and sold on the stock market, so you can actually lose money in bond funds when the stock market throws a tantrum.\nTrue wealth advisors bring more to the party than just stocks and bonds. The smartest investment advice incorporates different diversification tools to help you hedge market risk without sacrificing return like opportunistic real estate investments in healthcare and grocery, secured floating income portfolios that can take advantage of rising interest rates, and private equity investments that gives you access to private companies before they become public.\n3) What Are My Total Investment Fees...In Writing?\nMany times the quickest and easiest way to boost investment returns is to lower your total investment fees. For example, consider two identical investment portfolios earning 8% average per year over 30 years with the total investment fees of P ortfolio A at 1% per year versus Portfolio B at 2% per year.\nAt the end of 30 years, Portfolio A is worth $761,255 while Portfolio B is worth $574,349 - the fees in portfolio B gobbled up almost $187,000!\nRarely do I meet anyone (whether they have a wealth advisor or they're a DIY investor) who truly knows and understands their total fees and that's because they're so darn convoluted. The opaqueness of your true investment fees is compounded if you own mutual funds or variable annuities - generally two of the most expensive ways to invest your money because of the layers and layers of fees...those you can see and those that are hidden from sight. For example, I recently met with a retired couple that have used the same trusted advisor for years who's part of a respected chain of strip mall brokerage firms and while they liked their \"guy\" they had no idea of the fees they were paying or risk they were taking so they asked us for some perspective. After some detailed fee analysis we estimated their total investment fees were 2.11% annually , which to them amounted to over $50,000 a year in investment fees - most of which they couldn't see because they were hidden or difficult to uncover. We found that not only were we able to secure their retirement savings by hedging their market risk, but we also were able to lower their fees by over $34,000 per year.\nTo navigate any treacherous market, like the one we're in now, you have to truly understand what your risk is to market losses, different strategies to hedge your investment risk, and how much is going out the door in total investment fees.", "external_links": ["https://www.hiddenlevers.com/hl/leadgen/?lgemb=n&orgkey=CU1644325", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/490445872/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-10-11T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:42:49.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
