Yet that’s the plan for most people — work 30 years doing something they merely tolerate so they can live a fulfilling life later.You don’t have to live like this — there is a way out. You can live a fulfilling, wealthy life sooner than you think.Instead of waiting to retire from your business in 30 years, you can retire into your business in 2-7 years by retiring away from the tasks you hate and moving towards the tasks you love. Get rid of the tasks that are not aligned with who you are and what you’re passion about, and embrace and improve at the tasks that you are passionate about.Here’s why this is so important: an entrepreneur who is passionate about what they do will always outperform the entrepreneur who is only doing what they think needs to be done.It’s the difference between being so passionate about what you do that you search for that one tiny shift in perspective that completely changes the way the world looks at your industry, versus just doing what you know.It’s about making the world feel your impact. It’s about loving what you do. It’s about retiring into your business in 2-7 years. And it all comes from discovering your Soul Purpose.I recently sat down with Derick Van Ness, my friend and Soul Purpose advocate, to discuss how to discover and live your own Soul Purpose. Here’s a sample of what we uncovered:\nWhat Is Soul Purpose? Your Soul Purpose is the greatest expression of three things: Your strengths, t your passions, t and your values. And all three pieces are independently important for different reasons.Says Derick, “Strengths are: What are you really good at? What do you have a natural talent at? What skills have you acquired? What experiences have you had in life that you can bring a unique perspective or insight on?\"Typically some of your strengths will line up with your passions and some of them won’t. And if you’re stuck working in the strengths that you’re not passionate about, it can be difficult to live a life of significance.“I think of passions as gas in the tank,” says Derick, “you can have the best car in the world with the best engine in the world, but if it doesn't have any fuel to run it, that's a problem.”My friend, Dale Clarke, is the perfect example of this. He excelled in his career as a rocket scientist, but he wasn’t passionate about it. He didn’t feel fulfilled until he came to our company, Wealth Factory, where he could apply his strengths to helping people live wealthy today. This brings him energy rather than draining energy.Finally, you must understand your values. What’s most important to you?I once employed a person who valued quantity over quality — and it caused friction with me because I’m exactly the opposite. The person was bringing people into our program who weren’t a good fit simply to increase the numbers, but they were leaving unhappy. This couldn’t work long-term because it didn’t match my Soul Purpose.When you become self-aware enough to know your strengths, passions and values, then you’ll understand your Soul Purpose and how to live it.Living in your Soul Purpose is about doing what you do because you’re clear on who you are and what you’re meant to do right now.When you find it, you don’t tolerate your work, people have to pull you away from your work to make sure you keep a balance. How to Discover Your Soul Purpose To discover your Soul Purpose you have to become clear about your strengths, passions and values. Literally write them down. This isn’t always as easy as it sounds. For example, we tend to undervalue our strengths because they come so natural to us. An artist may look at their work and think anyone could paint the same thing because they discount what comes easily to them plus all the effort that’s gone into improving their talent.So in addition to writing down what you think are your strengths, start listening to what other people say to you. What do they consistently compliment you on? What do they think you’re good at? What do they continually come to you for help for?Think about all of your strengths and then narrow it down. Imagine you’re getting into a boat and you can only take one of your strengths or else the boat will sink — what strength would it be? What strengths would you take if you could have two? What if you could have five?Write down your top 5 strengths.[entity display=\"Next\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"next\" natural_id=\"fred/company/3064\"]Next[/entity], what are your passionate about? What would you do each day even if you didn’t get paid? What would you do each day disregarding all the time and energy you’ve invested to do what you do now?If you’re a dentist, for example, you may feel like your passion is dentistry because there are things you enjoy about it and you’ve invested the majority or your entire professional life towards it. But are there parts of your life as a dentist that you just don’t enjoy? Then “dentistry” is too broad. Write down exactly what it is about being a dentist that you have a passion for, and leave out the parts that drain your energy. You can do the same exercise for whatever industry you’re in.Write down your top 5 passions.Your values are important, too, and also tricky to pin down. Derick shares an exercise for uncovering your values that he picked up from the author, Woody Woodward: “We have things that we think are important, but we also have things that make us feel important, and those aren't always the same thing. What makes us feel important are gateways to understanding our values.”So what makes you feel important? Do you feel important when your business experiences achievements, growth or recognition? Do you feel important when your business demonstrates quality, integrity or authenticity? When are you proud of your business? Those are your values.Write down your top 5 values. Live Your Soul Purpose to Retire In Your Business With your 5 strengths, passions and values written down, you have discovered your Soul Purpose. What would it look like if you changed your day-to-day life based on what you’ve written down? What if you spent 80-95% of your time only doing things that aligned with your strengths, that matched your passions and that lived up to your values?For many entrepreneurs, that means working on the business more, and with clients, patients or customers less. For others, it’s the exact opposite. I can’t give you the right answer because it’s unique to your Soul Purpose.When you discover your Soul Purpose and commit to living it every day — maybe by delegating tasks to others that don’t align, or making space to focus on tasks that you love — you are committing to living a fulfilling life now instead of 30 years down the road.It usually takes about 2-7 years to completely move away from the tasks you don’t enjoy. But when you do, you’ll no longer be going to “work,” you’ll be going to your passion. You’ll never want to retire from your business because you’ve already retired into your business by getting rid of the tasks that seem like work. And because it’s your passion, you’ll be able to live a life of significance and force the world to feel your impact, while enjoying life along the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:17:46.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
