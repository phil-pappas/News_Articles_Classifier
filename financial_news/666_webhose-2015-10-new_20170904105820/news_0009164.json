That's encouraged it to try to capitalise on its traditionally strong fanbase among UK shoppers. \n\"The fresh look that we have taken is a move from loyalty into a members club,\" Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, M&S executive director marketing, told reporters. \n\"We believe the time is right for M&S to be introducing Sparks today ... But most importantly we could not have done it before.\" \nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters in June M&S was looking into launching the Sparks scheme. \nLoyalty cards, pioneered by Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) 's Clubcard two decades ago, are widespread throughout Britain's retail sector. \nBut unlike the purely transaction-based schemes offering generic discounts run by many other chains, Sparks membership rewards M&S customers across food, fashion, home and beauty with tailor-made offers, priority access to new season previews and \"sale\" products, as well as invitations to special events. \nFor M&S shoppers who register, points -- or Sparks -- are awarded every time they make a purchase, for every 1 pound they spend, and every time they write a product review or donate old clothes to charity. Also, each time customers use a Sparks card, M&S will donate 1 pence to a charity of their choice. \nIn July, M&S reported a dip in first-quarter underlying sales in its key clothing, shoes and homeware business, a setback after a return to growth in the previous quarter raised hopes it had rediscovered a winning formula. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in M&S are up nearly a quarter over the last year but have fallen 2 percent over the last week after some analysts forecast another fall in general merchandise like-for-like sales in its second quarter and cut profit forecasts. \nM&S' first half results will be published on Nov. 4.
