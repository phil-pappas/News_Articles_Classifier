They are opting to regain control by reimposing boundaries such as keeping certain nights free to eat together, or banning mobile phones from the dining table.\nYou can have a sit-down meal in a supermarket and buy your dinner in a petrol station. It can be overwhelming\nMark Price\nLaunching the chain’s Food and Drink Report 2015 on Wednesday, Waitrose’s managing director, Mark Price, said the shift in behaviour was characterised by time-poor consumers buying food on the go and for the evening ahead. In London, 40% of Waitrose sales are after 5pm, for example, as people grab dinner on the way home from work.\nTop-ups used to be unplanned; now they’re deliberate Price , who is stepping down from the chain next April and is tipped to become Channel 4 chairman , said: “As society changes, so does the nature of shopping. It is more informal and flexible than ever before. High streets are seeing significant changes: today you can get a panini in a newsagent, a newspaper in a coffee shop, have a sit-down meal in a supermarket and buy your dinner in a petrol station. It can be overwhelming.”\nJon Arnold, Waitrose head of operations and trading, convenience, added: “It used to be that ‘topping up’ in a convenience store was unplanned and not particularly desired. But now shoppers deliberately work it into their weekly routine. They buy bulky food online, or all in one go, and then nip out in the week to buy dinner for that night.”\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The first Oxo TV advert, screened in 1983. Mealtimes today are more informal than ever, the report says\nThe report’s findings are based on millions of transactions and feedback from Waitrose customers, as well as separate sessions with focus groups and further polling on a range of food-related topics.\nWaitrose this year revealed plans to create 2,000 jobs as it embarks on a store-opening spree following strong Christmas trading. The retailer, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, is opening a further 14 shops this year, split between supermarkets and Little Waitrose convenience shops.\nRelated: Customer shopping habits pop back to the 70s, says John Lewis\nIn the report, a third of consumers say that “pausable” TVs and services such as Netflix and iPlayer mean fewer TV dinners in our homes. Yet mealtimes are more informal than ever: one in seven families use their dining room less than they used to, while a quarter of us regularly eat “al fresco”.\nMicrowave rules the kitchen roost In its spotlight on specific food and drink trends, the report reveals the impact of gadgets on specialist ingredients. Waitrose now sells more pre-chopped frozen fruit than frozen pizza thanks to the rise of juicing, while the spiraliser craze, which turns courgettes into ribbons, or courgetti, has boosted sales of the vegetable by 10% over the past year. Nevertheless, the microwave still rules the kitchen roost, with half of all consumers surveyed saying they use it more than any other gadget.\nThis year’s mild winter and early spring have produced bumper UK crops, including the earliest-ever start to the British strawberry season in March. British-produced rapeseed oil – including brands such as Hillfarm in east Suffolk as well as Waitrose’s own brand – has elbowed aside pricier olive oil as the fastest-selling oil in the UK.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Avocado is the most pinned food on Pinterest, and roasted tomato and avocado toast is the fourth most watched recipe on Waitrose’s YouTube channel.

Avocado is the most pinned food on Pinterest in the UK, while roasted tomato and avocado toast is the fourth most watched recipe on the Waitrose TV channel on YouTube.\nFor the older generation, food has become “exciting where it was once functional”. Waitrose reports that newly retired men are signing up in large numbers to its cookery school courses. Claire Lanze, head chef of the Waitrose cookery school in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: “They’re one of our fastest growing student groups, so we’ve started trialling courses aimed specifically at them.”", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/user/Waitrose", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4deme%2Fsfb%23img-3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4deme&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287%2F0_1279_3200_1920%2F3200.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287/0_1279_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=35cf283024551833ca4d52db17294bfc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb/0_118_2511_1507/master/2511.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=d97faf6bfbd8e05bfd467630a548fbe8", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4deme%2Fsfb%23img-2&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4deme&picture=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ffec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb%2F0_118_2511_1507%2F2511.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287/0_1279_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=315697efcb92545dcc787bbc72aaac47", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287/0_1279_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=445&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=169f569a75257830152a5b8a1fa254b2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb/0_118_2511_1507/master/2511.jpg?w=300&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=70d70ca20cc83ad31900b586f35bd5a8", "http://www.waitrose.com/home/inspiration/waitrose_cookeryschool.html", "http://www.waitrose.com/foodreport", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Britons+shop+as+if+they%27re+on+holiday+%E2%80%93+little+and+often&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2015%2Foct%2F21%2Fbritish-shop-holiday-little-often-waitrose-consumer-supermarket-food&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2Ffec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb%2F0_118_2511_1507%2F2511.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb/0_118_2511_1507/master/2511.jpg?w=605&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=275ddf0c0cf753327924a261c5f27f0e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287/0_1279_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=6b5e4e7f36c75376f2555867cf943e72", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Britons%20shop%20as%20if%20they", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?description=Britons+shop+as+if+they%27re+on+holiday+%E2%80%93+little+and+often&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2015%2Foct%2F21%2Fbritish-shop-holiday-little-often-waitrose-consumer-supermarket-food&media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.guim.co.uk%2F08366a25fc86ee99a0e78c9c4a35dbfea358e287%2F0_1279_3200_1920%2F3200.jpg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fec9e3c3ef1f82b75b9afa6e9784089b054ee0eb/0_118_2511_1507/master/2511.jpg?w=620&q=85&auto=format&sharp=10&s=bbf4609dc53f3a2e66c007565b38a7f6"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:43:36.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
