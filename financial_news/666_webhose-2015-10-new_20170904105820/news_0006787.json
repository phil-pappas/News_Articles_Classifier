Louie Douvis But it's worth keeping in mind that rates over a 30-year period would be subject to frequent change, said Mortgage Choice spokeswoman Jessica Darnbrough.\n\"It will definitely have an impact on customers... but I don't think it will be a break-the-bank impact,\" she said.\nMs Darnbrough said while the move wasn't entirely surprising, given recent requirements for banks to hold more capital against mortgages, it does not follow the unspoken protocol of waiting for the Reserve Bank.\nIt's common for the banks take their cues from the Reserve Bank, which at its most recent meeting left the official cash rate on hold.\n However, growing concerns from the regulator about how much capital Australia's major banks are holding to cover the money they lend out. Since the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) told banks to increase their capital holdings, investor loans have been the primary target of big bank rate moves.\nStart looking around The message from mortgage brokers is do your homework to get a better deal.\n\"If they're not happy with the fact their interest rates are going up, it's time to look around to non-bank lenders, credit unions, building societies, even the majors,\" Ms Darnbrough said.\nJohn Kolenda, a mortgage broker with 1300 Home Loans, expects all of the major banks to lift rates on owner occupier loans in the next six to nine months as banks balance the demands of their customers and their shareholders.\nBut there are still bargains for owner occupiers in the market, with some lenders offering rates of 4.5 per cent, he stressed.\n\"On the brighter side of things, there are some lenders that are aggressively pricing owner occupying loans,\" he said.\n\"It's definitely worthwhile really keeping your eye on the marketplace and doing a comparison and I think you have to do that at the minimum on an annual basis.\"\nHe said the RBA's moves were \"almost irrelevant\" and the onus was on borrowers to do their due diligence.\nMs Darnbrough agreed the other banks could take the lead from Westpac. \"They may hold fire for the time being to see the reaction to Westpac's move, but I won't be surprised if they move.\"\nIn announcing the rate hike on Wednesday, the chief of Westpac's consumer bank George Frazis said it was \"a difficult decision and one that is not taken lightly\".\n\"We acknowledge that it does impact customers, even in an environment where interest rates remain near historic lows,\" he said.\nWe have sought to carefully balance the needs of our borrowers, depositors and our shareholders, as well as the competitive market we operate in. Increases in the cost of doing business inevitably influence business decisions, including price,\" Mr Frazis said.\nThe new rates will take effect from November 20.\nELIZABETH KNIGHT: Westpac rate rise ushers end of the property boom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:34:24.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
