Detailed description Praise for Trading with Intermarket Analysis\"John Murphy makes it absolutely clear that all markets are interrelated. It would be silly to trade stocks without keeping an eye on interest rates, currencies, and gold. In this valuable new book, the master of technical analysis teaches all of us how to monitor and profit from intermarket relationships.\"--Dr. ALEXANDER ELDER, author of The New Trading for a Living, www.elder.com\"Murphy's basic premise is that a trader's analysis needs to extend beyond the market itself to also encompass interrelationships with other markets--a broader perspective that is essential not only in understanding the big picture but also in providing valuable early warning signs through lead-lag relationships. The best part of Trading with Intermarket Analysis is that these critical market interactions are vividly illustrated with more than 150 color charts, providing valuable food for thought not only for chartists but also fundamentalists, as an understanding of intermarket connections is essential for all traders. One lesson I have learned from interviewing market wizards is that intermarket price action provides essential trading clues. In this context, Murphy's book offers traders a valuable resource and idea repository.\"--JACK SCHWAGER, author of Market Wizards and the Schwager on Futures book series\"In today's lightning-fast, interconnected global markets, savvy traders capitalize and profit on intermarket movements. Murphy's new book shows traders how to read the charts and understand intermarket dynamics in an easy-to-understand visual fashion. Learn how to utilize ETFs to trade and profit off these key market drivers. Long a friend to the TraderPlanet.com community, Murphy once again shines with his latest must-read book for all traders.\"--LANE J.
