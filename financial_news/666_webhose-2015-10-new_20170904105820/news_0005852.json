Josh Robenstone Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer has poured cold water on calls from the industry superannuation lobby for the government to dump plans to strip unions of board roles at super funds.\nUnder the government's plan, all super funds will be required to have one-third of board seats filled by independent directors from July 2017, and a majority of independent directors on an \"if not why not\" basis by July 2019. The shake-up is designed to break equal representation model of industry funds, whereby employer and employee groups each nominate 50 per cent of directors.\nIndustry Super Australia chairman Peter Collins, a former Liberal politician and NSW Treasurer, this week urged Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to scrap its super governance legislation as a sign that he is prepared to run a consultative government .\nMs O'Dwyer told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday that she planned to push ahead with the reforms tabled by her predecessor Josh Frydenberg.\nThe legislation was a \"very measured and balanced\" response to the recommendations of the 2010 Super System Review chaired by Jeremy Cooper and the 2014 Financial System Inquiry chaired by David Murray, she said.\nMs O'Dwyer said the changes would also bring the governance of Australia's super sector \"in line with international best practice\".\nFinal submissions to the senate committee reviewing the proposed reforms are due on Thursday.\nCrossbenchers have been subject to fierce lobbying by groups representing industry and bank-owned super funds. Ricky Muir organised a roundtable discussion on Tuesday between crossbench senators and Industry Super Australia. He also chaired a question and answer session with representatives from the Financial Services Council. A spokesman for Senator Muir said he was still considering his position.\n Tom Garcia, CEO of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees – the peak body for all non-profit funds, including industry, corporate and public sector funds – said he was hopeful of the reforms getting voted down in the senate.\n\"The crossbenchers have a good track record of supporting consumer protection, which fundamentally is what having both members and employers on the boards of super funds in all about, and many share our concerns that these changes are ideologically driven and not in members' best interests\".\nDefining independence The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA), which represents both retail and industry funds, has supported the push for funds to be forced to appoint one third of independent directs but opposes the legislation in its current form.\n\"We have a number of concerns with the legislation, including a poorly worded definition of independence that would have the unintended consequence of disqualifying suitable sitting independents,\" ASFA chief executive Pauline Vamos​ said.\n\"Removing the equal representation model for the remaining two thirds of directors and replacing the two-thirds majority voting rule with a simple majority is also worrying.\"\nIndustry Super Australia CEO David Whiteley criticised the bill for \"dismantling the governance structure of the successful non-profit super sector while not addressing the scandals and underperformance of the bank-owned sector\".\nThe Financial Services Council (FSC), which represents retail wealth managers, has been a driving force in advocating for the new independent director rules. The peak body already requires its members to have a majority of independent directors.\n\"It makes sense that those funds which manage our compulsory savings for forty years or more have good governance in place. The proposed minimalist reforms are supported by a range of advocacy groups including consumer groups,\" FSC chief executive Sally Loane said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:32:51.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
