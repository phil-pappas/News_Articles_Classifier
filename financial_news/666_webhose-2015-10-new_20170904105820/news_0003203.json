We will be more efficient, will reorganise our product range and core technologies and with the accelerated efficiency measures, we will have more room for trend-setting new technologies,\" Diess said. \nVW is currently battling its biggest-ever scandal after it was forced to admit last month that it had fitted 11 million cars worldwide with devices aimed at cheating pollution tests. \nThe affair threatens to cost the group, which is the world's biggest car maker in terms of sales, many billions of euros in fines and legal costs. And the fallout in terms of lost sales and customer trust is still incalculable. \nThe group's chief executive Martin Winterkorn stepped down as a result of the scandal. \nBrand chief Diess vowed to implement the measures with \"all our strength\". \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) in difficult times, the Volkswagen team has again and again proved\" its mettle, Diess added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:12:56.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
