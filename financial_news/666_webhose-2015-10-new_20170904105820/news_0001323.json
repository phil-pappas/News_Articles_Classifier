Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Walking into Skylight at Moynihan Station for Microsoft's Windows 10 devices announcement I was nervous. In fact, I'd been nervous for a few days. You see, pretty much every device I own is made by Apple. I have the new iPhone 6s, a MacBook Pro, a MacBook Air, an iPad and an iPod.\nI was prepared to attract a few sideways glances from the other event attendees when I pulled out my devices.\nBut I was wrong. A telling sign of the times, it seemed the majority of media attending the event were also using iPhones – rose gold coloured to be precise.\nMany of them also had Windows and Android phones, but they were all using their iPhones.\nThe second surprise was that Microsoft didn't seem to mind that I was using Apple products either. I'm sure the company representatives would have been happier to see me using a Windows phone, but realism seems to have kicked in and they now genuinely seemed to want me to get the most out of what ever Microsoft products I did use – Skype, Outlook, Xbox and so on.\nCross-brand approach The Surface Book is two times faster than the MacBook Pro. Bloomberg This cross-brand approach is a core part of Microsoft's strategy, and it's a clever one. Rather than turning away users who own different products, as we would have expected of the old Microsoft, it welcomes them into the fold, in the hope they will consider using a Microsoft product in the future.\nWhen it comes to brand loyalty I'm a pretty hard nut to crack, not so much because I deeply care about particular brands, but because once something works, I don't feel a need to change it.\nAs a member of Gen Y though, I do love a good camera and this is a big selling point of a smartphone to me.\nI was impressed by the quality of the camera in the new Microsoft Lumia 950 and 950 XL. The live photo function worked much better than the iPhone 6s (to the extent that I went back and tried mine again in case I'd been using it incorrectly), the stabilisation capabilities were so good any photographically challenged person could take a good picture and you could see the benefit of having 20 megapixels in the image quality.\n It left me wanting a Lumia 950 – even if it's just to complement my iPhone 6s.\nThe announcement of the Surface Book, the first laptop in the company's history, was a big moment for Microsoft.\nLaptop excitement A man sitting in front of me was totally freaking out. Literally sitting on the edge of his seat with excitement, I thought he might faint.\nBy this point in time I was pretty caught up in the excitement too. From the description, the Surface Book sounds pretty great – two times faster than the MacBook Pro and millions more pixels as a start. But as I looked at the device after the announcement I couldn't escape the feeling that, design-wise, it looked and felt just like a MacBook Pro.\nThat said, the backlit keyboard and five-point multi-touch trackpad was fantastic. The touch-enabled, detachable screen using the fulcrum hinge was also a cool innovation.\nMy hesitation with the product is simply around whether or not the changes are big enough to get MacBook users to switch, especially given the high price point. As a young 20-something with bills to pay, when my laptop needs replacing, I won't be able to afford a Surface Book or a MacBook Pro, even though I'd like to.\nDuring the event, the HoloLens demonstration of Project X-Ray was the first thing that really got my attention. I'm not a gamer, but I might become one in the future with this product.\nThe game, an augmented reality shooter, uses HoloLens' spatial mapping capabilities to make robot enemies appear out of the user's surroundings.It's just the start of what's to become a more personal, immersive era of gaming and it's an area where Microsoft could really excel, especially given the Xbox fan base which already exists.\nBefore I left for New York, a few friends asked me if I was going to come back a Microsoft convert. Having now been, my answer is: I don't know if I'd go that far, but sign me up for a Surface Pro 4. I definitely want one of those.\nI think we're on the verge of seeing some big things from Microsoft, now it just needs to work on further developing its app store in the smartphone market and hitting some home runs on the innovation front that really distinguishes its products from Apple's.\nYolanda Redrup attended the Windows 10 devices announcement as a guest of Microsoft.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3rNIxMlKmI", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-12T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:02:51.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
