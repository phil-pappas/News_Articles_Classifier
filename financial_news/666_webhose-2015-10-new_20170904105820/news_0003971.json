It is what he's been doing since Jaws (1975), the film that put him on the map. Today the name \"Spielberg\" is synonymous with a certain style of Hollywood entertainment – lavish, detail-perfect sets; music that provides all the emotional cues; sharp plotting, editing and continuity; and a peculiarly American sentimentality that makes one think of Frank Capra.\nBridge of Spies has all of these characteristics, but it might be the leanest, driest film Spielberg has ever made. This must be partly because of Joel and Ethan Coen, who have reworked a script by Matt Charman, adding some of the je-ne-sais-quoi of their own movies.\nThere are spy films that are no better than cartoons, as with most of the James Bond series, and others, such as The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965), that creep along in the shadows. Spielberg's tale is firmly in the latter category, a low-key narrative with little overt action, in which tension builds by degrees. It is an almost exclusively masculine story without a love interest, a secret game played by men.\nMark Rylance as Rudolf Abel, Russian spy, and Tom Hanks as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who undertakes the mission of his life in Bridge of Spies. Jaap Buitendijk It begins in 1957, the height of the Cold War, when tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union were escalating. We watch a grey, sallow man, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) painting a self-portrait in a cheap Manhattan hotel room. When he walks out into the street, FBI agents swarm like flies.\nSoon Abel is arrested, and his trial becomes front-page news. As a Russian spy he is widely expected to be convicted and executed, like the Rosenbergs. Yet because this is the Land of the Free, due process must be seen to be observed and a credible defence attorney appointed. That dubious honour falls on the shoulders of James B Donovan (Tom Hanks), a New York insurance lawyer, who is pressured into taking the case as a matter of patriotic duty.\nFacts of the matter Because this film is based on real events it's worth noting that the real Donovan did defend Rudolf Abel, but only after a number of other lawyers refused. He was not quite as ignorant of military and intelligence matters as the Tom Hanks character because he had been an assistant at the Nuremberg trials in 1945.\nLéa Seydoux plays the Loner leader in the surreal \"dating drama\", The Lobster. For the purposes of this story Donovan is transformed into a simple insurance lawyer whose fundamental belief in justice and the American Constitution prompts him to fight fiercely for his client's rights, even though the judge, the media and the public consider the verdict a foregone conclusion.\nA few years later, when an American pilot, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down over Soviet air space and held captive, Donovan's experience makes him the leading candidate to negotiate a swap of prisoners.\nTo undertake this top-secret mission Donovan must travel to Berlin, telling his wife and family that he is going on a business trip to London. In fact he is plunging headlong into the world of espionage we know so well from the novels of John le Carré and Len Deighton. In East Berlin, newly concealed behind a concrete wall, Donovan will meet the predictably sinister, enigmatic functionaries of the communist powers.\nThe complication in his mission is that an American student, Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), has got himself arrested by the East Germans. Against the advice of his CIA handlers, Donovan wants both Powers and Pryor in return for Abel. It's the same two-for-one deal we've heard him discussing in relation to an insurance claim at the start of the film.\nColin Farrell plays David in The Lobster. Recently separated from his wife, he is accompanied by his brother, Bob, who has been transformed into a dog ... An all American hero Donovan emerges as a man of rare integrity, unsullied by his foray into the murky world of international espionage. He is one of Spielberg's true American heroes, the living embodiment of those values enshrined in the Constitution. He seems even more heroic for being a humble insurance lawyer rather than the experienced operator he was in real life, let alone a cartoon character in cape and leotards.\nHanks' Donovan is an Everyman figure, with a wife and kids straight out of a TV sitcom. There are moments when this portrait verges on parody, as we have to reconcile the character's obvious sophistication with the same All-American traits that Hanks brought to his portrayals of Forrest Gump or Larry Crowne.\nOne can detect the hand of the Coen brothers in the way Donovan represents the ordinary man struggling to cope with extraordinary circumstances. Spielberg adds the moral dimension and the message. For although this is a film about the Cold War, one thinks inevitably of the way political prisoners have been treated in the United States during the so-called War on Terror.\nRylance plays Abel in such a colourless fashion that it's hard to reconcile his presence with the angry mobs of patriots baying for blood. Donovan sees his client as a good soldier who has merely done hs duty, and this is the perception conveyed to the viewer. The emphasis is on a shared humanity, not political differences. In a war, even a Cold War, the combatants must behave honourably towards their opponents.\nThe Americans have a special obligation to act in a morally upright manner, because they are only too aware of the hypocrisy of the Soviet system. As with Lincoln , Spielberg has given us a historical film in which we see an oblique but unmistakable reflection of the present.\nThe Lobster\nDirected by Yorgos Lanthimos\nWritten by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou\nStarring Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Léa Seydoux, Ben Wishaw, John C Reilly, Olivia Colman, Jessica Barden, Angeliki Papoulia\nIreland/Britain/Greece/France/Netherlands, rated MA 15+, 118 minutes\nYorgos Lanthimos could never be accused of a lack of originality. All over the world, one imagines viewers wandering out of The Lobster asking: \"So what was that about?\" If I say it's an allegory, that will do little to ease the confusion. Think of the late, deadpan surrealist comedies of Luis Bunuel and you'll be in the right zone.\nThe story is set in a not-too-distant future. In this world, men and women who find themselves single, either through death or divorce, are sent to \"The Hotel\", where they are given 45 days to fall in love and pair off with a new partner. If they fail to do so they will be transformed into the animal of their choice.\nThe guests can buy a little time by shooting \"Loners\" with a tranquiliser dart when they are taken out on hunting trips to the woods. The Loners are rebels who have opted out of the system to live in small groups in the wilderness. A hotel guest can extend the date of their transformation by shooting and capturing Loners.\nThe ground rules We enter The Hotel with David – played with glasses, moustache and paunch by Colin Farrell – who has recently separated from his wife. He is accompanied by his brother Bob, who has been transformed into a dog. For David's first night he must have one hand tied behind his back, which makes undressing for bed into a gymnastic exercise.\nThe guests wear the neat, ordinary clothes provided in a wardrobe and eat in a large dining room, where they are entertained by the manager and her husband, with a highly original rendition of Something's Got a Hold of My Heart. They will also be shown instructive vignettes on the advantages of being two rather than one.\nGuests are identified by their traits rather than names. John C Reilly is Lisping Man, while Ben Whishaw is Limping Man, who fancies his chances with Nosebleed Woman (Jessica Barden). David, for his part, will set his sights on the Heartless Woman (Angeliki Papoulia), who is a champion shooter of Loners. Much of the conversation revolves around the guests' choice of animal for possible transformation. David has decided to be a lobster, because he has always liked the sea. He appreciates the fact that a lobster lives for a long time, enjoys life-long fertility, and has blue blood like an aristocrat. At this point, viewers may be thinking of Salvador Dali's lobster telephone.\nNo love, no sex for Loners Before he reaches the final stage David flees the hotel and joins the Loners, who prove to be just as intractable. Their leader, Léa Seydoux, enforces a strict no-love, no-sex, policy. Everyone must dig their own grave, as a condition of membership. Now that he is prohibited from falling in love, David promptly forms a perilous attachment to Short Sighted Woman (Rachel Weisz).\nThe Lobster envisages a world that treats being alone as a criminal act, in which those who fail to comply forfeit the right to be human. The tyranny of the one-to-one relationship is absolute, as is the urge to match people with similar traits. Limping Man, for example, gives himself nose-bleeds to attract Nosebleed Woman. This need to share one's faults leads to alarming conclusions in David's choice of partners.\nHaving escaped the land of compulsory couplings, the Loners are no less doctrinaire in ensuring that individuals avoid every trace of romance. Their act of rebellion means submission to another form of mind control.\nLanthimos, and his fellow scriptwriter Efthymis Filippou, have isolated a social attitude and extrapolated it into an oppressive law. The human fear of being alone has bred a society in which solitude has been vanquished, while the logic of the dating agency, with its mechanical listing of shared interests, has become a New World Order. In the benign concentration camp of The Hotel, this matching of personalities has become fixated on shared disabilities. Beneath the surreal trappings it's a highly recognisable scenario.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/z069ldsumxA"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:07:33.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
