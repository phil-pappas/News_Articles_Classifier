That's not the sentiment of only grumbling left-leaning ideologues. Captains of industry -- Dominic Barton , global managing director of McKinsey & Co.; billionaire investor Nick Hanauer ; and real estate investor Jeff Greene , for example -- warn of the dangers that could face American capitalism. Seventy-seven percent of millionaires see it as a top economic concern.But aside from all the talk, going on for years now, little has happened. That should be no surprise. As Paul Theroux pointed out in the New York Times, most of the discussion has been just that: words. The problem is that the income for the most well off has been bolstered by financial distribution from those who had far less. Jobs were sent overseas to reduce costs, a move that helped keep real income flat, or worse, for most of the country.If you look at the shares of aggregate income by each fifth economic fifth, as well as by the top 5 percent, has shifted dramatically from 1967 to 2014. In that early year of the range, the lowest fifth held 4 percent, a number that would drop to 3.1 percent. The second lowest fifth went from 10.8 percent to 8.2 percent. Middle fifth: 17.3 percent in 1967 to 14.3 percent in 2014. The second highest and highest fifths went, respectively, from 24.2 percent and 43.6 percent to 23.2 percent and 51.2 percent. And the top 5 percent, which had 17.2 percent, now has 21.9 percent.[caption id=\"attachment_4b47fc98b6e140c4a8f7d4816004e084\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Pope Francis talks to the people gathered in front of Quito's Cathedral, in Ecuador, Monday, July 6, 2015.

Still, talk of income inequality, even if honestly actually meant, falls short. That is because the attention is too often on expecting to improve things in the short run by having CEOs make less and workers, more. But even with elevated salaries, there are typically so many workers to the one CEO -- or even a handful of top corporation officers -- that redistributed money would not amount to that much per person.That is because the focus on the CEOs alone is misdirected. The majority of money directed away from ordinary workers goes to major stockholders or to the corporation itself, not to a handful of people at the top. More importantly, the attention on income inequality is short-sighted, because the real issue is wealth, not income.Higher income does, absolutely, provide more comfort and greater possibilities. But that pales when compared to the advantage offered by family wealth, which represents the accumulated income advantages over time.Gini coefficients are measurements of financial inequality, with values running from zero (everyone has the same amount) to one (only one person has all the financial value). Typically, you hear of Gini coefficients when it comes to income. The income Gini coefficient for the U.S. is roughly 41, according to the World Bank.However, apply the concept to personal wealth and things change. In its Global Wealth Report 2015, global financial services firm Allianz calculated that the wealth Gini coefficient is 80.6, the single largest in the world. That continued shift of income share from the bottom to the top has helped reinforce the true wall that keeps the insiders in and outsiders out.That wealth becomes the head start in a race, like setting putting someone on the putative starting line and another, on the 90 meter mark in a 100-meter dash. By talking almost completely about income inequality, the country essentially pretends that a problem made over decades can be addressed on a single year's scale. It can't mathematically work.", "external_links": ["http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/new-economy/2015/0124/At-Davos-rising-income-inequality-worries-some-billionaires-too", "http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2014/h02AR.xls", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/4b47fc98b6e140c4a8f7d4816004e084/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI", "http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/nick-hanauer-ted-talk-income-inequality-controversy", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/the-hypocrisy-of-helping-the-poor.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0", "https://www.allianz.com/v_1443702256000/media/economic_research/publications/specials/en/AGWR2015_ENG.pdf", "http://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/millionaires-are-also-worried-about-rising-income-inequality-n294561", "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/11/26/the-high-price-of-rising-income-inequality/"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:46:58.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
