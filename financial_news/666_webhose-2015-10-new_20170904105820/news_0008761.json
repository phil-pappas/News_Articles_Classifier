The program was introduced in 2010 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and expanded to the Americas, Asia and Australia in 2012. Past efforts have focused on a diverse array of works including Henri Matisse's “The Swimming Pool”at the Museum of Modern Art in New York; four Tudor paintings at National Portrait Gallery in London, England; three Watanabe Kazan paintings at the Tokyo National Museum; and Rembrandt’s “Scholar in His Study” at the National Gallery in Prague.

The company’s support for the arts is diverse, and includes loans of its art collection to museums at no cost, sponsorships, grants to arts organizations for arts education, and the preservation of cultural treasures.
