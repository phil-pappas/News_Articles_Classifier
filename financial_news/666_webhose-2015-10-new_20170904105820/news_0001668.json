Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Brian Hartzer may be standing out there on his lonesome for now with Westpac's surprise decision to raise interest rates next month . He's unlikely to be isolated for long. The other three big banks will be delighted Westpac has made it easy to play follow the leader.\nA general rate rise, even of only 20 basis points, inevitably means a shock to Australian consumer confidence accustomed to rates staying low indefinitely or perhaps going lower. And while the familiar Australian sport of bank bashing has been on leave of absence, it won't take much to start up again in such a low-inflation, low-growth environment.\nIt certainly makes it more likely that the Reserve Bank will be inclined to counter any negative sentiment with its own reduction in the cash rate next month. The RBA has been reluctant to cut rates any more, in part because of the expected impact on what has been a surging Sydney housing market.\nBut for the banks, the basic equation remains the same. There's a cost to the need to hold more capital to balance their mortgage lending and they would rather have their customers pay some of that than their shareholders.\nBrian Hartzer of Westpac appeared before a Senate Committee at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 10 August 2015.

Or at least seem safer.\nMatching tougher global standards Whether having higher capital-adequacy-to-lending ratios would actually alter much in a full-blown international financial crisis is far more dubious. But the stance by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is a form of national insurance deemed necessary to be seen to match tougher global banking standards as well as the heavy dependence of Australian banks on a super-expensive housing market.\nAPRA's new rules , for example, require a 25 per cent average risk weighting for mortgages for the big banks from July next year – compared to 16 per cent at present. That means that 25 per cent of the worth of mortgage loans will soon be counted in measuring the amount of the more expensive capital necessary to be held against them. This translates into slightly less profitable leverage on the lending for housing that so dominates Australian banks' books.\n The big four still have more leeway than the smaller banks which, to their fury, are stuck at a 35 per cent risk weighting on their own mortgage lending. That's supposedly because they have less sophisticated systems for assessing risk. Hmm.\nBut the built in advantage of the majors will still diminish, along with their prospective returns on investment.\nBank returns have also been bolstered by bad-debt provisions also holding at record lows. That happy setting can't last forever no matter how much Malcolm Turnbull exudes confidence about Australia's future economic prospects.\nSo Westpac's move on rates – as well as its belated decision to join its peers in a multibillion-dollar capital raising – is evidence of the majors' determination to give their own shareholders more comfort that it can still be business-as-usual in Australian banking.\nAnd for all the enthusiasm among banking executives for backing start-ups and innovation and investing in technology to counter disruption, that effectively means continuing a profitable pattern of operating as huge building societies reliant on the growth of the domestic mortgage market.\nRepricing protects margins What is politely known as \"repricing\" helps protect margins as long as they can get away with it. Of course, one or more of the major banks could decide to try for competitive advantage by not matching Westpac on mortgage interest rates, especially ANZ or NAB, which are now focused on expanding their market share.\nBut this still seems unlikely given the usual preference for safety in numbers in any rates move. Under former CEO Cameron Clyne, for example, NAB did attempt to sell a \"break-up\" campaign with its peers by promising it would always offer the lowest rates. It has since moved on to other branding, given a much changed environment and the need to protect its margins.\nNAB's current chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, had a long-scheduled speech shortly after the Westpac announcement on Wednesday. When questioned, he emphasised the mortgage market was a \"core segment\" but that NAB would react to the market and review its position \"'on an ongoing basis\".\nThat's bankerspeak for \"watch this space\".\nHe and others had not expected the timing of Westpac's announcement on rates – although the announcement of a $3.5 billion capital raising was probably less of a surprise despite Hartzer's recent argument that Westpac could manage to raise more capital through dividend reinvestment plans. All the banks have been doing versions of this to move comfortably ahead of APRA's requirements.\nWestpac had already raised $2 billion of new equity through a dividend reinvestment plan, but the recent volatility in the market reinforced the need to act quickly.\nThe rate rise comes on top of earlier moves by the big banks to raise rates and restrict lending for investors only after warnings from the Reserve Bank and APRA in an attempt to slow a booming housing market, especially in Sydney and Melbourne.\nThat seems to have at least a modest effect so far, despite the continued flood of Chinese investment.\nHartzer insists the magnitude of regulatory capital increases and the relatively tight timetable for implementation has an inevitable impact on overall pricing.\n\"This was a difficult decision, and one that was not taken lightly,\" he told analysts. \"We understand it has an impact on customers, even in an environment where interest rates are near historical lows. We accept the regulators have ruled on challenges, but these changes impact on the cost of providing mortgages.\"\nIn other words, don't blame us.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:03:29.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
