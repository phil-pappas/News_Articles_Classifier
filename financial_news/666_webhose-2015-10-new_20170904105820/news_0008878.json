Once the approved filing has been made, your compliance professionals can focus on other activities with the peace of mind that they will be alerted once the comment letter has been made available by FINRA and automatically linked to the original filing in cMAX.\nAdditionally, the cMAX Ad Review Module provides:\nSEC 17a-4(f) compliant storage to maintain records A central data repository backed by a secure business continuity plan (BCP) NRS regulatory expertise combined with state-of-the-art technology to deliver a solution consistent with industry best practices A flexible workflow that can be tailored to your firm’s procedures Submission Form Content tailored to your business which informs reporting Optional Single-Sign-On (SSO) to simplify access and ease-of-use\nThe ComplianceMAX compliance technology platform includes modules that support multiple business processes including branch audits, annual disclosures, Form ADV Part 2B supplements, customer complaints, firm element training and rep registration management.\nAbout NRS\nOwned by the Reed Business Information, National Regulatory Service (NRS) is part of Accuity, the global standard for payment efficiency and compliance solutions.
