Quinn Rooney Share on twitter by Michael Smith Woolworths' efforts to win back customers with aggressive price cutting and Aldi's encroachment into the Australian grocery sector are not worrying Coles.\nThe Wesfarmers-owned grocery is continuing to gain market shares despite an increasingly competitive landscape but sales growth is slowing as it cuts prices.\nWith hardware chain Bunnings and Officeworks firing on all cylinders, Kmart delivering a stand-out result, and Target on the road to recovery, Wesfarmers' industrials businesses led by coal are the conglomerate's weak point.\nWhile Coles' sales growth has slowed slightly as food prices decline, it is still winning market share at the expense of its main rival, Woolworths , which is under enormous pressure to reverse declining sales growth.\nColes has reported comparable food and liquor sales growth of 3.6 per cent in the three months ended September 30, which is higher than the market's overall growth of 2.8 per cent. Total sales rose 4.7 per cent.\nThis is a moderate slowdown from 4.0 per cent growth in the previous quarter and is largely due to the fact that food prices are down 1.3 per cent, the biggest drop in two years.\nThis is bad news for Woolworths, which has already invested $200 million in reducing prices this year and is investing $500 million as part of a new price-based marketing campaign. Both Coles and Woolworths are also seeking to contain German discounter Aldi which is increasing its presence in Australia.\nWoolworths is under pressure on all fronts as it hunts for a new chief executive and nears a decision on whether to pull the plug on its loss-making Masters hardware joint venture with US-based Lowe's .\n Coles, in contrast, is delivering strong results despite the competitive pressures. Like Woolworths, Coles is also investing in lower prices which is the main factor behind the deflation story.\nSome of this is a direct response to the changing competitive landscape but some is part of an on-going strategy Wesfarmers has been deploying since 2008.\n\"We will always respond to market conditions and competitive pressures,\" Wesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder says when asked how much of the investment in price and promotions was pre-planned or in response to Woolworths' actions.\nBunnings reported 8.2 per cent comparable sales growth, which is further bad news for Woolworths-owned Masters hardware chain. Analysts have this week been crunching the numbers on a possible exit strategy for the $2.2 billion joint venture.\nWesfarmers expects Bunnings to remain resilient despite concerns about slowing housing markets but admits it will be hard to maintain 8 per cent comparable sales growth. Goyder says Bunnings still has a strong store rollout program but the percentage space increase will come off in the years ahead following a period of staggering growth.\nWesfarmers' industrials businesses are now the conglomerate's weak spot but Goyder was quick to reject one analysts' suggestion that coal could be the company's equivalent of Woolworth's Masters.\nGoyder says they remain strong businesses worth a lot of money but the days when Wesfarmers' industrials operations delivered $800 million in earnings are long behind it in the current depressed commodity price environment.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-10-22T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:04:41.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
