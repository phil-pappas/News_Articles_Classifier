However, there is hardly any traffic at present, leading to a cashflow problem,” a banker said.\nIn a regulatory filing, it said that traffic achieved in FY14 stood at 6.23 MT of multi cargo with 205 major cargo vessels as compared to 6.61 MT with 237 vessels handled in FY13, a drop of 5.75%. Karaikal Port Private Ltd (KPPL) is a subsidiary of Marg Ltd, a infrastructure and real estate developer along the Chennai IT corridor with interest ranging across various areas that include residential projects, commercial real estate projects, SEZs, ports, townships, IT parks and malls.\nAccording to bankers, the rest of the debt is yet to be auctioned. “While Indian Bank has the maximum exposure of around Rs 405 crore, the bank is yet to sell it,” a source added. Banks like Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank , United Bank of India and State Bank of Hyderabad have lend to Karaikal Port. Some private equity firms, including Standard Chartered Private Equity and Ascent Capital, have also invested in the company.\nThe company’s term loans of Rs 1,268 crore were restructured in FY13 with a two-year moratorium ending December 31, 2014 along with an additional funding of Rs 80 crore. In FY14 it reported a net loss of Rs 69 crore on the back of Rs 263 crore in revenues. The company’s debt stood at Rs 1,650 crore in FY14 (latest document available), from Rs 1,619 crore in the previous year.\nMeanwhile, lenders could sell NPAs worth Rs 20,000 crore to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) in FY15 out of more than Rs 90,000 crore of assets put on sale. In FY14, banks had offered assets worth Rs 40,000 crore and ARCs bought loans amounting to Rs 22,000 crore.\nFirst Published on October 02, 2015 12:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:46:20.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
