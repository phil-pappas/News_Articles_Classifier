They want their children and grandchildren to partake in the fun too. More precisely the couple in their 50s want to spread around the bounty from decades of saving and shrewd investing.\nThe challenge is: how much?\nAnd the answer remains very much a point of contention.\n\"We're trying to find where my value of saving and wealth preservation and her value of wanting to share and enjoy it meet,\" says Rich, already retired and collecting a pension worth about $2,100 a month after tax.\n\nYvonne, who is younger by a couple of years, is still working in health care, earning about $75,000 annually. But she would like to retire in the next year or two.\nWhen she does, Yvonne wants to continue helping her family by paying for her grandchildren's post-secondary education -- the way she and Rich did for their own children.\nShe also wants to take the whole family on holidays.\n\"Once a year, we'd like to have fun all together,\" she says, adding she also wants to give her three children about $5,000 each every year.\nOn the surface it wouldn't appear they could afford this largesse. They live modestly. Their home is worth about $250,000, and Yvonne will collect a pension worth about $2,400 a month before taxes when she retires. But their savings are considerable -- about $1.1 million -- and it's this money that would pay for their generosity.\nThe couple ran some numbers and estimate they can manage a combined after-tax income of $75,000 for the next 35 years. That's enough to pay for their living expenses, including plenty of travel. But they figure they will likely need an additional $25,000 after-tax to gift cash to their children annually and pay for the \"family holidays.\"\nThat's why they need a little advice.\n\"We've spent 35 years saving, and now are we really at the point where we want to enjoy retirement for the next 35 years,\" Rich says. \"But it's important to know we will only mac'n'cheese if we want to and that we can do things with our kids and help them out for whatever reason.\"\nPortfolio manager Robert Tetrault with National Bank Financial, who works with high-net-worth clients similar to Rich and Yvonne, says the couple may have seemingly competing ideas about how to manage their wealth.\nBut both can be accommodated with the right investment plan.\nIn fact, Rich and Yvonne are close to achieving their income goal even without any changes to their portfolio -- a conservative mix of mostly low-interest savings and GICs.\n\"Computer models indicate they could achieve an after-tax income of approximately $99,000 per year until age 90 if they continue as they are,\" said Tetrault.\nYet earning an average return on investments of three per cent a year leaves little cushion if inflation is higher than anticipated. While the Bank of Canada aims to keep inflation at about two per cent, prices for some goods and services rise faster than others, including the essentials: housing, food and energy.\nFor this reason, Tetrault suggests Rich and Yvonne build a portfolio that could increase returns slightly to incorporate a little more breathing room for rising costs in the budget.\n\"Clearly, Rich and Yvonne are risk-averse, so we would concentrate on building them a diversified portfolio that would produce the income they need while preserving capital and purchasing power as much as possible.\"\nA laddered bond strategy would be a cornerstone of this approach. This involves allocating a portion of their money to buy bonds with maturities of one to five years. The money would be split evenly -- 20 per cent per year of maturity -- so cash would be readily available annually for income needs. Any surplus cash would then be reinvested in a new five-year to maturity bond.\nThis strategy provides a steady flow of cash for income needs while protecting capital from market volatility. And because maturing bonds are consistently being rolled over to buy new five-year bonds their investments are always taking advantage of the best interest rates available.\nMuch of the remaining portion of their portfolio could be invested in other income-producing assets including dividend-paying blue chip stocks, infrastructure funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\nWhile all of these securities are interest-rate sensitive -- meaning if the Bank of Canada hikes rates, their values can fall -- those losses tend to be offset by the fact the rate hike is a result of the economy and stock market performing well.\nMoreover Rich and Yvonne's work pensions -- more than $60,000 combined before taxes annually -- along with CPP and OAS will provide them with a stable source of guaranteed funding. Consequently they can take on a little more market risk during retirement with a balanced portfolio allocation of 50 per cent equities and 50 per cent fixed income and cash.\n\"Our models indicate that over the last 50 years, this balanced allocation has generated a 6.47 per cent rate of return,\" he says. \"For them this translates to an after-tax income of approximately $120,000 per year for the rest of their lives,\" said Tetrault.\nTo achieve this goal Rich and Yvonne likely require a unified investment plan -- something they currently do not have. Because their assets are held among a few different financial institutions, it might be difficult to manage their money efficiently.\nIn Tetrault's opinion, Rich and Yvonne would benefit from professional, individualized money management for their investments.\nThe option is worth investigating for a few reasons. For one, a portfolio manager would have discretionary control over their assets to adjust asset allocation on a regular basis to keep their income plan on course.\nMoreover, portfolio managers are the only investment advisers who have a clear legal obligation to act in the best interest of clients. So Yvonne and Rich have a layer of assurance recommended strategies benefit them instead of just their adviser.\nEqually important, this type of management is often less costly than other options. Instead of paying two per cent or more annually for a portfolio of mutual funds, for example, Yvonne and Rich would likely pay one per cent or less annually.\nYet perhaps the biggest benefit is professional money management would help ensure their assets are invested in the right account -- be it an RRSP, TFSA or non-registered -- to create an income stream that is tax-efficient to make their money go further.\nFor example, their dividend-yielding Canadian stocks would be mostly held in non-registered accounts because Canadian dividends and capital gains are taxed more favourably than interest from fixed income, and dividends and capital gains from foreign equities.\nProfessional money management could also help them control the flow of cash from their investments so they could receive more money early in retirement when they may be more active while gradually notching down withdrawals as they become eligible for CPP and OAS.\nYet regardless of what direction they choose regarding their investments, the couple is well positioned to spread the wealth around once retired, Tetrault says.\n\"Rich and Yvonne are fortunate because they can make relatively modest changes that can provide a healthy cushion against uncertainty.\"\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:44:20.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
