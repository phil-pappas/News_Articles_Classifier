AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The Turnbull government isn't planning on getting involved in a potential confrontation between the United States and Chinese navies in the South China Sea.\nForeign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister Marise Payne held \"in-depth talks\" with US Secretary of State John Kerry and US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter in Boston on Tuesday about maintaining peace and stability in the oceans around China.\nThey pledged enhanced naval co-operation with the United States - but this does not include the Royal Australian Navy joining any US-led patrols to confront China over disputed islands in the sea zone.\nBut China has nevertheless hit back at earlier comments by Defence Minister Marise Payne who said Australia will oppose 'intimidation' and 'aggression' in the South China Sea.\nThe Chinese embassy in Australia issued a strong rebuke to Ms Payne in a missive on Wednesday, saying their comments on the South China Sea were \"neither responsible or constructive\".\n\"We urge the relevant sides to stop applying [a] double standard. It would be more helpful if they would honour their commitment of not taking sides on relevant disputes and do more to promote regional peace and security...rather than light a fire and add fuel to the flames,\" the embassy spokesman said.\nAnticipation is growing that US warships will soon sail within 12 nautical miles of disputed reefs in the Spratly archipelago that China has defiantly built on in the face of competing territorial claims from The Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam.\n\"Now, make no mistake\", Mr Carter said, \"The United States will fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as we do around the world, and the South China Sea is not and will not be an exception.\"\n Canberra is supportive of Washington's mooted \"freedom of navigation\" exercise to test China, but the naval cooperation announced at the Australia-United States Ministerial consultation does not extend to local ships or naval bases being used to launch such a mission.\nThe port of Darwin is thousands of kilometres from the hotspot and the US is more likely to begin any mission from Japan or other closer Asian allies.\nInstead, the naval agreement largely reiterates plans to ramp up joint training and exercises, with precise details absent at time of the announcement and subject to further discussions between officials.\nAustralian naval boats already operate independently through the South China Sea as a matter of course and will continue to do so.\nAmid tension over Beijing's belligerence, Australia and the US are trumpeting a surprise public statement by President Xi Jinping at the White House last month that China would refrain from militarisation of the artificial islands.\nAn official said Mr Xi's announcement was a shock because he had not mentioned it in his earlier private conversation with President Obama.\n\"We welcome President Xi's statement that they do not intend to militarise the Spratly Islands and we will certainly take some comfort in that and hold them to that statement,\" Ms Bishop said.\nBeijing has previously constructed airstrips and buildings capable of hosting military personnel and hardware on the artificial islands.\nSenator Payne, who was sworn in as Defence Minister last month, said she was committed to the \"full implementation of the US force posture initiatives\", including increasing the American marines rotating through Darwin to 2500, up from 1150 currently.\nThe defence minister and Mr Carter signed a joint statement on defence co-operation, including enhancing the interoperability of their military forces, intelligence co-operation and building co-operation with regional partners.\nIn the battle against Islamic State, which has been complicated by Russia's sudden insurgence to prop up the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, Australia pressed the US for assurances on the safety of its pilots deployed there.\nThe US is close to signing an agreement with Moscow on protocols intended to avoid inadvertent in-air clashes between Kremlin and coalition jets.\nIn Afghanistan, the US will soon make a formal request for Australia to extend the stay of up to 250 troops due to exit the war-torn Middle East country in 2016.\n\"I assured Minister Payne that the United States is absolutely committed to seeing the mission through beyond 2016,\" Mr Carter said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-14T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:26:49.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
