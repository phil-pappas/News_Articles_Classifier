During the week’s trading, the Sensex and the Nifty gained 1%+ and the Bank Nifty made a marginal loss. Clearly, the market has been moving sideways on a weekly basis and is not able to rally. \n\nThe Indian equity markets opened on a lower note on Monday, following a sharp downward revision of Chinese industrial profits. Observers pointed out that negative Asian market cues coupled with anxiety over the upcoming monetary policy review kept the Indian markets subdued. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) on Tuesday cut repo rate (the rate at which the RBI lends money to banks) by 50 basis points to 6.75% from 7.25%. At the same time, the central bank has made a pitch for passing the rate cut to consumers in the form of cheaper personal and commercial credit. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been kept unchanged at 4%. However, the market which was clamouring for a rate cut was surprisingly ambivalent about it after it actually got one. Fears of bank's ability to transmit the easing of monetary policy kept the bellwether indices subdued. The indices had opened deeply in the red, following a huge decline in US markets on Monday night and Asian markets on Tuesday morning. After the rate cut, the equity indices staged a recovery on the back of an unexpectedly high interest rate cut, but strong selling took over later in the last half hour on Tuesday. On Wednesday, with global cues from Asian markets being favourable, and Tuesday’s RBI rate cut in the hand, there was a rally in the main stock indices, leading to the major indices closing with gains of more than 1%. Analysts cited that more than expected monetary easing coupled with a dovish outlook by the country's central bank, strengthening rupee value and stable Asian bourses supported the Indian markets. However, Bank Nifty struggled to rally. Furthermore, the Supreme Court's verdict in favour of Mauritius-based foreign fund Castleton Investment offered more clarity over the applicability of minimum alternate tax (MAT) on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). The verdict is expected to restore FPIs' confidence in the Indian markets and smoothen the nerves of anxious investors. The government has already accepted the Justice A.P. Shah Committee's report on MAT that says the levy should not be applicable on FPIs. On Thursday, the markets made healthy gains within minutes of opening and continued their upward trajectory on the back of Tuesday's monetary easing by the RBI, overnight rally in the US markets, supportive Asian markets and strengthening rupee value. However, the upward momentum lost its steam as the latest Nikkei India Manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Manufacturers Index) for the last month showed a contraction. The PMI was at a seven-month low of 51.2 in September 2015. Markets analysts said the less-than-expected PMI data impacted sentiments and erased the gains made during Thursday's trade, as profit booking was also witnessed. The Indian markets remained closed on Friday on account of Gandhi Jayanti.
