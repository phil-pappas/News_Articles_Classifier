While I use technical analysis sparsely (and facetiously call it \"voodoo\"), I appreciate that others use it as a predominant form of trading and investing.\nI'm respectful of this and admire it when they succeed -- but \"it's not for me,\" as Grandma Koufax used to say.\nA good case in point is my take on Twitter ( TWTR - Get Report ) . Morgan Stanley downgraded TWTR to Underweight this morning, and the shares are likely to take a small hit as a result.\nBut Bob Lang, one of RealMoneyPro 's technically oriented contributors, wrote earlier this week that he liked Twitter's chart and was buying the December $30 calls for about $3.25.\nAs Bob noted: \"For the better part of 2015, Twitter has been a name to avoid, showing massive amounts of negative flow indicative of institutional distribution.\" That's very correct, in my view.\nBut Bob also said: \"With positive earnings and seasonal strength, we could see Twitter finally get back to the mid $40s by year-end.\" While I wish that were true, I feel it's unlikely.\nSo, as I've previously noted , I've been reducing some of my Twitter exposure.\nBasically, I saw Twitter as getting a strong, temporary bounce and becoming overbought on the news of Jack Dorsey as new CEO and ex-CEO Steve Ballmer of Microsoft ( MSFT - Get Report ) becoming a major investor.\nBut after those swift rallies, Twitter now faces some heavy lifting to turn around monthly average users, sales, profits and cash flow. This will take several quarters.\n\n1 2 3 Next › Last » Select the service that is right for you!
