One operator had 260 vessels and over 1000 employees building into that (resources) boom and it was basically an overnight shutdown,” CEO Chris Peters, 41, said.\n“Going forward it’s maintaining the capability to service the dredging and construction industries … but more widely spreading our input into the marine industry to subsidise those other areas,” Mr Peters said.\n“We’ve been approaching more heavily into harbour and regional towage.”\nGoing for Growth is Courier-Mail series, presented in partnership with NAB, championing Australian business success stories. Source: CourierMail\nChris worked alongside his father Con, and later his brothers Sam and Robert, to resurrect Pacific Tug in 2005 after it was sold to Adsteam in 1987, continuing on a minor level by retaining its name and some assets.\nThe business reached success through key dredging operations generated by the mining boom – working on major projects such as the Newcastle coal port expansion and Barrow Island and Wheatstone for multinational energy high-flyer, Chevron.\nAs the boom slowed the business retained profit by expanding into long-haul towage, turning over $38 million last year and maintaining a fleet of 18 registered vessels and 75 fulltime employees.\nIn April the PT Fortitude completed a world record trip of 4147 nautical miles from Singapore to Brisbane.\n“Being a family company, we’ve kept within our means,” Chris said. “There’s a definite bond and loyalty there that you don’t get outside family. It’s one of our major strengths.”\nWith stormy waters still ahead for the marine industry, Mr Peters said the family was confident the business would continue on into the third generation. His son, at five years old, is already showing interest.\n“If it was easy, everyone would be doing it; that’s one of our catchphrases around here,” he said.\n“This will be the first year where a lot of the big contracts have wound up … we’re hoping to get from $25-$30 million.”", "external_links": ["http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2015/10/04/1227556/812191-bd405adc-6a6a-11e5-a6ff-375823713d47.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:49:43.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
