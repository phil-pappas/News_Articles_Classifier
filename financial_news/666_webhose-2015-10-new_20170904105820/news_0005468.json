A native of Arizona, US, Woods is familiar with Indian food and tradition, thanks to her best friend of eight years who stays in her neighbourhood.\nWoods is participating in the Hero Women’s Indian Open 2015, starting on 23 October in Gurgaon, neighbouring Delhi. The golfer made her professional debut at the 2012 LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) Championship in New York, and won Volvik RACV Ladies Masters in Australia last year. She started playing golf at the age of 5 and enjoys hiking, “a game of ping-pong” (table tennis) and travelling. One golf course she is keen to play at is the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in the UK, and apart from her uncle Tiger Woods, her favourite sportsperson is Serena Williams.\nWoods says if she was not a professional golfer, she would have been in media broadcasting. Edited extracts from an interview:\nIt’s your first time in India—what makes this special?\nI have never been here. First- time experience. Hopefully I will get to see something local and some sightseeing. I love being in new countries and experiencing everything.\nBut I believe you are pretty regular with butter ‘naan’ and chicken ‘tikka’. You have dear friends from India?\nI have been friends with Rimpi Saini for over eight years now and through her I have got to know a lot about her family and India. They are always making me great food. I have got to know the culture and how beautiful it is and how strong it is. I go to their parties wearing Indian clothes. So I’m truly looking forward to this week.\nHow do you see your game at the moment?\nIt’s been a great year for me. It’s been my rookie year on LPGA and I have been able to travel a lot in the US. With this season coming to an end, I am hoping for a good finish here. And then I am getting ready for LPGA Q School (qualifying school) again to improve my status for next year.\nBeing Tiger Woods’ niece can’t be easy—it probably comes with its perks and pressures.\nIt’s pretty normal for me to have the attention. It’s a perk. Since I was 5, I have been inspired by Tiger Woods. He is the only person in my family who plays golf. He is so successful and I used to watch him on TV, so to have that inspiration is really special. With respect to the pressure and the media attention, once I am at the golf course, I just focus on what I can control, which is the shot ahead of me. At the end of the day, I have to just go out there and play golf. When I am on the course, it’s just me and my caddie and my effort to play the game well. But yes, having the option of asking him about things here and there about the game has been quite helpful for me.\nSo how often do you end up reaching out to Tiger Woods for your game?\nWe are both extremely busy. We talk every few months and see each other about once a year. It’s not too often but it’s enough where I am able to learn and take things from him and how he has done some stuff in golf.\nDid you get a chance to speak to Tiger Woods about playing in India?\nHe shared the experience of playing here, in India. He was very positive about the trip and the support he received here. So here I am looking forward to all that and seeing it for myself here this week.\nHealth and fitness are core to the game now—in fact that’s probably half the battle won. Do you agree?\nFitness has become a huge part of the game. You are seeing the girls in the gym a lot more, focusing on flexibility and strength. It’s very beneficial for all of us. You need to make sure your body is prepared and you are able to perform when you need to. When I am travelling, I try to go to the gym as often as I can.\nDo you feel golf has become more gender-balanced over the years?\nI think you are seeing the women’s game catch up with the men’s. It’s really exciting to see more girls play and see LPGA have more events and have more TV time. In Asia, a lot of players are being competitive and I think the exposure is great too.\nYou are taking up a golf clinic during this trip with young children interested in the game. Do you do this often and why?\nI think it’s very important to promote golf to the juniors because that’s where they fall in love with the game. That’s where they get started and make their goals about what they want to do in life. A lot of the times you have these stereotypes that golf is a rich man’s sport or only for boys or is boring. It’s good to give the kids more exposure and tell them how fun it can be.\nWhat’s on your shopping list?\nI plan to get a sari and some jewellery and I would love to get some henna on my hands.\nShaili Chopra is the founder of Golfingindian.com and India Golf Awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:35:40.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
