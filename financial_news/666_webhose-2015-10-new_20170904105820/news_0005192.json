Steelmakers and electronics manufacturers led declines.\nThe Topix slipped 0.7 percent to 1,433.36 as of 9:02 a.m. in Tokyo, heading for a weekly decline of 1.4 percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.8 percent to 17,588.24. The yen strengthened 0.1 percent to 119.84 per dollar. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index showed U.S. manufacturing barely grew in September as a stronger dollar and faltering overseas markets led to the slowest pace of orders since November 2012. Data on jobs growth in the world’s biggest economy is due Friday.\n“Any gains in Japanese stocks will be limited ahead of the U.S. jobs report and the weekend,” said Masayuki Doshida, a senior market analyst at Rakuten Economic Research Institute. “There are dark spots in the U.S. economy. The focus is on whether this is just a passing trend or whether it’s a medium to long-term deceleration caused by the worsening economic situation in China and emerging countries. Currently, the view that it’s temporary is strong.”\nBank of Japan officials see little need for an immediate expansion of monetary stimulus and would prefer to hold off to get a clearer picture of the economic outlook, according to people familiar with their deliberations. Board members who gather for a policy meeting next week want to observe further economic data and developments in financial markets at home and abroad, according to the people, who asked not to be named because talks are private.\nU.S. Futures E-mini futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little changed. The underlying gauge added 0.2 percent in New York on Thursday, erasing a drop of 1 percent.\nToday’s Labor Department report is expected to show the U.S. economy added 201,000 jobs in September with the unemployment rate holding at 5.1 percent, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. This will be the last jobs report before the Fed makes its next rate decision on Oct. 28.\nAs U.S. manufacturing growth weakens, the car industry is proving a bright spot. Auto sales increased more than expected in September, with the annualized rate reaching the fastest pace in more than 10 years. Japanese manufacturers shared the spoils, with Nissan Motor Co. beating analysts’ sales estimates, while Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. met expectations for healthy gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:25:27.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
