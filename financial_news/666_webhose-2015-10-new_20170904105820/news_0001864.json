This cemented expectations that the ECB may need to extend its 1 trillion euro bond-buying programme to stave off the threat of deflation in the euro zone.\nThe shockwaves from Draghi's comments travelled beyond the bloc's borders, as countries whose economies are closely aligned with the euro area also saw their currencies and government bond yields fall.\n\"Today was a tone-setter for what is to come,\" said Luke Bartholomew, investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.\n\"The ECB's rhetoric really emphasises the fragile state of the European, and global, economy.\"\nFalling commodity prices and emerging market concerns are weighing on Europe's economic prospects, and drove consumer prices lower last month.\nThat has led investors to assume the ECB will beef up or extend its quantitative easing (QE) scheme beyond its September 2016 end-date, while money markets have priced in a chance that the central bank would cut official rates further, even though Draghi had previously ruled this out.\nHis remarks on Thursday, delivered after the ECB kept interest rates steady, appeared to confirm those suspicions, emphasising that the ECB is prepared to do whatever it takes to lift inflation back towards its target of just below 2 percent.\nThe euro fell to a three-week low of $1.1140 after Draghi's news conference, down 1.8 percent on the day and on track for its biggest daily loss in seven months. It was also down by over 1 percent against sterling and the yen .\nBond yields and money market rates also fell sharply. Benchmark German two-year bond yields struck a record low of -0.322 percent, down over 7 basis points on the day as markets began to price in another cut to official rates.\nItalian 10-year yields recorded their biggest daily drop since June 2014, down over 15 basis points.\nEuropean stock markets rose, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index up 2.2 percent at a two-month high.\n\"The ECB's concerns over inflation is clearly the driving force and such negative language from the ECB President would imply that it is just a matter of time before further easing was undertaken,\" said Alex Lydall, senior trader at Foenix Partners.\nBeyond the euro zone, the Swiss franc fell over 1 percent against the dollar, while the Swedish, Norwegian and Danish crowns also weakened against the U.S. currency.\nSwiss 10-year government bond yields hit a record low of -0.299 percent.
