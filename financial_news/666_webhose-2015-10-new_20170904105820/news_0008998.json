JPM attributed the downgrade to weaker industry trends and low visibility in trends. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the announcement on Wednesday highlighted three incremental concerns: lower-than-expected US community college enrolments, higher returns from US book retailers and lower-than-expected textbook sales in South Africa. \nThe bank cut its 2015 earnings per share estimate to 70p from 73.6p and its 2015 estimate to 63.3p from 71p. \n\"We expect a wide consensus earnings range for 2016, and think improving and consistent underlying growth trends are needed for the shares to outperform,\" it said. \nStill, the bank said the nine-month announcement from Pearson does not change its view regarding the potential long-term growth opportunity in education, including the potential for the company to sell more products/services to more customers. \nAt 1047 BST, Pearson shares were down 4.1% at 957.50p.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:17:43.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
