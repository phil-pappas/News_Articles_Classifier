But it is an incremental cost that we will absorb and we will move on. While we could have done without it, we don’t see it as discriminatory,” Sanjiv Chadha, the UK head of SBI said.\nThe bank is reportedly injecting about USD 300 million to capitalise a new subsidiary that it plans to set up by 2017 to house its UK retail banking operation, which has 10 branches and about USD 2.5 billion of customer deposits.\nIt is expanding in the UK by opening two new outlets in the London suburbs of Ilford and Hounslow and switching all its branches to seven-day opening. It recently launched new savings products and is moving into small business lending and buy-to-let mortgages.\nMore banks from outside the European Economic Area are set to adopt similar steps as PRA works its way through a 50-strong list of foreign banks from Asia and the Middle East allowed to offer retail banking services.\nIt is less concerned about wholesale banking operations being carried out by non-EEA banks in the UK via branches.\nThe UK rules partly stem from the bitter experience of the 2008 financial crisis, when Britain had to compensate depositors who lost money they had stowed in branches of Icelandic banks that collapsed.\n 04, 2015 9:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T20:08:02.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
