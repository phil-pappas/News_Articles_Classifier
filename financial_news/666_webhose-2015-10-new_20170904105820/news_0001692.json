Janie Barrett Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Clubs NSW will start legal proceedings against the ABC after they aired explosive allegations by former Labor Minister Peter Garrett implying that the lobby tried to bride him.\nMr Garrett first claimed - on an ABC documentary - that he was offered an envelope full of cash by poker machine interests. He later amended the claim to say it was a cheque and occurred at a different time.\nClubs NSW say these claims are not true and the ABC has broadcast \"utterly false claims\".\n\"The fact is that Clubs NSW did not make or offer to make a contribution to Mr Garrett or his electorate council,\" Clubs NSW CEO Anthony Ball said.\nICYMI: Peter Garret tells #Lateline his donation claim was a \"mis-memory\": http://t.co/NIMsn99vM8\nâ€” Lateline (@Lateline) October 13, 2015 Mr Ball said Clubs NSW had decided to sue only after the ABC refused to retract or apologise for the story.\n\"Peter Garrett has proven he either has an appalling memory or a penchant for making up stories, at the same time as his book goes on sale,\" he said.\n\"The ABC was well aware that Mr Garrett had a confused recollection of events and that Clubs NSW had denied Mr Garrett's original and revised recollection when it decided to proceed with this story.\"\nMr Garrett said he was not pressured into correcting himself.\n \"I subsequently became aware, after checking with a person who was present when I was handed the envelope, that in fact it had contained a cheque made out to my federal electorate council,\" he said in a statement.\nMr Garrett says he is not embarrassed by having to correct his claims.\n\"No, I think it's the right thing to do,\" he told Sky News.\n\"That's the right action to take when someone comes to you and says you've got a fact wrong and you say, 'Oh, OK, I have.' You do make mistakes and the obligation that you have is to correct them as soon as you can and I did.\"\nMr Garrett has been promoting his new book, Big Blue Sky , in which he hit out at his former boss, Kevin Rudd .\nMr Garrett was elected in 2004. He was an environment minister under Mr Rudd and retired at the 2013 election.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/clubs-nsw-to-sue-the-abc-for-airing-peter-garrett-cash-claims-20151014-gk9hbw.html", "http://t.co/NIMsn99vM8", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Lateline?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Lateline/status/653893689710739456", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/peter-garrett-backs-away-from-bribe-claim-20151006-gk2vrk.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:51:08.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
