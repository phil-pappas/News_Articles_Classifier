So it is a fiscal issue and an issue for students who have debt because it affects their ability to buy houses and cars,\" Bernanke said.\nWhile Bernanke, who ended his eight years as Fed chairman in 2014, said it was a good thing that students can borrow to finance an education that would have been out of reach years ago, he also acknowledged that some loans should not be made.\n\"We need better lending,\" and counseling for students taking out the loans, he said.\nIn a nod to parents around the country, Bernanke said his own children have taken out loans to go to medical school. \"I assure you they have a substantial portion of the government's debt themselves,\" he said.\nBernanke traveled to Boston, where he earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard and doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, days after publishing his memoir \"The Courage to Act.\" (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:29:09.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
