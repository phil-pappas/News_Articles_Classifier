As he put it, while others have been debating the theory of climate change, insurers have been dealing with the reality. \nSince the 1980s, the number of weather-related loss events has tripled, and the value of these losses has increased from about $10bn (£6.5bn) to $50bn each year over the past decade. \nThere are many financial risks associated with climate change and investors are significantly exposed. The numbers are stark: known fossil fuel reserves of energy and mining companies around the world total over 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon. Yet only 225 gigatonnes can be emitted between now and 2050 if we are to have an 80pc chance of meeting the global goal of restricting temperature rises to two degrees above pre-industrial levels. \nThis gives rise to the very obvious risks of “stranded” assets that simply cannot be used for economic benefit. \nTo give a sense of the scale of the financial risks, 19pc of FTSE 100 companies are in natural resource and extraction sectors, with a further 11pc by value in power utilities, chemicals, construction and industrial goods sectors. The pattern is similar across the globe: these two groups account for around a third of both equity and fixed income assets worldwide. \nIt’s not all bad news, of course. If the analysis of climate change risks is correct, there will be significant investment opportunities in clean energy and associated companies the Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) debacle is expected to accelerate the adoption of hybrid and ultimately full electric cars, for example. * Bank of England governor Mark Carney calls on insurers to help prepare for climate change So why the controversy over the Governor’s speech? Much debate rages over the timing of the financial risks. Many argue that the worries are premature. \nMark Carney was careful to address this, although his words were not to everyone’s taste. He described the mismatch between low immediate risks and the apparent inevitability of eventful catastrophe as “the tragedy of the horizon”. The really problematic impacts of climate change are likely to impose a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix. \nI think this speech and its warnings are both insightful and a motif for the difficulties in coming to terms with the multiple transformations of our time. \nThe move from analogue to digital, the internet revolution in shopping habits, the relentless rise of social media, the backlash against traditional political structures and politicians, the fierce and ongoing debate regarding Scotland’s relationship with the UK and now over our relationship with the EU, and, yes, even the unstoppable march of gender and other equality movements are all real, seismic shifts. The difficulty is, as Albert Einstein pointed out, “We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them”. \nMichael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, echoed the need for new thinking in a recent, brilliant article, where he noted that the future system is “going to be more open, more accountable, more answerable to the community, and more socially inclusive”. He was referring to clean energy but his words could apply to politics, diversity, financial markets, media and technology. \nAnd the speed and scale of change are ever-accelerating and expanding. The rise of digital technology started slowly, then came all in a rush. Eastman Kodak invented the digital camera but made the fatal error of failing to capitalise on this, fearing a cannibalisation of its established business and believing it had more time. * Britain shows that world can cut carbon emissions and still get richer, says PwC * Mark Carney: Emerging market debt is the biggest risk right now Mark Carney’s climate change warning reminds companies and investors not to be complacent today over emerging, but not yet crystallised risks of a different nature. An early warning that would be a travesty to ignore. \nPolitical developments also demonstrate the trend away from evolution to revolution. The favourite candidates at the start of the Labour Party’s leadership contest (and the bookies’) underestimated how, not just a Left-wing, but left-field candidate could capture the imagination and votes of a party disillusioned by mainstream alternatives. \nI think the same scenario is playing out in Britain’s relationship with the EU, where the consensus approach of trying to “leave well enough alone” is also being exposed by the harsh winds of change. For me, the compelling arguments today are those based on the embrace, rather than rejection of, an unfolding multi-polar world, where a competitive Britain the fifth largest economy in the world has strong global trading and self-generated political relationships, and where decisions affecting us are taken by us, just as they are by 168 non-EU countries. \nSo as the Brexit debate enters a more heated phase, I consider the tussle as part of a necessary journey towards resolving a difficult issue. \nWhat we can all do is engage in the debate, and cherish the openness and democracy we are so lucky to have. But irrespective of which side we are on, I am convinced that great change is inevitable in our world. The old certainties are being overturned. The status quo is no longer an option.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:31:23.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
