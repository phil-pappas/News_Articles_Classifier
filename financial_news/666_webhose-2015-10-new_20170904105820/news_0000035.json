Others would rather have an ice-cold beer.\nJim White, who owns Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios in Virginia Beach, Va., says many athletes assume beer is full of carbohydrates and so makes a great recovery drink. The body needs carbohydrates after exercise to replenish energy stores in the form of glycogen.\nBut beer isn’t an ideal carb source. “Beer only has about 14 grams of carbohydrates, so it would not be sufficient for recovery,” he says.\nAfter a hard workout, an athlete should drink water or drinks with a carbs-to-protein ratio of 4:1 ratio, Mr. White says. Once hydrated, then the athlete could indulge in a beer or two, “keeping in mind to drink more water to balance out the alcohol.”\nYet some research indicates one or two beers a few times a week may benefit to athletes. Mr. White says compounds in beer known as polyphenols may assist with immune function during prolonged strenuous exercise.\nNancy Clark, a sports-nutrition counselor in Newton Highlands, Mass., says it is OK to drink one post-workout beer, consumed responsibly and with water and some carbohydrates to refuel depleted muscles. But she emphasizes beer shouldn’t replace a post-workout meal.\n“You need to eat a balanced meal with the beer within an hour or so, to offer protein to repair the muscles and buffer the alcohol,” she says.\n—Jen Murphy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:20:09.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
