Consumer finance expert Lisa Montgomery. Picture: Supplied.\nEmma Blake CHRISTMAS is 12 weeks away but it’s never too early to think about saving money for the silly season, especially if you want to avoid a crippling credit card bill in January.\nAfter the festive season, many of us cry that we’re broke, but there’s no need to worry if you’ve prepared for it.\nHere are a few jolly tips to set you up for the festive season.\n1. Decide how much you want to spend. What can you afford? It is only one day — don’t ruin 2016 for it. If you haven’t already, start a budget and see where you can trim costs.\nMORE: COMPARE HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNTS\nPlan and save ... Make sure your Christmas is a happy, debt-free one by taking action now. Picture: Supplied. Source: Getty Images\n2. Australians spend around $500 per person a year on gifts at Christmas. Yet many people try to find that money in December and end up relying on credit to get them over the line.\nINTEREST FREE CREDIT CARD DEALS\nBut there’s still time to save and, once you’ve taken your budget into account, you’ll work out how much you can manage. For example, put aside $250 a month over the next couple of months and you’ll have your $500 budget before the silly season starts.\n3. Make a list of who you need to buy for and whenever you see goods at low prices buy them and put them away in a Christmas cupboard.\n“Use the lay-by system,” says consumer finance expert Lisa Montgomery. “Most stores still have lay-by but a lot of people use a credit card instead and then pay interest on it.”\nThe other advantage of having weeks to look for a present is that you will find a gift that is really thoughtful rather than grabbing the first thing you see a few days before December 25.\n4. Create your own shopping fund by selling off a few unwanted items at a local market, car boot sale or online. Your trash could be someone else’s Christmas treasure.\n Plan ahead and save this Christmas ", "external_links": ["http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/guide/high-interest-savings-accounts#itm_t=story&itm_l=prepare-for-christmas", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9dec4f87195fb77740d6d5d640abfc51", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4a234e5c102b03b58ef2bed3939a8e3f", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/58415fc640e65bdabc172c772a546623?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/credit-cards/interest-free#itm_t=story&itm_l=prepare-for-christmas", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:48:19.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
