He admitted in July that he didn't turn over $156,564 in sales taxes he collected from customers. \nHis actions came to light following a routine canvas of used car dealerships in Ocean County by the state's Division of Taxation in November 2011. The agency was seeking to identify dealerships that were not properly registered or licensed. \nDuring the canvas, it was determined Dicecilia had not filed any sales tax returns or remitted any sales tax since his dealership opened in 2007. \nTax officials sought payment of the outstanding sales taxes, and Dicecilia subsequently filed sales tax returns. \nHowever, an audit by the tax division revealed that he deliberately hid information about the number of cars sold and the sales tax that he collected. \nFurther investigation, based on vehicle title transfer records kept by the state's Motor Vehicle Commission, determined Dicecilia had collected $205,157 in sales tax but remitted only $48,593 during the civil audit. \nThink your friends should see this?
