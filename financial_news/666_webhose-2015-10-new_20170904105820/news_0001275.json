The jobless rate hit a record high of 27.9 percent in September 2013.\nUnemployment has come down from record highs as the economy stabilised last year after a severe slump, but remains more than double the euro zone's average, of 11 percent in July.\nGreece's economy expanded by 1.6 percent in the second quarter, helped by consumer spending and net exports. It is expected to return to recession in the second half of the year.
