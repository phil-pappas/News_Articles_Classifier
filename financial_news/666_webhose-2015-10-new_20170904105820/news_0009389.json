Photo: Darrian Traynor\nWestpac will raise $3.5 billion through a share entitlement offer to help boost its capital reserves and will lift its home lending rates by 0.20 percentage points to help pay for the extra costs of the new equity.\nOn Wednesday, Westpac effectively pulled forward its full-year results due out on November 2, releasing unaudited full-year results for 2015 showing that its cash profit rose 3 per cent to $7.82 billion.\n\"The magnitude of regulatory capital increases and their short implementation timetable has an inevitable impact on our pricing,\" Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer told analysts.\n\"This was a difficult decision, and one that was not taken lightly. We understand it has an impact on customers, even in an environment where interest rates are near historical lows. We accept the regulators have ruled on challenges, but these changes impact on the cost of providing mortgfages.\"\nAdvertisement The move will cost the average Westpac mortgage holder around $10 per week.\nThe capital raising will be in the form of a fully underwritten, pro rata accelerated renounceable entitlement offer, with a offer price of $25.50, a 13.6 per cent discount to the company's closing price on October 13 of $30.44, adjusted for dividends.\nOmkar Joshi, an analyst from Watermark Funds Management, said it was \"pleasing to see Westpac dealing with the capital issue\" and said a solid net interest margin \"has helped to deliver a largely in-line result\".\nThe raising follows a $2 billion capital raising Westpac conducted at its half-year results in May. Since then, Commonwealth Bank has raised $5.5 billion and ANZ Banking Group has raised $3 billion after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said banks would need to raise more equity against mortgages, a recommendation of the financial system inquiry. National Australia Bank raised $5.5 billion in May.\n\"Westpac now joins [its] peers in being \"done\" on capital raisings for the time being,\" said Credit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin.\nIn a surprise move, the bank will also lifted its mortgage rates on residential property by 0.2 of a percentage point for owner occupiers and property investors. The new rates will take effect from November 20. The big banks started in July to push up variable interest rates for property investors but this is the first upward move this cycle on owner-occupiers at a time the Reserve Bank of Australia is still considering reducing the cash rate.\nMr Martin said the increase in interest rates \"sensibly shelters the return on equity impact of the capital raising\". He also suggested that Westpac's move will put the pressure on the other banks.\n\"We estimate that sector wide, re-pricing to date had only one-third defrayed the ROE impact of capital raisings. Whether the industry follows Westpac in repricing mortgages further will be a key test of oligopoly pricing discipline,\" he said.\nMr Joshi agreed. \"It will be interesting to see if peers follow by also announcing repricing,\" he said.\nThe increase in interest rates for Westpac's main brand does not extend to customers of St George or Bank of Melbourne but these are currently being reviewed.\nWestpac will lift the interest rate paid on four, seven and 12 month term deposits by 25 basis points.\nWestpac also said that it would pay a fully franked dividend of 94Â¢ for the 2015 year, up 2 per cent on the previous year.\nBut despite the increase in cash earnings, the bank's cash return on equity fell 57 basis points to 15.8 per cent during the year.\nCash earnings in the Australian bank rose 8 per cent, while the bank's net interest margin was unchanged at 2.08 per cent. The cash earnings were 1 per cent ahead of analyst expectations.\nMr Hartzer said the result was driven by \"a solid operating performance, supported by strong gains in customer numbers\".\nThe capital raising will add 100 basis points to Westpac's common tier one equity capital ratio, and take its CET1 capital ratio to 14 per cent on an international basis.\nIt is understood that Westpac was not willing to wait to announce the raising along with the results on November 2 given the pressure put on CBA ahead of its full-year result in August by hedge funds anticipating a raising.\nThe decision to accelerate the results was made about six weeks ago, at the time the bank ruled off its full-year numbers on September 30. The strong rally in equity markets last week provided comfort that markets would accept the raising this week.\nWestpac says this raising places its capital ratio \"within the top quartile of banks globally\". This was the measure recommended by the financial system inquiry, although last month APRA chairman Wayne Byres said the regulator would look at a range of issues when assessing strength.\n\"Capital raised responds to changes in mortgage risk weights that will increase the amount of capital required to be held against mortgages by more than 50 per cent, with the increased regulatory required to be applied from July 1, 2016,\" the bank said in a statement.\nThe increase in mortgage rates would also help meet the capital requirements, the bank said.\nUBS and Merrill Lynch are handling the capital raising.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/the-great-big-bank-capital-build-20150813-giysc5", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/cba-fasttracks-shortfall-bookbuild-20150910-gjk4sf"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:09:58.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
