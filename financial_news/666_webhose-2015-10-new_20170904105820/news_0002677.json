Horse trading: Demand for share in Lloyds Banking Group is expected to be high. By Ed Monk , Investment Editor 1:28PM BST 05 Oct 2015 Comments \nDetails of the deal given to small investors who buy the last £2billion of the Government's shares in Lloyds Banking Group are out. \nIt is one of the few occasions when ordinary investors jump ahead of large City firms in the queue and interest is expected to be high. It is the last of the Government's stake in the bank to be allocated for sale. \nThe terms are good, with shares to be made available at a 5pc discount, with a further bonus of an extra share for every ten purchased, up to a maximum value of £200. \nIt may or may not be possible to get the full value of the bonus shares. You’d need to invest £2,000 to get the maximum £200 available, but the Government has said that applications worth up £1,000 will be prioritised. \nIf applications for smaller amounts account for a large chunk of the £2billion available, the full £200 bonus won't be achievable. \nIt is not yet clear whether applications for shares worth more than £1,000 will be rejected in their entirety if the allocation is taken up with applications for smaller amounts, as happened with Royal Mail shares, or if the higher application will simply adjusted down to the £1,000 limit. \nPrecise details of how the share sale will be administered are not yet available but anyone interested can register their details on a website – www.gov.uk/lloydsshares - and receive further information as it becomes available. Buying direct \nPrevious sales of Government controlled shares, such as the Royal Mail in 2013, have seen the Government establish an online service for the public to buy shares. This is managed by a registrar company which issues share certificates. \nThis is potentially the cheapest way to buy the shares. There should be no dealing charges to buy but you may have to pay to sell the shares. \nBe aware that is it unlikely that you will be able to buy Lloyds inside a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) or Isa. This will require further admin, which will depend on your Sipp or Isa company and may require tight record keeping, particularly of share certificates. Investing platforms and banks \nLloyds shares will also be available through investing platforms – online services that allow investors to buy and sells shares. Banks may offer the service to their customers. \nThese platforms carry their own charges. These could be waived where shares are bought and held outside a Sipp or Isa, but holding the shares inside these tax wrappers is likely to incur charges for the admin involved. \nPlatforms become better value for money if your investing is more extensive. Some will favour those with small sums to invest and other for those with far more. \nThe frequency of the changes you make to investments is also a factor. \nWe’ve produced this table to help explain the charges of the leading platforms, coloured coded to show where they are cheap and where they are expensive. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas \nThe Telegraph has launched its own DIY investment service, designed with simple pricing.
