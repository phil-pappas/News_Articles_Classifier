The shortlist was unveiled on Tuesday with Adele Ferguson garnering two nominations for her investigations into wage fraud at 7-Eleven and problems in the financial advice arm of the National Australia Bank in Australia and in Britain.\nThe judge's citation for the expose on 7-Eleven, which was a joint investigation by Fairfax Media and the ABC's Four Corners , said: \"Shining a light on the fraudulent wage practices and staff exploitation happening every day inside one of the world's biggest brands was a complicated undertaking which involved leaked documents, whistleblowers and surveillance. Tracking the illegal operations all the way to the top of the franchise revealed gaping holes in Australia's visa and corporate arrangements.\"\nFerguson was jointly nominated with Fairfax Media's Sarah Danckert and the ABC's Klaus Toft.\nLearn more about the 7-Eleven scandal in a Fairfax Media interactive package here or watch the Four Corners episode here\nAdvertisement\nFerguson was also nominated for a detailed series of articles revealing allegations of misconduct, forgery and fraud at National Australia Bank.\nFerguson was jointly nominated with Fairfax Media's Ruth Williams. The judges found the investigation \"uncovered a corporate culture that had financially damaged hundreds of customers\".\n\"Their revelations of the bank's quiet sacking of 37 financial planners for misconduct (of whom NAB referred only five to the regulator) exposed the bank to multiple investigations. NAB changed its internal policies and established a compensation scheme for affected customers,\" the citation said.\nThe stories are linked here: Secret documents blow the lid on forgery, poor compliance and 'rogue' advisers in NAB's financial planning arm ; NAB's scandal deepens ; and\nNAB has left a trail of destruction in the United Kingdom\nFormer NAB planner Graeme Cowper.
