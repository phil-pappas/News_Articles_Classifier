We're talking about the people you sit next to for eight to 10 hours a day, five days a week, for maybe two, three or even 10 years.\nSo who should you choose if you get a say in who sits next to (and nearby) you at work?\nYour work bestie: This one's obvious. Work's so much better when you're close to your favourite co-worker.\nAdvertisement A shy person: They say it's the quiet ones you have to watch, but I think it's the quiet ones whose company you should enjoy. Once you gain their trust, taciturn people give you access to what tend to be their filthy minds and outrageously good senses of humour, and who doesn't want to be near that?\nA trivia whiz: Yes, you can find anything on the internet these days, but why go through the rigmarole of checking and cross-checking on Google when you can turn to a polymathic nerd one seat away and get the correct answer to your question the first time every time (plus really interesting asides about Magic The Gathering into the bargain).\nA coffee mule: Regular readers of Benign to Five will know I've found myself in this role before, so from a position of empathy I implore you to find the happy medium between gross exploitation of this immensely important colleague and (at least the appearance of) gratitude.\nNeighbours. Everybody needs good neighbours. Choose yours wisely.\nJonathan Rivett blogs at haught.com.au and copywrites at theinkbureau.com.au ,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:35:29.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
