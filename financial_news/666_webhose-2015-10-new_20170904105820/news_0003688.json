Riding the developers’ coat-tails, Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) was a little over 160p as 2009 dawned, but is now priced at £37. \nThis week, Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) called time on the London property boom, hoping it won’t be the latest in a long line of naysayers myself included on too many occasions who have learnt the hard way that the British love affair with bricks and mortar is built on firm foundations. \nReferencing seemingly unpoppable property bubbles in Hong Kong (1997) and Tokyo (1989) that duly imploded, Deutsche’s Sahil Mahtani argues that a vicious cocktail of rising interest rates, tighter lending restrictions and the increasing politicisation of the generation-dividing housing market will send today’s eye-watering prices into reverse. \nThe last factor is the most interesting and the least well-explored. Certainly the evidence is mounting that the Government’s support for ever-rising property prices is on the wane. The Chancellor’s assault on buy-to-let investors in the summer Budget slashing tax relief on mortgages and cutting the wear and tear sweetener has materially reduced the attraction of an investment that already looked marginal on yield grounds. The political calculus, which has always favoured elderly homeowners with a propensity to vote over disenfranchised Generation Rent, is shifting fast as Jeremy Corbyn discovered to his surprise. \nThis week saw a pretty significant wobble in the share prices of those high-flying construction and estate agency stocks. Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) (up a relatively modest 10-fold since November 2008), lost 7pc on Thursday after warning that revenues would be at the lower end of expectations . Insulation group SIG (LSE: SHI.L - news ) was 22pc lower after flagging slower demand in the repair and maintenance market. Foxtons, which said it was trying the suburbs to escape the slowing central London market, lost 5pc. \nSo is this the end of the party? I’m not convinced, for a few reasons. Just like the commercial property market, where London and the provinces march to a very different beat, the UK’s housing market is dominated, but not defined, by the capital. Across the UK, inflation-adjusted house prices remain well below their 2007 peak. Comparing prices to earnings, affordability in the UK as a whole is half its level in 1995 not a fifth as it is in London. Measuring mortgage interest payments against earnings, houses are twice as affordable as they were in 2007. \nFor investors in the housebuilding sector, it is also important to distinguish between the drivers of the secondary housing market and those of the new-build sector. According to Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , total UK housing transactions fell by 5pc in the first half of 2015, but new-build completions rose by 23pc. \nIf one solution to sky-high house prices is to reverse years of undersupply, then the builders will be the principal beneficiary. With the number of housebuilders falling by around 75pc since the 1980s, competition for land has eased, enabling the remaining companies to benefit from a widening margin between flat land-costs and rising house prices. \nPerhaps most importantly, it’s worth noting that while share prices have soared, profits have kept pace. That means that valuations look anything but stretched in the absence of a meaningful house price correction. The average ratio of share prices to expected earnings next year for the companies tracked by Goldman is 9.5, falling to just eight times in 2017. In a low interest-rate environment, the average dividend yield of 5.4pc, rising to 6.5pc, looks pretty compelling. \nWhether you can bring yourself to buy a share that has risen 20-fold in six years is quite another matter. \nTom Stevenson is an investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment.
