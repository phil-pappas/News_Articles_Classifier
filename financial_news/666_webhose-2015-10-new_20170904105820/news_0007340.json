But most of this is due to declines in oil and commodity prices,\" Kuroda said.\n\"I don't think there's a need to rush into (action) at this point,\" he said at a news conference after the International Monetary Fund's annual meetings.\nKuroda was optimistic on emerging markets, saying that while some nations were suffering from capital outflows, many have sufficient buffers to weather the market turmoil compared with what Asia went through during its financial crisis in the late 1990s.\nFinance Minister Taro Aso echoed the optimism, telling the news conference that the risk to the global economy from China's slowdown was not big enough for global policymakers to consider a coordinated response.\n\"If you ask whether China wanted such action, the answer would be no,\" Aso said.\nBut he said policymakers must enhance communication with market participants as China's stock market rout in August has sharply dampened investors' risk appetite.\nThe IMF warned on Friday that risks to the global economy have heightened as emerging markets in particular suffer from low growth and falling revenues from commodity exports.\nThe global slowdown has weighed on Japan's economy, which shrank in the April-June period and may have contracted again in July-September on weak exports to emerging markets.\nJapan's consumer inflation slid in the year to August on oil price declines and soft household spending, keeping the BOJ under pressure to expand an already massive stimulus program to accelerate inflation toward its 2 percent target.
