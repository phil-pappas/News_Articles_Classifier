Goodyear understands how important it is for drivers to get back on the road quickly and safely and will begin offering free flat tire repairs in all company-owned Goodyear Auto Service Centers, starting Oct.1. With the Free Flat Repair program, consumers who come to Goodyear with a flat tire will be offered a free tire damage assessment and appropriate puncture repair.\n\"For more than 100 years, Goodyear has been committed to keeping America moving,\" said Fred Thomas, vice president, Goodyear Retail. \"Our goal is to make flat tire repair convenient for our customers. The introduction of the Free Flat Repair program will make it easier for our customers, their friends and family members to get back on the road quickly, with quality service from a name they can trust.\"\nThe Free Flat Repair program includes an inspection to assess tire damage, and the performance of a puncture repair following industry standard procedures. The program applies to most passenger cars and light truck tires and is applicable only to individual consumers and does not include a new TPMS sensor. If the tire cannot be repaired, a replacement tire can be purchased and installed.
