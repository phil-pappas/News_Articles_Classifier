The market was on track to eke out its second gain in two days as investors assessed the latest company earnings for insight into how the global economy is doing.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,176 as of 3:24 p.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained four points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,028. The Nasdaq composite added one point, or 0.04 percent, to 4,871.\nSECTOR VIEW: Six of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 rose, led by consumer staples stocks, a category that includes Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo. The industrials sector fell the most.\nPLAYTIME AGAIN: Mattel climbed 5.9 percent after Oppenheimer published a research note highlighting the toymaker's core brands as a bright spot. The report came a day after Mattel reported disappointing third-quarter results. Mattel gained $1.32 to $23.85.\nSURPASSED EXPECTATIONS: General Electric reported a decline in third-quarter profit, but strong performances from its core units helped the industrial conglomerate top Wall Street expectations. GE rose the most in the Dow, adding $1.06, or 3.8 percent, to $29.09.\nCRIMPED CASINO: Wynn Resorts fell 1.2 percent after the casino operator said new gambling regulations in Macau continued to hurt its business. The stock fell 90 cents to $72.86.\nIN A SLUMP: Several oilfield service providers were trading lower. Schlumberger slid 3.4 percent after the company announced job cuts. The stock fell $2.57 to $73.59. Halliburton shed $1.69, or 4.3 percent, to $37.57, while Baker Hughes fell $2.68, or 4.8 percent, to $53.51.\nTOUGH QUARTER: Quanta Services plunged 29 percent after the contracting services company lowered its third-quarter profit and revenue outlook, citing project delays and a tough market. The stock lost $7.49 to $18.72.\nBIG WEEK AHEAD: Traders are looking to next week as earnings season kicks into a particularly busy period. Third-quarter earnings are forecast to contract overall as falling energy prices and weak global demand start to eat into profits. But investors will be listening for how company executives size up their business prospects in coming months.\nTHE QUOTE: \"That's what the market is focused on,\" said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"Are we seeing a pickup in demand overseas and in the United States, and if so, which sectors? That's what this is about.\"\nMANUFACTURING REPORT: The Federal Reserve said that U.S. manufacturing production fell for the second straight month in September as factories cranked out fewer appliances, computers, and electronics. The decline suggests that a strong dollar, weak overseas economies, and cautious U.S. consumers are holding back factory output.\nOVERSEAS: In Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.6 percent, while Germany's DAX rose 0.4 percent. France's CAC 40 gained 0.6 percent. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi inched down 0.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8 percent. The Shanghai Composite in mainland China was up 1.6 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 added 1.1 percent, aided by expectations that the country's central bank will come up with more stimulus measures this month or next.\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 88 cents to close at $47.26 in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 44 cents to close at $48.71 a barrel in London.\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES: U.S. government bond prices didn't budge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held at 2.02 percent. The euro was little changed at $1.1376 while the dollar edged up to 119.38 yen.\nMETALS: Gold fell $4.40 to $1,183.10 an ounce, silver declined five cents to $16.11 an ounce and copper lost two cents to settle at $2.40 a pound.\nAustralia International News Company Earnings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:10:55.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
