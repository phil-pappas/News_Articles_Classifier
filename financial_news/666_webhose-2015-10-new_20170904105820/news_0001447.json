Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rowan Dean Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his Foreign Minister Julie Bishop are urging all Australians to take a more \"holistic\" approach to tackling youth radicalisation by \"reaching out\" to members of their local communities and showing \"mutual respect\".\nIndeed, according to Assistant Minister for Agile Positive Engagement, Senator Confetti Fearitallends-Well, \"It is very important that we look at countering violent extremism not just from the law enforcement perspective but from a touchy-feelly, er, I mean from the social policy perspective as well.\"\nBut how? After close consultation with the police, education, immigration, child welfare, social welfare, social engineering, social inclusion, religious tolerance and multicultural affairs government agencies, this column has prepared a comprehensive Guide to Mutually Respecting Radicalised Youth.\nBirthday parties: In order to take a more holistic approach to the traditional birthday party, with a little bit of imagination and multicultural flair you can adapt everyday party games so that your child's radicalised classmates feel more at home. Here are some easy suggestions.\n:Pin the tail on the donkey\". Why not chop the tail off the donkey instead? With a machete preferably, but any old kitchen knife will do. Then you can lop off the front right hoof and the back left hoof too if the donkey's been caught doing anything naughty like stealing the birthday cake!\n\"Hide and seek\". Always a party favourite, but try to make sure the game is fair for all the local neighbourhood kiddies by first removing those pesky GPS tracking bracelets from any alienated or radicalised 14-year-olds.\n\"Bean bag throw\". Use rocks instead.\n \"Eleven fingers trick\". Kids will squeal will delight at this one, as you hold up your hands and prove you can count eleven fingers (one of which belongs – or used to belong – to the kid next door.)\n\"Funny mummy wrap game\". Kids love stories of ancient Egypt and the mummies of old kings and dead pharaohs. Why not make it more culturally inclusive by getting the kids to smash a few old vases or other ancient Greek or Assyrian antiquities? Millennia of fun for everyone.\n\"Heads up, seven up\". Get all the seven-year-old kiddies to stand at the front of a room or in a flat, dry, dusty outdoor space. The remaining children lay their heads on the chopping block (or on a table) with their eyes closed (no peeking!) The seven-year-olds walk around the room and each one chooses a person to decapitate before yelling \"Allahu akbar!\" at the top of their voices. Repeat until everyone is dead.\n\"Pass the parcel\". Enhance the holistic multicultural flavour of this popular game by stacking the parcel full of old bits of shrapnel (household nails will do) and an explosive timing device. Seconds of fun for the entire family!\n\"One-legged race\". Much more challenging when all of the contestants really do only have one leg left.\n\"What's in the bag?\" OK, this one's way too easy for most radicalised kiddies – so make it harder by asking whose head is in the bag? Shia or Christian?\nTeen games: Teenagers can be so hard to please these days, what with spending hours and hours locked in their bedrooms watching ISIS propaganda clips, so why not reach out to them with these excitingly inclusive multicultural games designed to drag them away from their laptops!\n\"Capture the Flag\". Another classic party game that's tons of fun. Again you'll need a large, flat, dusty space to play in. Divide the players into as many teams as you like and give each a flag. Flags can be made of anything, like a black cloth with white squiggly writing or even an old tea towel on a stick will do the trick. Each team must hide their flag somewhere on their side. The object is to sneak – in an agile way! – onto the other team's side and steal their flag. But if you get tagged in their space you lose and get put in a cage and burned alive. (Make sure you capture the fun on your iPhone so you can post it on YouTube at the after-party!)\n\"Spin the bottle\". All the boys and girls sit in a circle and spin the bottle. Whoever it stops at, she's your sex slave.\n\"Truth or Dare\". Already popular among the under-16s in certain parts of western Sydney, the latest – more holistic! – version of this game involves truthfully answering the question \"Would you like to shag 17 virgins?\" before being handed a pistol and dared to go and shoot a cop.\nMeanwhile, in other news this week, Australia's new Prime Minister Malcolm Croesus declared in Parliament this week that it was no news to anybody that he is \"richer than Turnbull\".\nTwitter @rowandean", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/rowandean", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/107339562751475118358/posts"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:45.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
