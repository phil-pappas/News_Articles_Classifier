Fans can flip through behind-the-scenes footage of the movie, which opens on Nov. 6, answer Bond trivia questions, choose whether they’d prefer a martini shaken or stirred, or watch a testimonial from a “ Spectre ” cast member.\nPeople can invite friends to see the movie with them via the Discover channel. The Bond content is professionally produced and doesn’t incorporate any user-produced videos, which are often a staple of Snapchat brand efforts.\nPhoto: Snapchat However, in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, fans have access to special “Spectre”-branded images, or filters, which they can use in their own Snapchat videos.\nSnapchat said that besides the stand-alone Discover channel, “Spectre” ads are running on other parts of Snapchat.\n“We’re huge James Bond fans and excited to give our community a sneak peek into the action,” Nick Bell, head of content at Snapchat, said in a statement.\nENLARGE Photo: Snapchat", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY216_ashton_E_20151026143301.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY215_shaken_E_20151026143207.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY215_shaken_D_20151026143207.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY216_ashton_D_20151026143301.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY213_spectr_E_20151026143117.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KY213_spectr_D_20151026143117.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:16:13.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
