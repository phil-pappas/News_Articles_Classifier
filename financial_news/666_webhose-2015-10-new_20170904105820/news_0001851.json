By Rebecca Burn-Callander | Telegraph – 3 minutes 6 seconds ago +0.68 \nAnother American gastronomic phenomenon is sweeping the UK \nPulled pork has become a meaty business in the UK, with sales rising 19pc between April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) and June this year alone, according to figures from the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB). \nHeston Blumenthal, the celebrity chef, has created a recipe for pulled pork and even McDonald's is planning to introduce pulled pork at lunch times . \nBritain's US-style BBQ restaurants generated £68m in sales last year, mostly driven by an appetite for the slow-cooked, shredded meat. \nBut could a meaty rival soon overtake the porcine repast's popularity? \nThe star attraction at One Sixty , the US-style smokehouse and bar created by serial restaurateur David Moore, the man behind Michelin (Paris: FR0000121261 - news ) -starred celeb hang-out Pied A Terre , isn't pulled pork, it's brisket. \nThe London-based company, which has two locations in the capital, has opened a standalone \"brisket bar\" at its City restaurant, where customers can order their sandwiches made to order. Its signature dish is a 18-24-hour smoked brisket. \n\"Brisket is really big here,\" says Moore. \"This is partly down to a novelty factor. People still aren't sure what it is.\" \nOne Sixty is not alone. At Red's True Barbecue, the Leeds-based American-style smokehouse chain , which has six outlets around the UK, brisket has been among the top three dishes this year. \nRed's sells around 45 tonnes of meat each month to its 65,000 customers, and brisket now accounts for 30pc of sales. \n\"Brisket and burnt ends [pieces of meat cut from the point half of a smoked brisket] will remain a core product on the Red’s menu,\" says Scott Munro, co-founder of Red’s. \"As the trend continues and the public become more aware, we believe we’ll see these become our number one seller.\" \n= Could this food trend be bigger than pulled pork? = \nUnlike pulled pork, which is produced through a cooking process rather than referring to a single cut of meat, brisket comes from the lower chest area of the animal. Brisket isn't just found in beef, you can buy pork and lamb brisket too. \nHistorically, it has been one of the cheapest cuts to buy, but its rising popularity has caused prices in the UK to rise exponentially. Mike Whittemore, head of trade marketing at AHDB, claims that brisket has become \"one of the most-wanted parts of the carcass\". \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) used to be a problem child and was just sold for a pot roast and nothing else,\" he says. \"If it wasn't sold it would go into the mincer, but now prices are rising because of demand and there's been a real tightening in the market.\" \nThe average price of fresh beef brisket joints sold across major UK retailers has risen by 7pc year-on-year, according to AHDB data, up from just 1pc the year before. \nThe brisket trend was born in Texas, where it's the staple meat in smokehouses. Foodservice firms in the US have reported huge spikes in the cost of brisket and Euromonitor's figures state that in January, price per pound of brisket increased by over 50pc compared to the same period in 2014. \n\"The National Cattle Breeders Association [AHDB's equivalent in the US] told us recently that brisket is selling for more that fillet or tenderloin,\" says Whittemore. \"This isn't just in the southern states of US, it is escalating to other parts of America too and we will see that transfer to the UK.\" \n“Although consumption of beef and veal in the UK is declining due to economic reasons and health-related concerns, our qualitative findings show that there is great demand for alternative, cheaper cuts of meat, such as bavette and spider steak, sirloin tip steaks, and brisket,\" says Anastasia Alieva, head of fresh food research at Euromonitor International . \nOne Sixty City, which currently sells around two whole briskets each day, at 5kg to 7kg each, is expecting to double sales of the trendy meat this year. \n\"We went on a recce to New York to see what our competitors out there were doing with brisket,\" says Moore. \"Fette Sau, Brooklyn Kitchen, Blue Smoke and Mighty Quinn's Barbeque all have their brisket out front. We're moving our brisket bar into the window as a takeaway offering.\" \nThe UK supermarkets have cottoned on to the trend and high end retailers such as M&S and Waitrose already offer slow-cooked brisket products. \n\"We also think we’ll start to see more more barbecue fans buy and cook this cut of meat, driving the trend further,\" says Red's Munro, who has launched a range of Red’s BBQ sauces into Asda and Sainsbury’s to cater to demand for Us-style smokehouse flavours at home. \nAlmost a quarter of UK consumers say they are willing to pay more for beef than other meats, according to Mintel's 2014 red meat report. This is compared to 8pc who say they same for chicken and 7pc for pork. \n\"Brisket is becoming more of a mainstream product in the pre-cooked category,\" says Whittemore. \"It could soon rival pulled pork.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:05:37.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
