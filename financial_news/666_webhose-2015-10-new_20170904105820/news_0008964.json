SMH GOOD WEEKEND Picture by THOM RIGNEY GW100619 Photo: Thom Rigney\nIt's enough to make you shout. Beer sales are flat and the big brewers are not only snapping up each other, they're swallowing their smaller rivals to stay in the game.\nJapanese beverage company Asahi is the latest multinational to swoop on a boutique label, buying Australia's Mountain Goat for an undisclosed sum this week.\nSome analysts expect the consolidation within the craft sector to continue for another five years.\nWhile sales of mainstream beer brands are stagnant, craft varieties, which are sold at a premium, are growing about 10 per cent a year. Along with premium international beer, it could grow to represent a quarter of the Australian beer market in coming years, industry insiders predict.\nAdvertisement Beware supermarkets But former Foster's chief executive Trevor O'Hoy has some advice for up-and-coming brewers – stay clear of supermarkets and their savage discounting.\n\"If you set up your business to the extent where you need to sell to the supermarkets because you have invested so much in equipment, land and people, to me that's the beginning of the end,\" said Mr O'Hoy, who now runs Byron Bay brewer Stone and Wood.\n\"The successful alcohol players in wine and craft beer actually don't have to sell to supermarkets because they have enough independent channel demand to pay the bills.\"\nMr O'Hoy said supermarkets had squeezed brewer margins worldwide, leading to mega-mergers such as Anheuser-Bush InBev's proposed takeover of SABMiller, the owner of Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught.\n\"That's a must because the balance of power has shifted to the supermarkets, the big retailers.\n\"So the brand owners need to get bigger to try to pull the power back from the retailer. While that fight is going on, craft brewers and premium winemakers are playing into the slipstream. There has been a gap that's been created.\"\nConsumption down Although Australia's alcohol consumption has dived to its lowest in 50 years, according to the bureau of statistics, the industry's overall revenue has remained steady.\nMarket research firm IBISWorld estimates revenue growing about 0.2 per cent a year since 2011 to $4.3 billion, and said the premium prices commanded from craft and internationally branded beers had helped offset the decline in consumption.\nBut Mr O'Hoy said buying a smaller brewer did not necessarily protect earnings and fuel growth.\n\"You can burn value from the day you make the acquisition,\" he said.\n\"You have to find the right model. It is the exact opposite to what makes commercial breweries good.\"\nThis meant learning that producing less really could generate greater returns.\n\"It's a bit like wine. I probably learnt the hard way but … really you are better off to run out of a product, and sell it on allocation.\n\"Stone and Wood has been selling on allocation all its life. You can pick and choose who you sell to and you don't have to discount to the same degree that the majors do.\n\"It's counter-intuitive for you to run out of product. It goes against the grain. But I think you are better off to sell on allocation and that's what the good craft brewers are doing.\"\nMr O'Hoy said Lion, a subsidiary of Japanese beverage company Kirin, had successfully acquired craft brands. \"They are the best at it that I've seen and I think it's a very light touch model, which probably gives you an indication about how you structure it\".\nLion's share Lion controls about 50 per cent of the Australian craft beer market, owning brands such as Little Creatures, which it fully acquired in 2012, James Squire, White Rabbit and Furphy.\nIt has invested heavily in maintaining provenance of its craft brands. In 2013, Lion poured $60 million in refurbishing an old carpet factory along the Barwon River in Geelong to create Little Creature's first east coast brewery – rather than shift production into one of its bigger plants.\n\"We have been able to grow the country's leading craft portfolio by respecting the craft brewing ethos of our brands, breweries and hospitality venues, while leveraging Lion's scale distribution system to get these great brands to more beer lovers,\" said Lion craft marketing director Gordon Treanor.\n\"We give our brewers licence to experiment and innovate.\"\nHe said this included all Lion brewers, whether they worked at Tooheys or Little Creatures, rubbishing the \"artificial divide\" between mainstream and craft beer.\n\"I challenge you to speak to any brewer who isn't passionate about his brews. We will keep giving our craft brands the dedicated focus and flexibility they need to flourish, while also better selling the benefits of all styles of beer and making the total category more appealing and accessible to a wider range of consumers.\"\n﻿ What is craft? IBISWorld senior analyst Spencer Little said the distinction between craft and non-craft was becoming increasingly blurred, but didn't believe it was necessarily tied to production volumes.\n\"Really, I guess the distinction we would draw would be between the traditional full-strength beers, and mid-strengths as well, versus the more recent beers, Little Creatures etc,\" Mr Little said.\nAlthough he said the consolidation within sector was making it harder for smaller brands to become established, such was the thirst for new flavours that he doubted they would disappear.\n\"Consumers are willing to go looking for the little guys and back the smaller microbreweries and craft beer brands that are manufacturing locally, whether it's in their own suburb, area. While entering the industry and becoming successful is very difficult, we have seen some examples of success.\"\nAsahi declined to reveal how much it paid for Mountain Goat, which is its second Australian acquisition after it bought Melbourne brand Cricketers Arms in 2013.\nThe company owns a brewing facility in an industrial estate at Laverton and has indicated a desire to become a substantial player in Australia's highly concentrated liquor market, in which SABMiller and Lion control 85 per cent.\nIn a statement, the company said it would continue to run Mountain Goat as a stand-alone business.\n\"Mountain Goat has become well established among the craft beer movement and offers a variety of beers,\" said Asahi's Australian chief commercial officer Scott Hadley.\n\"We plan to preserve the uniqueness of the Mountain Goat business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:43:07.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
