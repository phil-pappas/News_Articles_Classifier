According to the EIA ( U.S. Energy Information Administration) , distillate fuel is a “general classification for one of the petroleum fractions produced in conventional distillation operations. It includes diesel fuels and fuel oils.” Diesel fuel is also known as No. 1 fuel, heating oil is known as No. 2 fuel, and a blend of residual and distillate fuels is known as No. 4 fuels.\nThe EIA notes that diesel fuel is utilized in “on-highway diesel engines, such as those in trucks and automobiles, as well as off-highway engines, such as those in railroad locomotives and agricultural machinery. Products known as Diesel No. 1, Heating Oil No. 2, and No. 4 fuel oils are used primarily for space heating and electric power generation.”\n\nUS distillate inventories In its Weekly Petroleum Status Report released on October 15, 2015, the EIA states that US distillate inventories decreased from 149.2 MMbbls on October 2, 2015, to 147.6 MMbbls in the week ended October 9. Past reports state that inventory levels have fallen in the last four weeks.\nAccording to the API report released on October 14, 2015, US total distillate inventories fell this week to 148.0 million barrels, down by 2.7 million barrels (1.8%) from last week.\nImplications of decreased inventory levels The decrease in inventory levels is usually bullish for distillate prices. Higher prices give the opportunity for refiners such as Tesoro (TSO), Chevron (CVX), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Valero Energy (VLO), as well as refining MLPs such as Northern Tier Energy (NTI), to increase the production of distillates.\nAn increase in production volumes for distillates is positive for MLPs like Tesoro Logistics (TLLP) and Valero Energy Partners (VLP). Chevron accounts for 12.40% of the Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE).\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 2 - US Distillate Production and Increased Inventory Part 3 - Can Distillate Demand Influence Refiners’ Profits? distillate fuel Diesel fuel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:02:49.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
