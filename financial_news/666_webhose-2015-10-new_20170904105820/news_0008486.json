The Turnbull government has announced today it will shelve the policy for at least the remainder of the year.\nIt is also clear that changes to superannuation tax measures favouring wealthy savers — once ruled out by former treasurer Joe Hockey — are among the proposals back on the table.\nThe promise of income tax cuts at the next election, made under former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, also will be reviewed.\nPrime Minister Turnbull and Treasurer Morrison spoke on ABC radio just before a three-hour meeting of 20 business group leaders and ministers convened to discuss broad options for changes to economic policies to be announced before the election scheduled for late next year.\nMr Turnbull again promoted his “agile” style of government but promised wide consultation with no policy haste.\n“I think you know I’m not somebody who drags his feet. And I’m an activist,” he said. “I’m a thoughtful and considered activist. I’m expeditious but I’m not rash.”\nOrderly, thoughtful, consultative process to come up with the right answers.\nHe said there would be a “an open debate, all things being on the table, nobody assuming that they’ve got the right answer”, indicating a contrast with the Abbott administration.\n“Everybody’s theory or proposition undoubtedly will be improved by discussion.”\nTreasurer Morrison said the problem of bracket creep had not been forgotten and acknowledged the plight of workers whose wage rises had pushed them into a higher tax bracket without the buying power of their pay packet improving.\nMr Morrison said in 2000, 80 per cent of wage earners paid 30 cents in the dollar tax. The figure now is around 25 per cent. Someone on the average wage now is in the second-highest tax bracket.\n“I think we have an opportunity … to open up debate. Not open up debate for ideological reasons, I think to open up the debate for practical reasons,” said Mr Morrison.\n Turnbull takes out the Abbott-era trash", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/malcolm-turnbulls-reform-summit-looks-set-to-bury-tony-abbott-era-for-good/story-fn5tas5k-1227551953609", "http://www.news.com.au/national/politics/turnbull-government-announces-it-will-scrap-controversial-plan-to-allow-universities-to-set-own-fees/story-fns0jze1-1227551926334"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:08:24.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
