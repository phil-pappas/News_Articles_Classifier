N-Gas and WAPCo currently supply around 100 million standard cubic feet of gas daily to Ghana on a contractual basis. \nAfter a high level meeting between Nigerian and Ghanaian delegation on Wednesday, the Nigerian Gas Company, a major shareholder in N-Gas, and the WAPCo promised to continue with the supply of Gas to the VRA, Ghana’s Power Ministry has announced. \nThe Power Ministry Monday indicated that Ghana will settle the remaining US$170 million debt in three tranches. The first payment is expected to be made by November 2015, and final payment scheduled for February 2016. \nSources to Joy News’ Francis Abban at WAPCO said though they would not cut gas to Ghana, they need the payment plan urgently. The company is not sure of the action to take should government default payment after the first tranche. \nBut head of Public Affairs at the Power Ministry, Kweku Sersah-Johnson told Francis Abban, the partners have “agreed that whatever happens, if there are any challenges, any party will communicate to the other so that we will avoid the situation where we have this kind of threat coming in”. \nHe admitted that negotiation has “not ended entirely” because parties are still ironing out the “payment format”. \nThe meeting which brokered the new accommodation between the partners in Accra today involved the Nigerian Minister of State designate and Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Dr. Emmanuel Kachikwu Ibemenam, the Ghana’s Minister of Power, Dr. Kwabena Donkor, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Seth Terkper and the Chief Executive of VRA, Mr. Kirk Koffi. \nOther officials who were present at the negotiations included Ing. Bakare Babatunde, Chairman of the Board of N-Gas and Mr. Walter Perez, Managing Director of WAPCo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:27:44.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
