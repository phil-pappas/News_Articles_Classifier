You know, their own costs, competition, international markets, the cost of funds above all,\" he said.\n\"I think many people thought [the Westpac decision] was not necessary but, you know, we're running the government. We'll express some views from time to time about banks' movements on interest rates but it is ultimately a matter for them and of course for the market.\n\"A bank's decision will always be a commercial decision and it's always up to the bank to explain their decisions.\"\nWestpac raised its home lending rates by 20 basis points in anticipation of the government endorsing the financial system inquiry recommendation that they increase capital holdings as extra insurance against another economic downturn.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison blasted Westpac for gouging its customers, noting the increase was higher than that required to raise the extra money.\nAustralian Bankers' Association chief executive Steven Munchenberg said on Tuesday morning the banks are entitled to pass the extra cost on to consumers. He argued consumers ultimately benefited from a stronger banking system.\n \"Higher capital requirements will contribute to making an already safe system safer, but there will be costs across the system,\" he said.\nThe banks successfully fought moves to introduce a bank deposit tax which had the same aim as increased capital adequacy requirements. The banks had threatened to pass the tax onto consumers.\nMr Morrison said the banks could not blame the government nor the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which acted on the inquiry's recommendation regarding increased capital adequacy.\n\"They're not decisions that have been imposed on them by APRA or by the government. The banks will make their own calls and they can deal with their own customers,\" the Treasurer said.\nThe government also skated around the FSI recommendation that superannuation be fit for purpose.\nMr Morrison said the government would legislate to reflect the recommendation.\n\"It makes it very clear that superannuation is there to ensure that when Australians reach retirement age they will not be reliant on welfare payments in the form of the pension,\" he said.\n\"This is the primary purpose and this is what's been outlined in the Murray report and I think that provides an excellent starting point as to how we might then go and prepare wording that might form part of legislation\".\nBut, with the government now prepared to look at superannuation tax concessions as part of the tax reform package, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison were less forthcoming when asked whether for for purpose also mean taking steps to avoid super tax concessions being used for wealth creation.\n\"We all understand what the argument is about tax concessions relating to superannuation and as we've said several times, these are all matters...that are under consideration in the context of ensuring that our tax system, our transfer system, our savings system, does everything it can to incentivise Australians...to work, save and invest,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\"You learn from experience and you've got to adjust the system as you go along.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-20T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:47:18.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
