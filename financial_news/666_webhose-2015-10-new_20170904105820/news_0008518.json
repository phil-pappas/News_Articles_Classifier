That's why I am taking an independent position.\" \nHe added: \"Infrastructure is one of the most important things facing the country in terms of getting the right infrastructure for the next generation, and I am delighted to be playing a role in seeing we have got the modern infrastructure that we need as a country. \n\"We need to get the transport, energy and housing infrastructure that's going to see us through the next generation. That's a very big challenge for us as a country. \n\"I think it's possible to have a very. very strong objective view on infrastructure requirements. \n\"Obviously it's the politicians that need to take the decisions, government and parliament, need to take these decisions, but it's possible, as with the Davis Commission on airports, to bring a strong objective analysis to underpin decisions and I think that's for the good of the country.\" \nMr Osborne told Sky News there was a need to raise major decisions above the political fray. \n\"Then we can get on and do what this country needs to do - get building,\" he said. \nMr Osborne added: \"Andrew Adonis is someone who even though he was a Labour cabinet minister actually did a lot to try to build consensus on things like the HS2 project and the Crossrail project which is being built in London.\" \n:: Read about the fall and rise of Mr Osborne \nMr Osborne will tell delegates in Manchester later: \"Where would we be if we had never built railways or runways, power stations or new homes? Where will be in the future if we stop building them now? \n\"We have to shake Britain out of its inertia on the projects that matter most.\" \nThe peer's initial remit is to focus on projects to improve connections between northern cities , and advise on the large-scale investments earmarked for London's transport network. \nThe Adonis Commission will make recommendations for projects every five years at the start of each parliament. \nAlthough these suggestions will not be binding, his body will have the ability to \"hold the Government's feet to the fire\" if ministers provide an insufficient response. \nLord Adonis said he was \"pleased\" to have been offered the role, adding: \"Without big improvements to its transport and energy systems, Britain will grind to a halt. \n\"Major infrastructure projects like Crossrail and building new power stations span governments and parliaments.\" \nThe new body's creation follows criticism that the Davies Commission took three years to recommend a third runway at Heathrow after hearing submissions from hundreds of aviation experts, planning officials and environmentalists. \nLord Adonis has quit the Labour whip in order to ensure the new commission is politically independent, meaning it does not constitute a defection to the Conservatives. \nBut the timing of his departure, with voluble disagreements between senior Labour party figures, could still be unwelcome for Labour's new frontbench team. \nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn said the Conservatives' record on infrastructure over the past five years has been \"one of complete failure to deliver\". \nHe added: \"There is still nothing to indicate that the Tories understand the desperate need for serious long-term investment in infrastructure.\" \n:: The Chancellor will be making his speech to the Conservative party conference from 11.45am.
