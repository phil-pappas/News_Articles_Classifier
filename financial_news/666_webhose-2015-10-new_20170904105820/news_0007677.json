Smaller lenders must use a method set out by regulators, known as the standard approach. \nIn-house models are more sensitive to risks than the standard approach and come up with a lower capital requirements. \n\"The consequence of this is that smaller banks and building societies cannot compete effectively in lower risk asset markets such as prime mortgages because the capital requirements are too far apart and in favour of large banks,\" Bailey told a financial services audience. \n\"This forces them into riskier assets and undermines their position.\" \nThe Bank is taking a twin-track approach: seeking to persuade the European Union to change its bank capital law to ease the burden on smaller lenders; and in the meantime help smaller lenders get approval to use their own models for mortgages. \n\"We welcome internal model applications by smaller banks and we will do what we can to help them meet the required prudential standards, which are largely set out in the EU legislation,\" Bailey said. \nBrussels has begun a consultation on reviewing its bank capital rules to see whether changes could be made to help lenders provide more funds for the economy. \nThe BoE has told the EU it wants a more tailored approach to capital requirements at smaller lenders. \n\"This is an important issue, and one that matters if we are to have growing challenger banks,\" Bailey said in reference to a new generation of lenders like Virgin, Metro (Other OTC: MTRAF - news ) , Aldermore and Atom. \nThe move will help soften the blow of a new industry-wide surcharge on profits from next year. \nThe PRA has authorised ten banks in the last two years, and has a \"substantial\" pipeline of interested parties, Bailey said. \n(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:20:22.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
