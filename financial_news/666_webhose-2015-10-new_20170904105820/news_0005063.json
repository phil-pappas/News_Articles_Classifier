The same probe found less-than-expected signs of corruption in Wal-Mart’s Mexico business, it said.\nThe bribing in India comprised thousands of small payments to low-level officials to help move goods through customs or obtain real estate permits, the newspaper reported, citing persons it didn’t identify. The vast majority of the payments were below $200, and some were as low as $5, with the total amounting to millions of dollars, the report said.\nWal-Mart is likely to face charges of violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act due to these payments, the paper said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer is “cooperating fully” with the U.S. government on the matter and can’t comment further, Wal-Mart India spokesman Rajneesh Kumar said when contacted Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:35:46.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
