View Enlarged Image \n\nAmazon's North American gross merchandise volume captured 36% of all total retail growth this year, estimates Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer. \n\"Amazon's continued wallet share gain, likely as a result of increasing Prime membership count\" helped spark the strong quarter, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos said in a research report. \nAmazon swung to a per-share profit of 17 cents from a per-share loss in the year-earlier quarter . Analysts had expected a 13-cent loss. Mahaney said that Amazon's operating income had risen 66%, higher than analysts expected. \nAt least nine investment banks raised their price targets for Amazon.com stock. JPMorgan Chase was the most bullish, with analyst Doug Anmuth setting an 800 target. \nAmazon stock rose as high as 9.8% Friday before closing at 599.03, up 6.2%. Amazon stock is up 93% this year and carries an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 98, where 99 is the highest. \nGlobal growth for Amazon.com's e-commerce business was strong for the second quarter in a row, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham wrote in a research note. \"What was especially positive was that each segment and region contributed to the acceleration,\" he said in a research note. \nThe company's electronics and general merchandise e-commerce sales, which make up about 70% of the company's total revenue, jumped 27% from Q3 2014, Graham pointed out. \nPrime Key To Growth \nAmazon's Prime membership remains one of the company's key tools. About 40% of Amazon.com customers, or 60 to 80 million customers, might be Prime members, according to an RBC Capital Markets survey last month. The survey found that 75% of Prime members said that they bought more from Amazon after joining Prime. About half the Prime members said that they spend $800 or more a year at Amazon, vs. 16% for non-Prime customers. \nInnovations like Prime Day — a Black Friday-like \"holiday\" that the company held for the first time on July 15 and that offered deals and discount Prime membership — also boosted revenue. In fact, analysts estimated that Prime Day alone accounted for 2 percentage points of Amazon's Q3 revenue growth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:19:19.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
