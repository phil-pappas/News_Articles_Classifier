I would have ben irritable. I’ve done it for 10 years.” \nThis is not, he hastens to add, because he has lost any affection for the TV stalwart, which boasts around 6m viewers. “I would wrestle to the ground and smother anyone who said that it was rubbish,” he says, with vehemence. “It’s a great show.” \nThe Apprentice had simply become too exhausting, he explains. Lord Sugar’s advisers are forced to run after the candidates, furiously taking notes to pass on to the big man. “Physically, it’s very demanding,” he says. \nThe show also taught him a lot about human nature and not all of it good. “Maybe I am a bit naïve, but I also had no idea that people lie so freely,” he says. “That was a disappointment.” \nBut Hewer is not twiddling his thumbs now that he’s out of the show. Despite protestations that he’s “no Mother Teresa”, he reels off several charities he campaigns for. “I’ve yet to discover the word 'no’ when it comes to charity work,” he says. \nHewer is a patron of Pancreatic Cancer Action , because his sister-in-law and several friends died of the disease. He is also a patron of Hope and Homes for Children, and Street Child. He flies out to Sierra Leone at the end of this month on behalf of the latter. “We’re trying to feed and rehouse Ebola orphans,” he says. \nHewer still presents Countdown , saying: “It’s not exactly coal-mining in February, but it’s a tough old gig.” He has no interest in PR these days, an industry he claims is “unrecognisable” with the advent of social media. \n“I don’t know what they’re all talking about now,” he says, biting into a butter croissant, and shaking his head. “The young women and the blokes, they all pitch up in torn jeans.” \nFor a man who sold his PR agency way back in 1997 and ostensibly retired in 2004, he keeps busy. “At my age, you’ve got to keep going,” he says. “If you suddenly stop although we all yearn for that moment if you do, it’s the end. I’m still flying as fast as I can. \n“Friends of mine who had high-powered jobs who suddenly stopped working, at least two of them ended up in psychiatric hospitals. Seriously.” \nHe’s also taken on roles helping small businesses. His latest project is Bark , a start-up that matches local tradespeople and professionals with consumers. This is why he’s agreed to be interviewed. He’s not an investor, he explains, he’s an ambassador. \nThe company’s founders refuse to disclose what fee he’s paid but he’s certainly earning it, bringing the subject back to Bark whenever he can. \n“This isn’t bulls**t,” he says of the service, which launched in February. “The concept behind it is very clever. I trialled it when I had a beeping gas cooker at home and it was great. I’m not going to jump every time someone picks up the phone,” he says of his promotional work. “But if people trust me and I hope they do, that’s great.” \nHewer is a much-loved TV personality. Last month, Loose Women’s Ruth Langsford admitted live on air that she has a crush on him, and he’s been sent raunchy underwear in the post by adoring fans. His popularity is down to “luck, not talent”, he insists. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) in business, Hewer says that he’s “not a great businessman”. As boss of his own PR agency, he kept some clients for 30 years or more. This is nothing to be proud of, he insists. “You shouldn’t burst into tears if you lose a client after five years because you’re being paid at the rate of year two, and not keeping up with inflation,” he explains. “But we used to treat the loss of every client like a family bereavement.” These clients included Lord Sugar’s Amstrad and security firm Securicor, which later became G4S (Amsterdam: GF6.AS - news ) “a very odd company,” he says, with his trademark tut. \nFor Lord Sugar, the man who propelled him to stardom, Hewer is full of praise. “What makes him a great entrepreneur is his focus,” he says. “You give him a proposal of 50 pages and he has this ghastly unerring accuracy to go straight to page 43 where the fundamental flaw of the whole argument was, and spot it. Absolute focus. \n“He’s not interested unless it’s relevant and if it’s relevant, boom, he’s on to it. Those big black eyes sweep round like a laser and bite in. There’s no escape when he’s concentrating.” \nJeremy Corbyn is clearly someone that Lord Sugar has in his sights, I suggest. The outspoken entrepreneur has threatened to up sticks to China if the Labour leader ever rises to power. \n“Why would he want to go to China?” asks Hewer. “He has lots of homes in other parts of the world but none, as far as I know, in China. He’s always good for a quote, though, isn’t he?” \nWhat frightens long-standing Labour supporter Lord Sugar about the party’s new leader, Hewer explains, is that Corbyn marks a return to the bad old days of the trade unions . \n“He thinks Old Labour has had its day,” he says. “When the unions were worthwhile and genuine because they’d been put upon. He thinks the world has moved on and doesn’t want to be dragged back to the days of strikes and all that.” The current swell of political support for Mr Corbyn and the Tories’ move further Right is stirring up social unrest, he adds. “God forbid, but if we have a hot summer, things could kick off,” he says. “Remember we had the riots down in Camberwell and Brixton? It’s not beyond the bounds of possibility.” \nHewer presents Countdown, which is filmed in Media City in Salford , and he was also recently in Ipswich filming a BBC TV show about benefits. He’s seen extreme poverty across the country on his travels, he explains. “In Salford forget Media City, which is like The Emerald City [from The Wizard of Oz] it’s tough. Buildings are boarded up, grass is growing through the pavement.” \nHe’s seen no evidence of the Chancellor’s “Northern powerhouse”. “Doesn’t look like it to me,” he says. \nEven tougher times are ahead, he claims. “We’re living in a fool’s paradise on the interest rates,” he says of the ongoing 0.5pc base rate imposed by the Bank of England. “It can’t go on indefinitely. \n“People will be burnt out [when it rises]. It could be an absolute disaster. \n“I sat next to an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer two years ago,” he goes on. “He said that the average household’s savings would last a month.” \nHewer doesn’t claim to have the answer to the UK’s economic woes “Don’t ask me!” but says that come what may, the nation’s entrepreneurs will keep starting and growing businesses and doing their bit to prop up the economy. “Real entrepreneurs don’t give a damn,” he says. “They’re going to get on and do it anyway.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:15:56.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
