These cancers could be reduced by 1400 alone if Australians just stuck to the guidelines of no more than two drinks a day.\nEach year smoking is linked to 15,525 cases in 13 places including less obvious locations such as the bowel, liver, kidneys and ureter, and stomach.\nThe study, funded by Cancer Council Australia and conducted by QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, found the four most preventable cancers are lung, colorectal, melanoma and breast.\nGet over the tan thing and use sunscreen. . iStock Although prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Australia, it has no known preventable causes. David Whiteman, professor of epidemiology with QIMR Berghofer, who led the study, said while there was speculation about possible preventable causes, the two major authorities that make these determinations, The International Agency for Research on Cancer and the World Cancer Research Fund, had not formally agreed upon any.\nHe did say, however, that there was a view that obesity is likely to emerge as a causal factor for prostate cancer.\nWhiteman says men have higher rates of cancer because, compared with women, they smoke and drink more, exercise less and eat a poorer diet.\nThe new study also excludes brain and occupational cancers because the data is not firm enough. Surprisingly, the data is also not reliable for medical radiation, delivered through Xrays and CT scans.\nQuit smoking. Domino Postiglione The study did include the impact of some infections. It found the human papillomavirus, Helicobacter pylori and Hepatitis B and C caused the largest number of cancers. HIV and Epstein Barr caused fewer.\nSanchia Aranda, CEO of Cancer Council Australia, says it is time to focus on reducing the known risk factors.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-10-06T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:43:06.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
