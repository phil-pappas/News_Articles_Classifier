Rohan Thomson Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Despite Tony Abbott's best efforts to jam him on radio , Malcolm Turnbull is certainly getting the political atmospherics right. The Prime Minister's decision to call a meeting of business, community and union leaders to Canberra to talk about reform with senior economic ministers has already paid off.\nThe participants emerged to enthuse together about the Government's willingness to engage and to praise the constructive nature of the discussions.\nEven Dave Oliver from the ACTU was sounding ambitiously cooperative, talking about the \"commonality\" of interests despite the views of those outside the process. (Sound of Bill Shorten gagging…closely followed by an abruptly ex-Prime Minister)\n\"We all have on thing in common,\" the ACTU secretary declared. \"It's all about growth.\"\nCassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Service said it was always easy to divide people but pointed out there was a lot more binding everyone together, especially at such at an exciting time for Australia.\nCut to Jennifer Westacott from the Business Council of Australia praising an \"outstanding\" meeting where people really listened to a discussion on how to grow the economy and lift productivity and create more jobs.\nThis meeting may have been an overdue and necessary first step in the development of policy to try to meet high hopes now in such full flower. But for all the sense of relief that the economic debate has finally become a more intelligent one just as Turnbull promised, this phase is still the easiest part.\nWhile everyone keeps happily insisting on the new mantra - \"everything is on the table\" - any package of reforms will inevitably require a lot of things to fall off again.\n According to Westacott, the absence of a communique was a highlight given how often such statements tend to be a race to the bottom.\nKnotty details still to be worked out\nBut the focus is still on presenting very general areas of agreement rather than dealing with any knotty details of disagreement - of which there are plenty. Tax is the most immediately obvious.\nOptions still \"on the table\" range from raising the GST to reducing the corporate tax rate to curbing tax concessions . So what's the balance between helping low and middle income earners and hitting higher income earners? And what about the constant battle between increasing spending on some programs but cutting spending on others? Which ones? TBA.\nCompromise is a valuable commodity, especially given the frustrating deadlock dominating and frustrating much of Australian political life over the last several years. But as successful party pollster Mark Textor insisted at the AFR Tax Summit last week – and fresh from helping with the re-election of the Cameron Government in the UK - the dream of bipartisanship on reform is a business fantasy.\nNor is it just likely to be only the ALP standing in the way in the \"battle of ideas\".\nWhile the unions and ACOSS are sounding extremely positive about the change of tone and the possibilities for cooperation, they will continue to have a very different list of priorities to business and to the Coalition.\nThat includes, for example, any prospect of increasing the GST despite their willingness so far to \"keep everything on the table\".\nAnd while the talk is about the quality rather than the quantity of investment in education and skills and how to adapt to the changing workforce, any attempt to redirect spending will immediately create a backlash.\nThe Government also decided to choose the same day to make a belated announcement it was withdrawing its doomed changes to university funding , for example. But retreat is not the same as coming up with any decisions. That will become another election campaign fight.\nWork, save and invest\nThe government under its own new management is dismissing the Abbott tradition of three word slogans in favour of what it sees as a more sophisticated and nuanced conversation with the community. But Scott Morrison is still going to be talking a lot about his own new three word economic slogan – \"work, save and invest\".\nThe challenge for this Treasurer will be translating that into comprehensive and connected reforms that can retain broad support in such an unforgiving fiscal context and a threatening economic outlook.\nMorrison does understand hard choices as well as any minister and he is a lot more able to consistently and relentlessly explain the logic behind them than his predecessor ever was. That doesn't necessarily translate into community acceptance when hard cash is at stake.\nTony Abbott no longer has his transcripts quickly delivered courtesy of the Government. Not surprisingly, Labor is all too willing to assist instead in order to ensure Abbott's comments immediately receive as wide coverage as possible.\nThose comments have included digs at Morrison for alleged disloyalty and insisting– against the convictions of his own party - that he would have won the election.\nBut according to his latest radio interview, the last thing Abbott wants to be is \"a thorn in the side of the people who are doing what they can, inevitably under difficult circumstances, to serve our country.\"\n\"I mean it doesn't matter how the Prime Minister arrived in that job, it doesn't matter how individual ministers have arrived in particular jobs, they've got very difficult and challenging jobs to do and it is the responsibility of all decent Australians to try and make it easier for them to do their job,\" he said.\nThose same people might find it a lot easier to do their job if Abbott simply shut up, of course. Instead, he is clearly determined to defend his government's record and try to prevent it from being quietly interred as a failure amid the noisy celebration of its replacement. It's his version of leaving everything on the table.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:06:38.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
