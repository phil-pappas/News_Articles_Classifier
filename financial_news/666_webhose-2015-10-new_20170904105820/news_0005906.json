With strong Class 8 sales expected into the end of the year, and no apparent catalyst to trigger stronger economic growth, we would expect capacity additions to remain ahead of freight creation at least into the end of 2015,” he added.ACT is the worldwide leading publisher of new and used commercial vehicle (CV) industry data, market analysis and forecasting services for the North American market, as well as the U.S. tractor-trailer market and the China CV market. ACT’s CV services are used by all major North American truck and trailer manufacturers and their suppliers, as well as the banking and investment community in North America, Europe and China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:11:20.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
