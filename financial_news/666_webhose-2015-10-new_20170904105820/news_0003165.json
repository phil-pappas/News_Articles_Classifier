What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about whether there is ever a reason to delay filing and suspending. Question : I can’t thank you enough for the service you are providing all Americans regarding Social Security. One year ago I would have said “seniors,” but I have learned from you that many more people depend on Social Security benefits. For over a year I have faithfully read your column (and all the comments) and feel that I am in a very good place about being educated on by benefits. But, to be sure, I would appreciate running my situation by you and asking a question.I just turned 66 at the end of May. My husband is 65 and will be 66 next August. The original plan was to both wait until 70 to collect Social Security, but thanks to you we now know that we have a better option. We were both teachers in New York for over 30 years so we have pensions, and Social Security was withheld so we have full Social Security benefits. In addition, we saved in IRAs and 403b accounts. We are in good shape, but still want to maximize our Social Security benefits.Being 66, I can file and suspend and next year my husband will file and suspend and collect a spousal benefit from my record. My Social Security is slightly higher ($100 a month), because for a few years my husband worked as a substitute, and they didn’t take out Social Security. As we each turn 70, we will collect maximum benefits. We agree that this is an insurance policy for old age. I am more worried about being comfortable 20 to 30 years from now as my mother is almost 98, and my father lived to 95. My husband’s mother lived to 95 and his father died at 82 (young in our family!).My question is, does it matter if I file and suspend now? Or is there any reason to wait until next August when my husband turns 66? Any comments on my plan would be appreciated. Answer : Thanks for your lovely and encouraging note. Your plan has a huge problem, which, fortunately, is easily fixed. I’m assuming that your husband will be 66 in August 2016, not August 2015. To carry out your plan, you should wait until he reaches 66 and then file and suspend. And he should NOT file and suspend, but file just for a spousal benefit on your work record. If he, too, files and suspends, Social Security will transform his spousal benefit into his excess spousal benefit. His excess spousal benefit will surely be zero, because it’s the difference between half of your full retirement benefit and 100 percent of his own full retirement benefit.Only one of two spouses in a married couple can receive a full spousal benefit. Why? Well, to collect a spousal benefit, one’s partner must have filed for his or her retirement benefit. But the act of filing for one’s retirement benefit instantly plunges one into excess benefit hell in which you can no longer collect another benefit, be it a spousal benefit, a widow(er) benefit, a divorcee spousal benefit, a divorcee widow(er) benefit, a child-in-care spousal benefit, or a mother or father benefit by itself. Instead, you can only get an excess benefit, which is, exactly equal to or close to, the benefit in question in excess of the retirement benefit for which you are eligible.So having your husband file and suspend would be a huge mistake. His only task is to file a restricted application just for a spousal benefit. He can, as you know, only do this when he’s reached full retirement age.Were you divorced (after having been married for a decade or more) at least two years prior to reaching full retirement age, you could both receive full spousal benefits because Social Security treats the ex-spouse as having filed for his or her retirement benefit whether or not that actually occurred. Consequently, divorcees have an advantage over married couples. Were you now both 64, you could get divorced, live in sin, both file for divorcee spousal benefits at 66 and then both collect your own retirement benefit at 70. Why 64? Well, you need to be divorced for at least two years before you can file for a divorcee spousal benefit, or your ex has to have actually filed for his or her retirement benefit.Another option that careful software could evaluate is your having your husband file now for his retirement benefit and having you immediately collect a full spousal benefit on his work record. He’d then suspend his retirement benefit at 66, and you’d take your retirement benefit at 70. This would permanently lower his own lifetime retirement benefits, but get the full spousal benefit started now rather than a year from this August. I doubt this is worth it compared to the first option, namely he collects a full spousal benefit on your work record.Finally, if you take the first option, you should file now and suspend or wait until he reaches full retirement age. I’d wait because, God forbid, were he to pass away before reaching full retirement age, you’d want to collect a full widow’s benefit on his work record and then at 70 take your own maximum retirement benefit. But if you filed and suspended right now, you’d be in excess widow’s benefit word and wipe out your potential widow’s benefit.
