It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) made a net profit of one billion euros in 2013 and 212 million euros last year, the slide being mostly attributed to one-off restructuring charges incurred with privatisation in mind. \nIts status as a trusted brand in an ageing and financially conservative country has seen it acquire 420 billion euros in savings deposits through its post office-based accounts and it has plans to substantially develop its asset management activity. \nThe capital raised will make only a small dent in Italy's 2.2 trillion euro debt mountain, but Prime Minister Matteo Renzi sees it as the first step in a bigger privatisation programme which he hopes will help attract foreign investors to a country slowly emerging from recession. \n\"It is a very important day, a historic privatisation,\" said Fabrizio Pagani, the Economic and Finance Ministry official in charge of the project. \nPagani said the challenge for Poste Italiane was to become a national champion in the way that energy groups Eni (NYSE: E - news ) and Enel (Milan: ENEL.MI - news ) have since taking part in Italy's last major wave of privatisations. \nRenzi said recently the group had been held back by 60 years of political interference. \"We are putting it on the market so it will no longer be available to politicians to get it to employ whoever they want,\" the centre-left premier said. \nThe public companies expected to follow Poste Italiane to market include air traffic controller Enav and Italian state railways (FS). \nSmaller sell-offs last year saw stakes in shipyard operator Fincantieri and telecomms group Rai Way (Berlin: 4RW.BE - news ) floated. \nFrancesco Caio, the CEO of Poste Italiane, said he anticipated strong interest from international investors based on a renewed interest in Italy as \"a country which, more than others, can benefit from economic recovery and a government implementing reforms (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:50:26.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
