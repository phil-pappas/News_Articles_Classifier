We are investing in our brands, enhancing our route to consumer, introducing great innovations ... winning in reserve and focusing on cost and cash. We can realise Diageo's full potential and deliver our performance ambition.\" \nThe company's brand portfolio also includes Captain Morgan rum, Johnnie Walker whisky and Baileys. \nIn addition to its wine division, Diageo recently announced the sale of Gleneagles, the hotel and golf resort which staged last year's Ryder Cup. \nDiageo declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:25:47.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
