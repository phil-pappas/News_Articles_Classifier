In addition, research indicates that as early as 24 months, children in low-income families have been found to show lags in cognitive and behavioral development compared to their peers in higher-income families. To improve school readiness for prekindergarten learners, Scientific Learning Corp. (OTC PINK:SCIL) is teaming up with Kiko Labs to offer Kiko’s Thinking Time ( http://www.kikolabs.com/schools ). \n“We’re seeing a growing emphasis on early education, especially for children in poverty. As a result, many of our customers have been asking for a neuroscience-based solution for their pre-K learners,” said Robert C. Bowen, CEO of Scientific Learning. “We’re excited to offer Kiko’s Thinking Time to schools and districts because it’s a wonderful complement to the Fast ForWord® program for K-12 students. It takes the latest breakthroughs in neuroscience and turns them into adaptive games that help young learners have fun while sharpening their cognitive skills.” \nDesigned by Harvard and U.C. Berkeley neuroscientists, with support from the U.S. Department of Education, Kiko’s Thinking Time is a cognitive training program that targets the skills for school success, including memory, attention and key cognitive skills. Through this partnership, schools and districts can now purchase Kiko’s Thinking Time to provide a neuroscience-based learning solution for children ages 3 to 5 years old. \n“While executive function and reasoning skills are critical for a child’s success in school, their development isn’t guaranteed. They can be impacted by socioeconomic status, demands on single parents or busy working families, as well as overburdened schools and teachers,” said Grace Wardhana, co-founder of Kiko Labs. “Kiko’s Thinking Time targets behaviors that train these skills, which are so important to a child’s development and school readiness. We’re delighted to have the opportunity to bring this program to schools and districts to help early learners build the foundational skills for school success.” \nKiko’s Thinking Time is accessible on the iPad® and is available for $2,000 per school for a one-year license. \nFor more information, visit www.kikolabs.com/schools . \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151013006816/en/ \ncognitive skills Contact: Scientific Learning Corp.\nHallie Smith, 619-888-0887\nHSmith@scilearn.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:39:51.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
