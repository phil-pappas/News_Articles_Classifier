By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 50 minutes ago 252.27 +1.0200 \nThis couple lost a huge sum when emails to their solicitor were hacked. Regulators say law firms have a duty to safeguard clients' money, but they're still waiting for their money back \nDistraught victims of “conveyancing fraud” are being forced to wait months for regulators to investigate their case, leaving them in financial limbo and often many thousands of pounds out of pocket. \nTelegraph Money has reported a string of cases in which criminals have hacked into emails sent between solicitors and clients. The fraudsters, posing as one of the parties, send emails with instructions to transfer the money from property transactions to a rogue account. They then disappear with the funds. \nThe Solicitors’ Regulation Authority (SRA), which polices legal firms, has been very vocal about the dangers of conveyancing fraud and has repeatedly warned solicitors that they have a duty to protect their clients’ money. But some firms still aren’t taking notice and the SRA appears to be slow and often powerless to put things right. \nIn May this newspaper reported the case of Paul and Ann Lupton , whose solicitor, Perry Hay & Co in Richmond (Taiwan OTC: 2743.TWO - news ) , Surrey, transferred the £333,000 from their property sale to a fraudulent bank account. \nThe bulk of the money was eventually recovered but the couple are still £48,500 out of pocket. \nWhen Perry Hay & Co refused to compensate them, they lodged formal complaints with the SRA and Legal Ombudsman in May. But eight months after the fraud took place, they are still waiting for the SRA to complete its investigation into the firm’s actions. \nTo compound the situation, the Legal Ombudsman has said it will not progress the complaint until the SRA has completed its investigation. \n= 'Nobody’s fighting our case’ = \n== \nEarly this year the Luptons sold the flat they had bought for their daughter Tracey near Waterloo, south London, for £340,000. \nTwo days before the set completion date of February 27, Perry Hay & Co emailed Mr Lupton to request details of the bank account he wanted the sale proceeds to be paid into. \nHe duly replied, sending his Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) bank account number and sort code. But the email was intercepted by fraudsters who, posing as Mr Lupton, swiftly emailed Perry Hay & Co again from the same email account and told the firm to disregard the previous details and send the money to a different account instead. \nThe sale completed as planned and the solicitor sent the funds, amounting to just over £333,000 after fees and charges, to the criminals’ account. \nA few days later Mr Lupton called the solicitors to chase the payment and the crime was discovered. Both parties contacted Barclays and the police. \nBarclays was the account provider for all three parties involved: the solicitors, the fraudsters and the Luptons. The account was frozen and £271,000 was returned to the Luptons, leaving them £62,000 out of pocket. A further £13,500 was later recovered from a different account. \nFollowing the crime, Perry Hay & Co said it did not believe it was at fault and that the Luptons would have to suffer the £48,500 loss. \n• 'Our £300,000 house buying money was stolen' \n• Email hacking: another home-seller robbed of £270,000 \nMr Lupton then made a formal complaint to the firm, which replied by saying the fraud was “cleverly administered and well organised in such a way that this firm could not have been expected to have identified the fraud or acted any differently”. \nAt the time, the SRA told Telegraph Money that member firms were responsible for safeguarding clients’ funds and had to replace any money that was “improperly withheld or withdrawn from a client account”. \nBut despite being the legal watchdog, the SRA has no powers to force firms to compensate victims even when misconduct is established. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) can only recommend compensation something firms can choose to ignore. The SRA can impose fines or refer firms to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal powers it hopes will encourage firms to comply. \nBut this brings little comfort to the Luptons. “We feel like there’s no one fighting our case,” Mr Lupton said. “The whole process has been extremely frustrating and there’s been a real lack of communication from the SRA, despite promises to keep us informed. \n“Eight months have now passed since we fell victim to the fraudsters and five months since we referred our complaints to the regulator and ombudsman. The details of the case are very straightforward, so I don’t understand why there’s been such a hold‑up.” \nAn SRA spokesman described the case as “complex” and said it was still in talks with the firm involved. \n“Unfortunately, there’s no timescale for when this matter could be concluded,” he added. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:08:24.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
