No deaths have been reported as a result of the problem.\nPatients in the trials will get updated consent forms before deciding whether to continue in the studies.\nAZD9291 and durvalumab are two of AstraZeneca's most promising experimental cancer treatments, although their use together in lung disease is only one of many possible applications.\nAZD9291, like a rival product in development at Clovis Oncology, targets a genetic mutation that helps tumours evade current lung cancer pills. AstraZeneca has said it could generate sales of as much as $3 billion a year.\nDurvalumab belongs to the keenly anticipated class of immuno-oncology drugs known as anti-PD-L1 therapies, which work by stopping a tumour's ability to evade the body's defences. AstraZeneca has forecast it could sell $6.5 billion a year.
