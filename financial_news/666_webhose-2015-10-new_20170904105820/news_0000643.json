Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates ANZ Bank chief executive Mike Smith has dismissed claims banks will have to raise many billions of dollars more in capital as \"fairytales\".\nAs the government signalled support for tougher capital requirements on banks, the outgoing bank chief also said ANZ would weigh up its options on who would wear the cost of a safer banking system: shareholders or customers.\nThe big four banks have this year raised more than $18 billion in equity capital from shareholders, but some analysts argue they will need to raise even more as global regulations on banks tighten.\nIn its response to the financial system inquiry, the government on Tuesday said the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority would take \"additional steps to ensure our banks have unquestionably strong capital ratios\" by the end of 2016.\nHowever, Mr Smith said he thought the bulk of the capital raising had been done by banks.\nHe cited APRA's moves so far to tighten risk weights on mortgages, which raises bank capital requirements, and the extra capital charge levied on the big four, known as domestic systemically important banks (D-SIB).\n\"I think the heavy lifting has already been done frankly. If you think back, the D-SIB charge, and the adjustment of risk weighted assets to mortgages, really has been the major adjustment, but there will probably be some fine tuning going forward,\" Mr Smith told Fairfax Media.\nMr Smith said investment bank analyst predictions about the capital task facing the big four were \"overdramatic\" and often self-serving.\n \"I think the issue is that you can only manage what you know, and actually managing a fairytale is not very useful,\" Mr Smith said.\n\"And a lot of it is just a fairytale at the moment, we just do not know what will be proposed or what's going to come from this.\"\nAfter Westpac last week blamed tougher capital rules for its decision to raise mortgage interest rates by 0.2 percentage points, Mr Smith would not comment on ANZ's plans but said it was considering its options.\n\"We quite clearly have to weigh up our options. The fact is that the cost of further capital, the cost of increased regulation, has to be borne by somebody. This doesn't come for free,\" he said.\nIt came as the government endorsed all of the FSI recommendations relating to financial stability. These centred on boosting the size of bank capital buffers: funds banks hold to help them absorb loan losses.\nSeveral recommendations have been implemented by APRA this year.\nHowever, it was confirmed the regulator would take \"additional steps\" to ensure the banking system's strength by the end of 2016.\nBeyond 2016, the government said local banks would be subject to new global rules ensuring the world's biggest banks had adequate \"total loss-absorbing capacity\".\nIt will also introduce limits on bank leverage ratios.\nCommonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev supported the government's objective of making banks \"unquestionably strong\", highlighting the decision to develop a template to allow easier capital comparisons with lenders overseas.\nNational Australia Bank chief executive Andrew Thorburn said the bank had been preparing for tougher capital rules, citing its move to raise $5.5 billion from shareholders in May.\nCredit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin said the 2016 time frame for APRA to strengthen bank capital requirements was positive for the major banks because it made it more likely the capital could be built up through retained earnings rather than through more capital raisings.\nCommonwealth Bank, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ Banking Group have raised more than $18 billion in equity capital this year.\nMr Martin estimated the sector would need another $16 billion.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:15:47.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
