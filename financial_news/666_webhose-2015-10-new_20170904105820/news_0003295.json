Traders betting on the nation’s recovery are sending money to the the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking its shares for a sixth straight month.\n“I doubt the market is really so much focused on the earnings revisions,” said Christian Gattiker, head of research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich. “Italy is not so much impacted by the lack of growth in emerging markets. The rally has been justified.”\nEarnings downgrades have hit companies worldwide. For Italy, analysts reduced them by more than 4 percent since the FTSE MIB’s high in July -- that’s almost double the reductions for Germany’s DAX Index.\nYet because Italian firms are more domestic, traders are wagering an economy that grew more than projected last quarter will insulate its shares from the turmoil abroad. Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, the biggest FTSE MIB member, gets about 80 percent of its revenue from its home market.\nAverage analyst EPS forecast for FTSE MIB companies\nCredit Suisse Group AG advises investors look at auto-related stocks and retail banks to take advantage of domestic growth, while minimizing exposure to emerging markets. Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna SC, Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV are among the top FTSE MIB performers this year, up more than 44 percent.\nAfter Italian shares underperformed peers every year for almost a decade, traders switched to the nation on bets European Central Bank stimulus would propel the economy. But disregarding the risk of China’s slowdown would be a mistake, according to Romain Pasche, EFG Bank’s head of investment in Geneva.\n“The world has started re-rating Italy very fast in a very upbeat mode and suddenly you had some bad China news, which obviously had much more impact on GDP growth expectations, hence the EPS growth,” he said. “You don’t need a direct link to China to suffer.”\nStill, investors are paying less to hedge against swings in Italian stocks than the broader market. The cost of FTSE MIB options is at a four-year low relative to those on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n“The Italian market is insulated from any problems in emerging markets,” said Matteo Brancolini, an asset manager at Banca Popolare dell’Emilia Romagna. “It’s a little bit of a safe haven for the moment. Italy has recovered from its wounds of the past, it’s had an internal revival.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:52:13.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
