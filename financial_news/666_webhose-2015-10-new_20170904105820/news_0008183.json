DeVry Group also reported enrollment results at DeVry Medical International, Chamberlain College of Nursing, Carrington College, DeVry Brasil, and DeVry University and its Keller Graduate School of Management. \n“We expect DeVry Group’s strategy of quality, diversification and long-term focus to return us to revenue growth, beginning with fiscal 2017,” said Daniel Hamburger, president and CEO of DeVry Education Group. “Our 2016 first quarter results reflect solid execution of our strategy, including the planned repositioning of DeVry University and the continued growth in our healthcare and international segments.” \nAcademic and operational accomplishments: \nAmerican University of the Caribbean School of Medicine and Ross University School of Medicine enrolled their largest incoming classes in September Chamberlain College of Nursing opened a new campus in Irving, Texas, in September and is on track to open a campus in Charlotte, North Carolina, in January 2016 DeVry University expects to achieve its target of at least $125 million in cost savings and maintain positive segment economics in fiscal 2016 Abhay Ghiara, Fulbright Scholar and senior professor of arts, humanities, and economics at DeVry University, was selected to be a peer reviewer and evaluator for the Fulbright Commission Selected financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2015: \nTotal revenue decreased 4.5 percent to $441.4 million Medical and Healthcare segment revenue grew 8.7 percent International and Professional Education segment revenue grew 10.3 percent Business, Technology and Management segment revenue decreased 21.7 percent Reported net income was $5.5 million, compared to $20.4 million last year; net income excluding special items was $24.5 million, compared to $30.9 million last year Reported diluted earnings per share was $0.08, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.31 last year; earnings per share excluding special items was $0.38, compared to $0.47 last year Operating cash flow was $116.6 million compared to $141.1 million last year Cash and cash equivalents were $436.5 million as of Sept. 30, 2015 compared to $473.1 million as of Sept. 30, 2014 DeVry Group repurchased approximately 292,000 shares of common stock, up 32 percent from the prior quarter The fiscal 2016 first quarter results contained an after-tax charge of $19.0 million related to workforce reduction and real estate consolidations primarily at DeVry University. (See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information and Supplemental Reconciliation Schedule” on p. 7) \nOperating Highlights \nMedical and Healthcare Segment \nFor the first quarter, segment revenue of $224.0 million increased 8.7 percent compared to the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by strong demand at Chamberlain College of Nursing. Segment operating income, excluding special items, decreased 9.6 percent to $34.6 million as compared to the prior year. \nDeVry Medical International \nRevenue for the quarter at DeVry Medical International grew 0.5 percent to $82.8 million. In the September 2015 semester, new student enrollment increased 17.7 percent to 991 versus 842 in the prior year. Total student enrollment increased 2.2 percent to 6,546 versus 6,406 in the prior year. \nChamberlain College of Nursing \nFor the first quarter, Chamberlain revenue increased 22.4 percent to $101.0 million. For the September 2015 session, new student enrollment grew 27.9 percent to 4,942 students versus 3,864 in the prior year. Total student enrollment increased 23.3 percent to 25,802 versus 20,920 in the prior year. \nDuring the quarter, Chamberlain opened a new campus in Irving, Texas, and received approval to open a new campus in Charlotte, North Carolina, in January 2016. \nCarrington College \nRevenue at Carrington College decreased 2.4 percent to $40.2 million compared to the prior year. For the period ending Sept. 30, 2015, new students decreased 1.5 percent and total students decreased 1.0 percent compared to the prior year. Carrington expects improved results for the remainder of the year as it transplants programs into existing campuses, launches online programs and maintains disciplined cost control. \nInternational and Professional Education Segment \nSegment revenue increased 10.3 percent to $58.7 million compared to the prior year. On a constant currency basis, revenue in the segment grew 47 percent. Segment operating income in the first quarter decreased $2.7 million to $2.0 million. \nBecker Professional Education \nDuring the quarter, revenue increased 6.6 percent to $25.4 million, driven by strong demand for CPA and U.S. Medical Licensing Exam test preparation courses. \nDeVry Brasil \nRevenue in the quarter grew 13.3 percent over the previous year to $33.3 million. New and total student enrollments grew 176.0 percent and 72.1 percent, respectively. The increase at DeVry Brasil was primarily driven by the acquisitions of FMF, Faci and Damásio. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 80.2 percent. \nBusiness, Technology, and Management Segment \nDeVry University \nFor the first quarter, segment revenue decreased 21.7 percent to $159.5 million. DeVry University continues its transformation by enhancing its programs and services, addressing affordability and differentiating the university through strategic marketing. \nThe segment recorded an operating loss of $1.6 million in the seasonally weak first quarter, excluding special items. The loss reflects the impact of lower enrollments as expense management almost entirely offset the revenue decline. Expenses declined by 21 percent compared to the year ago period. DeVry University continued to make progress on reducing its cost structure and is on track to achieve at least $125 million in cost savings and maintain positive segment economics in fiscal 2016. \nFor the September 2015 session, new undergraduate students declined 24.0 percent to 4,006 students. Total undergraduate students declined 20.1 percent to 31,843 students. On a same-campus basis (excluding the locations moving to an online-only delivery), new undergraduate student enrollments declined 16.0 percent and total students declined 10.5 percent. \nThe number of graduate coursetakers in the September 2015 session was 12,937, a decline of 16.7 percent compared to the prior year. \nBalance Sheet/Cash Flow \nDeVry Group generated $116.6 million of operating cash flow. As of Sept. 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents totaled $436.5 million. \nOutlook \nDeVry Group provided the following outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016: \nRevenue is expected to decrease about six percent year over year, reflecting the planned repositioning of DeVry University and the impact of foreign currency in Brazil. Operating costs are expected to decline at approximately the same percentage rate as revenue versus the prior year quarter The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the 20 percent range, before special items Conference Call and Webcast Information \nDeVry Group will hold a conference call to discuss its fiscal 2016 first-quarter financial results on Oct. 22, 2015 at 4 p.m. Central Time (5 p.m. Eastern Time).

The following table illustrates the effects of restructuring charges on DeVry Group’s earnings. Management believes that the non-GAAP disclosure of net income and earnings per share excluding these special items provides investors with useful supplemental information regarding the underlying business trends and performance of DeVry Group’s ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations given the special nature of the restructuring charges. DeVry Group uses these supplemental financial measures internally in its management and budgeting process. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for, DeVry Group’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
