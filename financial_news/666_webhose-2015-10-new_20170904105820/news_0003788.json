Your Facebook account could also be targeted by the same stalkers,\" said technology expert Jacob Sihulo. When you enable the feature, you can choose who will be able to see when you're nearby (either all your friends, close friends, or just a specific friend list). If you realize it's is a little too creepy after all, you can turn it off at any time. \"Location sharing with Nearby Friends is a two-way street, meaning someone will only see that you're nearby if you share this information with them, and vice versa,\" Vaccari said. \"You and your friends both have to turn on Nearby Friends and choose to share with each other to see when you're nearby,\" she explained. Though, users of the app could be oblivious to the risks, even as cases of social media abuse increase in the country hence it would be critical for one to choose wisely for themselves what would ascertain their safety. According to the Daily Nation, Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) statistics state that last year alone, 5.4 million cyber-attacks were recorded in Kenya. \"The Internet has become a common place for cyber-attacks and users need to constantly protect themselves by protecting their personal information and whereabouts,\" said CA Director-general Francis Wangusi. The majority bordered around identity theft, cyber stalking and child pornography. Half a billion people now use Messenger, after Facebook forced them into it Facebook's Messenger is now one of the most used mobile messaging apps in the world, with more than 500 million people logging in monthly, the company said Monday. \"This is an exciting milestone,\" said Peter Martinazzi, Facebook's director of product management, announcing the stat. Facebook's main app has around 1.35 billion users; Facebook-owned WhatsApp has at least 600 million users. WeChat, owned by China's Tencent, has at around 438 million users, as of this past August. Facebook reached its milestone, however, as it angered users along the way. The company began requiring people to download Messenger for mobile chat several months ago, drawing criticism from those who didn't want to download a separate app for messages. Before that, Messenger had roughly 200 million monthly users, the company previously reported in April. Some people still seem annoyed, or confused, about why Facebook made the change. Clarity on why Facebook forced users to download the app was one of the most popular online questions submitted in the lead up to Facebook's first public town hall meeting last week. Facebook thought it could provide a better, faster messaging product by separating it, was CEO Mark Zuckerberg's explanation. Not everyone sees the logic in that. \"Separated app just for messages? Are you serious?\" wrote one Facebook user in an online discussion thread this past weekend, who said that switching between two apps all the time to send messages and see people's profiles was not \"comfortable.\" Kenya \nMandera politicians in the Jubilee coalition have threatened to quit the alliance if the government does not withdraw a … see more » Copyright © 2015 CIO East Africa.
