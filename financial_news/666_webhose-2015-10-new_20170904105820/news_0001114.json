That's the conclusion drawn from a study by TransUnion that shows younger Americans, in particular, unable to see divorce or death of a spouse, for example, as harbingers to bad credit scores. \"It's important for all people to understand the effect of life milestones on their credit so they can put themselves in a position to reach personal and financial goals,\" says Ken Chaplin, senior vice president at TransUnion. \"This survey reveals that many people, especially younger adults, may not be prepared for how certain events, such as marriage, buying a home or getting a car could alter their credit scores.\" The TransUnion report says Americans \"of all ages are generally unprepared for life events from a credit perspective, because they don't check their scores before or after the life event.\" Alarmingly, only 49% of U.S. adults check their credit score when hit with a major life event, like losing a job. Even positive life events, like marriage or having a baby, don't trigger credit checks by consumers, even though both can cost a great deal of money and thus will have a big impact on their credit health. \"Many different events - from major life milestones to small incidents - can enhance or damage your creditworthiness,\" Chaplin adds. \"It's worth investing in a credit monitoring service that can keep you informed about how events in your life are altering your score.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:23:33.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
