Bloomberg by Trevor Sykes One of Glencore's problems seems close to home: the $117 million it is owed by Aurelia Metals for the development of the Hera gold mine in NSW.\nGlencore is trying to put Aurelia into administration but the company is resisting vigorously and the dispute is headed for the NSW Supreme Court on November 4.\nAurelia has spent the last three years developing Hera, 100km southeast of Cobar in the well-known Lachlan Fold Belt of NSW, which also hosts the Cadia-Ridgeway, Cowal and Northparkes mines.\nAurelia did a $158 million funding package with Glencore back in September 2011, when mines and commodities looked better than they do now.\nWhen gold production began at Hera in April 2014, problems quickly became apparent. Mick Connolly Hera's orebody contains an estimated 2.18 million tonnes averaging 3.1 grams gold, 3.2 per cent lead, 4.2 per cent zinc and some silver. The mine life is only estimated at five years, but there is an excellent chance that will be extended through further exploration.\nExploration excites the punters but the real drama is when the processing plant (costing anywhere from $100 million upwards) is designed. Mistakes in plant design can be serious and very expensive. Sometimes they can't be fixed at all.\nAt Hera, the plant was planned to crush the ore, after which it would go through a gravity module which would recover 60 per cent of the gold, followed by leach tanks which would lift recovery to 94 per cent gold and also reclaim 47 per cent of the silver. A separate rotation circuit would recover in concentrate 91 per cent of the lead and 90 per cent of the zinc.\nAt the risk of over-simplifying, if anything goes wrong at the start of a processing plant, it is likely to impact recoveries in the rest. When gold production began at Hera in April 2014, problems quickly became apparent. The vertical spindle impact (VSI) tertiary crusher was not working efficiently and needed to be replaced by a cone crusher and ball mill.\n Recovery of gold through the gravity circuit was lower than expected, so the plant was using more expensive reagent. More gold was going through to the zinc and lead concentrate, where it is regarded as an impurity and attracts no payment.\nAurelia began solving the problems immediately, but when June 30 arrived this year they had borrowed heavily, gold recovery was 62 per cent instead of 94 per cent and so their accounts were maximum ugly. An impairment of $92.9 million on mine development pushed Aurelia to an operating loss of $118 million, the current account was adverse ($41 million liabilities against $13 million assets) and instead of net assets the balance sheet showed a deficiency of $35 million.\nSince June 30, Aurelia has improved plant efficiency, lifting gold recovery to 84 per cent and also improving zinc recovery. Gold is now projected to be produced at less than $700 an ounce after base metal credits. The replacement crushing plant is estimated to cost $16.8 million.\nGlencore's loans were in four facilities and Aurelia was permitted to convert two of them totalling $78.8 million into shares at 24¢ and 25¢. Aurelia announced it would exercise the conversion, which would have created about 300 to 315 million extra shares and giving Glencore 45 per cent of the issued capital.\nHowever, Glencore claimed Aurelia was insolvent at the time in breach of the loan agreement and attempted to appoint voluntary administrators to the company. That move crunched Aurelia's share price from 22¢ to 2¢.\nThe two companies are now heading for the courts, where the issues will probably be decided legally on the terms of the loan agreement and the dates upon which both tried to exercise their rights.\nFrom a practical viewpoint, Aurelia doesn't look much of a solvency risk. Pacific Road has publicly shown its support for Aurelia by providing $12 million in convertible facilities and agreeing to underwrite a $25 million equity issue. The principal of Pacific Road is veteran mining financier Paul Espie, who sits on the Aurelia board and probably understands the company and its outlook better than Glencore.\nSo Aurelia should be hoping for a practically minded judge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:09:53.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
