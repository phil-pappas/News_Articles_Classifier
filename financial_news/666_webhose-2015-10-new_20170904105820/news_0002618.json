Ssali \nThe Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) has come up with a report which reveals that Africa's large youth population could be its greatest asset. The report \"Youth in Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa\" was launched last week in Lusaka, Zambia during the African Green Revolution Forum (AGRF). \nThe continent which has 226 million people aged between fifteen and twenty five has sixty per cent of the world's arable land but the youths have no access to it and its food production falls behind its population growth. \n\"A continent with such vast holdings of arable land and a large and increasingly educated young force should be the envy of the world,\" said Dr Agnes Kalibata, President of AGRA and formerly Rwanda's minister of agriculture and animal resources. \n\"Our growing population of young people, who should be a treasured resource for economic growth, are often labelled a 'ticking time bomb' for fear of their lack of job prospects generating instability.\" \nThe report indicates that Africa can overcome its chronic food shortages and employment challenges by immediately addressing the major stumbling blocks such as: lack of land rights tenure system, credit, quality farm inputs, entrepreneurial skills, machinery and other impediments preventing agriculture from providing jobs on and off the farm for the youth population. \nIt highlights the Wold Bank's view that incomes in Africa are rising in the continent's rapidly expanding urban centres, generating a consumer food market that by 2030 will be worth US$ 1 trillion. \nIt says those demands could be met by farms and related agriculture businesses located in African rural communities. If given the land, the needed skills, credit, and other incentives the youth can produce, process, and sell the food to meet the big demand and even get out of poverty. \n\"Agriculture can provide a reliable and lucrative source of income from producing and selling seeds and other farm supplies, to cultivating crops themselves, to providing storage, marketing and processing services or getting involved in local, regional and international food markets,\" said Dr David Sarfo, Managing Editor of the report.
