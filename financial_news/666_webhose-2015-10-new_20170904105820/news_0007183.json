The common currency was on track to end the week effectively flat.\nThe greenback was nearly unchanged at 118.94 yen after pulling away from a 7-week trough of 118.065 struck overnight. The U.S. currency was still poised to lose 1 percent this week.\nThe New Zealand dollar lost a bit of lift after news on Friday of inflation cooling slightly in the third quarter, an outcome seen giving the central bank room to cut rates if needed.\nThe consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in the third quarter, taking the annual rate to 0.4 percent, Statistics New Zealand said on Friday.\nThe kiwi inched down 0.3 percent to $0.6829 after flying to a 3-month high of $0.6897 earlier this week on expectations that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand might pause in cutting rates.
