Andrew Meares But as we have learned from bitter experience with FTA deals, the detail is everything and while we can hail the striking of the deal, and what it says for a general impetus to trade liberalisation, we have to reserve judgment on how it will operate in practice.\nEven in looking at the details we do have about the TPP, the glaringly better arrangements in it compared with, say the Japan-Australia FTA signed just last year, hit you in the eye.\nFor example, the TPP will cut beef tariffs in Japan for Australian and American farmers to 9 per cent, bettering the Abbott government's free trade deal with Tokyo last year which secured tariffs of between 19.5 per cent and 23.5 per cent to be phased in over 15-18 years.\nWeeks, not months The fact that we should actually see the fine details of the deal within weeks, rather than months, is also to be commended.\nThere has been a general presumption that the three North-Asia FTAs signed by the Coalition in the past couple of years have been framed by, or benefited from two different factors.\nThe first is that the FTA deals were able to be struck because the Coalition was prepared to make more concessions than Labor in the interests of getting the deals done.\nThe second is that Trade Minister Andrew Robb led a smart strategic push to get all three agreements finalised in rapid succession, believing Japan, South Korea and China would offer more competitive terms when they were conscious the other deals were also close to completion, or just completed.\nWith the TPP, even though the negotiations were even more complex because of the involvement of 12 countries, Robb has managed to build on this, and took a commendably hard line on the subject of pharmaceuticals , even perhaps at the cost of a better deal on sugar, which, appropriately, reflected Australia's changing trade priorities.\nThe deal has met a lukewarm reception in the United States, both from the Republicans and some Democrats in the presidential race, who have questioned if it is an optimum outcome for the US.\nPolite reaction The response here has been more polite. Labor has welcome the multilateral deal but has reserved judgment until they see the full details. Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has been more sceptical.\nBut the importance of the TPP in a political sense may be that it has helped restore a more bipartisan rhetorical line on trade matters than has been apparent in the recent debate about the China Free Trade Agreement.\nFor the rest of us, the deal provides a crucial fillip to the prospects of boosting global trade at a time when it has actually gone backwards in the first half of 2015, and focuses on the sorts of services exports that will be crucial to us in the post-mining boom world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:08:48.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
