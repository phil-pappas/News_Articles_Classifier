Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Edmund Tadros Interactive - Explore the poll of polls\nAlmost two-thirds of voters believe the Liberal Party took the right decision to replace Tony Abbott with Malcolm Turnbull as leader, the latest Newspoll has found.\nThere is majority support for the decision to install Mr Turnbull as leader across the party divide, with 56 per cent of Coalition supporters and 71 per cent of Labor supporters in favour of the move.\nThe poll, published in Monday's edition of The Australian , also found the Coalition and Labor both on 50 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, while Mr Turnbull's personal approval rating continued to soar.\nThe deadlocked two-party preferred polling is in contrast with other national polls carried out since the leadership change that have mostly found the government is ahead of the opposition.\nA Roy Morgan poll published last week had the Coalition's two-party preferred vote at 55 per cent, while an Essential poll had the Coalition at 52 per cent.\nThe Coalition, which won the 2013 election under Mr Abbott with a decisive two-party preferred vote of 53.5 per cent, has not seen support like this since the months immediately following that election.\n All two-party preferred figures are based on preference flow at the last election.\nThe Newspoll found the Coalition's primary polling is now at 43 per cent while Labor's primary polling is at 35 per cent.\nHalf of voters surveyed are satisfied with Mr Tunrbull's performance, with the remaining half split evenly between those dissatisfied and those uncommitted.\nIn contrast, only 28 per cent of voters were satisfied with the performance of Opposition Leader Bill Shorten while more than half, 53 per cent, were dissatisfied. Almost one-fifith, 19 per cent, were uncommitted in their view of Mr Shorten.\nThe majority of voters, 57 per cent, thought Mr Turnbull a better PM than Mr Shorten.\nThe survey is based on 1631 interviews carried out between Thursday and Sunday and has a margin of error of 3 per cent.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com.au/cqstatic/12z7v7/Was_it_right_to_replace_Abbott_with_Turnbull-_Yes_No_Uncommitted_chartbuilder.png", "http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/newspoll-malcolm-turnbulls-appeal-grows-but-parties-locked/story-fn59niix-1227565337941", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/103016317765947923255/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/edmundtadros"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:41:25.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
