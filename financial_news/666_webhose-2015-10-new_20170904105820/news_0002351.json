But if Macquarie is right, equity investors will return to the sector and the window will re-open at some time in the next few years. When it does, Quadrant will be a contender. It's already a talking point in some parts of the market.\nMacquarie's no stranger to such deals and now Quadrant is on the bank's balance sheet, there is sure to be some significant brainpower mapping out its future.\nAs Street Talk reported on Monday, Quadrant is in talks to acquire a bunch of Western Australian assets from joint venture partner Santos, with a deal slated for later this month.\nQuadrant and Santos' jointly held WA assets include the Reindeer offshore gas field and the Devil Creek onshore gas processing plant, as well as the offshore Stag oil platform and the John Brookes and Spar gas and condensates ventures.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:06:00.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
