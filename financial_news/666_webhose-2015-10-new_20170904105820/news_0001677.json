I have encouraged both of them to put as much away as they could at this age as life gets in the way with mortgage payments and young families, etc. I am not sure what the minimum retirement age will be for them with laws changing as they do, but assuming it is at age 55, they have 30 plus years to invest. From April the lifetime allowance falls to £1m. What do you think a sensible cap would be for their pension contributions? RE, via email Telegraph Money has frequently argued that the pension lifetime allowance punishes those who save early and have the most investment success. This applies to your two sons, who have done very well to put so much money away for retirement already. They should now benefit from investment growth on their pots for many years, but as you say they need to be careful not to be caught by the lifetime allowance. From next April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) the maximum amount savers can put into their pension pots over their lifetime will be reduced from £1.25m to £1m. In 2011/12 the limit was much more generous, standing at £1.8m. This applies to an individual’s entire pension savings (apart from the state pension). Savers will pay tax on any excess savings above the lifetime allowance limit. The rate of tax depends on how savers receive the excess. If it is in the form of a lump sum, then the rate of tax is an eye-watering 55pc. If it is in the form of a regular pension, the excess is taxed at 25pc. Reaching £1m may seem like a pipe dream to many, but calculations by Telegraph Money in April found some 460,000 people could be affected . Your two sons, due to the amount they have already saved and how far they are away from retirement, could breach the allowance without putting another penny into the pot. But, as the table below shows, for this to happen investment returns will need average 8pc a year over the next 34 years. These level of returns are fairly optimistic. Data from the authoritative Barclays Equity Gilt Study, which analyses at how British shares have performed over the past 115 years, suggests returns of 5pc a year are more realistic. • Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of our investment ideas • Explained in one minute: how to boost your tax-free pension cash • Nine ways of improving your chances of retiring early Investment returns How £80,000 pension pot will grow over 34 years 5pc £420,268 6pc £580,082 7pc £798,249 8pc £1,095,211 9pc £1,498,273 • Calculator: How your money might grow after a lump sum investment \nPhilippa Gee, a financial adviser, suggested when the pots hit £200,000 it is time to consider capping pension contributions. “The basic numbers are that if you had £223,500 and achieved a return of 5pc a year after charges, if you had £407,000 and achieved a rate of return of 3pc a year, or if you had £123,000 and achieved 7pc, you would hit the £1 million cap,” Ms Gee said. “I would suggest you also look at the use of Isa allowances, as these would provide tax efficient retirement income and a value which is not, at this point, capped.” Patrick Connolly of Chase de Vere, an advisory firm, agreed that it is worth looking at saving in Isas alongside pensions, if they’re not already doing so. But Mr Connolly thinks it would be hasty to cut pension contributions at this stage. \"The difficulty with making decisions such as this now is that we can’t even be sure what the pension rules will look like next year, let alone in more than 30 years time,\" Mr Connolly said. “Pension regulations change far too frequently and there is even another government consultation taking place now to see if pensions should be changed yet again. “But I would also be surprised if the Lifetime Allowance still existed in 34 years time. So, on that basis, I wouldn’t stop your sons from making pension contributions.” Work out how much income you may receive from your personal pensions with our handy retirement calculator .
