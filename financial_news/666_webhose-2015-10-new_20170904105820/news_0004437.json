My body certainly isn't what it used to be when I was younger and I have a few sport-related injuries, so cycling is a low impact way of getting a great workout without overly taxing my dodgy knees and ankles.\nI love the freedom of being on a bike. You can virtually go anywhere on a bike and take in the scenery while you're at it.\nHow many bikes and how do you know when you have too many?\nAccording to my wife – too many! I have two bikes: a Trek commuter bike and an Eddy Merckx road bike.\n How much did they cost?\nI have invested less than $3000 in my bikes. My cycling philosophy is all about improvements in my own performance rather than my machine.\nKind of riding\nOn average, I commute to work two days a week and ride for leisure two or three days. My early Saturday morning ride has always been, and will remain, a staple. I ride with a small cycling club - the Malvern Hill Cycle Club. We have two devout members who share the same philosophy about cycling. We ride for fitness and the pure fun of cycling, and importantly we agree that riding bikes makes us feel 12 years old again. Our club may be small in numbers but not ambition – our aim is to make our club a global force in cycling – it may take a while.\nDo you stop at a stop sign if there is no one around?\nI am a law-abiding citizen. I always stop.\nTips to become a better rider\nNothing beats time on the bike, and don't avoid the hills.\nKilometres a week\nI average around 150 kilometres a week. Slightly more when I have a big ride coming up.\nMost like to go on a long ride with\nThere are lots of options on my wish list. Tour legend Eddy Merckx would be my top choice, a few hours on a bike with Tony Abbott, and my wife because she is great company. I'd have to say no one beats my cycling buddy Marty because he knows when to talk and when to stay quiet.\nFavourite refuel station\nStranded Deli Café on The Strand at Croydon. It's close to home and a good way to end a ride.\nFavourite piece of cycling gear\nMy helmet – you need to protect your head.\nFavourite ride\nI enjoy all rides. Being outside is a bonus but if I had to choose, I would say the ride down to Waterfall (in southern Sydney) and back is always a good challenge. Parts of it are tough, but I always find it satisfying when completed.\nCrashes? Catastrophes?\nProbably falling off my bike and knocking over pedestrians on George Street, Sydney, one Friday afternoon. When I stopped at the lights I failed to disengage from my pedals and toppled over into the crowd of pedestrians waiting to cross the road. I was on the ground and pedestrians were scattered all over George Street like dominoes. No one was injured but I did feel like a goose.\nIf you could improve one thing about the world of cycling what would it be?\nAnything that makes cycling more accessible to people would work for me – be that new cycle paths, better events, or more city or national initiatives aimed at getting people on bikes. There really is no downside. It's a healthy low-impact pastime for all ages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:09:49.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
