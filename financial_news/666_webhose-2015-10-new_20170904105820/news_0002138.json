( NASDAQ : ASTI ), a provider of lightweight, flexible photovoltaic (PV) solutions, announced today that the Company's newest rugged fully-integrated photovoltaic power solution, the MilPak™ E, has met the grueling conditions required under MIL-STD-810G testing and has been selected as a finalist for the upcoming R&D 100 Awards in two product categories, including the exciting new \"Market Disruptor\" category. \nIn addition, the MilPak™ E has also been selected to present to the U.S. Military, Corporate, and Investment Leadership at the Defense Energy Innovation Summit and Showcase on December 1-3, 2015 in Austin, Texas. \nThe MilPak™ E is a fully integrated mobile power solution that includes a foldable photovoltaic blanket with an attached waterproof battery case that houses a maximum peak power tracker, 86.5 watt hours of power storage with battery management circuitry, a 55 watt 24 volt power circuit, and two high-current USB circuits. \nIn keeping with the ruggedized requirements, all switchgear, protection circuit, and the 24V and USB connectors are all rated IP-67 or better, and the case is constructed from a military-grade plastic. Most important, the entire unit weighs in at less than 8.5 pounds (3.8 kg) which makes it extremely portable by military or other users. \nThis product is the first to introduce the MilPak™ platform to the military, first responders, disaster relief workers and other users who want to reduce the number of components they required to take in the field and take advantage of solar power. \n\"We are pleased that the MilPak™ E has passed the criteria for MIL-STD-810G testing which includes, but not limited to, dropping onto concrete, blowing rain, temperate extremes and random vibration,\" stated Dr. Joseph Armstrong, Chief Technology Officer and a co-inventor. \"As a platform, the MilPak™ will provide the power necessary for many applications; both those currently in the user's possession, or even permanently integrated into the unit itself, including applications which will be able to run outdoors continuously.\" \n\"We are extremely excited that the MilPak™ E has been selected by R&D 100 Magazine as a finalist for the prestigious award in the \"Market Disruptor\" category,\" said Victor Lee, President and CEO of Ascent Solar. \"Additionally, we are also equally excited with the opportunity to showcase the MilPak™ E at the Defense Energy Innovation Summit and Showcase. This represents a significant milestone for Ascent in our pivot away from the commoditized traditional rooftop market to focus on the military and other high-value markets.\" \nThe MilPak™ E is in the application process to be listed on the General Services Administration (GSA), a prerequisite channel through which to offer the product to the various units of the US armed forces. The Company will also progressively integrate this \"Market Disruptor\" technology into the Company's EnerPlex brand, making the product available to consumers worldwide. \nABOUT ASCENT SOLAR TECHNOLOGIES, INC. \nAscent Solar Technologies, Inc. is a developer of thin-film photovoltaic modules using flexible substrate materials that can transform the way solar power generation integrates into everyday life, on this planet and others as well.
