View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151019005175/en/ Bala Ramaiah, CEO of ISSQUARED Inc (Photo: Business Wire) ISSQUARED grew 365% in 2014, doubled the number of employees, added a strong leadership team , and is looking to dominate their niche by leveraging their recently announced partnerships with industry leaders in Identity and Access Management: Lieberman , ObserveIT , Okta (the leader in Gartner’s 2015 IDaaS Magic Quadrant ), as well as enterprise infrastructure services/software companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and VMWare (NYSE:VMW). Brian Irvin, Head of IT at long-time customer Oltman’s Construction Cos., a general building contractor, said, “ISSQUARED were far and away the easiest to work with, and the complete package to take advantage of Microsoft’s Hyper-V to virtually deploy applications in the cloud.” ISSQUARED CEO Bala Ramaiah said, “ISSQUARED is thrilled to be partnering with the leaders in Information Security to customize implementations for Enterprise and Mid-Sized Businesses looking to securely share information and application access.” Ramaiah reminisced how earlier in his career, when working as a Principal Enterprise Architect at well-regarded companies such as Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Cable & Wireless (LON:CWC), and Exodus Communications, he relied on vendors to implement the company’s Infrastructure and Security Roadmap in a timely manner. Ramaiah founded ISSQUARED in 2010 with the belief that IT Services could be much more reliable for enterprise clients if they could find innovative, time-efficient vendors who could anticipate challenges in the areas of ITIL Processes, Infrastructure, Network Security, and Identity Management, before they became issues. The company was named as IS 2 to communicate how a client could –multiply– its Information Systems resources by working with ISSQUARED. In 2013, Indian-born Ramaiah added Security Monitoring Services out of their Hyderabad-based office. In 2014, a U.K. office was opened to serve European clients to architect services to deploy virtual desktop infrastructure and enable enterprise mobility. About ISSQUARED ISSQUARED (IS 2 ) is a privately held company headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, with their global service delivery center in Hyderabad, India, and European office in the U.K. It specializes in Identity and Access Management Information Systems for clients in the pharmaceutical, construction, retail, and government sectors.
