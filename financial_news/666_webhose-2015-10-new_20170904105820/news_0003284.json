In a bearish note entitled “The sack race”, the broker downgraded the investment bank to “hold”, snapping the stock’s 26pc gains recorded over the previous eight trading sessions. \nInvestec said the “surge” in the share price was driven by “market enthusiasm” around reports the bank is planning to cut around 1,000 top staff . \nIan Gordon, of Investec, cautioned: “Despite a raft of recent downgrades, consensus revenue/earnings forecasts remain far too high, in our view.” Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) fell 2.3pc to 768.6p. \nMining stocks tumbled back into the red after Switzerland-based Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) announced plans to sell its Cobar copper mine in Australia and its Lomas Bayas mine in Chile. The miner and trading group slid 1.3pc to 127.5p. Meanwhile, Anglo American was off by 0.7pc, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) was 0.6pc lower and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) fell 0.4pc. \nFTSE 100 engineer Rolls Royce (LSE: RR.L - news ) became the biggest casualty of the morning, down 4.4pc amid reports EU regulators are investigating whether airlines are being forced to enter anti-competitive contracts. \nElsewhere, British Airways owner IAG was flying high after Goldman Sachs began covering the stock again, with a “buy” rating following its acquisition of Aer Lingus. \nThe investment bank reckons the airline’s current valuation does not reflect its higher return and growth prospects. Shares jumped 1.1pc to 568p. \nEuropean bourses also found themselves in the red this morning, with the exception of the German DAX up 0.2pc - as utility stocks propped up the index. The CAC fell 0.6pc, the IBEX was 0.2pc lower. * Asian markets rally as China says stock market correction 'almost over'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:22:35.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
