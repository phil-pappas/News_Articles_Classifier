Peter Braig by Jonathan Shapiro James Eyers They might be the pillars of the economy, but a bit of bank bashing has become a rite of passage for every new federal Treasurer.\nAnd so it proved this week for Scott Morrison, who is just four weeks into his new job.\nAfter announcing a $3.5 billion capital raising on Wednesday, Westpac Banking Corp shocked the market by also jacking up mortgage rates by 20 basis points to compensate its shareholders for the higher costs of the equity now required by the banking regulator.\nMorrison's response was swift, and went to the heart of the debate that is raging from this capital push initiated by last year's financial system inquiry: should bank customers or shareholders bear the brunt of the costs for gold-plating the banking system to ensure it has the wherewithal to survive another crisis?\nThe 20 basis point response was \"in excess of what I am advised would be sufficient to meet the new requirements set out by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority and the recent similar capital raisings of their banking competitors,\" Morrison declared. A day later, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten concurred, describing Westpac's move as \"corporate greed\".\nThe Treasurer cited figures from APRA showing its increase in the average \"risk weighting\" applied by banks on mortgages from 16 to 25 per cent would raise the cost of funding by around 10 to 15 basis points.\nWestpac's rate rise – which most analysts believe will ultimately be copied by the other banks – makes it clear that customers are taking a big share of the capital pain.\nIndeed, Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer made it clear on Wednesday that the bank will still look to increase its dividend and will stick to the overall return on equity (ROE) target of 15 per cent.\n But in a world of safer banks – which should reduce the cost of capital – is a 15 per cent ROE still a reasonable goal, given it involves whacking customers with an out-of-cycle rate rise?\nNot all the banks have a formal ROE target. ANZ Banking Group did aspire to an ROE of 16 per cent but new chief executive Shayne Elliott has suggested this will be reviewed at the bank's full year results later this month. National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia have shied away from formal ROE targets.\nReasonable return For Westpac, the 20 basis point increase in rates is considered reasonable because it produces a return on its new regulatory capital of much less than what is targeted by the bank as a whole.\nTo determine this return, it is necessary to look at how much additional earnings will be made by Westpac from the increase in rates. According to the latest APRA figures, Westpac's owner-occupier loans are $190 billion and its loans to investors are $150 billion, a total of $340 billion. Of this, about 78 per cent, or $265 billion, are variable mortgages to which the new rates apply. Adjusted for a corporate tax rate at 30 per cent, the earnings from the 20 basis point rise in interest rates is therefore $372 million.\nIn addition to this, Westpac will also make additional earnings from the repricing of 27 basis points previously announced for investor borrowers after APRA made its mortgage risk weight changes in July. Applying the same methodology, Westpac will earn a further $221 million from this re-pricing in the next full year.\nDividing the total new earnings of $593 million by the additional capital raised this year of $6 billion ($3.5 billion this week, plus $2.5 billion from the underwritten dividend reinvestment plan announced in May and the partial sale of a stake in BT Investment Management) delivers a return on the new equity of 10 per cent.\nThis is only two-thirds of the group's overall ROE target of 15 per cent.\nInside Westpac, there are also questions being asked about the assumptions underlying the calculation of the 10 to 15 basis point range Morrison said this week was a more accurate reflection of the true cost of the new capital.\nAssumptions understated Morrison's figures were taken from testimony from APRA chairman Wayne Byres in August to the Standing Committee on Economics Inquiry into Home Ownership. But it is understood assumptions made to produce this range may understate the true cost of new capital. For example, APRA's numbers do not take into account the capital banks have to hold against offset accounts and un-drawn mortgages. In these instances, the bank receives no interest or return on the amount the customer can redraw, but still has to carry regulatory capital against the amounts.\nFurthermore, Westpac had the most work to do raising its risk weighted assets to meet APRA's new requirements because its RWA levels were at the lowest levels among the big banks. Therefore, the cost to Westpac of meeting the new requirements would be at the highest end of any average range.\nThat aside, the larger debate as to what is an appropriate profit for a bank to earn has ignited again.\nByres has openly raised the issue of whether Australian bank ROEs are too high in a recent speech, while David Murray, chairman of the financial system inquiry, believes investors would be prepared to accept lower returns from safer banks.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia also alluded to this notion in its Financial Stability Review on Friday, stating \"a subsequent fall in the major banks return on equity might be accommodated by investors if they were to adjust their required returns to account for any decline in risk arising from stronger capital positions\".\nBut Brad Carr, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, says while Australia banks are \"the envy of much the world\", they cannot take their investors for granted.\nCarr says the theory that investors will accept lower returns on safer banks overlooks the reality of investor preferences and competing investments.\n\"It seems to assume that investors can only invest in banks. But if bank equities offer lower returns and lower risk and starts to look more like debt securities, then those investors that want equity returns might just switch their investments into another industry.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:07:05.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
