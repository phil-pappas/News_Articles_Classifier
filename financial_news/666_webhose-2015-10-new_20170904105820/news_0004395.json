Dean Sewell Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey In late 2008, just after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Brendan Nelson as opposition leader, the Coalition's Senate leader and expert political tactician Nick Minchin paid him a visit to talk strategy.\nMinchin, who owned a modest home in Adelaide's eastern suburbs, had never before been to Turnbull's Point Piper digs and, as he found himself gazing wide-mouthed upon entry, his first thought was \"we've got to get him out of here\".\nIf only because Minchin could foresee the kind of class-warfare attacks that would come Turnbull's way as Labor sought to portray the bloke as a silvertail who could never hope to empathise with ordinary folk and their daily travails.\nTurnbull had, on rare occasion, given fuel to such fears.\nOne day in 2006, during his rookie political years under John Howard, Turnbull infamously turned up at Parliament and dismissed a 25 basis-point interest rate increase as being \"over-dramatised\" because it was only \"one-quarter of 1 per cent\".\nThen-shadow treasurer Wayne Swan pounced: \"Money can buy you a lot in life but it cannot buy you the common touch\". Then health minister Tony Abbott also had a dig: \"Certainly interest rate rises hurt borrowers, they hurt them big time.\"\nTurnbull was sent back out to mop up.\nBut such slip-ups were rare afterwards and soon became non-existent.\n Turnbull used his first speech as opposition leader to define himself and use his own log-cabin story to tackle head-on the perceptions about him and his money.\n\"I do not come to the position of leader of the Liberal Party from a lifetime of privilege,\" he told colleagues in September 2009.\n\"I know what it is like to be short of money. I know what it is like to live in rented flats. I know what it is like to grow up with a single parent, with no support other than a devoted and loyal father.\n\"I know Australians are doing it tough and some Australians, even in the years of greatest prosperity, will always do it tough.\"\nNone of this dampened Labor's subsequent approach.\nNot short of a quid Kevin Rudd, who, thanks to his wife, was not short of a quid himself, would refer to Turnbull as the Member for Goldman Sachs.\nThis week's assault on Turnbull's wealth by Labor was designed to do two things: Associate his personal behaviour with what it believes is the Coalition's tepid approach to corporate tax avoidance and disclosure and, secondly, to remind voters that, unlike them, the Prime Minister is filthy rich.\nThe immediate strengths Turnbull has brought to the prime ministership are knowledge, candour, pragmatism, and a refusal to use talking points, slogans or spin.\nHe tends to give honest answers and does not pretend to have a solution to everything. Earlier this week, he used common sense and empirical evidence to skewer the Greens by highlighting that party's gaping logic over asylum-seekers and children in detention.\nOn Thursday, he was brutally frank when he put Labor to the sword over its probing of his Cayman Island investments.,\n\"So really, if the [opposition] wants to go round wearing a sandwich board saying, 'Malcolm Turnbull's got a lot of money,' feel free. I think people know that.\"\nSeasoned political pollster Tony Mitchelmore, who has played key roles in many past Labor victories, was quick to point out the ALP was on a hiding to nothing . He produced his recent focus group research of swing voters in Western Sydney who generally admired Turnbull for his wealth, more so given he made it himself.\nMitchelmore, and those in Labor who were mortified after Thursday's strategic debacle, point out most middle-class voters regard themselves these days as aspirational.\nAlong with the late Neil Lawrence, Mitchelmore devised the anti-mining tax campaign for the mineral giants, and said Labor made the same mistake when it tried to sell the mining tax.\n'Who'd he rob' The Howard years and all it's largesse helped foster this mindset. Howard would often note that, traditionally, if an Australian saw a person drive by in a Rolls Royce, his instinct was to ask \"who'd he rob?\", whereas and American would ask \"how do I get one of those?\"\nIn October 2006, Michael Chaney, then-president of the Business Council of Australia, used a speech to the National Press Club to identify what he believed was an long overdue shift away from the mindset of the \"Aussie battler\".\nHe said \"an aspirational mindset\" had replaced that of the battler and politics had failed to reflect it.\nThis emerging shift should be recognised and nurtured so it becomes firmly embedded in the national psyche and a legacy of confidence and security could be handed to future generations.\n\"The aspirations of individual Australians and the inherent potential of this nation will not be unlocked if we allow the debate about our current and future opportunities and challenges to be framed around battler or negative, inward-looking ways of thinking,\" Chaney said.\n\"Instead of being focused on basic needs, Australians are increasingly more focused on how they might go about locking in the wealth and the prosperity they've worked hard for.\"\nShorten himself recently acknowledged the change in mindset, albeit clumsily, when he linked penalty rates to people having the choice of sending their kids to the local private Catholic school.\nThe Twitterati erupted in violent protest at such heresy but Shorten was right. More and more, people are prepared to work to give themselves options previously regarded off-limits.\nMitchelmore's research shows despite the change in leadership, concern about the economy and job security is high and \"many now have a path of decline for the nation in their minds\".\nThey welcome Turnbull's renewed focus on \"economic leadership\" and, says Mitchelmore, \"his first, second and third priority has to be to deliver and communicate a plan here\".\nAs Turnbull himself told his party room this week, the new government faces high expectations.\nVoters welcome his ascension to the leadership but, still bruised from the 2014 budget, remain \"decidedly wary and cynical\". They are impatient and Turnbull \"needs to perform\".\nTurnbull has his challenges but his wealth is not one of them. If anything, given the economic task ahead, it's a bonus.\nPhillip Coorey is The Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-16T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:52.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
