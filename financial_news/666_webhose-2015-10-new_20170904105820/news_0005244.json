The area adjacent to the tear had just been placed under leach and a small amount of the leach fluids flowed over the area of the tear. The Company immediately reported the incident to PROFEPA, the Mexican environmental agency, which has since inspected the area. The Company believes that the clay barrier built beneath the liner caught any fluids that flowed over the area of the tear. The Company is in the process of replacing the clay and fixing the tear and expects to shortly receive the approval of PROFEPA to resume irrigation in that area. While the Company temporarily ceased irrigation in that particular area, overall leach pad operations were not affected. The Company has provided full cooperation to PROFEPA in its review of the situation. The Company remains committed to protecting the environment and respecting the communities in which it operates. \nNeither the TSX nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX) nor the New York Stock Exchange MKT accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release. \nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements contained herein may constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities laws.
