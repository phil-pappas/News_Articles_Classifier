Also, a whopping 83% of consumers overestimated or underestimated the amount of money they would receive if they waited to become beneficiaries at their full retirement age — with 67% underestimating. \n“It is a tremendously complex government program that utilizes your highest 35 years of taxable Social Security earnings in a ridiculous formula,” said Troy Sharpe, president and co-founder of Oak Harvest Financial Group in Texas. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T07:48:05.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
