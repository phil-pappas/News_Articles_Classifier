Now the heat is on for smaller resource companies to follow suit, ahead of the trend spreading to less-exposed sectors.\nTrillions of dollars in capital will move out of some industries and into others as the world economy pivots around the need to limit global warming to 2 degrees.\nEmma Herd, IGCC chief executive \"In the coming years most companies will have to prove to investors how sustainable their exposure to climate risks are in the long term,\" Catholic Super chief executive Frank Pegan said.\nPope Francis, pictured addressing a joint meeting of US Congress in September, has called for action on climate change.

Just look at what has happened with Glencore's recent share price collapse when it needed to raise more money\".\nMr Pegan also chairs the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), a collective of Australian and New Zealand super funds, fund managers and insurance companies managing $1 trillion in assets.\nANZ Banking Group said on Tuesday it will set strict rules on lending to the coal industry to bring the bank's business into line with the growing momentum across the corporate world of reducing carbon emissions.\nThe changing nature of the climate risk modelling and reporting metrics demanded by institutional investors will be a key topic at the 2015 IGCC summit, to be held in Melbourne on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\"At this time of great disruption, whether you divest, invest or engage, it is clear that all investors need a strategy for carbon. Investors are building the tools they need to manage risk and capture new opportunities. There is no turning back,\" IGCC chief executive Emma Herd said.\nAhead of the 2015 United National Climate Change Conference, in Paris from November 30, participating countries have flagged an agreement to commit to a goal of limiting the rise in average temperature since the industrial revolution, already at 0.9 degrees to 2 degrees .\n\"After the Paris summit expect to see a huge jump in the sophistication of carbon-risk reporting,\" Ms Herd said.\n\"Trillions of dollars in capital will move out of some industries and into others as the world economy pivots around the need to limit global warming to 2 degrees\".\nBank of England governor Mark Carney last week issued a waning to investors that the majority of the world's fossil fuels could become \"stranded\", meaning resources companies are due for a big fall .\nBHP Billiton on front foot Local resource companies are already struggling with the shift.\nAGL Energy chairman Jerry Maycockâ€‹ used the company's annual general meeting last week to call for a \"coherent national plan\" to shift the country's electricity generation sector away from fossil fuels .\nAt a briefing for about 40 investors on Friday BHP Billiton revealed the results of financial stress tests it had modelled for the impact of 2 degrees, 4 degrees and 6 degrees average temperature rises on the business.\nBHP Billiton has also modelled the impact on its balance sheet of a range of different carbon prices.\nThe demerger earlier this year of BHP Billiton's most carbon intensive assets into a new entity named South 32 had also improved the resources giant's climate risk profile, AMP Capital head of ESG investment research Ian Woods said.\n\"Carving out the aluminium assets into South 32 has enabled BHP Billiton to reduce its carbon emissions by around one third, in exchange for a relatively small drop in market capitalisation\".\nAMP Capital is aiming to improve the financial modelling of the climate risks in its portfolio, which has led to increased demands for information from the companies it is invested in.\n\"We want boards to show us that they have modelled the the potential impact of temperature rises and carbon pricing on their balance sheets, and have a started thinking seriously about what they could do to minimise that impact,\" Mr Woods said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/carney-warns-investors-face-huge-risks-from-climate-change-20150930-gjxuty", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/agl-revives-call-for-government-support-to-exit-coal-generation-20150929-gjxoh3", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/josh-frydenberg-says-india-china-still-keen-on-coal-20151001-gjzki9", "http://www.afr.com/news/policy/climate/no-lifelines-for-old-coal-clunkers-anz-shifts-carbon-emissions-policy-20151005-gk1e5b?&utm_source=social&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=nc&eid=socialn:twi-14omn0047-optim-nnn:nonpaid-27062014-social_traffic-all-organicpost-nnn-drive-o&campaign_code=nocode&promote_channel=social_twitter"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:57:23.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
