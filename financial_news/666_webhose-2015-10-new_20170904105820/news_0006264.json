This may mean house sharing instead of living alone, bunking back down with the parents or even house sitting.\nWhether you rent or pay a mortgage there are ways to cut back on costs. Source: AAP\nPHONE/INTERNET\nYOU won’t find many people without a phone in the house, whether it be a mobile or landline or a connection to the internet.\nRiegelhuth says this is an ever-changing space and all telco users should take an active approach to hunting around for more competitive deals.\n“The phone companies and internet providers are making new deals all the time so I think it’s important to look at that when your current provider’s plan is up and see what else is available,’’ she says.\n“These days do you really need a home phone anymore? You may even find it’s enough to have your mobile and stream data from that at home depending on your usage.”\nIt’s also worth considering bundling your internet and mobile services — this will help cut costs.\nComparison sites such as whistleout.com.au can be useful for shopping for deals.\nSarah Riegelhuth advises an active approach to hunting around for more competitive deals.

The main change you’ll see will be in the billing paperwork,’’ she says as the new supplier will do all the hard work of switching for you.\nConsider opting into monthly, rather than quarterly, billing to spread the pain and make a conscious effort to switch appliances off at the wall; this can save you more than $100 a year.\nGROCERIES\nThe fewer trips to the supermarket you make in a week, the better.\nSo do a weekly menu plan then make a shopping list and stick to it. Stay away from the supermarket when you’re hungry; this will make you want to buy more without you even realising it.\nRiegelhuth also suggests buying items such as boxes of fruit and vegetables direct from suppliers that can be delivered to your front door.\n“Structure your shopping, for example if I buy a box of fruit and vegetables every week I just have to use what’s in it because I don’t want to throw any of it away.”\nFIND A HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT\nAbigail Koch says rounding up or guessing the value of your home and contents for insurance can often leave you out of pocket. Source: News Corp Australia\nINSURANCE\nDon’t be tempted to just sign up to the cheapest policy possible, this could hurt you when you make a claim.\nKoch says be sure to sign up to insurance that is tailored to suit you and make sure you are thorough in documenting your home and contents information.\n“Try not to over or underestimate the value of your home’s contents,’’ she says.\n“Rounding up or guessing can often leave you out of pocket whether it’s through higher than necessary monthly insurance premiums or a lower than expected payout when you make a claim.”\n Kill bills: smart ways to slash spending ", "external_links": ["http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/home-loans/refinance#itm_t=story&itm_l=kill-bills", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9b09dc6bbdc298bfdf62f117e8f2cb2a", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans/refinance#itm_t=story&itm_l=kill-bills", "http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9f94dc4eb066f984eb18f1ffe8466633", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/132d0da9b7f29ef65e058ba5cc71acb5", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/guide/high-interest-savings-accounts#itm_t=story&itm_l=kill-bills", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/258eacc24ce5860e78b6c1ff40d4038a?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://mozo.com.au/energy?utm_source=news&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=energy&mz_source=news__energyarticle", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2F4wajl0dzqA55hEtJ8-WQdLLOEzy70fRr%2Fpromo267758138&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:47:24.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
