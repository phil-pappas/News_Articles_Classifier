Photo: David Mariuz\nEmbattled oil and gas player Santos has rejected a $7.14 billion takeover approach from little-known Middle Eastern private firm Scepter Partners as it continues to pursue asset sales to relieve its $9 billion debt burden.\nSantos shares shot higher, gaining as much as 20.6 per cent to $6.56, as of 10.25am, on news of the approach, which the company described as \"opportunistic\" and failing to reflect fair value for the company's assets.\nScepter, led by former partners of private equity player Blackstone, has connections to Middle East royalty and represents over $US14 billion in assets.\nRepresenting individuals with a net worth of more than $US100 billion, the firm targets large-cap acquisitions in resources, telecommunications and media.\nAdvertisement Santos's strategic review, being overseen by executive chairman Peter Coates, is considering all options to restore shareholder value, including the sale of various package of assets, strategic M&A proposals, and potentially a capital raising.\nMr Coates said last Friday the review was making \"good progress\" and signalled the most likely asset sales were \"non-strategic\" ventures rather than Santos's stake in the prized Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas project.\nAlphinity portfolio manager Stephane Andre said the news of Scepter proposal \"shows that there is value in the stock, but it also shows that they are determined on the strategy of asset sales and that they think they can get out of [their debt problem] another way.\"\n\"They must be to some extent confident that these asset sales are progressing well,\" Mr Andre said.\nThe Santos board met to consider the \"indicative, highly conditional and non-binding\" proposal from Scepter, and decided to reject it.\n\"The proposal is considered to be opportunistic in nature and does not reflect the fair, underlying asset value,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe approach, a cash offer, represents a 26 per cent premium to Santos's close of $5.44 on Wednesday. But the stock is down from more than $12 a year ago, as the company suffered from the slump in oil prices and high debt levels. The takeover bid at $6.88 a share would be worth about $7.14 billion.\nScepter's shareholders including \"a syndicate of ruling families\", ultra wealthy industrialists and sovereign wealth funds, Santos said. It is chaired by former Glencore Xstrata chairman Sir John Bond, who would likely be known to Mr Coates, who is a non-executive director at Glencore.\nSantos received the approach from Scepter on Tuesday. A spokesman said the company was continuing to assess all options and is in dialogue with a number of interested parties, but couldn't comment further.\n\"The proposal was also subject to numerous conditions, some of which would be adverse to Santos' continued evaluation of other alternatives in its current strategic review process,\" the company said.\nMr Andre said Santos represented good value if it could fix its debt problem.\n\"Santos is cheap if they fix the balance sheet but it's a question of how they can fix it, and people are nervous until they do fix it,\" he said.\n\"The market is waiting for announcements on [asset sales] in the coming weeks.\"\nMarket sources say the most likely outcome will be the sale of Santos's assets in Western Australia and potentially elsewhere, to realise proceeds of at least $1 billion, topped up with an equity raising.\n\"It does't have to be black and white; maybe it's a combination of a few options,\" Mr Andre said.\nSantos said it \"will continue to inform shareholders of any material developments.\"\nMore to come", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/brand/chanticleer/santos-bid-rejection-puts-chairman-coates-under-pressure-20151021-gkfdgo"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:16:01.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
