Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if they want to operate, their raw materials aren't coming in,\" Pokhrel said. \n\"This is the peak time for reconstruction. But this crisis will have a long-term impact on our recovery.\" \nFor victims like Gurung, the crisis translates to more immediate worries. \n\"The earthquake has troubled us enough, this fuel crisis is only adding to our pain,\" Gurung said. \n\"I pray that our government resolves this soon and pays attention to us before winter comes (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:55:43.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
