Louie Douvis by Duncan Hughes Bigger bets are being taken to boost performance of some non-core unlisted retail property funds, despite the property sector heading into a new period of change and uncertainty, a leading fund manager has told a meeting of investment specialists.\nAdrian Harrington, head of funds management for Folkestone, a real estate funds manager and developer, also warned about growing risks to investors from \"increasingly normal\" complex deals.\nMr Harrington, whose company manages nearly $1 billion, said: \"There are a lot of big macro changes happening that are outside the control of managers\" that could influence fund performance.\nThe unlisted sector includes 28 core and 52 non-core retail sectors.\nCore funds lower risk by having less than 20 per cent in development, gearing below 50 per cent, more than 90 per cent exposure to direct property and must not capitalise interest.\nNon-core funds are unrestricted by any of those investment conditions.\nOver three and five years the performance of the two unlisted sectors has been around 14 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.\nDuring the past 12 months non-core funds have increased leverage and risk to boost performance to more than 30 per cent, compared to core's 18 per cent.\n Mr Harrington, who has been in the property industry for 24 years, said \"uncharted waters\" into which the industry is heading include below-trend growth, strong capital flows and weak demand and rental capital growth.\n\"As managers our job is to maximise the risk-adjusted returns of our investors – sometimes that means saying 'No, this is not the right time to invest,' or 'This is not the right strategy for this point of the strategy,'\" he says.\nMr Harrington also questioned whether defining, quantifying and managing risk was \"really understood\".\n\"Private real estate fund managers need more than ever to focus on how to underwrite, structure, finance and execute on their transactions whether it be acquisitions or dispositions,\" he said.\nSocial and technological changes, ranging from increased mobility to social media and cloud computing, are changing the way businesses operate and their property requirements, he said.\n\"The latest buzzword – 'through-the-cycle investing' – is not the panacea for every deal as not everyone has permanent capital.\"\nMr Harrington was speaking at the Annual Property Funds Industry Forum in Noosa.\nAustralian property funds have more than $245 billion of assets and own about 70 per cent of the nation's investment-grade property.\nThey are managed by more than 70 companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:35:50.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
