Advertising Print This Post \nGCM Prime Ltd has continued attracting top-tier talent with the appointment of Glenn Ward as its newest Director, according to information made public on his Linkedin profile. \nMr. Ward joins GCM Prime’s London office, whose appointment will be tendered with immediate effect. Prior to joining GCM, he held a number of senior positions at many financial service groups, including most recently at La Cloche Capital Markets as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Additionally, he has served at many other stops, including Amius Trading Solutions, ICM Capital, London Capital Group, and ODL Securities, among others, part of a lengthy career dating back to 1991. \nJust last week, GCM Prime added another key hire in Adam Toro , the longtime FXCM and financial services executive that joined the company as its CEO. Speaking at the time on the appointment in an exclusive statement to Finance Magnates, Mr. Toro noted: “As an industry leader, FXCM afforded me tremendous opportunities to grow and to learn all facets of the brokerage business. With GCM Prime poised to take advantage of the highly fragmented market space, the opportunity to build a team of experienced professionals was too enticing to pass up.” \nGCM Prime is a UK regulated broker that provides an end-to-end solution for brokers including white label trading platforms, back office solutions, and access to liquidity from a variety of trading venues. The group also has recently unveiled plans on targeting high frequency traders (HFT) that can integrate their aggregated liquidity streams via API – available liquidity is slated to include foreign exchange (FX), contracts-for-difference (CFDs), and metal trading.
