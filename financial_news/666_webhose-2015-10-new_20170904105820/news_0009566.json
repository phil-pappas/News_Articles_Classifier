The software is installed in about 11 million vehicles, but may not be activated in all of them.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-will-put-nonessential-projects-investments-under-review-1444129779?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:59:06.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
