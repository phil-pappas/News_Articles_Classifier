One analyst said Clinton’s call increases chances of the tax being tossed out — though not just yet.\nAdding to the pressure for repeal: a poll released Wednesday morning. Sixty percent of Americans said they oppose the tax in the latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll .\nThe tax, meant to help pay for spending in President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, is scheduled to take effect in 2018. It would impose a 40% levy on benefits of more than $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families.\nRepeal of the tax is backed by both businesses and labor unions. Terry O’Sullivan, president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, said the group is encouraged that all the Democrats running for president and bipartisan members of Congress are working to repeal the tax .\nHealth-care analyst Spencer Perlman of Height Securities said Clinton’s move “modestly pushes the needle toward eventual repeal.” He said Clinton’s statement gives extra cover to Democrats to oppose the tax, though he noted many already did. And he stressed the tax would stick around for some time.\n“It’s very unlikely [repeal] would happen while Obama is in office,” Perlman said in an interview. The White House is opposed to scrapping the tax.\nThe Cadillac tax is a rare area of Obamacare on which Republicans and Democrats agree. Republicans are opposed to the law in general.\nOn Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee advanced a bill that would repeal the Cadillac tax as well as other major Obamacare provisions . “We’re going to pass a bill that can dismantle Obamacare and reach the president’s desk,” said Rep. Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the panel.\nThat bill is a “nonstarter” since Obama would veto it, Perlman said. Yet Cadillac tax repeal could be included in another package, he said.\nRepealing the tax would deprive the government of about $91 billion in revenue over a decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. Clinton said she is encouraging Congress to fully pay for the cost of repealing the tax.\nSTATEMENT: Hillary Clinton for repeal of the Cadillac Tax. pic.twitter.com/KbKIMgkfie\n— Jesse Ferguson (@JesseFFerguson) September 29, 2015 More from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://t.co/KbKIMgkfie", "http://www.liuna.org/news/story/secretary-clinton-announces-support-for-repeal-of-cadillac-tax", "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/255292-panel-advances-fast-track-obamacare-repeal-bill", "http://kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-september-2015/", "https://twitter.com/JesseFFerguson/status/648965939782942720"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:21:01.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
