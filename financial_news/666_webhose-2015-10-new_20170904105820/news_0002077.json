James Brickwood by Jemima Whyte It barely takes five minutes and we're talking about Diane Smith-Gander's family.\nAnd her farm in Margaret River, with vineyards (shiraz, cabernet chardonnay and petit verdot,) a yabby-filled dam and some kangaroos. And the fact they – Smith-Gander, her younger brother Craig and his wife Fiona – are building a house.\nFor a woman with a fierce reputation, Smith-Gander – who arrived early to get the portrait shots out of the way and is sitting comfortably with the photographer in the middle of Sydney's three-hatted Bridge Room on a busy Friday when I arrive – it's an unexpectedly open start.\nIt couldn't have been spelled out more clearly – she's not on the defensive.\nTransfield has responded to activists' claims transparently and accurately, Smith-Gander says. James Brickwood After the past few months, Smith-Gander, of the under-siege Transfield Services and outspoken president of women's lobby group Chief Executive Women (CEW), might be expected to be guarded.\nHuman rights activists, vicars and even superannuation funds have made the listed company their target, doing their best to paint the company she heads as embodying the worst of Australia's refugee detention centre policy.\nThe week before we meet, Smith-Gander, with experience as a director of the NBN Co, Wesfarmers, WA Tourism and more under her belt, missed out on the plum Tourism Australia chairman gig – a fact that some attribute to the \"Transfield taint\", though she doesn't see it like that.\nShe's fast developing a reputation for being in the headlines, not always for the best reasons, and there's some muttering in boardrooms about whether the divorced 57-year-old is too strident, and potentially counterproductive, in how she is pushing CEW's agenda to get more women in business.\nAdvice from a guide at the great Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru taught Smith-Gander why waiting can work. But right now, that's not the focus.\nInstead, we're discussing whether or not to have wine for lunch (absolutely, a glass – Lark Hill pinot noir for Smith-Gander, Helm riesling for the AFR Weekend ), and the vineyard.\nLife lessons in Kalgoorlie And from there, it's straight onto her family. Craig, the sporty \"golden child\" and long-time member of North Cottesloe Surf Lifesaving Club. Her father John (\"that's where I get my calves from\") was a professional sprinter, and then a boundary umpire to help supplement his income. Her mother Betty is still driving around Perth at 85.\nIn response to a question about whether her mother worked, Smith-Gander, who looks much softer in person than her photographs, is expansive, recalling a formative move to Kalgoorlie at age 11 during the 1960s nickel boom.\nThe West Australian mining town was where Smith-Gander met her first power-suited \"businesswoman\" Geraldine Ardagh, who sized up her stay-at-home, ex-typist mother at a barbecue as someone worth hiring, and had her back teaching typing within the week.\nExplaining the family's move to Kalgoorlie, Smith-Gander reveals that the family lived in a caravan for six weeks before buying a house in the last street in town \"with a lovely view of the slag heap\" and a hole in her bedroom wall that \"we could have driven a motorbike through\". But for a child who had watched her parents make their own bricks to build their own house in Perth's Alfred Cove, that wasn't the striking thing. It was the Indigenous women with their babies coming to the back fence to ask for water, that parts of the neighbourhood were disapproving when her parents rigged up a watering system, and that the Indigenous children she went to school with didn't take their netball uniforms (made by her mother) home because their siblings would wear them.\nThe Transfield reputation Throughout the lunch, in response to questions about Transfield, politics and gender diversity, Smith-Gander keeps referring to her childhood.\n\"Think about the world I came from. Every time they [my parents] looked at something and they saw the gaps, the first thing they wanted to do is fill the gaps and improve them. Naturally, I am like that,\" she says later.\nBut at this point we still haven't picked up the menu, and with decisions made quickly, it's time to ask about Transfield and its government contract to provide garrison and welfare services to the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. In August, Transfield said it was preferred tenderer for another five years.\nIs she surprised by how the management of the refugee processing centres has played out for the company? Did she consider the reputational risk to the company and to herself when she took on the role?\nHer answers are clear, and it's obvious she's been asked variations of this many, many times. The company needed to diversify earnings away from resources and mining, it needed to deliver reliable earnings to the market, it had experience in dealing with vulnerable people and managing government contracts. It assessed geographical risk, as it always does. Smith-Gander was appointed chairman in September 2013, succeeding Tony Shepherd under whose chairmanship Transfield was awarded the first Manus Island and Nauru contract in 2012.\nNo, she says, she wasn't surprised about how things have panned out, because she didn't have a clear map of how it might all go. But yes, she admits, the awareness of refugees' conditions has been greater, and quite possibly, even the UN Human Rights commissioner would be surprised by how much it's now on the global agenda. And – considered rationally, she asks – is it any different to emotive issues like outsourcing water, or electricity?\nIt's hard to get Smith-Gander to consider Transfield's role from any other angle than her position as chairman (to be clear – Smith-Gander may have no issue about kissing fellow directors in greeting but she never wants to be known as the chairwoman).\nAbiding emotion is pride Just as we're getting into it, the waiter arrives to take our orders. Starters, and then snapper for both of us. A few more questions, and she admits it is \"incredibly powerful\" visiting Nauru and Manus Island.\n\"The test for me is how do I come back and do what I have to do so the abiding emotion is [still] pride,\" she says.\n\"If I got to the point where I couldn't have pride in the system, that's the time when I know we're in a deep dilemma of how we get back towards that.\"\nThe pride she says she feels when she leaves the detention centres is in a job well done. That the company which she chairs is doing the best possible work. An example? Her focus on mould. On one of Smith-Gander's earlier visits to the islands, she says she noticed mould throughout the centres (intensely practical, she mentions she battled with mould while living in Hong Kong and working as a consultant and says it's an inevitable in an equatorial region). And so, she used the issue as – in her words – a proxy.\n\"Is the tone we are setting from the top getting through? I need to know not that it's on the work order but being approached in the right way, with the right attitude.\"Pressing a bit more – surely there are moments where doubt creeps in about whether the company is doing the best possible job, and whether it could be doing it better, faster – and Smith-Gander again makes the point her focus is on making sure the company is prioritising the right issues.\nActivists held to account \"I absolutely believe that frustration is an absolute waste of energy,\" she says.\nSmith-Gander's sense of pride in Transfield's role on the islands was first reported in The Weekend AFR on October 3, and this week, she said it prompted a surprising bout of sexist comments from people on Twitter, who commented on her hair and what she was wearing. She added that the response form the business community had been positive and constructive.\nLater, Smith-Gander does admit to a wobbly personal moment – when she found herself in the United States, working for McKinsey & Co, with no work, a growing realisation that her partner (who she later divorced, with a messy public court battle) was not the support she had hoped he would be, living in transitional accommodation she couldn't afford. It's almost a relief to hear the \"just get on with it attitude\" does have its limits.\nSmith-Gander says the activist attack on Transfield is flawed, and says the reason she's taking a far greater profile than is usual for a chairman is because of the implications for business. She wants the activists held to account.\n\"I can respect the activist attempt to change government policy,\" she says, adding she is an activist herself in Indigenous and gender issues. \"But there's no connection between what I do [as Transfield chairman] and government policy.\"\nShe says Transfield has responded to claims transparently and accurately, though she's realistic enough to admit that there's no point trying to weigh into the debate on refugees.\n\"If I was to step into the arena of trying to influence government policy I would be seen as flying the flag of self-interest.\"\nA second thorny topic Entrees arrive – prettily presented crab and raw kingfish with shaved watermelon – and now the first thorny topic has been broached, it's time for another.\nDid she go overboard in her speech at Kirribilli House earlier this year to mark 30 years of Chief Executive Women, when she told Tony Abbott more must be done?\n\"Someone who is prime minister of the nation is not going to be a shrinking violet, and being too soft and not giving clarity is not respectful of that person or that office,\" she says, ignoring the spanner crab starter. \"So I absolutely do not think that I overdid that speech.\"\nIs her gung-ho style a problem?\n\"Isn't diversity of style a basic human right? I'm quoting [non executive director] Helen Lynch on that.\" Lynch is one of Smith-Gander's mentors, who she credits with teaching her how to disagree with people. Another is Andrea Mason, an Indigenous leader who urges compassion comes with pragmatism and practicality.\nSmith-Gander has said it before, and again she says her style has moderated but it's mainly due to maturity.\nA sunburst epiphany She's also adamant that style shouldn't be moulded because of gender stereotypes, noting later that she's been in situations where she's disagreed with another female director and had her comments met with a raised eyebrow.\n\"Almost as if my gender somehow is supposed to trump my logic. And clearly that's never going to happen,\" she says.\nThroughout the lunch, there's just one question that Smith-Gander won't answer. Which board seat would she like next? \"No, we're not going there,\" she says, as we both finish off snapper cooked with lots of butter, though she says she clearly has space for another directorship.\n\"I do think there is an emerging tendency for Australian politicians to regard board appointments as political appointments. I think most Australians would regard that as a public service,\" she says, before adding that she doesn't want to go into politics, though she's occasionally asked about it.\nShe'd like Australia to be a republic, and then the conversation turns to Utah – where she owns a house – Mormons, her US retail therapy (at The Container Store retail chain), her dog Pearl, and her new-ish membership of a Perth 24/7 gym (she's been in the middle of the night).\nAlso, advice from surprising places.\nShe has learned to wait – have a \"Sun Gate moment\" – after her guide urged her to do so on a drizzly Machu Picchu​ day, as hordes of trekkers headed for shelter. They waited. Half an hour later, the sun came out.\nThe Bridge Room\n44 Bridge St\nSydney\n1 wild-caught raw fish, preserved watermelon peel, $34.00\n1 Fraser Island spanner crab, picked and shelled, new season asparagus, $34.00\n2 wild-caught snapper, burnt celeriac, ceriac softened in butter, $96\n1 baby gem lettuce hearts, salad cream, fragrant herbs, lettuce, $11\n1 black Russian tomatoes, sesame dressing, chia seeds, no charge\n1 glass riesling, $17\n1 glass pinot noir, $19\nTotal, including card surcharge: $214.17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:44.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
