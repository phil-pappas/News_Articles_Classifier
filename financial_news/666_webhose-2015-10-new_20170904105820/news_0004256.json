The Hanlon Managed Income Fund (HANAX, HANCX, HANIX, HANRX) seeks to provide current income, capital preservation and positive risk adjusted returns, while the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund (HTDAX, HTDCX, HTDIX, HTDRX) seeks to provide capital appreciation and current income.\n“Over the past decade and a half, we’ve had great success working with advisors on similar investing strategies in individual managed account and UMA structures”, said Sean Hanlon, CEO of Hanlon Investment Management. “Based on demand from advisors and their financial institutions, we are pleased to now offer access to this investment approach in a portable, mutual fund vehicle that will be available on all of the industry’s leading fund platforms.”\nHanlon’s philosophy on investment management is to aid clients in achieving long-term goals by providing tactical investment strategies to take advantage of market movements and changes in the investment climate. By exiting the market when Hanlon’s proprietary science indicates market weakness, Hanlon clients can avoid large drawdowns in their assets, while at the same time being able to enjoy the benefits of market appreciation by moving back into the markets during periods of market strength.\n“In today’s more volatile market environment, advisors and their clients need more sophisticated investment strategies to meet their financial goals and objectives.” Hanlon said. “Our tactical overlay approach combined with the academic and private sector research on the benefits of dividends and momentum as notable factors in generating alpha over the long term are part of that approach and our new mutual fund products will provide the industry with broader access to these strategies. We are particularly excited about the Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund. This Fund is unique in providing sector selection analysis and investments in S&P 500 constituent companies utilizing dividend yield and price momentum equally weighted. The fund may hold 10 stocks in each sector or none if that sector does not look appealing. The Fund is managed to track the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Index calculated and published daily by Solactive AG.”\nTo learn more about the Hanlon Managed Income Fund and the Hanlon Tactical Dividend and Momentum Fund, please logon to http://www.HanlonFunds.com for their relevant fact sheets.
