REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files \nBEIJING (Reuters) - Google will take a minority stake in Beijing-based artificial intelligence firm Mobvoi as part of a $75 million fundraising round, the start-up said on Tuesday, as the U.S. search giant tries to rebuild its presence in China.\nMobvoi will maintain a controlling stake, it said in an e-mailed statement. The size of Google's investment was not disclosed. Google's parent company is now named Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).\nThe Chinese start-up works on artificial intelligence (AI) voice-controlled software, like that used in Google's Android products for mobile search. Mobvoi previously partnered with the U.S. firm to provide Chinese-language voice search for the latter's Android Wear smartwatch operating system. \n\n(Reporting by Paul Carsten; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\nSingapore International News Google artificial intelligence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:43:57.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
