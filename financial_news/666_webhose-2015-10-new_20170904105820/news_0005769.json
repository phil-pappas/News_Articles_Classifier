Rakesh Sharma, CEO of Ultra Electronics stated, “We are delighted to support the development of NuScale’s innovative SMR technology and look forward to developing this relationship.” \nUltra Electronics will work closely with Rock Creek Innovations, a long standing NuScale strategic partner, on the development and deployment of the reactor protection system and other safety-related I&C systems for the NuScale SMR. \n“I am pleased with the addition of Ultra Electronics to our expanding team of partners,” said John Hopkins, NuScale’s Chief Executive Officer. “Ultra Electronics’ knowledge and experience in the area of I&C systems will be a powerful asset to NuScale’s SMR design and deployment.” \nNuScale Power recently hosted over 230 attendees, including representatives from Ultra, at its NuScale Exposition (also known as NuEx) in Corvallis, Oregon. A notable list of speakers emphasized the important environmental and economic benefits of NuScale’s baseload, carbon-free SMR technology. NuEx attendees were also provided with a rare look into NuScale’s test facilities. \nAbout NuScale \nNuScale Power, LLC is developing a new kind of nuclear plant; a safer, smaller, scalable version of pressurized water reactor technology, designed with natural safety features. Fluor Corporation ( FLR ), a global engineering, procurement, and construction company with a 60-year history in commercial nuclear power, is the majority investor in NuScale. As the sole winner of the second round of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) competitively-bid, cost-sharing program to develop nuclear small modular reactor (SMR) technology, NuScale's design offers the benefits of carbon-free nuclear power but takes away the issues presented by the cost of installing large capacity. A nuclear power plant using NuScale's technology is comprised of individual NuScale Power Modules™, each producing 50 megawatts of electricity (gross) with its own factory-built combined containment vessel and reactor vessel, and its own packaged turbine-generator set. A power plant can include as many as 12 NuScale Power Modules to produce as much as 600 MWe, gross (570 net, nominal, after house loads). The reactor coolant is driven by natural circulation and can be shut down safely with no operator action, no AC or DC power, and no external water supply. NuScale power plants are scalable - additional modules are added as customer demand for electricity increases. NuScale's technology also is ideally suited to supply energy for district heating, desalination, and other applications. NuScale is headquartered in Portland, Oregon and has offices in Corvallis, OR; Rockville, MD; and Charlotte, NC.
