Greg Newington by Jeremy Cooper The Australian super system is unusual in having a mandated retirement savings regime with an unstructured pension or retirement phase. The default MySuper accumulation product is not permitted to offer a pension. This means that there is effectively a \"cliff edge\" at retirement where retirees are left to make a range of complex financial decisions, typically without any professional assistance. The purpose of super is, oddly enough, not sufficiently clear. The current legislation says that it is about providing \"retirement benefits\". This could mean almost anything once you retire.\nTuesday's announcement that the government has substantially adopted the recommendations of the financial system inquiry will address these problems. FSI chair, David Murray, said that super should be primarily about providing income in retirement to supplement or replace the age pension. He was right.\nThis will be great news for the 700 or so Australians who retire every day. Once the changes come into effect, all large APRA-regulated super funds should be offering a comprehensive income product for retirement. CIPRs are intended to manage retirees' need for regular income, growth and protection from the financial risks they face: inflation, outliving their savings, market gyrations and cognitive decline. These risks are currently largely left to retirees to manage on their own.\nIt is understood that CIPRs are likely to use a combination of products, starting with the account-based pension and incorporating lifetime annuities and other pooled longevity risk management products.\nUnderspending Retirees have been underspending in retirement because they are uncertain how long they will live. A recent study found that they even become \"net savers\" once they hit their early 80s. CIPRs should enable retirees to enjoy a higher standard of living if they can safely spend their money to the end of their lives. Reading between the lines of the response, the government's message is very clear: super is not for the kids' inheritance.\nThe CIPR concept is cleverly framed as a \"soft default\" where funds will \"pre-select\" a retirement income solution that \"nudges\" retirees in the right general direction, but doesn't force them into a product. The hallmark of our system is about choice for everyone who wants to make one. There is no silver bullet solution for providing retirement income.\nOne of the key tools available to meet longevity-related risks is through longevity-risk pooling. The core concept involves the idiosyncratic risk of a person living longer than average being diversified away in a large enough pool of lives. This can take the form of insurance, where both this risk, and the systematic risk of all pool members living longer, is fully absorbed by a life insurance company. An alternative model spreads the idiosyncratic risk between the members of the pool, but it is not protected by third-party capital and still faces the systematic risk that would result in lower and lower distributions of income if it eventuated.\n How might CIPRs help a typical retiree? At the moment let's say a single woman, Jill, retires at 65 on a full age pension and is trying to work out how long her retirement savings will last. Although, on average, Jill should live to age 89, about two-thirds of women her age will live until somewhere between 81 and 97. In fact, Jill only has a 5 per cent chance that she will die at age 89 even though that's the current average. With these odds, neither she nor her adviser can work out what she can safely spend in retirement. Having some of her savings in a retirement product that pays her income for life will address this problem.\nSince 2010, more Australians over the age of 100 have died each year than those in the first year of life. We need these new financial products to help our retirees last the distance. The introduction of the CIPR regime will nudge more of them into existence. CIPRs will be as close to a MyPension as it gets.\nJeremy Cooper is Chairman of Retirement Income at Challenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:06:21.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
