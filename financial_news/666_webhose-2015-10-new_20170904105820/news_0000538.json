Last week brought a rare sense of relief to see the parliament, especially the House of Representatives return to its nominal call of considering motions and bills. However, to say that they are starting on a wrong footing is to in deed understate the obvious. No sensible Nigerian expected that the lower legislative House would begin its work in the 8th Assembly with another comical orchestration of probes, particularly at a time when the nation's pressing problems require urgent and creative supporting action from the law makers. In the past five years, the National Assembly spent more than 70% of their quality time entertaining Nigerians with fruitless wrong-headed probe hearings decked in all the accouterments of Nollywood melodramas. Did they hit or miss with this endeavour? Of course it was a huge success on the sphere of drama; what with all the farce, humour, intrigues and fascinating revelations. But it was a disastrous flop in terms of the benefit that has accrued to the nation therefrom. Again, we are back on that familiar turf, and I dare say that the House of Representatives is free to probe anything, as the task falls within their oversight schedule, as guaranteed in the constitution. But beginning their work with the probe of the recent successful privatisation of the power sector is indeed preposterous and worrisome. In fact, this is one proposition that is tantamount to picking the wrong target and making disastrous mistakes. I may not know all the details about how the privatisation of the power assets was carried out by the previous administration, but I dare say that this was one policy that cast the Jonathan Government in bright light. At the end of the exercise, it became quite clear that it was a bold, positive and novel initiative that elicited commendation from both the local and global business community, because of the transparency and standardization of the bidding process. Pundits in the sector then held the opinion that the exercise was so evenhanded that even the international companies that participated in the bidding including, those that didn't win, found it quite appealing. I recall then that many of the top global development agencies cited the Nigerian power privatisation as a success story and a model for other African countries. South Africa, for instance, was said to have indicated interest in copying this same power sector privatisation model for the transformation of its energy sector. If all these commendations and endorsements point to anything, it is that the power sector privatization, pioneered by the Jonathan administration, is a sustainable and bankable project, which is already yielding divided under the Buhari Government with improvement in power supplies. Former President Jonathan then described it as the only way the country could get out of the power quagmire. It behoves on history to prove him right or wrong. But there are indications already that he may have done the right thing. It could be recalled that when late Bola Ige was appointed minister of power in the Obasanjo administration he then told Nigerians that he was going to turn around the nation's power woes within six months. He never did. The Obasanjo Government ended up spending billions of dollars on power but there was still no respite and no power for Nigerians. The cartel in the generator business never allowed the government to succeed in the power sector. Obasanjo who admirers love to describe as brave and smart could not confront the cartel. The only hope we are having today is as a result of the Jonathan administration's decision to privatise the sector. Jonathan may have been considered weak in some areas, but he was brave enough to confront the mafia. He ended up doing what the lions and tigers could not do. In fact, he became the one to successfully bell the cat. What is obvious from the improvement we see in the sector is that the generating companies, GENCOs are expanding their capacities. I hear that they are even currently generating more than the transmission capacity in the country can evacuate. Nigeria is surely on the way to stable power supply. This is one project of Jonathan that nobody should touch, if this nation really wants to grow and make progress. That is why one is perplexed that the first job the House of Representatives would undertake, after their shameful leadership fight, is to probe the privatization exercise. It is difficult to understand how the well meaning honourable members of the House would sign off this process, except for the fact that the very powerful generator importation lobby may have succeeded in penetrating and polluting the hallowed chambers of the parliament. If a probe of the sector should be envisaged at all, I guess the most sensible thing to do is to beam their searchlight on the billions of dollars spent by Obasanjo Administration without tangible results, rather than waste the nation's time and resources, attempting to reverse a success story. I mean, this is a process that was transparent, brought revenue and is already yielding dividends. Why then embark on an action that would not only setback the nation's power sector, but also endanger people's investments and scare aware future investors? For goodness sake, is this honest legislative business, or part of the lynch agenda inherent in the anti-corruption orchestration currently being implemented against the last administration and all its policies? Of what benefit will this be to the nation's economy? In this country, we have a knack for always ruining our own party. This is one project that has been generally and universally commended as credible with many foreign investors waiting in the wings to get in. But it appears we are more interested in shooting ourselves on the leg in order to justify the claim that this is a country that can't get anything right. It becomes even more disappointing that the prevalent wanton stigmatization of the nation has continued to happen because some self-seeking politicians want to take us on a ride in the name of bitter opposition politics. I would have thought the law makers should hearken to the advice of Dr Ibe Kachikwu, the group managing director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and Minister designate. While attending his confirmation session, he had told the lawmakers to their laxity and failure to pass the petroleum industry bill (PIB) over the years had created a lot of uncertainty in the oil sector, with the attendant loss of $15billion worth of investment every year. Surely, for the lawmakers, this is the way to go, rather than waste their time on barren probes. Like the PIB there are other bills including the planning continuity bill requiring urgent attention from them in the bid to move the nation forward. It is a patriotic call. Particularly, the fact that the lawmakers ignored in the last legislative session, the planning continuity bill prepared by the Jonathan Administration, portrayed them as officials with no interest in the maxim that governance is a continuous process. It is standard practice that a new Government needs to continue from where the previous one stopped, especially when the policies are adjudged good and the processes fair. No matter how the present All Progressives Congress (APC) controlled National Assembly would want to demonise the previous administration, we the people will bear witness to the fact that it indeed recorded landmark achievements in the reform activities in such areas as power, agriculture, aviation reforms, transportation, as well as the Nigerian content law in the oil and gas sector. Also, there is no doubt that the major reforms in the electoral process and the electoral body ensured the deepening of the nation's democracy. Our Honourable members must convince us that they understand the problems of this county and are prepared to apply themselves finding the solutions. Currently, the nation is being held down by economic and security challenges. There is terrorism in the north, kidnapping in the south which is fast spreading everywhere, youth unemployment and restiveness, looming economic recession and decaying infrastructure. Our expectations are that the parliamentarians should strategically engage and collaborate with the executive to save this country. Using their privileged position to pursue political opponents or rivals is the worst disservice the House of Representatives can do to this country. --Mohammed wrote from Yola in Adamawa State Nigeria \nThe International Crisis Group, a global, Brussels-based NGO dedicated to preventing and resolving conflict, selected … see more » Copyright © 2015 This Day.
