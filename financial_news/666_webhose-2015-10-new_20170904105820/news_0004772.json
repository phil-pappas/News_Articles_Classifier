This could lead to either cheaper broadband prices of larger data download allowances.\nThe ACCC decision is bad news for Telstra, which generates almost $1 billion in wholesale access revenues every year from its copper network, according to Goldman Sachs. This decision alone could cost Telstra over $150 million in net present value.\nAdvertisement Telstra had argued that it would have to keep maintaining its copper network even as millions of customers were shifted onto the national broadband network. It believed the one-off increase in charges would help pay for the discrepancy.\nBut the ACCC ultimately decided that the shrinking base of copper customers should not be punished for staying put and ruled it was against the long term interest of end users. The final decision is 0.2 per cent less of a cut compared to its draft decision issued in late June .\n\"Users of Telstra's network should not pay the higher costs that result from fewer customers as NBN migration occurs,\" ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement. \"If there is no adjustment for these higher costs then customers who have not yet been migrated to the NBN will ultimately pay significantly higher prices for copper based services.\"\nStrong allies overruled Telstra had a strong ally in then-Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann ,who both wrote to the ACCC calling for it to support the telco giant's proposal because doing otherwise could destablise the NBN's rollout.\n\"It will undermine the integrity of [the $11 billion deal] if Telstra shareholders are deprived of the benefit of arrangements they did not initiate but negotiated in good faith [and] this may weaken Telstra commitment to current reforms,\" the Ministers said. \"[Optus, iiNet and TPG] clearly understood the commercial value of the commitments ... and the centrality of those commitments to the reform process. \"The is disappointing to see them pursuing short term financial advantage.\"\nThe Department of Communications secretary Drew Clarke, who is now Prime Minister Turnbull's acting chief of staff, later backed this up with an official letter to the regulator reiterating its support for Telstra's position.\nBut all of this ultimately came to naught.\nThe decision could also be problematic for NBN, which needs as many customers as possible to switch onto its services to avoid a shortfall in revenue.\nA spokesman for Telstra said the company was strongly disappointed and considering its various options for appeal.\n\"The decision does not follow the ACCC's own fixed pricing principles that require Telstra to be given the opportunity to recover from wholesale customers the costs of providing services to them,\" he said in a statement. \"Any regulated entity should be concerned by this decision, especially in circumstances where merits review has been removed.\n\"We are particularly disappointed to see the ACCC depart from its draft decision in March which recognised the importance of providing price stability to the industry at this time of transition to the NBN.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/government-urges-accc-to-ignoretelstras-nbn-deal-20140724-j48o3", "http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/telstra-argues-price-rises-are-necessary-20141010-11bwib", "http://www.watoday.com.au/business/accc-forces-telstra-to-cut-wholesale-internet-prices-20150628-gi07ye?skin=dumb-phone"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:49:37.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
