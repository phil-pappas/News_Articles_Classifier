ADVERTISEMENT Sources told Bloomberg that the breach is far more serious than the smaller intrusion revealed by Dow Jones late last week. The FBI, the Secret Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission are leading an investigation that began at least a year ago, they said. It’s unclear if the company’s newsgathering operations were impacted by the breach. Dow Jones owns The Wall Street Journal and other publications. Experts say the incident is part of an insidious new era of online trading using stolen information. Embargoed press materials on topics like mergers and acquisitions could be valuable to traders looking to gain an edge over competitors who don’t know what’s coming down the pipeline. Earlier this summer, federal authorities brought civil or criminal charges against 32 people and companies that allegedly conspired to steal unpublished financial press releases and provide that information to traders. Together, officials say the group made more than $100 million in profits off illegal trades. Up until the indictment was unsealed in August, many prosecutors and investigators thought the incidents were outliers. “Clearly there’s concern that if the government was unable to uncover this crime, how many more are there?” Austin Berglas, former head of the FBI’s New York Cyber Branch and a lead investigator into last fall’s breach at JPMorgan Chase, told The Hill afterwards. Dow Jones said last week that hackers had breached its computer systems, looking for contact information to send fraudulent solicitations. In a letter sent to customers, the financial information company said there is no evidence that data was stolen but that the hackers may also have accessed credit card information of fewer than 3,500 individuals. Of the breach reported by Bloomberg, FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser told Reuters via email, “We are aware of the Dow Jones intrusion and looking into it.” Past: 1 day Clinton cracks up over question...
