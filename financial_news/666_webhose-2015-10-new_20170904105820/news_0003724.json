Photo: Graham Tidy\nMaybe high prices and generous tax concessions for investors haven't killed the Great Australian Dream of home ownership â€“ only changed it.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics' Housing Occupancy and Costs release provides a rich data seam to mine.\nThe hottest story to come out of it is that we've become a nation of renters; that the home ownership dream is dying.\nCertainly, more of us are renting, but there's actually been little change in the proportion of us who own residential real estate.\nAdvertisement The Reserve Bank's submission to the home ownership inquiry in June showed the proportion of owner-occupiers had been remarkably steady for half a century at 70 per cent, give or take a per cent or two.\nThere had been a definite rise in the private rental market in the 1990s; it was mainly the balancing item for a fall in government housing. The owner-occupier rate barely moved.\nThe ABS series, derived a little differently, showed there was a definite decline in \"OOs\" from its 2009-10 survey (69 per cent) to 2011-12 (67 per cent).\nThe proportion remained 67 per cent in the latest survey, which covered 2013-14.\nThe percentage of renters also was steady over the past two years at 31 per cent, but that was up from 28 per cent in the 1990s.\nRenting landlords However, the ABS fine print showed 17 per cent of those renters also owned an investment property; they were landlords who paid rent themselves.\nThat shouldn't be a surprise.\nSince January, the NAB quarterly residential property survey has been reporting an estimate that 10 per cent of all housing sales are to first home buyers acting as investors.\nThe ABS count of 17 per cent of the 31 per cent who are renters also being landlords means another 5 percentage points should be added to the total number of residence owners; let's call it 72 per cent.\nI tried to check how many renters were landlords back in the 1990s, but the housing occupancy publication didn't include such a figure then.\nIt seems it wasn't an issue, but I expect it wasn't nearly as high; just as the number of owner-occupiers with investment properties has grown after the Howard/Costello capital gains tax discount collided with negative gearing.\nAnd so it looks like our proportion of home owners, if not owner-occupiers, is remaining fairly steady despite what prices and tax incentives have done.\nThat Great Australian Dream has been evolving, not dying.", "external_links": ["http://abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4130.0Main+Features12013-14?OpenDocument", "http://business.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nab-quarterly-australian-residential-property-survey-q4-2014-pdf.pdf", "http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/inquiry-into-home-ownership/home-ownership-rates.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:33:30.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
