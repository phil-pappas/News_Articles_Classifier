Kinds of businesses that go around those areas include second clothes merchandise, food items, kitchen utensils and some other kinds of goods sold at other famous places like Kariakoo. These traders misuse Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) trunk lanes, though from time to time, relevant authorities have ordered them to vacate. They play cat and mouse, keeping away during the day. But when it gets dark, they go back and resume their business without fear, simply because the city fathers are no longer in control of the areas. The basic question to ask is: Is the law applicable only during the day? We have noticed that for the past two months, the lanes have been used to conduct drivers' training on how to operate the trunk buses that will be used in the project, so the area should be spared only for that particular purpose. The interim period has also been used to familiarise the project to citizens because the system will be completely different from the current transport system used in Dar es Salaam. Why do these petty traders fail to abide by the law? It should be noted that this place needs to be respected for the intended purpose, because it shall be a different system in terms of operations, safety, cleanliness and drivers' professionalism. The new system is also expected to help serve time of passengers, hence increase work efficiency. We wonder why these traders have refused to vacate the area, despite pleas from different authorities who have urged them to do so. It might be hard to drive them away when the project starts to operate in full swing next month. We believe time has come for people to vacate these areas as soon as possible. They should look for other avenues where they can display their merchandise. We insist that petty traders should clear away from all BRT trunk lanes or face legal action. The lanes were designed to improve the transport system in the city and not otherwise. Let relevant authorities take necessary measures to drive away petty traders from all the BRT lanes. The sooner these measures are taken, the better.
