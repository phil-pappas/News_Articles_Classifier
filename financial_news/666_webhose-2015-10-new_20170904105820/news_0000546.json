Alipay has not said whether these users were the victims of data leaks. \nMany users said that later checks showed that the links had been removed from their accounts. However, some said they had to contact Alipay to do this because they could not remove them on their own. \nThe Alipay employee said that the team responsible for designing the company's website had been notified of the problem and would fix it. The team had thought about requiring users to verify such links, but chose to skip the step to help the user experience, the employee said. \nAlipay is China's most popular online payment tool. As of 2013, it had 300 million users who registered their real names with the company, Alibaba said in an annual report. \nThe company was criticized for an incident in May that saw its service stop working for more than two hours. \nThe central bank has repeatedly chastised Ant Financial Services Group and its competitors for too often trading security for the convenience of users. The company has been told to put some of its new services – such as e-credit cards and payments made by the scanning of codes – on hold because they failed to meet its security standards. \nThe regulator is worried because it fears that scammers can use flawed payment systems to commit fraud on a large scale. \nData related to more than 10 million bankcards that was held by a payment company was leaking in January, causing losses of nearly 40 million yuan over the next six months, said a report written by central bank experts that Caixin has read. \nThe report did not name the payment company. \n(Rewritten by Chen Na) Alipay Blames Flaw One User Found on Data Leak Online payment company admits single user was victim of leak, but won't say whether others who have encountered same problem are affected By intern reporter Han Yi SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:14:50.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
