Australian stocks lost 0.2 percent as worries about China weighed on commodity prices.\nThere was little in the way of a lead from Wall Street where the Dow ended Tuesday 0.1 percent lower, while the S&P 500 eased 0.14 percent and the Nasdaq 0.5 percent.\nThe S&P healthcare sector shed 1.5 percent, dragged by Allergan and Pfizer, while a drop in IBM offset gains in companies that reported strong quarterly results such as Verizon and United Technologies.\nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 4 percent in the third quarter, while revenue is expected to have declined 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nEconomic news from the United States was moderately upbeat as housing starts increased 6.5 percent in September to an annual pace of 1.21 million units, beating expectations for 1.15 million units.\nThere was also better news on bank lending in the euro zone as data from the ECB showed a further easing in credit conditions and improving demand for loans.\nThat might lessen the need for the ECB to immediately ramp up its 1 trillion euro asset purchase program.\nThe ECB's governing council meets on Thursday and markets expect it to highlight a willingness to act to boost inflation, but not just yet.\n\"The general consensus is that the ECB has been trying to moderate expectations this week, suggesting it's too early for discussion around extending the current QE programme,\" said analysts at Citi.\nThe euro was steady at $1.1351, hemmed in by support at $1.3300 and resistance around $1.1386. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down a shade at 94.855.\nThe New Zealand dollar hit a one-week low of $0.6737 after a disappointing global dairy auction saw prices for the country's single largest export fall 3.1 percent.\nOil prices softened on speculation U.S. inventory data would only underline the extent of oversupply in the world. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will report official inventory data on Wednesday.\nU.S. crude was off 40 cents at $45.89 per barrel.
