PUBLISHED: 19:09, Sun, Oct 18, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:32, Sun, Oct 18, 2015 ALAMY Car windscreens are usually a straightforward job to repair \nConvertible car owner Christine Pearce was puzzled at first as to why such a straightforward job was proving so difficult but then when her patience started to run out, she asked Crusader to weigh in on her behalf a couple of weeks ago. \nA stone had scratched and cracked the car’s glass at the end of April. Christine, from west London, told us. “My insurance policy included windscreen cover and my claim was approved. So I got an appointment with the recommended windscreen repairer but then, instead of being job done, it was just the start of a long saga,” she explained. \nHer Mazda MX5 was less than two years old and the first fitter who arrived from Auto Windscreens had not brought along the right screen so he left saying he would need to source one from outside the UK. “When I was told the right type had arrived in mid-August I had to try several times to get another fitting date,” Christine added. “When I did get one, I waited at home but no one turned up.” \nBecause the stone had damaged the screen on the passenger side, Christine could still drive her motor. “However the scratch was getting longer as time went on. I was told because the glass was laminated it would not break into pieces but I was not reassured.” GETTY Smashed car windows should be easy to claim on insurance \nNext she was promised a same-day appointment, only that also failed to materialise. “Then a pleasant young man arrived at my house without warning to do the fitting. However he had picked up the wrong windscreen,” she said. \n“When I complained to someone called Ashley at the company, I was pleased because someone did call me back but in September the whole pantomime resumed. I seem to be caught in a loop and am at my wits’ end wondering how to break it.” I seem to be caught in a loop and am at my wits’ end wondering how to break it Christine Pearce \nFearing her windscreen had been allocated to another car and she was now back on a waiting list, Christine sent Crusader a concise catalogue of her woes. As this was the first problem we had ever received concerning Auto Windscreens, all the indications were Christine’s experience was not its normal standard of service. \nThe company immediately had another go at fitting a screen but again to no avail. In the end it was Christine herself who came to the rescue by contacting the garage that originally supplied her car. It provided the part number and sourced the right model within a couple of days. \nManaging director of Auto Windscreens, Chris Thornton, made it clear there were no excuses for what had gone on but at least he had got to the bottom of why Christine had the problem. “We feel we have fallen short of expectations,” he said.

It might be that paying for the replacement yourself will prove cheaper. \nIf there are hold ups, find out the part number. This is not your job but it could save time. Always note the name of any customer services person you deal with. \nTechnological advances, such as auto-dipping mirrors and GPS tracking systems are making windscreens more expensive so damage cover in insurance policies could disappear in future.
