Brendon Thorne by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Macquarie Capital is helping State Super Financial Services Australia (SSFS) consider its options ahead of a potential $1 billion-plus initial public offering in early 2016, as revealed by Street Talk Online on Monday.\nWhile sources cautioned a decision had not yet been made to proceed with a float, a non-deal roadshow is expected to get underway this side of Christmas.\nState Super Financial Services is one of Australia's biggest financial planning businesses. It is owned by NSW's SAS Trustee Corporation, the former State Super, and provides financial advice to buckletloads of former NSW public servants and their families who typically receive large lump sum payments as part of their retirement benefits.\nSAS Trustee Corporation has over 117,000 members. Chief executive officer John Livanas has been instrumental in the outperformance of the $42 billion fund, hiring the likes of ex AMP's Mark O'Brien as chief investment officer.\nSources also noted last year's merger between SAS Trustee Corporation and NSW Treasury Corporation has been seamless, prompting the SAS board to turn its attention to a potential float of State Super Financial Services.\nAs revealed by Street Talk on October 5 , investment banks have been lobbying for State Super Financial Services to be considered for privatisation as part of NSW's 2016-17 financial year budget.\nMultiple banks had volunteered their services for a State Super Financial Services scoping study, in an effort to convince SAS Trustee Corporation and NSW premier Mike Baird and finance minister Dominic Perrottet that the financial planning group would be better off in the hands of one of the big banks or financial institutions, or run as a separately-listed entity on the Australian Securities Exchange.\nIt is understood Perpetual, IOOF Holdings and planning arms of the Big Four banks have been mentioned as potential acquirers.\n With 60,000 clients and $15 billion in funds under management, it shapes as one of the IPO pipeline's larger contenders for 2016. Should State Super Financial Services float on the sharemarket, Macquarie is unlikely to be the only bank working on the deal.\nThe well-regarded Nicholas Johnson was appointed chairman of SAS Trustee Corporation in June this year, replacing Michael Carapiet.\nFormer Ipac Securities boss and National Australia Bank director Peeyush Gupta is chairman of SSFS while other directors include former ING Investment Management head of Asia Pacific Paul Scully and IOOF director George Venardos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:07:01.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
