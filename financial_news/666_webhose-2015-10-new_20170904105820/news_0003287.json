He also proposed a solution to to the Minimum Initial Payment (MIP) issue, which would also assist international students who currently have to pay 100% of their fees for Rhodes upfront. Mabizela suggested that students be allowed to either pay 20% upfront or be allowed to pay their fees over 10 months via debit order. International students will be allowed to pay the legal minimum amount as set by Home Affairs for their MIPs, which is 75%. He also invited students to take part in the university budget discussions about the proposed fee increase for 2016, which has not yet been finalised. Mabizela noted that student fees would only be used as a last resort to balance the books but cautioned that the university could not legally draw up a deficit budget. He also suggested that all parties work together to find alternate funding sources. As outsourcing of labour has been raised as a significant issue at other campuses across South Africa, Mabizela was also asked about how Rhodes handled its labour practices. He pointed out that the only outsourcing Rhodes does is to supplement its security staff through the private security company, Hi-Tec. Most Rhodes support staff are employed full time, directly by the university but the local branch of trade union Nehawu has raised issues in the past about staff being employed on temporary contracts, which are never converted to full-time work.
