There were 123 job offers for every 100 job hunters in August, according to the report. \n\"This marks the strongest reading since 1992, and suggests that the unemployment rate could hit three percent in coming months,\" Capital Economics said. \nBut the job seekers survey also suggested a skills mismatch between those looking for work and the jobs available, added Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) . \n\"We think that rising job offers will not necessarily lead to any visible increase in the number of employed,\" Shirakawa said. \nThe fresh figures come a day after a closely watched Bank of Japan Tankan survey showed the country's major manufacturers were becoming less confident as a slowdown in China and weakness at home hurts their business. \nJapanese factory production fell unexpectedly for a second month in August, while data last week showed consumer prices dropped for the first time in more than two years. \nWeakness in Japan's economy has stirred speculation that the BoJ will expand its 80 trillion yen ($665 billion) annual asset-buying scheme -- similar to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing. \nThe stimulus plan, a key pillar of Abe's policy, aimed to pump cash into the economy to kickstart growth and conquer years of deflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:35:14.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
