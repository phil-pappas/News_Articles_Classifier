Moon Express was awarded $1 million by Google this year as the only team shooting for the moon to flight test a prototype of its lander.\nUnder the launch services contract, Rocket Lab, which was founded in New Zealand but is now headquartered in Los Angeles, will use its Electron rocket system to launch three missions of Moon Express' MX-1 lunar lander spacecraft, starting in 2017.\nThe launches will take place either from New Zealand, where Rocket Lab is building a South Island launch site, or from an American range.\nRocket Lab uses battery-powered rocket engines that are cheaper than traditional engines and are quickly created using 3D printers.\nPrivate companies, including Elon Musk's Space X and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, are increasingly entering the space business following cuts to funding by U.S. space agency NASA.
