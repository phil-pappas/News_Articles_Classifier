Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Elise Shaw Canaccord raised its price target on dorsaVi, a company focused on developing wearable sensor technology for use in clinical practice, elite sports as well as occupational health and safety. It has a price target of 80¢ on the stock, up from 75¢ previously, and a \"buy\" recommendation. \"DVL has announced a landmark, three-year sales agreement worth at least $9 million for its ViMove product in the UK with a network of physiotherapy clinics called YourPhysioPlan (YPP). Currently over 100 clinics have signed up with YPP and the group is planning to expand to more than 300 clinics over the next 12 months. To maintain exclusivity for use of ViMove in the private clinical market, YPP is required to license or purchase 100, 300 and 600 ViMove units in each of the three years which should generate at least $9 million in revenue. While DVL has recently had significant success in securing contracts for the OH&S market, this is the first major commercial contract in the medical market. We have increased our forecast of revenue from the medical market.\"\nBell Potter initiated coverage on fashion jewellery retailer Lovisa with a \"buy\" and a target price of $3.70 a share. \"Australia is LOV's largest market exposure; however the company is embarking on an international store rollout strategy. Our positive view on LOV is supported by the combination of: 1) the strong earnings growth outlook underpinned by significant global store rollout opportunities; 2) LOV's highly attractive business attributes that we believe positions the company on strong grounds to execute on its international store rollout plans; and 3) undemanding valuation (FY17e PE: 12.8x and EV/EBITDA: 7.7x) considering LOV's growth prospects and upside to our forecasts.\"\nMacquarie's Economics team recently updated its FX forecasts , predicting further weakening in the $A/$US exchange rate and other commodity currencies. \"Newcrest Mining NCM (outperform) is a major beneficiary of the long-term cut to our $A/$US forecasts due to the long mine lives of Cadia Valley and to a lesser extent Lihir Island. We now expect NCM to have the capacity to repay its debt in three years. Northern Star Resources NST saw similar upgrades to its mid-cap gold producing peers with operations exposed to the $A and we upgraded NST from 'neutral' to 'outperform' after lifting our price target by 17 per cent.\"\nMacquarie Wealth Management maintains an \"outperform\" on Rio Tinto and a target price of $57 a share. \"The sale of Bengalla is significant as it more than halves our previously forecasted $1 billion cash flow shortfall for CY16. We expect the simplified ownership structure will facilitate a smoother exit from RIO's remaining Hunter Valley assets. The Bengalla divestment price shows that there will always be interest at the right price for tier one, first quartile cost curve assets and we suspect Mt Pleasant, the largest undeveloped coal deposit in the Hunter Valley, could be next to go given RIO's conscious capital constraints.\"\nBroker Watch: Alumina, Metcash, Brambles, Tomizone\nBroker Watch: Ramsay Health Care, Sims Group,
