Citizens will now also be able to rate the service delivery of their urban local bodies. For the first time, collective citizen feedback via these ratings will be able to the urban local bodies, State and Central Government in real time. Also, Citizens, Businesses, NGOs and any other Organizations can refer to these ratings before making their relocation/business/project decisions in a particular city. The online Swachh Bharat Online Citizen Communities initiative was initiated in October 2014 by LocalCircles ( www.localcircles.com ) and Swachh Bharat Mission, Ministry of Urban Development. Since then, over a period of 12 months, over 335,000 citizens have become part of the National Community called “Swachh Bharat” providing inputs on various aspects of Swachh Bharat Mission ranging from Municipal Reforms to Civic Sense Basics for every Indian. Over 50 whitepapers/checklists have been generated as a result of this effort with another 50 discussions open thereby making it the largest community for the cause. Recently, a citizen survey conducted in the community with over 40,000 respondents from over 100 cities of India, highlighted that while Swachh Bharat has been successful in creating large scale awareness, especially among school children, the focus going forward has to be on many aspects of the Urban Local Bodies which are responsible for delivery of waste collection, disposal and sanitation services. To ensure, what Urban Local Bodies are delivering, is in sync with the citizens’ collective pain points from a civic service standpoint, online citizen communities are being enabled across 200 cities of India to bring together citizens and urban local bodies so they can get and stay connected for the cause of Swachh Bharat. Such connectivity will also enable urban local bodies to easily mobilize citizens for Civic Awareness Campaigns or seek expertise/volunteers for various initiatives. The online communities will have features like Polls that will enable Urban Local Bodies to seek citizen views on initiatives, set priorities based on citizen feedback, schedule events and cleanliness/civic sense awareness drives, seek structured feedback and make Swachh Bharat a true Jan Andolan or Citizen Movement. Citizens will now also have the capability to rate their Urban Local Bodies at a Department level. Urban Local Bodies can access these ratings and understand collective citizen issues in real time via these ratings. “The Swachh Bharat Citizen Communities is a one of its kind initiative that has grown from zero to over 3 lakh citizens over the last year connecting Citizens who stand for the cause of Swachh Bharat and have generated whitepapers that we regularly refer to in our Swachh Bharat policy making exercises”, said Venkaiah Naidu, Minister for Urban Development, Government of India. “As the Mission moves into its second year, having local electronic connectivity between Citizens and Urban Local Bodies is a positive step towards enabling the Urban Local Bodies and making Swachh Bharat a “Jan Andolan”, Naidu continued. “In this day and age of Smartphones and Social Media, these online citizen communities truly make governance participative and transparent and can mobilize collective action towards Swachh Bharat at a local level”, said Sachin Taparia, Chairman and CEO LocalCircles. “Our hope is that the Urban Local Bodies will embrace them instead of resisting them and work with citizen communities they serve for the cause of Swachh Bharat”, he continued.
