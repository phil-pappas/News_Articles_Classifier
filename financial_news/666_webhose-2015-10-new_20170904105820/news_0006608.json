AP Share on twitter by Karen Maley Global currency wars are back on in earnest, with the euro tumbling after European Central Bank (ECB) boss Mario Draghi signalled the bank stood ready to boost the \"size, composition and duration\" of the bank's bond-buying program.\nThe ECB's move to boost its monetary stimulus , which drives down eurozone bond rates and puts downward pressure on the euro, comes as US Federal Reserve board members appear deeply divided on whether to proceed with plans to raise US interest rates this year.\nWhile the Fed dithers, the market has already ruled out an interest rate cut this year, which has pushed lower both US bond yields and the greenback.\nBut as it grapples with feeble economic activity and inflation falling into negative territory, the last thing the ECB wants is to see the euro strengthening against the US dollar. A stronger euro will act as a drag on eurozone growth, because it will make the region's exports more expensive in global markets. And the ECB cannot stand by idly and watch as the slight progress it has made in terms of boosting economic activity is destroyed by a strong currency.\nAs a result, Draghi has little choice but to fire up the printing presses even more by signalling that the central bank's €1.1 trillion ($1.7 trillion) bond-buying program could be \"re-examined\" in December, and by refusing to rule out further interest rate cuts.\nSpeaking in Malta, Draghi said the European central bank's \"governing council recalls that the asset purchase programme provides sufficient flexibility in terms of adjusting its size, composition and duration.\"\nAt the moment, the ECB is buying €60 billion of mostly government bonds each month, and many analysts expect this will be increased to €80 billion a month at the ECB's December meeting. The ECB might also cut the rate charged on banks' deposits parked at the ECB, which is minus 0.2 per cent at present, even further.\n\"The degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at our December policy meeting when the new … projections will be available,\" Draghi told reporters.\n Not surprisingly, the euro sank against the US dollar on Draghi's comments and bond yields, which move inversely to prices, dropped sharply. Benchmark 10-year Italian and Spanish bond yields fell to their lowest level since April, while the yield on two-year German bonds hit a record low of 0.32 per cent.\nSpeaking at the ECB's governing council meeting, Draghi invoked the customary politeness of central bankers and stressed his policies were not aimed at reaching a particular foreign exchange rate target. He noted the euro had been appreciating \"to a somewhat significant level\" and noted the stronger currency was putting yet more downward pressure on inflation.\nReigniting inflation is important for Draghi because deflation makes it harder for governments, businesses and households to service heavy debt burdens. What's more, a prolonged period of falling prices hurts spending, and increases the real (after adjusting for inflation) interest rate that households and businesses have to pay.\nInvestors were impressed by Draghi's clear resolve to provide yet more monetary stimulus, and his statement that the ECB's stance was one of \"work and assess\", not one of \"wait and see\".\nBut Draghi also stressed eurozone governments needed to do more to ensure the region returned to sustainable growth, through investing in infrastructure projects and undertaking structural reforms. Monetary policy, he complained, \"shouldn't be the only game in town\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley", "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2015/html/is151022.en.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:02:41.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
