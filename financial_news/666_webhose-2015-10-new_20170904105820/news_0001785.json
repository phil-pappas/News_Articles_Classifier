Some of the companies that these CEOs lead are reassuringly familiar – like Largo Foods, the maker of Tayto; fruit giant Fyffes, and Guinness stalwart Diageo. \nSome companies could barely have been dreamed of until a few years ago, like STATSports, which tracks the movement and health of professional athletes on the field of play, and is now standard issue in the English Premiership and in international rugby. \nThere are plenty of familiar figures in this year’s CEO 100, and surnames inextricably linked with Irish business: Smurfit, O’Reilly, O’Leary. Likewise, companies that have been around for generations. \nIn a highly disruptive business environment, where technology causes fortunes to ebb and flow; empires to rise and fall faster than ever before, one wonders which of these leaders has the vision to match the old guard’s longevity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:56:40.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
