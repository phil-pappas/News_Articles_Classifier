CSX -2.35 % executives said Wednesday.\n“Although we are projecting stable to favorable conditions for several key markets, this will be more than offset by unfavorable conditions for the remainder of the portfolio,” said CFO Frank Lonegro on the company’s earnings call with analysts.\nBright spots for the railroad continue to be growth in its intermodal business, or the transportation of containers and trailers. While fuel prices have declined, making truckers more competitive with rail, CSX said it expects to continue to gain market share and command strong prices. The automotive industry is also expected to continue to boost shipments by rail.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

Metals will continue to be hit as a strong dollar fuels imports and domestic production falls, reflecting a similar decline to the third quarter. Domestic coal volumes will decline by about a fifth in the fourth quarter as low natural gas prices have caused power plans to switch fuels, a trend that should continue into 2016.\n“Overall, we expect fourth-quarter volume declines as we cycle a strong 2014 volume environment, continue to feel the effects of low natural gas and crude oil prices and the impact of strong currency on our export and import-sensitive markets,” Mr. Lonegro said.\nIn order to control costs, the railroad is running longer trains – lengths were up 10% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago – and reducing its workforce. In the fourth quarter, its average headcount will be down 6%.\nFor the quarter, CSX reported a profit of $507 million, or 52 cents a share, down from $509 million, or 51 cents, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 8.8% to $2.94 billion.\nWrite to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:09:28.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
