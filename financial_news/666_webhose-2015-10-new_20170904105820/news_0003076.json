Sanders, the New York-born Vermont senator, topped both the Facebook ( FB - Get Report ) charts and Twitter's ( TWTR - Get Report ) social media feed with his colorful comment that \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,\" a remark he made after Clinton was questioned during the debate about her private e-mail server. While Clinton said she had made mistakes about the use of a private e-mail account while serving as secretary of state, Sanders did her a favor -- and won some support in the process -- when he told debate moderator Anderson Cooper that the subject already had received too much attention. Clearly pleased by Sanders' remark, Clinton pitched-in and agreed with a \"me too.\" Sanders' comment helped catapult the 74-year-old Democratic socialist to the top of Facebook's ranking for the candidate most discussed on the social media platform during the two-hour debate. Clinton came in second followed by former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Sen. Lincoln Chafee. On Twitter, Sanders was the subject of 41% of all Tweets followed by Clinton at 39% and Webb at 9%. O'Malley and Chafee tallied 6% and 5%, respectively. Chafee gained some unwanted fame when he sought to explain his 1999 Senate vote in favor of repealing the Glass-Steagall provisions of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933. Chafee's comment that he had \"just arrived\" in the Senate prior to the Glass-Steagall vote, and in retrospect, he lamented his decision, was the subject of the second-largest number of Tweets during the debate. The Glass-Steagall provisions limited commercial banking activities, prohibiting banks from also being involved in securities such as stocks and bonds. The repeal of Glass-Steagall is often cited by critics as an underlying cause of the 2008 recession. During the debate, 4.2 million people were engaged on Facebook, generating more than 10 million interactions, defined as \"likes,\" posting, comments or shares. As for content, racial issues generated the most discussion followed by the economy, government ethics, the environment and guns, according to Facebook.
