The new IC is optimized for high efficiency systems, with a strengthened monitoring function to reduce potential risks that threaten the security of the system. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151015005618/en/ Toshiba: \"TB9042FTG\", a system regulator IC with monitoring function for the motor control system of electric and hybrid vehicles. (Photo: Business Wire) Failure of the system regulator IC leads to malfunction of electronic devices. The system particularly loses functionality when microcontroller (MCU) failure impacts on operation. “TB9042FTG” provides an SPI communication function to avoid this dangerous condition. The system regulator IC and the MCU identify trouble at the time of the abnormality by using the SPI communication function to monitor each other. Using the derived information, the system can carry out safe and timely processing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:25:12.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
