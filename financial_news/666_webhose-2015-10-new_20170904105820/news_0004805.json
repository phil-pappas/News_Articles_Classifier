Sometimes computer trading algorithms are a cause. Share on twitter by Philip Baker That was some \"fat finger\" trade which for no good reason sent a cool $US6 billion from the Deutsche Bank foreign exchange desk in London straight to the bank account of a very happy client.\nIt was a mistake of course, and the money was returned the next day, but it highlights that regulators can slap as much compliance as they want on trading desks in a bid to make them safer, but human error could still spark a shock in financial markets.\nIt didn't happen this time round but what's to say it won't if something similar takes place again.\nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank rule forced the big Wall Street banks to spin off certain trading activities so it was clear they were stand-alone operations and wouldn't be bailed out with taxpayers' money the next time any of their big bets went pear-shaped.\nWhich is how it all played out in the 2008 crisis.\nThat rule was supposed to make the banks safer and think twice before their bets could jeopardise the safety of financial markets.\nTalk to anyone on a dealing desk these days and the most common whinge is all the compliance and admin that has to be done.\nFor example, it's common for a two-page report to have another five pages of disclaimers.\n It's all about making financial markets safer and more transparent.\nBut what about genuine human mistakes, like a fat finger trade?\nWhat happens if that causes the mayhem?\nNo amount of regulation or compliance can stop stupid human mistakes or a good old-fashioned accident.\nBut sophisticated computer technology and complex trading algorithms could also cause havoc.\nIn 2014 Japan's sharemarket was all over the shop when a trading error caused more than $US600 billion ($825 billion) worth of orders to be made and then cancelled straight away.\nBlack Swan events obviously have an enormous impact on financial markets, but the fat finger trade is also an accident that no one sees coming.\nHong Kong regulation Earlier this year Hong Kong's markets regulator tried to put in place a plan to stop fat fingers and rogue algorithms from causing havoc in day-to-day trading.\nThe idea was to prevent individual stocks, mainly the larger, more well-known companies, from moving more than 10 per cent within a five-minute period.\nUnder the plan any order that forced a stock to rise or fall by more than 10 per cent will be stopped, and a cooling-off period will begin.\nIn August this year the Dow Jones plunged more than 1000 points in the first six minutes of trading. Heavyweight stocks such as GE and JPMorgan slumped more than 20 per cent after a flood of automatic selling triggered so-called stop-loss orders.\nThese types of orders are designed to protect investors by putting in place a sale once a stock falls to a certain level.\nBut press the sell button for longer or just keep your fat finger on it and the selling doesn't stop.\nThat's not safe for investors.\nInfamous trades At the stockbrokers' awards each year it's not unusual for the Fat Finger Award to draw some of the biggest cheers, as the trades executed with the odd missing digit or decimal place are explained in great detail.\nThere have been more than just a few infamous trades that have caused angst in financial markets.\nIn 2009 a former oil futures broker traded more than 7 million barrels of oil when he was drunk after a weekend of binge drinking.\nA year earlier in the local market there was a sell order for just over 500,000 QBE Insurance shares at 2¢, compared with previous levels of $22.85.\nWith QBE accounting for 2 per cent of the S&P/ASX 200, the sales that went through between 1¢ and 3¢ a share after that order were enough to send the index down by around 100 points.\nNot all sudden market moves can be blamed on fat fingers. Sometimes automated systems, guided by computer algorithms, are blamed.\nIt's similar for commercial banks.\nIn 2007 Northern Rock made headlines around the world when it became Britain's first bank run in 140 years.\nIt's the confidence game.\nIf people lose confidence, and there's enough worry around, no amount of regulation will stop people wanting their money back.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-10-20T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:04:21.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
