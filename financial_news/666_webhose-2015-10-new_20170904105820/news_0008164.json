And that does notbode well for other big names that need to borrow money soon.\nHP was forced to pay almost half a percentage point morethan rates on its existing bonds, as Bloomberg News’s MichelleDavis reported. The California tech company raised the money tosplit its enterprise unit from its printer and PC business. Andwhile it has faced declining revenues and a shrinking staff, thecompany is still investment grade.\nHP is lucky it didn’t have to pay more. Its new bonds werestruggling to keep their value in initial trading, with BreanCapital LLC macro strategist Peter Tchir noting Thursday thatthe deal was “not doing well.”\nThis sets a bad precedent for other companies, such asHalliburton and Pfizer, that are hoping to borrow money in thenear future.\nInvestors are already demanding 1.78 percentage points morethan benchmark rates to own investment-grade bonds, the mostsince 2012 and up from 1.06 percentage points in June last year,Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.\nBond buyers are jumpy, and it’s easy to understand why.
