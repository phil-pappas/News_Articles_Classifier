Share on twitter by Christopher Joye For years we've argued that, given heightened uncertainty, a preferred portfolio posture is to barbell between cash allocations, which provide valuation optionality and mitigate unanticipated shocks, and long-short equities hedge funds that reduce \"beta\", or index risks, while leaving you with \"alpha\" in all conditions.\nAlpha refers to a hedge fund's ability to identify and profit from appreciation and/or depreciation in asset values independently of any market movements (or \"beta\").\nThe hedge fund is distinguished from long-only managers that only win when stocks climb. In a perfect world you wouldn't limit yourself to the latter constraint: you would capture positive total returns through the cycle's upswings and downswings.\nIn 2015 the barbell approach has worked well. To highlight this, I've examined the relative performance of the following strategies: two cash proxies (the cash rate and the average term deposit); a Treasury or floating-rate bond fund that I help run; Australian equities as represented by the All Ordinaries Accumulation Index; global shares using the MSCI World (Ex Australia) Net Total Return Index in Aussie dollars; a multimanager hedge fund solution offered by Jon Horton's NWQ Capital Management; a global equities long-short hedge fund managed by Rob Luciano's VGI Partners; and an Australian market-neutral equities product overseen by Perpetual's Anthony Aboud. (My family invests with NWQ, VGI and Perpetual.)\nCash and Australian floating-rate bonds, which are up between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent for the year to date, have smashed both domestic and global shares, which are down 2.7 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively.\nThe real standout, however, is the three hedge fund solutions. The value-oriented long-short stock-picker VGI Partners, which concentrates on G20 economies, is up an incredible 23 per cent in 2015. NWQ's Fiduciary Fund, which actively diversifies across seven long-short and market-neutral portfolios, has likewise delivered an impressive 11.6 per cent net return.\nFinally, Perpetual's Pure Equity Alpha, which has a more conservative \"market-neutral\" approach that balances out longs and shorts to provide a net (beta-adjusted) exposure close to zero, has furnished absolute returns of circa 4 per cent this year while the wider market tanked.\nThere are several lessons from this. The first is that in an environment where the global financial system is in uncharted territory – care of record leverage, unprecedented government interventions to bolster prices, and never-ending shocks (Greece, China, Yellen's yips, Volkswagon and Glencore) – liquid cash and Treasury investments that yield low-duration returns can be a sensible safe harbour.\n Yet the real driver of the overall return story has been harnessing investors who capitalise on positive and negative movements in individual stocks while externalising index risk.\nOne particularly profitable downside trade, for example, has been shorting Australia's major banks, which, as we have explained before, ranked among the most expensive in the world.\nThe majors have come under relentless pressure as one-eyed punters reluctantly accepted they were materially undercapitalised and needed to raise vast volumes of first-loss equity. With higher funding costs and much less leverage, there is much more downside for the majors' dividends and returns on equity.\nUnderlying this narrative is the insight that smart diversification via strategies that have genuinely low correlations is the best way to reach your return targets while reducing risk. One interesting new development in this respect is the emergence of \"alternative beta\" solutions.\nBeta is technically defined as the relationship, or correlation, between any given investment (say CBA shares) and a market-wide asset-class (for example, Aussie equities).\nThe industry tends to abstract away from this calculation to conceive of beta more crudely as simply an independent source of risk and return. Thus we have equities beta, fixed-income beta, cash beta, private equity beta, commodities beta and so on.\nThe idea is that you can run a portfolio optimisation whereby you allocate across different types of beta in a manner that gives you the highest likelihood of reaching your return expectation with the lowest probability of loss.\nThe best forms of beta are those that remain consistently uncorrelated with other markets. In practice, this is hard to isolate. Most super funds treat Australian and global equities as independent asset classes, yet the truth is they are quite correlated, and become even more so during crises.\nSince 2012 the correlation between the ASX/S&P 200 and the S&P 500 indices has been only 18 per cent. (While the monthly correlation is a much higher 54 per cent, one should where possible use daily as opposed to monthly returns to minimise statistical biases associated with low-frequency sampling.)\nThe problem is that during the Chinese equities crash in August the correlation between Aussie and US equities spiked three times higher than its long-run average. Theoretical diversification that was meant to protect you faded. Many investors learned this lesson in the global financial crisis, when supposedly uncorrelated assets like listed equities, infrastructure, hedge funds and private equity suffered simultaneous losses.\nA jump in correlations during global ructions often reflects common influences on all returns that are exogenous and mostly non-diversifiable events. The earthquake-induced Fukushima meltdown rocked markets. Spendthrift Greek politicians freaked out investors everywhere.\nChina's experiments with freely moving equities and foreign exchange markets triggered global market volatility, as did Middle Eastern cartels pushing oil prices down precipitously to undermine competitors.\nThese perturbations have an impact on all asset classes except, superficially, non-marked-to-market cash, wherein savers carry their investments at face value and incorrectly assume away their unsecured bank credit risks. The truth is that there is no such as thing as a \"risk-free\" asset despite popular presumptions to the contrary.\nA key trap when searching for uncorrelated assets is that relationships can be unstable: this year's beta may look very different from that implied by long-term analysis. In June, when Aussie equities were down 5.5 per cent, the AusBond Composite Bond Index, which since the GFC has proved a solid equities hedge, also fell 1 per cent. Yet in August, when shares tumbled 8 per cent, bonds rose 0.6 per cent.\nUncovering alternative beta A discreet Paris-based hedge fund, Capital Fund Management (CFM), has had unusual success uncovering bona-fide sources of \"alternative beta\" by leveraging a large research team comprising 40 PhDs and 70 computer scientists.\nThe beta CFM searches for is not the traditional, asset-class-dependent exposure that most investors have in mind. Pouring over hundreds of years of time-series data spanning numerous investments, CFM instead focuses on finding exploitable and scalable statistical patterns, or anomalies, that persist over \"decades or even centuries\".\nThree crucial features of these anomalies are that they are sustainable over the long run, \"decorrelated\" with conventional beta (that is equities and bonds) and capable of producing positive absolute returns. There's no use being uncorrelated if your return is negative!\nCFM has publicly disclosed its six biggest sources of alternative beta: \"momentum\" in equity returns; the famous Fama and French (1992) anomaly whereby cheap \"value\" stocks outperform expensive \"growth\" stocks; a \"quality\" variable deriving from underlying earnings and cash flows that has predictive capacity regarding future returns; long-term positive or negative \"trend-following\" strategies across equities, bonds, currencies and commodities confirmed by 200 years of data; \"carry trades\" that profit from interest rate differentials between high- and low-yielding currencies at the cost of exchange rate risk; and, finally, capturing \"volatility premia\" by selling expensive options (much like insurance) that capitalise on the fact that people feel more pain from losses than happiness from gains.\nSince CFM's alternative beta strategy was launched in December 2013 it has returned 10.2 per cent annually after fees, with volatility of only 6 per cent. This success has attracted around $300 million, which is only a fraction of CFM's total $6 billion in funds under management. Since CFM does not seek to produce alpha per se within its six beta strategies, costs are around half the standard hedge fund model, with a 1 per cent management fee and 10 per cent performance fee.\nThe firm's president, Philippe Jordan, warns that \"in-sample over-fitting is one of the biggest pitfalls in the portfolio management business\". This is like assuming the fund managers with the best returns over the past 10 years will be subsequent winners. To avoid this problem, CFM spends an inordinate amount of time stressing its strategies using tests that do not suffer from hindsight bias.\nThe takeaway is that well-diversified and intelligently constructed beta can ultimately be more valuable than elusive alpha, which is difficult to maintain.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:07:07.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
