On News Feed and profiles, we’re seeing people create and view more videos than ever before. Today we’re starting to test the next step in an obvious evolution of profiles: profile videos,” Facebook Product Managers Aigerim Shorman and Tony Hsieh wrote.\nUsers will be able to film a short, looping video clip that will play for anyone who visits their profile, the blog said.\nThe social networking firm said people visit Facebook profiles more than four billion times per day.\nAlong with the new profile features, Facebook has also made design changes to mobile profile, aimed at improving the profile layout and better present information about the user in a more visually engaging way.\n“We’re moving your profile picture and video to literally put you front-and-centre on your profile. Profile pictures are now centered, and we’ve made them bigger to give you more real estate to show off what you can do with our new creative tools,” the blog said.\nThe US-based firm has also introduced easier control over what people see on the user’s page with a customisable space at the top of their profile.\n 01, 2015 10:18 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:18:36.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
