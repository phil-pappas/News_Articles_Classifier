General Assembly, the newly re-elected Alexis Tsipras charged that economic reforms his nation has been called to implement resulted in a \"devastating social cost\" and deepening economic and fiscal woes.\n\"What we faced was a firm commitment of some to the idea that Greece must exit the eurozone,\" Tsipras said, decrying austerity measures and proposing to replace them with a growth agenda \"to protect the most vulnerable members of society.\"\nGreece has depended on bailout loans since 2010.\nThe prime minister also told the U.N. gathering that Greece was \"taken aback\" by \"unprecedented migration flows,\" which have brought more than 300,000 people, most of them fleeing violence in Syria, Afghanistan and Libya, to Greece's shores.\nTsipras praised his compatriots for showing \"solidarity\" with migrants and refugees and giving them food and shelter. But he also slammed racism, xenophobia and force used to repel people seeking safety.\n___\n10:45 a.m.\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he is counting on the leaders of Pacific island nations to raise their voices and build momentum for an agreement to combat climate change.\nHe expressed hope that the world's nations will finalize \"a new universal and meaningful climate change agreement\" at a conference in Paris in December which would be \"an important turning point.\" But he said it would not be \"an end point for global climate action.\"\nBan said dangers to vulnerable small islands persist, citing this year's El Nino phenomenon which has caused strong droughts and cyclones in the Pacific.\nHe told a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly ministerial meeting that he has been doing everything possible to raise the financing they need to mitigate climate change.\n___\n10:30 a.m.\nHaitian President Michel Martelly is praising his country's progress now that long-awaited legislative elections were finally held this summer.\nAddressing the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, the president called the Aug. 9 legislative elections \"an important stage in the consolidation of democracy.\"\n\"The Haitian people proved their political maturity and their capacity to take charge of their destiny,\" he added.\nThe legislative elections had been postponed for nearly four years due to a political showdown between Haiti's executive and opposition, and they have been billed as a crucial test of the country's electoral system ahead of a presidential vote in late October.\n___\n10:19 a.m.\nThe chairman of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is pledging to spare no effort to preserve the country's democracy and multi-ethnic diversity as it seeks to enter the European Union.\nThe pledge by Dragan Covic comes as Serb authorities are trying to challenge the authority of the national court over the Serb half of the country, a move the U.S. and EU say would threaten Bosnia's sovereignty and security.\nThe peace agreement that ended Bosnia's civil war two decades ago split the country into two semi-autonomous mini-states along ethnic lines, one shared by Muslims and Croats and the other for Serbs.\nCovic told the U.N. General Assembly's ministerial that Bosnia is intensively working on reforms to improve social and economic conditions and the rule of law.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:32:15.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
