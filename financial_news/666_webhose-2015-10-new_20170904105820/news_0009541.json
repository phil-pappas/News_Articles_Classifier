Among them were a passenger-vehicle purchase tax and a lowering of property down-payments for the first time in five years. \n\"Investors seem to be expecting more policy stimulus to come through this quarter,\" said Ronald Wan, chief executive at Partners Capital International in Hong Kong. \nBut he warned: \"There's some turnaround in sentiment but investors' confidence will fade easily if the economy doesn't recover as expected and increases the market's volatility.\" \nWhile Shanghai advanced, other regional markets' rallies ran out of steam. Tokyo eased 0.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.75 percent and Seoul dipped 0.10 percent. Sydney was up 0.38 percent. \nIn foreign exchange trade the dollar edged down against the Indonesian rupiah, Indian rupee and Philippine peso, while the yen and euro also advanced against the greenback. \nOil prices renewed a recent rally having been hit on Wednesday by a report showing US stockpiles and production rising. \nUS crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate added 0.82 percent while Brent North Sea crude gained 0.72 percent. \nThe contracts had surged at the start of the week as the weaker dollar made prices lower for users of foreign currencies, while hopes for easing output levels tempered worries about a global supply glut. Ongoing crises in the crude-rich Middle East also provided support. \nBut on Wednesday the US Department of Energy said output unexpectedly rose in the week to October 2, having fallen in the previous week. At the same time, inventories jumped more than forecast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:58:52.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
