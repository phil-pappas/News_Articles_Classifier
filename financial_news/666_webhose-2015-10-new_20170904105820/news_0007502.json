Dallas Kilponen Primrose Riordan A likely move by Labor not to field a candidate in the North Sydney byelection, triggered by the resignation of former Treasurer Joe Hockey, has been slammed by the Greens.\nActing NSW President Trent Zimmerman is the frontrunner in the Liberal Party preselection on Monday night, before the Greens confirm their sole candidate, former NSW MP Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, at a meeting on Wednesday. The election will be held on December 5.\n\"It is surprising and not a good sign for Labor. They should be using every opportunity to put forward an alternative to Malcolm Turnbull,\" Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon said, adding Labor should be offering electors a choice.\nWhile Labor are yet to confirm whether they will run a candidate in the tightly held Liberal seat, a senior Labor source said: \"Why spend half a million bucks on a seat you are unlikely to win\", especially when funds are needed for next year's election.\nGreens NSW campaign coordinator James Ryan said the Greens would be running a \"full and vigorous campaign\", and even though it's a byelection they think it is important to highlight the pitfalls of the Turnbull government.\nThe North Sydney seat was previously held by independent Ted Mack, and the Liberals hold it by a 16 per cent margin; it would be the first time in decades if Labor were not to run a candidate.\nIn the face of poor polling, Labor's communications spokesman Jason Clare conceded on Sunday that the shift to Turnbull had made Labor's job harder.\n\"The switch from Tony Abbott to Malcolm Turnbull makes our job harder, no doubt about it; we are the underdog.\n \"But I suspect that is because Malcolm Turnbull is different to Tony Abbott, better than Tony Abbott in many respects. He speaks in full sentences, doesn't eat raw onions. [But] he is going to make us a better opposition and in turn will make us a better government,\" Mr Clare told Sky News .\nMr Hockey, expected to be appointed ambassador to Washington, is also facing calls from independent Senator Nick Xenophon not to \"double-dip\" and draw on his parliamentary pension when he takes on the new job.\n\"What Joe Hockey can do is to refuse to accept his parliamentary pension in addition to getting $330,000 a year as ambassador.\n\"I just want to help Joe Hockey fulfil his dream of ending the age of entitlement by setting an example for the rest of us,\" he said, adding he would put forward new legislation to prevent the practice if Mr Hockey did not heed his call.\nTurnbull urged to bundle up free votes with election Meanwhile Mr Turnbull, under pressure to reveal the process for the plebiscite on same-sex marriage, has been urged to bundle up a number of issues in free votes by Mr Xenophon.\n\"Australians are smart enough to vote on more than one issue,\" Mr Xenophon said.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission has estimated that holding a separate vote or plebiscite would cost $158.4 million.\nHe said the Coalition should roll a free vote on basic poker machine reform and $1 bets into the same-sex marriage plebiscite, and suggested Mr Turnbull could include the referendum on Indigenous recognition in the next federal election.\n\"We mustn't lose momentum,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-25T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:41:01.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
