Su-Lin Tan Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Call it a parallel universe moment on the road, or railway line in this case. It was slightly disconcerting to learn that Joanna Lumley’s Trans-Siberian Adventure went to air in Britain and Australia in the middle of my own, 20‑day, trans‑Siberian journey.\nMs Lumley’s fetching fox-fur hats, dewy make-up, train-appropriate yet still dazzling wardrobe and close-ups of snow falling gently on her hair made my sojourn across the vast Siberian land mass look decidedly less desirable by comparison.\nThen again, that was the point. No matter what the British actress-celebrity and her style team would have you believe, the greatest train journey in the world, as I discovered, is in reality as unromantic as it is fascinating.\nOn my trains, which ran all day and night, stopping in more than 20 strange places at ungodly hours, there were no eager Russians waiting to tell me the story of their Gulag past. No blonde bombshells to serve vodka in a silver shot glass. Instead, I drank the famed spirit straight from the bottle, on a train really designed more for commuters than for tourists or, as one Russian called us, “crazies”.\nJockeys at the Naadam Festival can be as young as five. Su-Lin Tan Long mesmerised by the mysterious 9656-kilometre journey, for years I’ve kept cuttings of ads for the famed Golden Eagle Trans-Siberian Express trains , with their plush red interiors and seductive art deco lighting.\nDepending on which of the three “branches” or routes you choose, and how long you’ve got, the trip takes in Russia, Mongolia and China. Indeed, the world’s longest railway journey was designed to connect Moscow and European Russia with the Russian Far East provinces, Mongolia, China and the Sea of Japan.\nThis year I took the plunge. After spending weeks organising the trip by email, and dumping more than $600 in visa fees, I found myself standing on a platform at the Beijing Railway Station one steaming hot morning in July. I left Beijing on the Trans-Mongolian, which would later meet up with the main Trans-Siberian artery from Vladivostok, in Irkutsk. Travelling from Vladivostok to Moscow would have been the more classic route. But I was happy to abandon tradition in exchange for Mongolia’s Gobi Desert.\nIndoctrinated by all those advertisements, I’d quietly hoped to be greeted on board with a cocktail topped with red cherries. Rather, I was confronted by eight-berth, third-class compartments in a train carriage with no airconditioning as the mercury raced past 35 degrees. Luckily, I’d paid for a second-class ticket, which meant four fewer bodies to compete with for the tiny, pre-1947 window perch. My carriage, No. 7, looked like it had been salvaged from a civil war.\nThe tracks go forever on on a trans-Siberian adventure. Su-Lin Tan The carriages were joined by pieces of twisted steel, which, despite appearances, worked a treat. Carriages can be owned by Russia, Mongolia or China. The locals said it was the luck of the draw which train you got, but word had it the Russian ones were best.\nAt 11.22am, my Chinese train creaked its way out of Beijing to begin the long trek across a land I’d never seen, nor knew anything about. I felt a brief flutter of nerves, but had the reassurance of my travelling partners. We’d all paid about $5000 each for this small group tour, organised through Sundowners Overland . This included accommodation, local guides, transportation and certain meals. I would gladly have travelled alone, but I didn’t have the luxury of time to get lost.\nOur first bonding experience was in learning to dodge the infamously angry provodnitsas, the cranky train attendants whose customer service skills border on sub‑zero. Then there were the other train staples: the stench of old carpet and hot-pot instant noodles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I never understood why the provodnitsas were so angry but sensed it had something to do with travelling for seven days straight, then back again.\nThe first couple of days began to feel like the start of a rather un-luxurious slog. But in the end, I at least understood why I was here. It was the complete absence of those holiday aspirationals – the poolside bar, the private butler and fancy in-house day spa – that first attracted me to, and held my interest throughout, my Trans-Siberian experience.\nA canal in St Petersburg, looking towards the Cathedral of Spilled Blood. Su-Lin Tan Rather than exercising in a flash gym, to keep my legs from cramping I walked the carriages daily in search of a Russian prepared to trade their broken English for my broken Russian and a story. To keep cool, I stuck my head out of the train windows. I met new, equally flustered friends, leaning out of neighbouring windows.\nTo keep hunger pangs at bay, I ate just about anything on the menu. (The salyanka, a Georgian beef stew, was a welcome antidote to train fatigue.) There was even a strange Russian-Chinese midnight feast in compartment 2 at Novosibirsk, in the middle of Russia. We gobbled up cured fish in bean sauce and dried jerky-like chicken kidney with rice. Two Chinese sisters had rung their Russian relatives for a home‑cooked meal ahead of their arrival at the Novosibirsk platform.\nAfter a grinning Russian-Chinese man handed four food containers to the ladies on the train, I was invited to crouch over the beds, lit only by a torch, picking out fish bones with chopsticks as the rest of the eight‑person compartment snored on, oblivious to the pungent scent of Chinese stir-fry.\nThe Trans-Siberian was also mostly about staring out of the window for hours on end, watching the taiga - the vast coniferous forests that make up the world’s largest terrestrial habitat - fly past. But in truth, it was less about those lovely winter wonderland images and more the smell of diesel and meat dumplings.\nDespite the lack of creature comforts, I wouldn’t have had it any other way. No amount of room service could compare with the friendships I forged with the teenage Russian dog trainer, Yana, and her Russian toy terriers, Chika and Rita; or spying on the Russian army travelling to a secret location just outside Moscow for training. Not to mention the single mum, Oksana, who, despite not speaking a word of English, managed to convey how she had left her philandering husband. Here are more highlights from my favourite pit stops:\nChanging of the tracks At the China-Mongolia border, about nine hours after leaving Beijing, my train arrived at Erlian, the border town for passport control, at 9.30pm. It was then shunted into a poorly lit, post-communist, rusty shed and split in two while we passengers remained on board.\nThen, like ants, hundreds of train workers raised the train and started changing the bogies – the axles and wheels – because of the break of gauge between China and Mongolia. Three hours of clanking later, we made it out of China.\nWindswept horse trainer Mongolia in July is all about the traditional Naadam Festival, the annual celebration of “the three games of men” – wrestling, archery and horse racing.\nWomen now compete in the latter two events, but what makes the horse racing really stand out is that the cross-country courses range from 15 to 30 kilometres and the horses are ridden by jockeys aged from five to 13.\nI got off the train in Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar, for nine days to sample the world-famous festival, which I can best describe as part Anzac Day, part Olympics and part Sydney Royal Easter Show. And I’m embarrassed to say I arrived in Ulaanbaatar with a poor misconception. While it’s the most remote capital city in the world, it’s far from backward.\nAs I discovered, it’s remarkably cosmopolitan, with an around-the-clock drinking scene, pubs and jazz bars.\nOn day three of the festival, I met 40-year‑old horse-trainer Atgorgerel at the racing fields of Khui Doloon Hudag, two hours’ drive from Ulaanbaatar.\nI trekked across the fields in a sandstorm to interview Atgorgerel, who told me of his high hopes that his little five-year-old jockey and two-year-old horse might win the prestigious race.\n“It’s really difficult to train a horse,” he explained later in his ger (nomadic tent), as he sipped fermented horse milk from a bowl. “It’s really hard to choose the right breed and rider. If I win, I get good recognition and money for my province.”\nThe race was over 22 kilometres and, at this track, there were no frocks or fascinators in sight. Atgorgerel is from the middle Gobi Desert region and has been training horses and riders for 21 years.\nHis horse didn’t win. But it was still a good day because he’d done his tribe proud. Simply to race a horse at Naadam is a great honour.\nSyringe-filled Naushki There is nothing in Naushki, the border town between Russia and Mongolia. Nothing!\nMy first sights were broken windows and a park filled with syringes – images symptomatic of the dead border towns we passed through.\nAs I walked around, I discovered there were also two milk bars with prison-like gates for doors. When an old Soviet car came hooning down the road just missing us train‑numbed passengers, I decided to be just a little bit afraid.\nNaushki was a sobering reminder that Russia is not all Kremlin, cathedrals and tsars. It’s also about plenty of poverty and struggle.\nThat said, after a smile and a bit of sign language, Naushki managed to provide me with an ice-cream, cold beer and a cool train lounge to sit in, which was far more than I could expect in my train carriage, now nudging 38 degrees.\nBaikal’s not just for fishing After Mongolia, the train curved around Ulan‑Ude, the Buddhist capital of Russia’s Buryatia Republic, as I slept and then past Lake Baikal and onto Irkutsk.\nBaikal, the magnificent lake and Russia’s French Riviera, beckoned. “When fishermen talk about going to Baikal, they say they are going to sea,” my guide, Daymen Bodeev, said. “They call it Father Baikal.”\nAnd it is like a sea, an ocean even.\nScientists at the Baikal Limnological Museum say the lake could become the earth’s newest ocean one day and split Asia and Europe in two. I believe them.\nThe waveless, murky Baikal seems to have no horizon. It’s 1.5 kilometres deep – and deepening more every day as the earth’s crust moves. While there are no Loch Ness monsters, it’s home to some of the most mysterious water creatures in the world, including the rare freshwater seal, the nerpa.\nThe seductive scent of smoked fish surrounded us as fishermens’ wives cooked on Baikal’s banks.\nAll my life, I’d wanted to see the deepest freshwater lake in the world and I was not disappointed.\nI had to swim. At midday on July 18, I put on my cossie and headed in, watched by my stunned travel mates. Two dips and four minutes later, I was baptised. Lucky for me it was summer – the water was a “warm” 14 degrees, or so the locals said.\nEkaterinburg – East & West On the third day of the four-day, longest non‑stop stretch on board the Trans-Siberian, I lost Asia. It just disappeared.\nIn its place loomed Europe. The first city to mark a new continent flowing under our silver wheels was Ekaterinburg, the meeting point of Asia and Europe. We arrived at 10.30pm on July 22 for a 62-minute stop. Already train-crazy by this time, I dashed into town for a decent hot meal, uncharacteristically at McDonald’s. It was the fastest, closest thing to the train, and I had never in my life been happier to see something so dreadfully modern.\nA quick cheeseburger with my friend Michael from Belgium – and a photograph of the sign “Between Asia and Europe” – and we raced back to the platform just as the provodnitsa hurled a string of sweet abuse at us and the train readied to pull out.\nPS: Spectacular Moscow After the train trip, I headed to St Petersburg. It’s so easy to like; it’s beautiful. It has all the right things – sexy canals, jaw-dropping cathedrals, alluring art, contemporary basement culture and a youthful, playful nightlife. But it was Moscow that proved to be my heart-stopper.\nMoscow may be Russia’s steely political nerve centre, but it’s also seductive and enticing. In the dark, it enraptured with a night at the Bolshoi Theatre. The cobblestoned Red Square basks proudly in its history, Lenin still close in his grave nearby. It has the pomp and circumstance of the bygone royalty, with their gaudy gold, red velvet and diamonds.\nIt’s also home to muscleman Vladimir Putin, the unlikeable Russian leader who has alternated as president and prime minister since 2000.\nThat downer aside, Moscow effortlessly played Disney’s Elsa to St Petersburg’s Anna.\nI was smitten.\nAll aboard Listen to... Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff. It was the only time their works had made complete sense to me.\nDon't...

A Lonely Planet guide or similar is handy for the history and geography. Skirts are useful because of the heat. You'll need battery packs given there are few recharging points on the train. Ruthlessly halve your luggage before leaving home, but pack a bottle opener for all the grog you may need.\nTip Russian souvenirs are best bought in Moscow and St Petersburg.
