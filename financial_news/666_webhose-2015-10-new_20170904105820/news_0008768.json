Christopher Pearce Noting such exemptions are available only to two dozen venture capital funds (including Reinventure) using special structures, he said: \"I think there is a very strong case to . . . extend that general concept of capital-gains-tax-free investing to the start-up sector generally, regardless of the identity of the investor.\"\nMr Coleman also said the government is thinking about ways \"where it could potentially be made easier for people with entrepreneurial skills to come in to Australia . . . to help seed [the start-up] environment\". This could include making visa application processes less stringent and the 457 visa system more flexible.\nSimon Cant, a co-founder of Reinventure Group, which was seeded with $50 million by Westpac Banking Corp last year and has taken equity stakes in six start-ups, said it is important that tax policy is designed to ensure investors receiving CGT exemptions are committed to supporting growth-oriented start-ups for the long term.\nLure for entrepreneurs He also suggested the government go even further on tax settings by adopting policy from the United Kingdom, which provides up-front deductions for investors in growth companies. Capital gains tax settings could also be used to lure more entrepreneurs to start businesses in Australia by making equity provided to founders CGT free.\nJonathan Davey, who runs NAB Labs, an innovation unit established by National Australia Bank this year, said the outcome for the government is to \"create an environment in Australia that supports entrepreneurs, drives the right skills and allows us to create businesses that can help transform the Australian economy. In my mind, tax reform and educational reform are two of the key levers that will help facilitate that.\"\nBankers of the future will need skills in \"design thinking\" and psychology, he said. \"It is very important we encourage people with those sorts of skills so they have empathy with the customer side, and [innovation] is not purely taken from a technology perspective.\"\nMr Cant suggested an HECS-style model could be used to lend funds to workers wanting to retrain in design and technology development, skills which remain highly sought-after. \"We can talk about STEM in high school and primary school, but actually the need is now,\" he said. \"And if we are going to address that need now, then retraining the existing workforce . . . [and] extending HECS or some other model to those sorts of people would be a huge value add\".\nMr Coleman said such ideas have merit \"and are precisely the sort of things the government will consider as part of the innovation package. Certainly the need to increase the technical skills base of the nation is very much on the agenda.\"\nThe head of Commonwealth Bank of Australia's business bank, Adam Bennett, applauded the government for looking at innovation broadly. \"It is not something you are going to solve just through a single policy. I think you need to look through a number of different lenses, and if we can crack that concept, we will be able to facilitate the outcomes government and industry are trying to achieve.\"\nMr Cant said while governments are generally reluctant to pick winners, fintech requires focus, given the speed the UK and Asian jurisdictions are moving at. \"We think it is really important to say there is an opportunity to be won or lost now around being the number one fintech centre in Asia. Having a laser-sharp focus on the aspect of the value we want to win is critical.\"\n\"We need to win the fintech opportunity. There is a risk our innovation efforts become diluted across all sorts of industries, because there are many people with their hand out looking for something. I think, as far as possible, if we can keep it focused, that will be a win for the country.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:53.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
