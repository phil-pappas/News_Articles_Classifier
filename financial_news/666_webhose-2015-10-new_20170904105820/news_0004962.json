AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe A weak American employment report on Friday prompted economists to defer their expectations for a US interest rate rise, possibly until next year, and sparked a bumpy ride for stocks on Wall Street at the end of the trading week.\nThe US economy added a below-par 142,000 jobs in September and job gains in the earlier two months were a combined 59,000 lower than previously reported.\nConcerns are rising that the US economy is showing signs of suffering from the headwinds emanating from a slowing China and a soaring US dollar that is hurting manufacturing and exports. The US Federal Reserve pointed out these developments last month when it decided to keep rates anchored near zero.\n\"Today's report lowers the odds of a Fed rate hike in December, but does not take it off the table,\" Bank of American Merrill Lynch US economist Michelle Meyer said in a note to clients.\nCapital Economics said the Fed was now unlikely to raise rates until next year and ruled out the central bank lifting rates for the first time in almost a decade at its October board meeting.\nAs investors rushed into the safety of government bonds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell below 2 per cent. The Fed-funds futures market cut the chances of a December rate increase to 34 per cent, from 44 per cent before the labour data, according to CME Group.\nA sell-off in risk assets caused the Australian dollar to initially fall to just above US70¢ before recovering to US70.50¢ around 6.30am AEST on Saturday. The greenback ended the day weaker against most currencies.\nThe S&P 500 initially sank 1.6 per cent following the disappointing US Labour Department report, before rebounding in afternoon trade. Investors attributed the swing in stocks to a possible deferral in rate hikes, a fall in the US dollar and related rise in commodity prices, including oil and metals.\n On the final day of the trading week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 200.36 points or 1.23 per cent to 16,472.37, the S&P 500 lifted 27.54 points or 1.43 per cent to 1951.36 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 80.69 points or 1.74 per cent to 4707.77.\nIn European trading, the UK's FTSE 100 jumped 0.95 per cent to 6129.98, Germany's DAX rose 0.46 per cent to 9553.07 and France's CAC 40 gained 0.73 per cent to 4458.88.\nAlthough the US unemployment rate held steady at a relatively low 5.1 per cent, wages were flat and the job gains fell short of the 201,000 tipped by market economists.\n\"The September employment report was significantly weaker than expected, with slower payroll growth, downward revisions to prior months and flat wages,\" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said. \"We now see a Fed rate hike in December as a close call.\"\nThe modest job growth last month has some analysts concerned the economy is cooling after growing a robust 3.9 per cent annual pace in the June quarter.\nFigures published in the past week showed US factory orders declined more than expected in August and the manufacturing index declined in September.\nBoth were seen as signs the international economic slowdown led by China and strong greenback are starting to bite the US economy.\nHowever, some analysts were less concerned about the disappointing September labour report, pointing out it was only one month of data.\n\"While today's employment report was disappointing relative to market expectations, it doesn't change our view that the US expansion remains resilient and on firm footing driven by private sector domestic final demand in consumer spending and housing,\" Macquarie Capital Markets analyst David Doyle said.\nIn Asia on Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 3.17 per cent to 21,506.09 and the Nikkei 225 Index in Japan ended flat, eking out a mere 0.02 per cent rise to 17,725.13.\nIn Sydney, the broader All Ordinaries finished 1.1 per cent lower on the day but up 0.2 per cent for the week to close at 5089.2.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-03T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:08:40.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
