TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate MATTEL INC (MAT) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its reasonable valuation levels, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and weak operating cash flow.\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe gross profit margin for MATTEL INC is rather high; currently it is at 53.72%. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of -1.14% trails the industry average. MAT, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 1.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 7.0%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Leisure Equipment & Products industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 140.1% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $28.33 million to -$11.35 million. Net operating cash flow has decreased to -$187.66 million or 34.29% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower.
