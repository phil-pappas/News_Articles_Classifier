Projects that present the greatest likelihood of economic impact in the region will be given priority. \nThe state legislature appropriated $2 million and the Shaping Our Appalachian Region Executive Board approved funding criteria and an official application process on Oct. 5. \n\"We're excited to see what our communities are doing to impact important community challenges like job growth and leadership training,\" said Jared Arnett, executive director of Shaping Our Appalachian Region. \"Successful local initiatives can be replicated, and KARD grants are a good chance for the region to see what's working.\" \nSOAR was established in 2013 by Gov. Steve Beshear and Congressman Hal Rogers to address the significant challenges confronting Appalachian Kentucky. \nKARD will be administered through the Department for Local Government. The first round of applications is due Dec. 18. \nInformation from: The Independent, http://www.dailyindependent.com \nThink your friends should see this?
