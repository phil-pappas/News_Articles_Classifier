Ebit, excluding about $1.5bn in legal costs, mostly related to the small-car ignition-switch recall, totalled $3.1bn.\nGM’s profit rebounded from a year earlier as US buyers continue their love affair with trucks and the nation’s largest car maker overcame a tough car market in China by boosting sales of more expensive sport utility vehicles.\nNorth American earnings before interest and taxes were a record $3.3bn.\n\"These results reflect on our work to capitalise on our strengths in the US and China,\" CEO Mary Barra said in a statement. \"GM is a vastly different company today than it was five years ago.\"\nThe company’s equity income from the China joint venture slipped to $467m. Vehicle sales have struggled in the market, with GM’s sales falling 4.2% in the quarter. GM is keeping profit afloat with crossovers like the Chevrolet Trax and Buick Envision, representing more than 17% of sales by GM and its joint ventures in September, up from 6% a year ago.\nIn the quarter, GM took a charge of $1.5bn related to its ignition switch recall, with $900m going to a settlement with the US Department of Justice and the rest to settle lawsuits related to death and injury cases.\nIn Europe and South America, where GM has struggled to make a profit, the company continues to lose money. The European business cut its losses nearly in half from a year ago to $231m, while GM lost $217m in South America. In the same quarter last year, GM lost $32m in South America.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:57:26.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
