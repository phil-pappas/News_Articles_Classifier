However, the state is required, even without a budget, to put aside money each month for pensions and debt service on bonds.\nIllinois' debt service payments on bonds total $3.4 billion in fiscal 2016, while payments to its five retirement systems total $6.8 billion, according to a May budget analysis by the Chicago-based Civic Federation. A monthly breakdown of those amounts was not immediately available from Munger's office.\nIllinois has also been ordered by courts to pay its workers and comply with federal consent decrees to fund health care and other services based on fiscal 2015 funding levels. But fiscal 2016 revenue is projected to fall by nearly 18 percent from fiscal 2015 due mainly to the rollback of temporary higher income tax rates on Jan. 1\n\"We are doing everything within our ability to make sure the government runs and meets its obligations without having a budget,\" Rauner said at an unrelated press conference on Tuesday.\nHe declined to say which payments should be shorted in a cash-flow crunch.\n\"One thing I wouldn't do is discuss that with you now,\" the governor said.\nSteve Brown, spokesman for Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, said the sole responsibility for the state's cash flow problems rests with Rauner, who vetoed all but the school funding budget passed by the legislature.\n\"That's why we've been saying since May the number one issue was the budget,\" Brown said.\n(Reporting by Karen Pierog ; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:15:07.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
