David Rogers by Neil Chenoweth The simple defence to Labor's attacks on the Prime Minister's investment in Cayman Island hedge funds is that it's legal, and everybody does it.\nChipping Malcolm Turnbull for investing in a few hedge funds is fairly anodyne – back in 2003 he founded a hedge fund that operated in the Caymans, without remark.\nBut in tax havens, it's location, location, location. These latest hedge funds are based in Ugland House, a five-storey harbour-front office in George Town that US Democrats and Australian Labor politicians love to hate.\nIt houses the biggest law firm in the Caymans, Maples and Calder, which operates more than 18,500 shell companies – a swathe of corporate life that traverses the good, the bad, and mostly the mundane.\nThere's a personal link for Opposition Leader Bill Shorten. One of the hot potatoes that he inherited when he was appointed Assistant Treasurer in 2010 was the TPG-Myer controversy.\nIn November 2009, US private equity group TPG shipped offshore its $1.5 billion profit from the Myer float, just ahead of a freezing order by the Australian Tax Office.\nThe money was moved through four countries before it ended up on Grand Cayman – with a TPG company at Ugland House.\nThe ATO's actions sparked a strong response. The investing community complained the ATO misunderstood the way hedge funds operate.\n Hedge funds are pooled investments from around the world that require different tax treatment for different investors. The solution hedge funds offer to this problem is a \"neutral tax environment\" (by which they generally mean a nil-tax environment), with investors left to pay tax in their home countries – as Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull do.\nIt's routine. Thousands of international investors use hedge funds in tax havens. It's an industry. The disputes are just around the edges.\nA brief financial stopover Investing in the Caymans is a little like flying to Europe with a Singapore stopover – nothing much happens on the overnight stop, it's where you came from and where you are going to that matters.\nMost of the tax has been sidestepped before the money gets to Grand Cayman, and the real question is whether investors pay tax on the returns paid out to them, after the money leaves the Caymans.\nIn 2010 the Future Fund invested €350 million ($547 million) into a Caymans fund run by Towerbrook Capital Partners to buy up distressed debt in Europe.\nTowerbrook obtained a secret tax agreement with Luxembourg that allowed a Total Swap Return, which meant that any profits made in Europe would be repatriated tax-free to a Caymans company (located a few blocks behind Ugland House, in Elgin Avenue), in return for a flat annual payment to Luxembourg of about $470,000.\nGoodman Group, AMP Capital, Lend Lease, Macquarie Group and others had different deals in Luxembourg, using other tax havens, which had a similar outcome to the Future Fund deal. Profits arrived in the tax haven largely untaxed.\nWith TPG it worked the same way – TPG banked a $1.5 billion Australian profit from the Myer float and sent it to the Caymans untaxed.\nAll of this is fine because the payouts from the Cayman Island investment funds are taxed back in the investors' home country. Or they should be.\nBut the ATO doubts that – on the one hand, it points to US investors keeping money offshore indefinitely, while at the same time it suspects Australian investors of doing the same thing.\nIn the wash-up of the TPG affair, it proposed that hedge funds should identify who their investors were, to ensure some tax was paid somewhere.\nIt's a work in progress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:58:16.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
