The plan provides comparatively higher percentage of the sum assured (SA) as a money back benefit at specified intervals for a longer policy term. The product offers guaranteed money back of up to 150% of the SA, depending on the policy term chosen. For example, policy term of 28 years has 30% of SA at the end of 7th, 14th and 21st policy year and 60% of the SA as maturity benefit along with vested bonus (if any) and terminal bonus (if any). But if you choose 16-year policy term, the product will pay 105% of the SA. It will pay 15% of the SA in 4th, 8th and 12th year along with 60% of the SA as maturity benefit along with non-guaranteed vested and terminal bonuses.   Getting returns of more than the SA does not mean high product returns. If the premium is high with respect to the SA, getting 150% of SA does not mean much. Moreover, it is for long policy term of 28 years wherein 150% of the SA will not mean much due to inflation and time value of money.   The product comes with four policy terms of 16, 20, 24 and 28 years. Premium payment term (PPT) for each option is policy term minus five years. Traditional policies are opaque and still give better commission to intermediaries than ULIPs. It is not surprising that agents keep pushing traditional policies, even when the average returns can be 4%-5% per annum. Bajaj Allianz’s Cash Assure has non-guaranteed bonuses which, along with terminal bonus (if any), will be paid as maturity benefit. The returns will not be known in advance.   It is always better to buy a term plan for insurance needs and invest in mutual funds, PPF, tax-free bonds and bank fixed deposits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:49:27.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
