Sylvia Liber by Matthew Stevens If BlueScope chief executive Paul O'Malley wasn't humming Lou Reed's Perfect Day as he jogged his way across the Sydney Harbour Bridge at dawn on Monday, then there is seriously something wrong with him.\nAfter all, the day ahead was going to open with public announcement of a material profit upgrade, a $US720 million acquisition of the other half of BlueScope's best asset and with news that his board had been convinced to stick with steelmaking at Port Kembla.\nO'Malley has run BlueScope for eight years. He can never have had a more satisfying day in the job.\nExactly two months before his Perfect Day O'Malley had gone to the market with a vulnerable set of profit numbers and confirmation that BlueScope management needed to secure \"game changing\" cost reductions at the Port Kembla steelworks or his board would shut the last of the Illawarra's steel furnaces.\nO'Malley called on the steel unions and on government's state and federal to help management extract $200 million from the steelmaking bits of BlueScope's business and gave everyone a deadline of the company's November annual general meeting to get fully on board or 5000 jobs at Kembla would go.\nThe managers of Australian steel have made a long habit of Chicken Little runs through Canberra and the capital cities of steel. O'Malley's clarion could all too easily have been ignored. It was not. Over eight weeks the unions, Kembla workers and now the NSW government has agreed to carry some short-term pain in the name of longer term protection of BlueScope's legacy steel business.\nThe unions and the Kembla work force has surrendered 500 jobs and accepted a three year wage freeze along with more permanent changes to the way they work that includes a recovery of management oversight over the operations of the business that could not have been imagined possible when O'Malley went to the market with his binary proposition, reform or die.\nBlueScope and the unions valued the concessions at about $60 million annually. But there is now every reason to imagine that this new alignment of economic interests will generate a good deal more value than that and so much faster than had been anticipated.\n A symphony of positives O'Malley introduced Monday's symphony of positives with news that BlueScope's FY16 results would be 40 per cent, or $50 million, stronger than flagged just two months back. He said 60 per cent of that changed outlook was the direct result of savings initiatives and their speedier than expected effect on the bottom line. The balance of the up-grade is driven by a lower Australian dollar and stronger than expected demand for various streams of building quality steel.\nWith that O'Malley was able to confirm that the state government had agreed to defer an estimated $60 million of payroll tax payments over the coming three years. Given government tax indulgence stood the keystone in the arch of concessions that O'Malley needed to sustain steelmaking at Kembla, he was then able to confirm survival.\nThe deal shaped with the government stands typical of everything achieved over the past eight weeks. What looks to have happened very quickly indeed is, in fact, the product of a crisis productively anticipated by BlueScope management and one that they were determined would not be wasted.\nThe bloke who runs BlueScope's Australian business is Mark Vassella. He along with a group of advisors that includes Port Jackson Partners, have been working for more than a year on a plan to first protect and then enhance BlueScope's Kembla operations.\nInterestingly, we understand that the Vassella Plan has a target for cost savings that is well north of the $200 million that has been stated publicly by O'Malley. Mind you, O'Malley is not fibbing, he is just being quite specific. He talks always of savings at the steelmaking business. But that is only about 70 per cent of the Kembla business and it represents only about 60 per cent of the controllable cost base.\nFrom what we hear the real target here is annual cost savings of about $300 million and that BlueScope management is increasingly confident that it can do better than that. Given the current external business settings remain the same (exchange rate, steel pricing and economic settings) then there is every chance that BlueScope could do better than just return Kembla to a point that sees it cash neutral through the bottom of the cycle.\nTricky things Convincing the state to relieve BlueScope of about $20 million a year in payroll tax obligations stood a final hurdle to the Vassella Plan. Obviously, asking government to surrender income is always a tricky thing and payroll, which generates $8 billion annually for the state exchequer, is a particularly sensitive lever to pull on.\nThe risk for government was that precedent would be established and it would be besieged by sob-stories and rent seekers wanting to match BlueScope's terms. That risk remains. But the hurdles set by the structure of the deal are higher and more open to ministerial judgement.\nThe final deal will see the government gets its money but BlueScope relieved of its immediate tax obligation. The payroll tax bill will be deferred for three years leaving $60 million in the BlueScope cash kitty. BlueScope's payroll tax obligation will normalise in 2020 and it will pay down its deferred payments in very digestible chunks over the decade beyond.\nThere paradox in confirmation that Kembla's furnace has a future because, back in August, O'Malley ran the real risk that a successful rescue mission would bring material pain in the form of equity market punishment.\nThere remains a pocket of investor wealth that holds BlueScope would be better off in the short and medium term if it made the hardest call of all and ended steel production at Port Kembla.\nThe logic is socially cruel but numerically compelling. While the $500 million cost of closure would be high and the effect of the Illawarra community even more heavy and lingering, the impact on BlueScope earnings would be profound and immediate. The EBITDA gain from fully importing steel feedstock rather than self-sourcing has been put variously at between $300 million to $450 million.\nInstead of a spanking, the market mood was set by progress already secured and new potential made obvious. BlueScope earned itself a positive re-rating, closing just under10 per cent higher at 4.475 a share.\nKeen price Critical to that shift in mood was a deal that will see BlueScope acquire the other 50 per cent of a US steel mill that it currently shares with US commodities giant Cargill. BlueScope will pay $US720 million ($990 million) for 50 per cent of a hot rolled coil operator called North Star. The price is keen, the result will be immediate earnings accretion and the whole thing is only affordable because Kembla is going to stay open.\nA decision to close Kembla would have left the BlueScope balance sheet carrying at least $500 million in closure and remediation costs. O'Malley could do one thing or the other. He could stop making steel or activate the pre-emptive rights that allowed him to match a final offer for North Star. He could not afford to do both.\nOn Monday described his final outcome as \"the perfect outcome in many ways\".\n\"It is the right social decision, it is the right decision economically for us and for Australia and it is a decision that leaves us free to take up our options elsewhere,\" he said.\nThe first of those options is, obviously, moving to 100 per cent of North Star. But the fact that a future sale of a strategic interest in that same business has been added to the list of options aimed at easing the debt load assumed to make that deal in the first place offers insight of an important and shaping shift in thinking at BlueScope.\nBlueScope has long seen itself as a steelmaker that added to its channels to market by painting and coating some of that raw output. But the steel worm has turned.\nBlueScope's future will be described by coatings and colour businesses that now reach from Australian to China via South East Asia and India and by a building products operation that boasts unique strengths in North America and China.\nRaw steel has become a means to an end. BlueScope will self-source where it makes sense. But it is just as content to acquire someone else's steel to paint or reshape. The idea that North Star is a tradeable asset affirms this new approach. Making raw steel is no longer essential to life at BlueScope and that means the gains made at Kembla will need to be captured and amplified or this is a sentence delayed rather that one commuted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:02:59.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
