Zinc prices have fallen 30 percent since May to five-year lows. \n\"Glencore believes that current prices do not correctly value the scarcity of our zinc resources,\" the company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. \nThe cuts will reduce the company's fourth quarter production by 100,000 tonnes. It had previously expected to produce between 1.52 million tonnes and 1.57 million tonnes of zinc this year. \n\"Glencore remains positive about the medium and long term outlook for zinc, lead and silver, however we are taking a proactive approach to manage our production in response to current prices,\" it said. \nA Glencore spokesman in Australia declined to say how much the output cut would save in working capital or pay, nor how long it expected the cuts to last. \n(Reporting by Melanie Burton and Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:02:08.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
