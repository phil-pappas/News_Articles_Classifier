Axtel will remain traded on Mexico's stock exchange, the two firms said in a joint statement.\nThe statement did not include financial terms for the deal.\nTogether, Alestra and Axtel will have a fixed-line market share of less than 6 percent, according to regulator statistics, a tenth of the dominant player Slim's America Movil.\nThomson Reuters data shows Axtel has a market capitalization of $590 million and debt of some $544 million, according to its most recent results.\nAlestra reported sales of $97 million for the second quarter of this year, while Axtel had revenue of some $150 million.\nThe new firm is expected to have sales in the order of 14 billion pesos to 14.5 billion pesos ($828.4 million to $858 million) a year, Alfa's development director Alejandro Elizondo told Reuters, adding that he expected the companies to be fully integrated within two years.\nAn Axtel spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe merger follows a sweeping reform to Mexico's telecoms sector to spur competition and curb the power of multi-billionaire Slim, whose America Movil has some 70 percent of Mexico's mobile market and over 60 percent of fixed business.\nThe telecoms reform has raised pressure on smaller players to merge, and the Axtel purchase follows the acquisition by U.S. giant AT&T Inc of Mexico's third- and fourth-largest carriers Iusacell and Nextel over the past year.\nAlfa's Chairman Alvaro Fernandez Garza and Axtel's Chairman Tomas Milmo Santos will be co-presidents of the combined firm and will make decisions by mutual agreement. Alestra chairman and CEO Rolando Zubiran Shetler will be named chief executive of the combined entity once the transaction is completed.\nThe merger, which is still subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close at the end of this year or the beginning of 2016.
