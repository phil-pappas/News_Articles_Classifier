The victims and the suspects were attending a birthday lunch in a private room at the restaurant when the shooting occurred, he said.\n—Copyright Associated Press 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:16:03.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
