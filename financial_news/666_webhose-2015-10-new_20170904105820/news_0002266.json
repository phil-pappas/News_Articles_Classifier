This could ultimately affect developing nations' currencies, exports, and even employment levels. \nCBK froze its lending rate at 11.5 per cent last month thanks in part to a decision by the US Federal Reserve not to increase its interest rates which relieved the pressures on the shilling and other currencies in emerging markets. \nThe Lima meeting will also explore the links between inequality and poverty, and the practical measures that can be taken by nations to address the same as many emerging markets set their sights on transitioning into higher income economies. \nThe gatherings will also provide a forum for civil society, the private sector, academics and others to engage in discussions on economic issues. \nWorld Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim and IMF Managing Mirector Ms Christine Largade will make key notes addresses during the meetings. Kenya \nNairobi has named a road next to State House after Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
