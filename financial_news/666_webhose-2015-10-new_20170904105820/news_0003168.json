The Murdoch family controls News and 21st Century Fox, with 39.4 per cent of the B shares of the two companies. Simon O'Dwyer Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth The Murdoch family came within $US13.5 million ($18.6 million) of losing a cliffhanger vote over the control of News Corporation at the annual meeting in Los Angeles last week.\nA thin majority voted to retain the share structure that maintains Rupert Murdoch's 62-year control of News, after a change of date restricted a group of new shareholders from voting. The outcome might signal that News and the much larger 21st Century Fox are in play, at least in the medium term.\nMr Murdoch is determined that his iron grip over News Corp, which owns the Wall Street Journal , the Sun and The Times in Britain and half of Foxtel and REA Group in Australia, and 21st Fox, which has movie, cable and satellite broadcasting, will be passed to his children.\nWhile last week's shareholders' motion to abolish the voting structure was non-binding for directors, investors are paying a premium now for News Corp B shares, which have voting rights, over the non-voting A shares.\nOvernight in New York, News Corp B shares closed 1.2 per cent higher than A stock, a reverse of a long-term trend that has featured the A shares trading up to 5 per cent higher than B shares.\nWhile the margin is small, the switch to preferring the less-liquid B shares reflects a change in sentiment by institutional investors that has affected News and 21st Fox since August 21, which coincided with Mr Murdoch's visit to Australia.\nMeeting a month earlier News Corp held its annual meeting a month earlier in 2015, and announced that only shareholders at August 17 could vote in last week's annual meeting .\n Historically News Corp and 21st Fox have set the date of record for proxyholders at September 15 or later.\nPerhaps unwittingly, pushing the date of record back to August meant none of the shares bought since the new preference for B shares began on August 21 could be voted by the new shareholders.\nThe shareholders' vote and the realignment of the stock prices present a significant challenge for the 84-year-old's plan to switch control of both companies, together worth $US67 billion, to his two sons, James and Lachlan.\nThe 21st Century Fox share price is down 10 per cent since the company announced in June that James and Lachlan had been promoted over the head of chief executive Chase Carey, and down 25 per cent since December 2014, raising questions whether there is a Murdoch discount affecting the share price.\nA spokeswoman for News Corporation in New York declined to answer questions directly, instead referring to a statement by independent director Jose Maria Aznar, head of the board's nominating and governance committee, at last week's meeting.\nBest economic interests Mr Aznar said the board supported the voting structure solely because it was in the best economic interests of shareholders by offering stable management.\n\"The issue of control is not a factor in the board's consideration,\" he said.\nIn last week's proxy vote the voting rights proposal gathered 49.5 per cent support and failed by just 896,491 shares.\nThat margin of shares, worth $US13.5 million, had determined control of a company valued at $US8.5 billion.\nMr Aznar's statement indicates the board remains rock solid behind the Murdochs and is likely to have ignored the vote.\nHowever, US case law underlines the perils of ignoring the wishes and interests of shareholders.\nThe Murdochs control News Corp and 21st Century Fox through their 39.4 per cent ownership of the B shares of each of the two companies.\nWell short of control If A shares also had voting rights, as the shareholders' motion proposed, the Murdochs' voting stake would drop to 13.5 per cent of News and 15.9 per cent of 21st Century Fox – well short of control.\nOnly 5.5 per cent of non-family shareholders supported retaining the voting structure.\nDirectors would have to argue that they were not favouring a minority by opposing the wishes of more than 80 per cent of stockholders and more than 50 per cent of voting shareholders to retain management control by the younger Murdochs.\nThe higher liquidity for A shares and the share buyback scheme that targets the non-voting stock ensured they traded 2 to 4 per cent above the B shares for most of 2015.\nThe value of B stock has varied with market sentiment over Mr Murdoch's control. In 2011, when many expected him to step down over the British hacking scandal, B shares traded up to 7 per cent higher than A shares. But after the decision to split News Corp from 21st Century Fox, A shares traded up to 5 per cent above the B stock.\nNews Corp B shares closed in Australia on Thursday, August 20 at $20.68, 43¢, or 2.1 per cent, below the A shares. On the Friday they closed 9¢ above the A shares.\nThe News and 21st Century Fox B shares moved by similar amounts in Nasdaq trading on Monday, August 24. The B shares have remained fairly stable at a small premium to the non-voting A shares ever since.\nIn Australia Mr Murdoch had been in Australia since August 16, with most of the headlines focused on Foxtel's loss of the National Rugby League broadcasting rights.\nInvestors who have paid a premium for voting shares since August 21 are unlikely to have supported maintaining the voting structure, but were excluded from voting at last week's meeting by the August 17 date of record for proxy-holders.\nIt raises the prospect that the underlying shareholders' discontent with the voting structure is even deeper than last week's vote showed.\nRegardless, the continuing small premium paid for News and Fox B shares suggest that investors believe voting stock for both companies, valued at $US8.5 billion and $US58.6 billion, is more valuable than the non-voting stock.\nLast week's vote could hardly even have been imagined a year ago.\nThe 2014 shareholder revolt was led by US fund manager South Eastern Asset Management, which held 12 per cent of News Corp's B class voting stock. However, after the motion was defeated, South Eastern sold almost all of its News shares in November.\nSold voting stake down Saudi Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, who has been one of Mr Murdoch's strongest supporters, revealed later he had sold his 5.6 per cent voting stake down to 1 per cent, most of it before 2014's annual meeting.\nNews has 199.6 million B shares, with voting rights, and 381.6 million A shares, which have no votes.\nWhile the Murdochs start with 39.4 per cent of the vote, their position is even stronger because not all shares vote.\nIn 2014 167.4 million shares were voted, or 83.8 per cent of the total number of B stock.\nThe Murdochs' 78.7 million shares represented 47 per cent of the shares voted, which meant they had to attract only 3 per cent more votes for a majority.\nPart of what made the difference in 2015 was that another 10 million shares were voted, including a drop of almost 2 million shares in the total described as \"Broker Non-Votes\", where brokers do not have a mandate to vote stock.\nWith 177.8 million shares voted, the Murdochs' 78.7 million shareholding fell to 44.3 per cent, which meant they needed 5.7 per cent of outside votes for a majority to defeat the motion on voting rights.\nJust enough support Of the extra stock voted in 2015, 2 million shares supported the Murdochs, but 8 million voted against them. It was just enough support, taking the Murdoch camp to 50.5 per cent.\nPart of what drove the victory was increased support for Rupert Murdoch. He was returned as a director with 76.8 per cent of the vote, up from 66.8 per cent in 2014.\nChief executive Robert Thomson did best, with support up from 67.9 per cent to 79.8 per cent. James Murdoch received 68.4 per cent, up from 65.7 per cent.\nLachlan Murdoch's support slipped 1 per cent to 66.5 per cent.\nThese figures include the 44.4 per cent support of the Murdoch stock. If these are taken out, a majority of non-Murdoch shareholders voted against the election of all directors except Rupert Murdoch and Thomson.\nIt's a sobering prospect for directors, who will need to consider their legal position in approving the family succession when Rupert Murdoch finally steps down from News.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:13:06.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
