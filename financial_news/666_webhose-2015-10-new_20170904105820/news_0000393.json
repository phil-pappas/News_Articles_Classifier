Photo: Wayne Taylor\nNo sooner had Westpac bumped up its interest rates than speculation started that the Reserve Bank would cut the official one. What's going on?\nWestpac even threw a sop to savers by lifting rates on term deposits more than it did on home loans, something that got lost in the outrage.\nWell, the Reserve can do what it likes, which will be exactly nothing, but there won't be any more rate cuts for home buyers.\nSurprising as it sounds, the banks aren't acting from a position of strength but, for the first time since the global financial crisis, weakness. Their free lunch of cheap capital is over, thanks to rule changes by the banking regulator making every mortgage considerably less profitable unless banks charge more.\nAdvertisement Apart from having Eurocentric regulations foisted on our banks, they also face having to set aside more capital for loan defaults, which are about as low as they can go right now but could start to rise because of the spreading drought and job losses from the mining downturn.\nIncredibly, the big banks had been allowed virtually to set their own capital requirements, resulting in very low amounts set aside for what, admittedly, is a safe investment underwritten by the best collateral of all.\nEven so, for every dollar lent, the banks only set aside an average 16 cents in capital. Other banks around the world are required to set aside more than twice that. Under the new rules the banks will have to set aside 24 cents, which is on top of other rules requiring more capital overall.\nThe fact is the banks were under-capitalised and thank goodness it was only the regulators who noticed, and they pretty much kept it to themselves.\nAnd the last round of capital requirements won't be the last. They're inspired by the central bankers' bank based in Basel, which is often fixing problems we don't have.\nAll the big banks have had to raise capital and for each extra share it'll be harder for them to deliver higher profits or, yikes, dividends.\nSo where does the Reserve fit in? It still thinks the economy is going all right, thank you.\nHousing construction has done wonders in holding the show together by providing jobs as mining investment winds down.\nThese extra homes are adding to supply at a record pace, which can't go on, so the Reserve will be hoping that something else pops up, or perhaps down in the case of the dollar.\nBesides, the Reserve is far from convinced that lower rates will do much good and perish the thought we get any closer to zero like the US where, seven years later, the economy isn't what you'd call robust.\nStill, thanks to Westpac the market expects it to cut again in the new year just so rates don't drift up of their own accord.\nGood luck there. Why should it make life easy for the banks?\nNo, it'll wait for the US Federal Reserve to stop dawdling and lift rates by the end of the year as it's been intimating for ages.\nThat'll boost the US dollar, keep our dollar down, and allow the show to roll on.\n@moneyPOTTS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@moneyPOTTS"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:12:27.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
