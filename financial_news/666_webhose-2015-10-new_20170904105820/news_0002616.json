Okuma Corp rose 6.5 percent and Minebea Co gained 6.0 percent, but still down 8 percent and 7.8 percent this year, respectively.\nExporters were also strong, with Toyota Motor Corp rising 0.9 percent and Honda Motor Co gaining 1.0 percent.\nAir-conditioner maker Daikin Industries Ltd rose 3.8 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that its overseas operations are picking up, with its Chinese business benefiting from brisk summer sales of commercial units for residential buildings. The stock was the third biggest positive contributor to the Nikkei, adding a hefty 11 points to the benchmark.\nHino Motors Ltd fell 2.4 percent after Credit Suisse lowered its rating to 'neutral' from 'outperform', citing weak demand in emerging markets and unfavourable exchange rates.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 1,496.03 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.2 percent to 13,405.00.
