Its total assets were CNY966 million, but its total debts were CNY1.07 billion in 2014.\nIn 2008, Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines launched Joy Air in conjunction with AVIC. At that time, China Eastern held a 40% stake in the regional joint venture, while AVIC held the remaining shares. But CEA transferred 35% of those shares to AVIC in 2009. Industry analysts speculate that AVIC may purchase the remaining 5% of Joy Air from China Eastern.\nJoy Air operates a fleet of nine AVIC-produced MA60 regional aircraft .\nChinese regional carriers have been suffering from heavy operating losses owing to higher operating expenses, lower load factors and increased taxes. It is reported that Joy Air is discussing with Tianjin-based Okay Airways a new regional joint venture to reduce operating expenses and achieve synergies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:22:07.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
