In addition to his upcoming CEO position, Hermann was elected as a board member, effectively immediately. \n\nAdditionally, Citigroup initiated coverage on the stock with a \"buy\" rating and a $88 price target, citing high return-on-investment capital and \"one of the most visible and longest duration growth opportunities in retail today,\" according to an analyst note.\nCitigroup mentioned that it forecasts 6% to 8% annual revenue growth during the next five years, propelled by expansion domestically and internationally. \nCitigroup analysts initiated coverage on 20 retail stocks last night, and off-price retailer TJX was second on their list.\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates TJX COMPANIES INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate TJX COMPANIES INC (TJX) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, growth in earnings per share, revenue growth, notable return on equity and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Turning our attention to the future direction of the stock, it goes without saying that even the best stocks can fall in an overall down market. However, in any other environment, this stock still has good upside potential despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year. TJX COMPANIES INC has improved earnings per share by 9.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, TJX COMPANIES INC increased its bottom line by earning $3.15 versus $2.95 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.30 versus $3.15). Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 9.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 6.5%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Specialty Retail industry and the overall market, TJX COMPANIES INC's return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.38, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Despite the fact that TJX's debt-to-equity ratio is low, the quick ratio, which is currently 0.60, displays a potential problem in covering short-term cash needs.
