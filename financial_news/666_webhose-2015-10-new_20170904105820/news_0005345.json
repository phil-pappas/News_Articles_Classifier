The Transportation Specialist’s Group is a third party logistics and transportation management firm, specializing in solutions that optimize a company’s distribution and supply chain operations. With headquarters located in Lawrenceville, Georgia, TSG now employs 35 highly experienced, customer - focused employees. Their goal is to help identify all of their customer’s transportation wastes and inefficiencies, in order to develop cost-effective solutions that improve the customer’s bottom line. What’s more, they serve as a single source to handle all transportation needs.\nTSG evaluated several leading BI solutions, but only InetSoft offered a free assisted evaluation, which showed step by step how the InetSoft tool could meet all of TSG’s needs. TSG’s main need was for an automated system to create billing reports for all of their customers. They also wanted to build a variety of client specific reports, including profitability reports for each client, as well as carry or aging reports to ensure that freight bills were being processed in a timely manner.\nTo build these reports, TSG needed a tool that would integrate data from their on-site database with data sent to them by customers. Since TSG couldn’t expect their customers to give access to their internal databases, customers sent their data in a variety of forms, often in simple flat files such as Excel and CSV. TSG realized that InetSoft’s unique data mashup would enable reports to be easily built that would integrate data from customers' flat files with data from TSG’s own database, without any coding or ETL process. This potentially represented a huge savings in man-hours.\n“InetSoft is helping us to close the door on manual touches by providing a robust and dynamic platform for automation and optimization,” explains John Miller, Director of Business Solutions at TSG. “With InetSoft’s tool, we’re expecting to save a solid 50 hours a week on report generation alone.”\n“TSG is a great example of how organizations can save time and money on data intelligence,” expresses Mark Flaherty, Chief Marketing Officer at InetSoft. “Our unique data access layer can mashup data from many different sources without coding or laborious manual processes, saving the developer’s time, and in many cases, removing the need for a data warehouse completely. There’s simply no limit to the amount of possible savings from automating your reporting process.”\nInetSoft's Style Intelligence is a data intelligence platform. At its foundation, it is a powerful data mashup engine that enables fast and flexible transformation of data from disparate sources, which can either supplement or obviate a data warehouse solution. At the development level, a unified interface allows for easy and advanced data manipulation and design of interactive dashboards, visual analyses, and published reporting. At the consumption level, self-service is maximized for a range of users, from casual business or consumer-type browsers to power users and data scientists. As a cloud-ready, fully scalable enterprise-grade platform with granular security, multi-tenancy support, and multiple integration points, it serves both enterprises and solution providers. In either environment, ease of deployment and ease of use are chief development principles that help lower the time investment and total cost of ownership - and make the solution attractive to organizations of any size, with or without BI expertise.\nTo learn more about InetSoft's Style Intelligence, view a demo, read customer reviews, and download a free evaluation copy, please visit\nhttps://www.inetsoft.com/products/StyleIntelligence/ .\nAbout InetSoft\nSince 1996, InetSoft has been delivering easy, agile, and robust business intelligence software that makes it possible for organizations and solution providers of all sizes to deploy or embed full-featured business intelligence solutions.
