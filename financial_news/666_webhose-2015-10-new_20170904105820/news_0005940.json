New Hampshire pays school districts $3,450 per student, but the law says no district can get more than 108 percent of what it received the year before. Dover, a growing school district, said the cap means it's not getting all of the money it's owed per student. \nAssistant Attorney General Anne Edwards said the office doesn't believe it's constitutional for the state to give districts less than lawmakers have determined it takes to provide an adequate education. \n\"We will defend any law that we believe there is a good faith defense to, and it happens very rarely that we don't,\" Edwards said. \nThe attorney general's decision not to defend the cap puts the executive branch at odds with Republican legislative leaders, and House Speaker Shawn Jasper and Senate President Chuck Morse are intervening in the case. Both branches will argue against the back payments. \n\"Any law that the Legislature passes and votes on should be defended,\" Morse said. \"I think we were a little surprised that the AG wasn't going to defend it.\" \nStrafford County Superior Court Judge Brian Tucker did not grant Dover an injunction it was seeking that would require the state to start making payments above the cap this year. \nEducation funding has long been a contentious issue in New Hampshire, with a lawsuit over school funding by the city of Claremont in the 1990s leading to the current per-student funding stream. The Legislature put the cap in place more recently. Most school districts are seeing a decline in enrollment but others, such as Dover, Bedford and Windham are seeing more students. \n\"If Dover hadn't pushed it, no one from the state would have stood up and admitted (it was) unconstitutional,\" said Andru Volinsky, Dover's attorney and the lead attorney on the Claremont cases. \nThe state budget recently signed into law raises the cap to 160 percent in 2017, leaving the state about $4 million short of full funding for every district, Morse said. The budget also includes a provision that said any surplus in the state's education trust fund must go toward that shortfall. Not all districts will get more money, as the budget begins slowly reducing stabilization grants created in 2012 to protect districts from funding changes. \n\"Education funding formulas are not simple,\" Morse said. \"We were slowly trying to affect change and we thought we did that.\" \nThink your friends should see this?
