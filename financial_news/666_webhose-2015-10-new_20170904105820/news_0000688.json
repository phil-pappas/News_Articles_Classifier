(“Hartman XX”, “the Company”, “we”, or “the Sponsor”), a Houston based Real Estate Investment Trust, continues to move toward its goal of a potential listing/IPO liquidity event. The Company provided new details regarding its intention to close Hartman XX to new investments. “We have taken discrete, concrete steps, including the engagements of both securities and compliance counsel (Mark Torok) and an IPO advisor (Rich Jennings) to better evaluate and structure a merger, the listing of shares on a national securities exchange, and an underwritten public offering,” said Al Hartman, CEO.\nIn an effort to make better informed decisions regarding a potential listing/IPO liquidity event for Hartman XX, in August of 2015, a group of Hartman executives traveled to New York to participate in a series of meetings with national and regional investment banking firms in New York City.\n“There was significant interest by underwriters in being selected as the Hartman XX's lead underwriter, based on Hartman's long and successful track record in creating value,” said Rich Jennings, IPO advisor to the Hartman XX Board of Directors.\nThe Hartman XX Board of Directors has provided the following estimated timeline of events:\n Close Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. to new investments by March 31, 2016. Complete a possible merger of Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc., Hartman Short Term Income Properties XIX, Inc., and Hartman Income REIT, Inc. during the second quarter of 2016. If the Board of Directors chooses to move forward with a possible merger, completion of a possible public listing of the successor company on a national exchange could take place during the third or fourth quarter of 2016.\nAny of the above events would be heavily dependent on market conditions and other matters not under the control of the Sponsor or Hartman XX, including, but not limited to, the approval of the boards and shareholders of all relevant entities. As such, the timing of such an event is impossible to predict with certainty. At this time the Hartman XX Board of Directors has not yet determined that a merger, listing of the shares, and/or an underwritten offering are the most suitable events to pursue for the benefit of the shareholders. There are no assurances a merger or liquidity event will occur or even that such an option will be approved by the Hartman XX Board of Directors or presented to the shareholders for approval.\nAbout Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc.\nHartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. is a Texas-centric REIT which owns fourteen properties in Dallas/Ft. Worth, Houston, and San Antonio. For additional information about Hartman XX visit http://www.HartmanREITs.com or call 800-880-2212.
