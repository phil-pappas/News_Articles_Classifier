Their behaviour is akin to that seen in the Volkswagen scandal.\n“It seems that industry is rife with manufacturers engineering to find their way around tests, rather than engineering better, more efficient technology. This behaviour is seriously misleading customers.”\nRelated: Emissions scandal: how the drive for diesel ran out of gas\nBosch said it “strenuously rejected” Dyson’s allegations.\nA statement from BSH Home Appliances, on behalf of Bosch and Siemens, said: “All Bosch and Siemens vacuum cleaners are measured in compliance with European energy regulations. Appliance performance at home is consistent with laboratory performance - and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly misleading.\n“The purpose of energy labelling is to give consumers a clear and independently-validated indication of energy consumption and broader performance criteria. We have a long and proud tradition of stringent testing.\n“We are committed to providing full disclosure on the energy ratings and broader performance of our vacuum cleaners so that consumers can make an informed decision. For reasons we fail to understand, this is not something that Dyson choose to do.\n“European Commission regulations and energy labelling on vacuum cleaners provide a valuable and reassuring guide that benefits the consumer. We believe that clear, accurate and independent performance information should be available to all consumers - and we are proud to share this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:50:24.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
