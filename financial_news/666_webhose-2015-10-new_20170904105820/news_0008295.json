Results show loan originators and their real-estate partners still want training on the “tricky” new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures.\nThe rule goes into effect on Oct. 3, 2015. Leading trade groups representing lenders, banks, credit unions, title companies and others are urging federal regulators to provide more details on examination guidelines. These groups are asking how the CFPB plans to enforce the new mortgage disclosure rule. According to a story in National Mortgage News , the CFPB is working with other regulators on examiner guidance to help ensure that the agencies enforce new mortgage disclosures in a \"corrective\" manner, not a \"punitive\" one, said director Richard Cordray.\nMortgage industry training veteran and SVP e-Learning at Morf Media Inc. Ginger Bell stated: “The new TRID process is significant. It's time to get training before the deadline to avoid the \"gotchas that will getcha.\" It's key you know the difference between what is old, what is new under TRID, and what to do in order to become a TRID expert.”\nStrategic Compliance Partners (SCP), a leader in mortgage compliance consulting, has exclusively created content for Morf Media Inc. for use in their platform for a comprehensive online TRID training program. Ari Karen, CEO, Strategic Compliance Partners, commented: “Dodd-Frank mandated the overhaul to the borrower disclosures required under TRID. TRID is designed to simplify the origination documents, improve their accuracy and get the forms in borrowers' hands faster. Though the changes are considerable, the online training curriculum we have created exclusively for the Morf Media platform delivers a comprehensive course to help mortgage professionals and their real-estate partners achieve TRID success.”\nThe training platform from Morf Media provides a fast, fun and easy way to do online training with the comprehensive TRID training program from SCP. The gamified online course is only $25 per person until October 10, 2015. Company pricing is also available.
