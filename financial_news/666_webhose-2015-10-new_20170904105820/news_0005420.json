After a campaign from Sherborne last year, Electra set out a policy of returning 3pc of its value per year to investors. \nThe group completed 11 new deals in the year to the end of September, all but one of which were bolt-on acquisitions for companies already in its portfolio. The total return on the group's investment portfolio was £429m, or 34pc. \nElectra’s net asset value per share rose to £39.14p, giving a total return of 25pc once dividends are included. The firm, one of the only private equity groups listed on the stock market, trades at a 5.5pc discount to its underlying value. \nThe company is speaking to its major shareholders this week to oppose Sherborne’s attempt to install co-founder Edward Bramson and another appointee, Ian Brindle, onto the board. \nThe private equity firm has spent two years resisting Mr Bramson's overtures, and has engaged in an increasingly fierce war of words about his claim that he could unlock £1bn of unrealised value from the firm by rejigging its costs and investment strategy. \nSpeaking after the results were announced, Electra chairman Roger Yates said that the shareholder advisory groups PIRC, ISS (Copenhagen: ISS.CO - news ) and Glass Lewis have now advised their clients to support Electra against Mr Bramson’s proposals. \n“That’s a good background for us to talk to shareholders. I’m not sure there’s anything we could do that would change Ed Bramson’s mind. We’ve tried and tried to elicit the issues he’s bothered about but to no avail,” he said. \nThe results have been released three weeks earlier than usual, in a move the firm hopes will show off its strong returns to shareholders without Sherborne’s suggested improvements. \n“Everything that’s in these numbers has to be audited and we’ve gone through the same process that we always go through with our auditor PwC,” said Mr Yates. \n“There’s nothing that we’ve pushed hard to get to a particular number.” \nMr Bramson recently told the Telegraph that he was \"not going anywhere\" even if he fails to install his own board members at the vote on November 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:45:14.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
