The Elgeyo Marakwet Governor added that the house is not located in Kamariny stadium as claimed. Athletics Kenya and the sports fraternity approved the project, he also said, adding the land where construction is taking place had been grabbed by an individual he did not name. \"This is a project that is located adjacent to Kamariny. I am not a mad man to authorise the construction of a residence in the middle of a stadium,\" he said. \"This is not Governor Tolgos' house. It is the county governor's house. It will be used by Tolgos and future governors. Opponents have been made to think the house belongs to the current governor.\" Speaking during the first Chebara dam conservation run in Marakwet West on Saturday, Tolgos faulted the landgrabber and a politician, saying they incited residents into oppositing the project. He asked residents not to listen to critics of the construction, claiming they have been bribed to derail major projects in the county. \"We cannot allow a few selfish individuals to ruin development projects through petty politics,\" he said. Moiben/Kuserwo MCA William Chesingany said the County Assembly \"cannot turn around and begin to oppose\" the project it approved. But he asked the county government to relocate the project to Chebiemit, Marakwet West subcounty, if the opposition persists. \"We have adequate land in Chebiemit, and residents are ready to host the governor,\" he said. Several local and international athletes train at the stadium. During a forum in Iten town on September 28, sections of MCAs, county officials and residents said the project should be stationed away from the stadium.
