Confidence was given a lift at the start of the month by a report indicating the country's key manufacturing sector saw a slight improvement in September. \nThe news provided some cheer after a string of figures highlighting a sharp slowdown in Chinese growth. Fears about the Asian economic giant were inflamed in August when authorities devalued the yuan currency, raising questions about their grip on the crisis. \nBernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said Monday's price rise was bolstered after el-Badri said Sunday: \"OPEC is confident that it will see a more balanced market in 2016. \n\"In recent months, there has been a contraction in production from non-OPEC producers and an increase in global demand.\" \nThe comments meant the oil producers' cartel -- which accounts for about 40 percent of global production -- \"still sees stronger demand in the medium term\", Aw told AFP. \nDespite the recent uptick, oil prices remain depressed owing to concerns about demand as the global economy stutters, a supply glut and the weakness in China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:10:20.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
