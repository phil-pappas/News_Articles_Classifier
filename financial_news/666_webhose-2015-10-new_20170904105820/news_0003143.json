Warburg Pincus is asking clients to submit their subscription documents by Nov. 2.\nEd Trissel, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined to comment on the capital raising.\nA divide between firms able to gather money quickly and those that stumble is increasingly appearing in the private equity industry as competition for new cash heightens and clients seek to invest with fewer firms. Groups that have closed funds this year have taken 16.3 months on average to raise money, according to research firm Preqin, compared with 11.5 months in 2007, before the financial crisis struck. A record 2,348 funds were being marketed as of September, up from 1,304 at the start of 2008.\nFund Returns Warburg Pincus, led by co-Chief Executive Officers Chip Kaye and Joe Landy and President Tim Geithner, plans to invest the new fund in 60 to 90 companies, according to a June presentation to the Fresno County Employeesâ€™ Retirement Association, in California. The firm has typically invested in leveraged buyouts, growth equity and venture capital from one global fund at a time, until it raised $4 billion last year for its first vehicle dedicated to energy deals.\nIts 11th main fund, which finished gathering $11.2 billion in 2013, was producing a 21 percent annualized return as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its $15 billion pool from 2008 had an 8.8 percent return, the data show.\nDealmakers have recently struggled to find cheap assets as markets hovered near record highs. Private equity firms announced 765 buyouts in the second quarter, the fewest since the first quarter of 2010, according to Preqin.\nBlackstone Group LP, the biggest manager of alternative assets such as private equity holdings and real estate, gathered $17 billion in seven months for its latest buyout fund, people with knowledge of the process said earlier this year. KKR & Co. is seeking $10 billion to $12 billion for a new North American private equity fund, and TPG Capital is nearing a close on a $10 billion buyout pool, its first in seven years.\nWarburg Pincus, with more than $35 billion under management, traces its roots to EM Warburg & Co., which was founded in 1939 and acquired by Lionel I. Pincus & Co. in 1966, forming the current version of the firm. Geithner, the former U.S. Treasury secretary, was hired in 2013 and started last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:00:55.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
