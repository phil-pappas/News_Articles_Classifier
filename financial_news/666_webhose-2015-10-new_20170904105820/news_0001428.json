Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Fiona Carruthers Even billionaires love a favourable exchange rate.\nBeatrice Tollman, matriarch of the UK's Tollman family – which owns and runs one of the world's biggest travel companies - has spent the past week staying at the lavish Park Hyatt Sydney with Opera House views for seven nights.\nGiven the low Australian dollar, shopping was high on the to do list.\n\"I've been coming to Australia for 50 years now,\" the president and founder of Red Carnation Hotels told the AFR Weekend over a glass of sparkling water in the Park Hyatt's lobby. \"Shopping is always high on my agenda. Sydney's a great place to pick up antiques.\"\nShe's sampled the local food scene (including Neil Perry's Rockpool), browsed the outdoor markets around the Rocks and snapped up an embroidered cashmere stole as a gift for a close friend, plus a few bottles of Emu oil.\nShe was also scouring the city for antique silver cutlery, indigenous art – and even a possible site for a future Red Carnation hotel.\nThe Tollmans operate the Travel Corporation in more than 60 countries, with an array of brands in their portfolio, including Red Carnation Hotels, Uniworld cruises, Trafalgar, AAT Kings, Insight Tours, Contiki and Creative Holidays.\n\"This is one of my favourite places in the world,\" Mrs Tollman said. \"Our hotels have a special look and feel – it's hard to find the right building – but we're always on the look out. We've come close a couple of times to finding a suitable location. Hopefully it will happen one day.\"\n Awarded Hotelier of the Year in 2012 at the European Hospitality Awards, Mrs Tollman is just one of an increasing number of international visitors enjoying the low Australian dollar, where the ABS recently reported that tourist arrivals into Australia were up 5.8 per cent in August 2015, year on year.\n\"We're obviously very familiar with and resilient to currency fluctuations,\" Travel Corporation's CEO, Brett Tollman said.\nMr Tollman also spent the past week in Sydney with his mother and other family members.\nAAT Kings is the Tollman's biggest product in the Australian market and so far the company has seen growth of almost six per cent in forward bookings, primarily by international tourists coming into Australia. \"That's fairly consistent with the ABS rise for August,\" Mr Tollman said.\nLike many travel companies, the family is finessing how it caters for Australians heading abroad. There might be only 22 million Australians – but they are a market of 22 million people keen to travel.\nMr Tollman said upping pre-paid, packaged, all-inclusive offerings across their brands has kept Australians hot on long-haul trips despite the plummeting dollar.\n\"Advance international bookings out of Australia for Contiki Tours in 2016 are up about 30 per cent year-on-year despite the dollar,\" Mr Tollman said. \"Trafalgar and Insight are both up by about 10 percent, while Uniworld has seen a spike of seven per cent.\n\"Europe accounts for about 80 per cent of our footprint and advance bookings out of Australia show the resilience of the Australian traveller.\n\"We all need a holiday. Australians will change their buying habits for sure – they will cut the trip shorter, maybe two or three weeks not a month. And some will look at a different destination where the value might be better at the moment. But they still tend to travel.\"\nThe Travel Company has just repositioned its Cost Saver product as a stand alone brand: \"You book and pay in Australian dollars and it's almost all-inclusive, so the price is locked in.\"\nMeanwhile, the family continues to grow its Australian products, and recently outlaid $20 milllion for a building in inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria, to be used as it's new headquarters for AAT Kings.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SophTraveller"], "published": "2015-10-16T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:08.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
