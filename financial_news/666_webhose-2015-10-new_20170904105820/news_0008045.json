It is commonly grown by subsistence and small-scale farmers. \nIt is often associated with low income earners, and its cultivation is largely secondary, especially, where it grows in the wild. \nCocoyam Serves As Food Security CropThe reality, however, is that cocoyam serves as a means of livelihood and food security crop for farmers, especially, in West and Central Africa. \nThe crop is now accepted as one that can guarantee food security, because it is relatively low-priced and could therefore feed many low income families. \nAccording to Kennedy Agyemang, an agronomist at the Crop Research Institute, cocoyam species are found, grown and used as one of the underutilized food security resources for solving food supply problems. \n“It is a food security crop that grows well and can withstand all forms of weather variation,” he said. \nIt is well adapted to most agro-ecological zones, yet it receives little interest and attention by producers and consumers. \nCocoyam Growing Areas Are Losing Environmental Requirements \nMost cocoyam growing areas are however losing the environmental requirements suitable for the crop. \nAgronomist at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Anthony Owusu Amoako, said the crop requires fertile and deep -well drained soil adding, it is a partially- shady and loving crop. \nHe however raised concerns about the continued shrinking of the forest and woodland in growing areas which will in the long run , negatively affect production. \nCocoyam With-Stands Severe WeatherKennedy Agyemang, again, said with climate and weather variation, Ghana needs crops that with-stand severe conditions. \nHe recommended cocoyam to farmers, in addition to other crops. \n“With change in rainfall patterns and continued decline in soil fertility and productivity, we need crops that can with-stand conditions,” he said. \nCocoyam Is The Only Crop That Can Integrate In All Cropping SYSTEM \nCocoyam is one crop that can be easily integrated in all kinds of cropping system. But there is no value for the crop. \n“It can be integrated into cocoa, rubber, and plantain in inter-cropping,” Kennedy Agyemang stated. \nAnthony Owusu Amoako, once more, cited loss of forest land may affect growing of cocoyam in future. \nNutritional Value Of The CropCocoyam has high protein, vitamin and mineral content but many farmers pay little attention to investing in its cultivation on large-scale. \nKennedy Agyemang indicated cocoyam has better nutritional elements than other root and tuber crops like cassava and yam. \nIt Has Two Times Or More Yielding Capacity Than Farmer Variety \nThe Crop Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has so far released three main varieties of cocoyam of high yield. \nThey are harvested, at most, ten months after planting with a yielding capacity of up to three times higher than the farmer variety. \nI Gain A Lot From Cocoyam – FarmerEmmanuel Otchere is one farmer who is making gains in cocoyam farming. \n”I have made a lot of gains from cocoyam cultivation, ” Emmanuel summed up his excitement. \nOther farmers at Juaso in the Ashanti Region who grow cocoyam are making significant progress. \nWhy most farmers do not grow cocoyam in commercial quantity \nTraditionally, the old corms sprout spontaneously after clearing and burning of the land. Many farmers now however now practise zero tillage. \nCocoyam was also used as a nurse crop in cocoa production. Most cocoa farmers are no more inter-cropping with the crop to shade their young cocoa trees. \nThey prefer fast- growing plants like grilicida sepium that provide shade. \nMr. Owusu Amoako again said, “apart from being the fast- growing plant, it fixes nitrogen as well. Farmers prefer it to the cocoyam.” Business & Finance Follow Us Life will teach you great lessons through human beings.lt is only God who will not betray you.
