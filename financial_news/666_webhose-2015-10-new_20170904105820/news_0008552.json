So, once these investigative agencies form a prima facie opinion, its only then the magnitude, the nature and the kind of people involved in it will become clear,” he told CNBC TV18.\nLast week, CBI and the Enforcement Directorate started investigating the matter. It is alleged that Rs 6,172 crore black money was remitted from Bank of Baroda to Hong Kong which was passed off as payments for non-existent imports like cashew, pulses and rice.\nIt is also alleged that the amount was deposited in 59 accounts of the bank’s Ashok Vihar branch (New Delhi) in cash as advance for import and the money was sent to some select companies in Hong Kong.\nThe branch opened 59 current accounts from May 2014 to June 2015 through which large foreign exchange remittances were made, the bank said in a regulatory filing.\nDuring this one year, a total of 5,853 outward foreign remittances aggregating USD 546.10 million (around Rs 3,500 crore) were made through 38 current accounts to various overseas parties numbering some 400, mainly based in Hong Kong and one in the UAE.\n 15, 2015 7:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:10:20.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
