Picture: Stephen Laffer\nANTHONY KEANE, SOPHIE ELSWORTH AUSTRALIANS are among the world’s biggest buyers of vitamins and other nutrition supplements, and many of us are spending more than we should.\nHuge savings are often available for those who shop wisely and watch more closely what they consume.\n“Leading a healthy lifestyle does not have to cost you the earth,” says naturopath Kasey Willson of Aloe Health.\nThis is an area where shopping around is worth the extra effort. Discounts of 50 per cent of recommended retail prices are not unusual online and in stores.\nWillson says buying supplements in bulk is usually the most economical option. “However, initially purchase smaller quantities of a supplement to rule out any side effects or reactions,” she says.\n“Understand how the ingredients of supplements work and if there are any studies, evidence or testimonials to support the claims.”\nHOW TO BUILD A BUDGET\nNutritionist Kasey Willson says a healthy lifestyle does not have to cost you the earth. Picture: Stephen Laffer Source: News Corp Australia\nSURGING SALES\nStatistics show that Aussies consume more health supplements per person than anyone in the world, and sales have been growing by about 14 per cent a year for more than five years.\n“It’s a huge market,” says Queensland Consumers Association spokesman Ian Jarratt. He says comparing health supplements can be confusing because you must measure both quantity and the dosage levels of active ingredients.\nBeware of tricky packaging. “Manufacturers often use the same pack but there are different quantities in packs,” Jarratt says. The same-size container may be used to hold 180, 200 or 250 tablets, he says.\n“Don’t automatically assume that the supermarket will be the cheapest — discount chemist shops are sometimes very competitive.”\nCOMPARE LOW RATE CREDIT CARDS\nLoading up on supplements won’t work well if you’re eating junk food. Source: AFP\nFOOD COMES FIRST\nDon’t overdo it. Loading up on supplements won’t work well if you’re eating junk, and Willson says savings on the food front are plentiful.\nShe suggests seeking out farmers markets, volunteering at local food co-ops to share in savings, splitting costs with friends by buying in bulk and planning your meals at the start of a week. “Knowing what to shop for will reduce food wastage,’’ Willson says.\n Vitamin boost at half the price ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/db6d568276367dc6e98d032e3f0b529e", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/guide/building-a-budget#itm_t=story&itm_l=health-supplements", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ed281a848fecd57b8cef26cb38e2af86", "http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/1e5da35e12090281c9239526e4a0c475?domain=newscorpaustralia.com", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/38b03a8ad80611c7a6b1f41e74ab212b", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/credit-cards/low-fee#itm_t=story&itm_l=health-supplements", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:46:18.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
