Offshore trusts, in the right jurisdiction, have a benefit of a short statute of limitations for creditors to bring an action to reach the trust assets on a fraudulent conveyance theory (the usual mechanism under which trust assets are reached). However, if the trust is established before there is a creditor on the horizon, there are even more advantages in certain jurisdictions. First, by establishing the trust while the grantor is solvent, this will usually insulate the trust from a fraudulent conveyance trust completely in the favored jurisdictions. That is, if a later creditor claim arises, since the trust was funded while the grantor was solvent and the funding did not render the grantor insolvent, the later creditor is out of luck. Second, even if there is an existing creditor at the time the trust is established, and if that existing creditor perhaps can get into the trust on a fraudulent conveyance theory, in the proper jurisdiction creditors that arise after the funding of the trust cannot piggy-back on the claim of the first creditor to reach trust assets. Again, these later-acquired creditors are out of luck. In many U.S. jurisdictions, this protection is not available. Human nature being what it is, calls to our office for creditor protection planning usually arise AFTER a potential claim arises. This is problematic both for domestic and offshore planning, and we usually decline to participate in post-claim planning.. The ideal planning should occur before there is a claim. This is helpful for both domestic and offshore planning, but debtor-friendly asset protection trust provisions in some foreign jurisdictions provide even greater benefits for such early planning than if the trust is established in the U.S. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Charles (Chuck) Rubin, Gutter Chaves Josepher Rubin Forman Fleisher P.A. | Attorney Advertising Gutter Chaves Josepher Rubin Forman Fleisher P.A. on: \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email… * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website \nIf you prefer not to enabl \nIf you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at info@jdsupra.com \nExcept as otherwise described in this privacy statement, JD Supra will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries or requests; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of JD Supra, users of the Service, Website visitors or the public; (5) permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain; and (6) enforce our Terms & \nWe reserve the right to change this Policy at any time.
