Drewry Analyst Neil Dekker said “an overcapacity crisis” will grow as more ultra-large container ships enter fleets in the next few months.\nOcean shipping capacity is expected to expand by 1.6 million 20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs, a standard measure for container cargo, by the end of this year. Mr. Dekker said ocean shipping companies won't be able to keep rates from sliding if they don't idle more ships.\nThe new Drewry report is one of several that are raising alarms about the financial state of ocean carriers as they continue to incorporate new vessels that are some 40% larger than the biggest ships were less than 10 years ago. The scale of the megaships has led many large shipping lines to combine services under what the industry calls alliances. Some of those groups have recently cut back services, a costly move for ship owners that need a steady stream of revenue to pay for the new vessels.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter.

This year marks the “highest inflow of new capacity” ever in the ocean shipping industry, with 200 ships accounting for the 1.6 million-TEU expansion, Denmark-based shipping association Bimco said in a report Thursday. In 2008, the last banner year for ocean vessel capacity, the industry added 1.5 million TEU across 436 ships. The average new ship size in 2015 was nearly three times the average in 2008.\nMeanwhile, ship owners aren’t demolishing their older vessels at the rate they once did. This year only 51 ships with a combined 94,000 TEUs of capacity have been demolished, and many remaining ships are relatively new—less than 20 years old. Still, Bimco said scrapping of ships could grow in November and December if demand remains low.\nDrewry highlighted a few carriers that have removed capacity on major routes. Two large weekly routes between Asia and North Europe have been suspended and five carriers canceled weekly megaship service between Asia and the East Coast of South America.\nWhile most analysts don’t forecast a significant rise in demand through the end of the year, Bimco’s Peter Sand said there were a few bright spots in the global shipping market in the first half of 2015.\nU.S. East Coast imports grew 17%, and shipments between Asian ports grew nearly 5%. But “increased uncertainty surrounding the economic development in China adds doubt as to whether such a strong growth rate can be sustained for the full year,” the report said, adding that exports from China have dropped steeply this year.\nAsia-to-Europe trade is down this year and imports to the U.S. West Coast have been slower than expected, the report said.\nWrite to Erica E.
