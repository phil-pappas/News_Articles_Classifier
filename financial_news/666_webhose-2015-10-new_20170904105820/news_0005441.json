Commodity prices fell, although a rebound in UK oil and gas stocks sparked a recovery in the European resources and energy sector. \nThe cautious tone in major government bond markets at the open prevailed, making for lower yields across the board, while most major exchange rates were stable. \n\"The biggest gainer is ARM Holdings after it announced a 7.5 percent jump in revenues. This is good news for ARM, which could keep on feeding Apple (LSE: 0R2V.L - news ) with its more powerful chips used in new iPhone models,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, market analyst at London Capital Group. \nAt midsession the FTSEuroFirst index of leading 300 European shares was up 0.2 percent at 1,345 points. \nARM was up 7 percent, its biggest one-day rise in 2 1/2 years. Shares in Credit Suisse were down 1.5 percent, having lost as much as 4.5 percent earlier after it announced plans to raise 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.3 billion) in capital. \nGermany's DAX was up 0.7 percent, France's CAC 40 up 0.6 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 up 0.4 percent. \nU.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . futures pointed to a higher opening on Wall Street of around 0.4 percent, more than reversing Tuesday's small losses. \nEarlier in Asia, MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.25 percent. \nIn Japan, the slowest growth in exports in over a year fuelled talk of recession. But the prospect of more stimulus from the Bank of Japan lifted the Nikkei 225 to its highest since Sept. 9, ending up 1.9 percent at 18,554 points. \nECB TO STAY PUT? \nEarnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have fallen about 4 percent in the third quarter, while revenue is expected to have declined 3.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) data. \nEconomic news from the United States was moderately upbeat as housing starts increased 6.5 percent in September to an annual pace of 1.21 million units, beating expectations for 1.15 million units. \nThere was also better news on bank lending in the euro zone as data from the European Central Bank on Tuesday showed a further easing in credit conditions and improving demand for loans. \nThat might lessen the need for the ECB to immediately ramp up its 1 trillion euro asset purchase program. \nThe ECB's governing council meets on Thursday and markets expect it to highlight a willingness to act to boost inflation, but not just yet. \n\"Actions are highly unlikely this week. But its words will need to confirm a strong dovish bias that keeps the ECB on track for extra QE (quantitative easing) in December if the market is to keep its composure,\" Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) analysts wrote in a client note on Wednesday. \nThe euro was steady at $1.1350, hemmed in by support at $1.3300 and resistance around $1.1386. The dollar index was last also little-changed at 94.865. \nThe Australian dollar was the biggest mover among the major currencies, under pressure from the weakness in Chinese stocks and world commodity prices. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was last down 0.4 percent at $0.7230. \nOil prices softened on speculation U.S. inventory data would only underline the extent of oversupply in the world. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will report official inventory data on Wednesday. \nU.S. crude fell 1.2 percent to $45.73 per barrel, while Brent lost 0.5 percent to $48.48. \nIn bonds the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was down almost 2 basis points at 2.05 percent.
