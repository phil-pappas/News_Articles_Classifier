Each launcher uses eight interceptors.\nLockheed spokeswoman Cheryl Amerine said the computer issue had been resolved and the revised delivery plan was met in June.\n\"Interceptor deliveries were delayed to allow time for a requested upgrade that further improved the mission computer and interceptor's performance,\" she said.\nThe program halted production of interceptors during missile segment testing after the mission computer's Static Random Access Memory - a new device on the computer's memory card - failed an acceptance procedure, Army Colonel Anthony Brown, THAAD program manager, said in a report released last week.\nAs of March, when that report was completed, the program had projected that Lockheed would deliver nine interceptors in the 2015 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. But Lehner said only three were actually delivered.\nBrown said budget cuts also posed problems for the program, with funding for THAAD interceptors cut from 72 a year in fiscal 2011 to around 18 a year in fiscal 2017 and 2018, and 17 a year in 2019 and 2020.\nAs a result, the U.S. Army was unlikely to achieve its goal of receiving a full combat load of interceptors for a seventh unit and a preliminary load for an eighth unit by fiscal 2020, unless costs could be lowered by bundling orders, Brown said.\nHis report was part of the Pentagon's third annual report on the performance of its weapons acquisition system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:18:08.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
