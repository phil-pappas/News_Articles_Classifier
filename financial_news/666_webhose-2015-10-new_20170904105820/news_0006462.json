The CloudMargin / OpenGamma solution will allow those firms to independently validate and understand the margin they are charged by the CCPs. For CloudMargin customers, this service can be delivered without adding any overhead of systems deployment or data integration\".\n# # #\nAbout CloudMargin\nCloudMargin is the collateral management technology provider.
