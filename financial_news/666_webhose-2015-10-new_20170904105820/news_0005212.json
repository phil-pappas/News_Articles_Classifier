Capital intensity of approximately US$9,100 per annual tonne of copper produced. Post-tax IRR of 15% and NPV 8 of US$164 million on a 100% equity basis, with a payback of 5.1 years after start of production, based on US$3.11/lb copper price from 2019 (NPV is zero at $2.62) 1 . Life of Mine (\"LOM\") EBITDA of US$1.41 billion. C1 cash cost of US$1.60/lb of copper metal produced, with an all-in cash cost of US$1.93/lb. Copper recovery of 91%, with annual copper cathode production of up to 40,000 tonnes with an average of 37,000 tonnes per annum over life of mine. Annual ore production of 1.5 to 2Mt Run of Mine (\"ROM\"), with average head grade of 2.2% copper. Underground mine with 13-year mine life. 22.5 Mt ROM LOM production target at 2.2% copper with ~500,000 tonnes of contained copper. 1 \"Real\" terms, after tax and based on average long-term copper price forecast of 12 brokers. \nThe Options Study has delivered a result which indicates the Kitumba Project is technically feasible with an average production rate of approximately 37,000 tonnes per annum copper over a 13-year mine life. The Project also has economic potential capable of generating US$1.41 billion in EBITDA, a post-tax IRR of 15%, and an NPV 8 of US$164 million at a long-term copper price of US$3.11/lb. \nThe Company's CEO, Scott Lowe said: \n\" The outcome of the Options Study for the Kitumba Copper Project is an important development, confirming that the Project has economic potential. \nThe reduction in resource tonnage announced as a result of the inclusion of results from the infill drilling program has required a substantial rethink of the development plan for Kitumba. Today's announcement demonstrates that, despite the smaller resource and weaker commodity price outlook, Kitumba remains economic at a long-term copper price of $3.11/lb. \nThe key components of this breakthrough have been a smaller annual throughput, coupled with a sharply lower capital investment. Another advantage of the change in development plan is that the reserve grade has increased to 2.2% copper average. \nGiven the current state of the copper market, with spot prices below the long-term copper price forecast level, the Company intends to continue drilling our high priority targets in the area surrounding Kitumba in an effort to find additional resources that would further enhance project economics. The decision whether to take the Kitumba Project on to full feasibility will be made early in 2016 following the completion of exploration drilling and metallurgical testing. Importantly, the Kitumba Project is subject to a mining licence granted in November 2014 and the present plans are consistent with the expectations of the Zambian government \". \nFurther details of the Options Study are available in a summary report available on the Company's website at www.intrepidmines.com.au . \nATTRIBUTION \nThe information in this report relating to Mineral Resources at the Mumbwa Project in Zambia is extracted from the report titled \"Intrepid Mines Limited: Mumbwa Project - Kitumba Mineral Resource Update\", lodged with ASX on 17 August 2015 and available to view on the Company's website, www.intrepidmines.com . \nThe Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. \nThe Company confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market announcement. \nThe information in this report that relates to Ore Reserves is based on and fairly represents information and supporting documentation compiled by Peter Wade BEng (Min), MAusIMM. Mr Wade is a contractor to Coffey Mining Pty Ltd and has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity being undertaken to qualify as Competent Person as defined in the 2012 Edition of the 'Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves' (JORC 2012). Mr Wade consents to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on his information in the form and context in which it appears. \nThe information in this summary report at sections 6 and 7 relating to the metallurgy and process flowsheet, capital and operating cost estimates is based on and fairly reflects in the form and context in which it appears, the information and supporting documentation (the \"SNC Information\") prepared by and under the supervision of SNC-Lavalin Australia PTY LTD (\"SNC\"). The information in this summary report at section 8 is also partly based on SNC Information, but is also based on information from a variety of other sources including, without limitation, Coffey Mining, Intrepid Mines and work performed by other consultants. SNC has reviewed and approved the contents of sections 6, 7 and 8 of this summary report (as relating to SNC Information) and consents to the inclusion of the SNC Information in the form and context in which it appears. \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS \nThis announcement contains certain forward-looking statements relating to, but not limited to Intrepid's expectations, intentions, plans and beliefs.

Forward-looking information may include reserve and resource estimates, estimates of future production, unit costs, costs of capital projects, and timing of commencement of operations and is based on current expectations that involve a number of business risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, failure to establish estimated resources and reserves, the grade and recovery of ore which is mined varying from estimates, capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates, delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other project approvals, inflation, changes in exchange rates, fluctuations in commodity prices, delays in the development of projects and other factors. Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. \nShareholders and potential investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information.
