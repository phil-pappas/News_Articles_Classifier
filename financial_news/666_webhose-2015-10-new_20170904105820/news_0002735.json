Both companies would like to be up next for union negotiations, so they are not as greatly affected by the talks that preceded them.\nThe second shift at Detroit-Hamtramck, to start in early 2016, will add 1,200 workers at the plant, which will then have 2,800 workers, GM said. The plant is located in both Detroit and the city it nearly envelopes, Hamtramck. It is highly flexible, having the ability to build models based on different underpinning chassis.\nThe plant will start producing the Cadillac CT6, Cadillac's new flagship sedan, in the first quarter of next year, a GM spokesman said.\nHiring is under way for the second shift at the plant, also called \"D-Ham,\" where GM produces high-volume sedans Chevrolet Malibu and Impala as well as the plug-in electric-gasoline hybrid sedans Chevy Volt and Cadillac ELR.\nThe new workers will add to the 52,700 UAW-represented hourly workers now employed by GM in the United States, where it is the No. 1 automaker. There are an additional 400 GM unionized workers who are members of other unions.\nThe new workers will make the prevailing starting UAW-GM wage upon their hiring, which now stands at $15.78 per hour but is expected to rise when a new contract goes into effect.\nThe new pact with Fiat Chrysler, which will be used as a pattern for the basic outline of the GM and Ford deals, calls for a $17 per hour starting wage and an eight-year path toward top pay which by the end of the four-year contract will be about $30 per hour.\nGM announced nine months ago that it would invest $300 million to upgrade and heavily automate the D-Ham plant.\nThe last U.S. GM plant to add a shift was its Lansing-Grand River plant in Lansing, Michigan, in order to produce new version of the Chevrolet Camaro.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Frances Kerry)\nGM Cadillac", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:56:15.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
