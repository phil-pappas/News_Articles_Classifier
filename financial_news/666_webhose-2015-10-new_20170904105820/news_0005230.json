Dr David Cade , chief medical officer, Sirtex Medical Limited.\nHow did you get started as a cyclist?\nAs an 80s kid I spent my waking hours on my Quicksilver BMX attempting table-tops off the ramps we built on the local vacant block. I got back on a bike in 2000 to do triathlons, borrowing my sister's Malvern Star. The beauty of a bike is you see more of the world than you do rushing past cocooned in a car.\nHow many bikes and how do you know when you have too many?\nTwo. A 15-year-old Giant TCR that has done a lot of miles in Europe and around New York City. I also have a one-year-old Pinarello Dogma F8, the bike Chris Froome won the Tour de France on. I am happy with two - one work of modern art and an old faithful to knock about on.\nHow much did they cost?\nI dare not say. My lovely wife would equate them to 10 and 45 pairs of shoes respectively. I'm reliably told a cheap pair of heels is $300.\nKind of riding\n Commuting and road riding, with a couple of triathlons thrown in over summer. Most riding is done with my good friend Brodie Dixon (managing director) of H&R Block. Whether it's ocean swimming, beach running or surfing, he's a natural athlete and does each considerably better than me. I'm his match on the bike though and that's the way I plan to keep it.\nDo you stop at a stop sign if there is no one around?\nHand on heart, I can't say always. I do always, without fail, stop at red lights and wait for the green. Apart from the obvious self-preservation and not wishing to make a personal contribution to Darwinian evolution, cyclists running red lights do no one any favours.\nTips to become a better rider\nCommuting to work is a great way to boost your weekly kilometres. Riding with a couple of fit mates who I'm not prepared to allow to get (too far) away on the hills has also worked.\nKilometres a week\nI'm training for the Ride to Conquer Cancer supporting Chris O'Brien Lifehouse with a team of Sirtex colleagues in October and the Noosa Triathlon in November. Currently, I'm averaging 130 kilometres on the bike and 60 kilometres on the trainer. I'd love to be able to do more.\nMost like to go on a long ride with\nMy Sirtex colleague John Phillip, who has gall bladder cancer. John is 38 with a wife and two boys and is currently receiving chemotherapy. He completed the Ride to Conquer Cancer last year and has requested a chemotherapy break from his oncologist to enable him to ride again this year. My hope is John is riding with us in the years to come.\nFavourite refuel station\nDriftwood Cafe at Akuna Bay Marina in the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, north of Sydney - more for the tranquility than the quality of the beans.\nFavourite piece of cycling gear\nThe Shimano Di2 electronic gear shift on my Pinarello. It provides gear changing that operates with surgical precision and has proven utterly flawless.\nFavourite ride\nLane Cove out to Akuna Bay and then on to West Head, which has spectacular views over Pittwater. Plenty of hills, spectacular waterways and few cars. Outside of Sydney it would have to be a lap of Manhattan followed by a detour across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey and up into the Palisades … Tony Soprano country.\nCrashes? Catastrophes?\nCycling from Cologne to Bonn along the Rhine river one Sunday the front wheel of my bike gave out around a fast bend. It was like having a cheese grater run down my right side. The guy sitting next to me on the flight to Stockholm that evening politely excused himself and moved to another seat when blood came oozing through the seven layers of bandages I'd applied to hold it all together. Admittedly it looked pretty disturbing.\nIf you could improve one thing about the world of cycling what would it be?\nI can honestly say that in my experience the majority of motorists accommodate cyclists. Trouble is, it only takes one wobble by the cyclist or one texting driver to create a disaster. It would be wise to address these stacked odds by separating the two. I'd be happy to shout the NSW Roads Minister a study trip to Germany to see how it's done … flying economy and staying Airbnb of course.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:11:30.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
