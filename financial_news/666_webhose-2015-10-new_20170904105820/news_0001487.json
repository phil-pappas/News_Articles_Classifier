Strategize a plan to defeat student loans now. If you're a homeowner in a high-tax state, you know that a property-tax bill is one of the biggest numbers you'll see all year. But there's something you can do about it.Should you live in New York and New Jersey -- or any Northern state -- you know that you're paying some of the highest property taxes in the nation , according to The Tax Foundation.Where I live in Northern Illinois ranks among the highest property- taxes areas in the country with a median tax of more than $6,000 per year (I pay much more than that). While I know there's little I can do to directly reduce the tax rate, I can tackle it indirectly.By appealing the assessment -- the annual estimate of what my house and property are worth -- I can reduce the basis of the final tax bill. It's a two part-formula.First, your assessment is determined by your local assessor. It reflects any increases or decreases in similar properties in your area. The \"assessed valuation\" is than multiplied by the tax rate provided by your local taxing bodies -- schools, fire departments, villages, etc. -- to come up with your tax bill.There's not much you can do to get local taxing bodies to lower their rate unless you show up at their meetings and try to get them to lower their spending. That's time consuming and highly demanding.But you can challenge your assessment, which comes out once year around this time. If you knock down the value of your home, it's going to reduce the first piece of the property-tax formula. Here's what you can challenge:-- Your property description.Check to see that the assessor had everything accurately depicted. If they have you down for four bedrooms -- and you only have three -- you can easily correct that. That will result in a lower valuation.Be sure to see if the finished square footage of your home matches what the assessor has in the description.-- Changes in the neighborhood or structure.Did your neighborhood get hit by a natural disaster such as a tornado, flood or wildfire? Note anything that could reduce your property value.Also note any changes to your property. Did you get hit by a hailstorm and didn't get insurance coverage to fix your roof? Do you lose living space?-- Lower valuations of neighboring properties.Many have not increased in value since the 2008 meltdown. You also may still be seeing foreclosures in your area.Look at selling prices of similar homes? Have they gone down? If so, but how much?Once your present this information to your assessor, they may lower your home's value instantly. If not, you can appeal on the county level for a hearing.I check my home's value every year. The last time I appealed and adjusted my home's value to current market conditions, I was able to get a $1,000 yearly reduction in taxes.Of course, this year, I am appealing again because the assessor says my home is worth 20% more than the last regular assessment.You can fight assessment yourself or hire a property assessment consultant or lawyer to do it for you.Specialists in assessment appeals will charge you a fee for paperwork -- mine charged $50 -- then will take one-third of your take savings. It's worth it if you're going to saving thousands of dollars.The one thing you have to keep in mind is that assessors make mistakes all the time and you have to challenge them. Their way of calculating price gains may not be fair.That's why you have to get in the game to save on taxes.", "external_links": ["http://taxfoundation.org/article/new-york-new-jersey-lead-nation-property-tax-burden", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015NLA8BQ"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:14:57.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
