With a threatened strike hanging over them, negotiators from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union continued to meet on Wednesday afternoon, a Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said. The U.S. union on Tuesday called for a strike against Fiat Chrysler's U.S. operations at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Wednesday (0359 GMT Thursday) unless a new agreement on a four-year contract is reached. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook By Bernie Woodall\nDETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. union United Auto Workers' leaders on Friday approved a tentative four-year contract with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N), sending the proposed pact to 40,000 workers for a ratification vote.\nThe move follows Fiat Chrysler workers' rejection last week of a previous tentative contract. A new tentative agreement was reached on Wednesday night, averting a call by the UAW to have its members strike Fiat Chryslerâ€™s U.S. operations.\nSeveral hundred of the UAW's local leaders from its branches, mainly in the U.S. Midwest, met in Detroit to take the formal step to send the contract on to a worker vote.\nThe new deal would reshape the way in which UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler are paid, gradually eliminating the contentious two-tier pay structure. However, it will take eight years from hiring to top pay rather than a shorter period for UAW workers prior to the 2007 creation of the two-tier structure when all three Detroit automakers were struggling financially.\nThe deal is richer for second-tier workers than the one rejected by a nearly 2-to-1 margin in that it raises the top pay for newer second-tier workers to about $29 from about $19 currently, and from the top pay of $25 proposed in the rejected contract.\nFiat Chrysler is financially the weakest of the Detroit Three which also includes General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N). Its labor costs are lower than GM's or Ford's in large part because it has a higher percentage of second-tier workers.\nArthur Schwartz, a labor consultant and former GM negotiator, said this proposal is richer and that he will be \"stunned\" if it is not ratified.\n\"If (UAW members) don't vote for this, then their expectations are too unrealistic and I don't know if they can get a contract at Chrysler,\" Schwartz said after the highlights of the new deal were released.\nWhen UAW leaders sent the previous proposal to worker vote last month, Schwartz said it would have a difficult time passing.\nIf ratified, fist-tier workers would get their first raises in about a decade. They would get an immediate 3 percent raise from their current pay of about $28, and another 3 percent in the third year, along with lump sum bonuses of about $2,500 in years two and four.\nThe UAW said it agreed with the company to offer \"retirement incentive packages\" at some plants, without mentioning which ones.\n\n(Additional reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Plumb, Bernard Orr)\nFiat United Auto Workers NV", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:55:11.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
