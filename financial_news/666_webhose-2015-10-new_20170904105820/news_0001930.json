It has received funding of over USD 120 million in the last 4 years.\nIn April this year, Snapdeal acquired FreeCharge in one of the largest acquisitions in the consumer Internet space in the country.\nFreeCharge, as a platform, has 27 million registered users making more than five transactions per month per user.\n 11, 2015 11:26 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:29:02.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
