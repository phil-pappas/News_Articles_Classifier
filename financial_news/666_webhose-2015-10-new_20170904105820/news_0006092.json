Treasury CEO Mike Clarke turned from the hunted into a hunter in a few weeks. Cole Bennetts by Simon Evans Joyce Moullakis Treasury Wine Estates chief executive Mike Clarke turned from hunted to hunter in a matter of weeks in late 2014.\nJust weeks after Treasury had evaded two separate $4 billion takeover tilts by private equity firms KKR and TPG, Clarke made an initial call to Diageo chief executive Ivan Menezes in November 2014, asking if he was prepared to sell his premium Californian wine brands.\nIt was 11 months on that he finally landed his prey after a stop-start process and some tough negotiations, resulting in the $754 million acquisition on October 14 of most of British drinks giant Diageo's wine brands.\nThe whole deal had an on-again, off-again flavour for much of calendar 2015. But just a few weeks ago it accelerated, with Clarke swallowing his pride somewhat, and agreeing to buy an unwanted asset â€“ cheap and cheerful commercial wine brand Blossom Hill, which Diageo insisted be stitched together with the collection of prized United States wine brands that Clarke had always been steadfastly focused on.\nFortunately, Clarke knew the British consumer goods landscape intimately from his time as chief of Premier Foods, a food company selling a range of products including Bisto gravy and Sharwood's Asian flavours, which he ran until January 2013.\nDiageo is more than 10 times the size of Treasury, the owner of Penfolds, Wolf Blass, Wynns and Seppelt.\nBut with a market capitalisation of $46 billion and impatient investors demanding better returns from Menezes, who took the helm of the spirits and beer group in July, 2013 and who was also keen to try and revive profit growth at his own firm, the planets started to align.\nClarke kept the negotiations at a high-level company-to-company basis for most of the time. Treasury's director of strategy, Abe Salt was a key player, assisted by chief legal counsel Paul Conroy. The secret code-name for the slated transaction was initially Project Duchess, and then transformed into Project Lima.\n Goldman Sachs investment bankers, who had a longstanding relationship with the company even before it was spun out of Fosters Group, rolled their sleeves up later in the process.\nWine proving a distraction Diageo had inherited a wine business in 2000 after the break-up of global giant Seagrams and had added assets along the way. But compared with its towering spirits portfolio led by Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Baileys, Tanqueray gin and Guinness, wine was increasingly a distraction for Menezes because it generated just 4 per cent of Diageo's revenues. Diageo executives worked closely with Treasury's top brass to find a solution, horse-trading on what would be included and excluded.\nClarke's first overture to Menezes in November 2014 was just a few weeks after Clarke and his team had closed the book on Project Kingdom, where Treasury had been pursued by two private equity firms in KKR and TPG. After extensive due diligence and presentations, the Treasury board was being urged by institutional shareholders not to sell cheaply, and the private equity firms couldn't muster sufficient firepower to convince them otherwise.\nGoldman Sachs' investment bankers Christian Johnston and Zac Fletcher put the defence handbook away. But Clarke was thinking ahead. He'd showed enough in his first year that things were starting to turn around. He wanted to expand in the United States with upmarket brands that had plenty of premium grape supply. Goldman was back in the boardroom for this one, with law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, also a longstanding relationship, alongside. Partners Rodd Levy and London-based Greg Mulley were on deck for the law firm.\nIn London, UBS bankers Jonathan Rowley and Sandeep Dhillon advised Diageo. Menezes insisted that Blossom Hill, bottled in Italy and the No.2 wine brand in the entire UK market, would not be excluded from the sale. If Clarke wanted high-end Californian brands Sterling Vineyards and Beaulieu Vineyards, he would have to buy the cheap stuff as well.\nClarke did manage to exclude a big chardonnay brand, Chalone Vineyards, which Diageo had splashed out for in 2004. But there was stubbornness over Blossom Hill from Diageo.\nThis brought forward another plan Clarke had been mulling. He'd been putting most of Treasury's $35 million in savings from a cost-cutting blitz into more zip in marketing and advertising for the existing high-end premium brands like Penfolds and Wolf Blass.\nBut the commercial brands were still a problem until a masterstroke emerged. By reluctantly buying Blossom Hill, it would give more oomph and scale to the low-end business across Treasury, making it easier to eventually sell-off and concentrate on the premium end.\nThe transaction navigated three time zones. Goldman Sach's Fletcher spent time in San Francisco, just a short jaunt to the Napa Valley wine region in California.\nAs negotiations reached the pointy end, Treasury's funding arrangements were nutted out. Execution and an equitable structure for institutional and retail shareholders were crucial.\nGoldman's Sarah Rennie was involved as they opted for the PAITREO structure, which allows retail shareholders to trade their rights on the ASX while an offer is still open. It would be a fully underwritten renounceable offer to raise about $486 million, and the balance funded through new US dollar debt facilities. No other banks were involved in the secondary offering. Freehills called on Richard Loveridge and Tim McEwen to assist with the raising.\nFast forward to October 13, and after the local market closed, the finishing touches were signed. The following day Clarke was able to outline the transaction after the shares were halted on the ASX. The same morning Westpac announced a much larger raising of $3.5 billion, but Treasury's deal had a positive reception.\nIt came just a day before the global release of the new version of Penfolds Grange, Treasury's flagship wine at $785 per bottle. It isn't a big point-scorer from wine judges because it came from the difficult 2011 vintage when heavy rain soaked the vines.\nBut the strength of Grange lies in its history. In the same way, Clarke is hoping this deal will stand the test of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:35.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
