And one intricacy that very few are aware of is how bonuses are linked to the number of female employees.\nAn investor has told The Australian Financial Review of a mid-ranking female equities analyst at a US investment bank to whom he offered a job, and, as normal, a pay rise to go with it. She was keen to accept, ran it past her employer, only to be told \"You can't leave. It will impact everyone's bonuses if we don't meet our gender targets.\"\nShe stayed, after the bank offered to raise her total remuneration from about $250,000 to closer to closer to $350,000, which the fund manager chose not to match.\nBetter bonuses all round at that bank this year.\nThe debate has raged around setting hard targets to promote more women in business. Inside the board room, it seems to have settled that hard targets are not the answer. Chief Executive Women's president Diane Smith-Gander doesn't want quotas.\nBut there's plenty of hard targets inside the results-driven world of investment banking.\n US banks JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are known for being especially prescriptive in their approach, recruiters say, adding that it is not unusual to have clients tell them to compile female-only applicant lists, particularly for junior to mid-level equities analysts. The banks may not have a firm ratio for employees that needs to be met, but close scrutiny is applied.\nAt Goldman Sachs, there's an \"if not, why not?\" question asked when employee ratios aren't 50 per cent male/female. Bonuses are linked to diversity, and while there's no hard and fast target, money is at risk if there's a sense the issue isn't being adequately tackled.\nGetting more women to work within financial markets at all levels is important. Equally, closing the pay gap between men and women should be a priority.\nMale Champions of Change, which counts Goldman Sachs' Simon Rothery and Citi's Stephen Roberts in its ranks, has some numbers on the gender gap. The Workplace Gender Equality Agency has more still. Based on that data, JPMorgan had 133 females in its 477 managers, and 363 of its 777 non-managers were female at May 2014. Some 61 of Goldman Sachs' 280 managers were female, and 128 of its 272 non-managers were female. Over at Merrill Lynch, there were 27 of 143 managers who were female, and 108 females out of 208 non-managers.\nBut are these measures creating kinks in the system? And is that OK if it achieves longer term goals?\nIn the case of equities analysts, it's a surprising development at a time when equities analysts within in investment banks are widely regarded as having lost their star status - and earning power along with it. Anecdotally, banks do seem to struggle to keep female staff at the associate, or mid-ranking, level.\nBut in the case of this particular analyst, there's a bit more than just gender at play.\nThis particular US bank is rebuilding its equities franchise, and closely guarding its staff. In fact, The AFR has learned of another recent example at the same bank where a male analyst paid about $400,000 a year was offered another job at $550,000 a year. The bank met, and raised, the offer. Perhaps the only difference isn't that he didn't think gender was the reason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:05:12.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
