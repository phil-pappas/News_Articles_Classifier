WHE now has nine offices throughout the County and recently opened a tenth office in Coachella Valley. The company is also planning locations in Escondido, La Mesa, Indian Wells and Palm Springs as it surpasses $1 billion in rolling 12-month sales volume based on data from Broker Metrics. WHE representatives say the new offices are needed to serve the robust housing market in San Diego County. Although overall sales volume of single detached homes in San Diego declined slightly by about 2.697 percent in September 2015, the median sales price for area homes remains healthy at $682,667, up 4.455 percent from the same month in the prior year, according to the 2015 Greater San Diego Association of REALTORS ® summary statistics for San Diego County.\n“This type of market, with sales volumes going down slightly and prices continuing to go higher, calls for highly skilled real estate agents—and that’s what we have at the Windermere Homes & Estates offices,” said Windermere Homes & Estates Co-owner and Broker Brian Gooding. “The agents at the new offices in Alpine, Fallbrook and Scripps Ranch have a deep knowledge of their neighborhoods and know how to move properties at these higher price points we are seeing.”\nThe WHE Alpine office is located at 2605 Alpine Boulevard, in Fallbrook at 746 S. Main Avenue, and Scripps Ranch at 9988 Hibert Street.\nWHE, founded by Brian Gooding and Rich Johnson about two years ago, is the fourth largest residential real estate brokerage in San Diego based on sales and has about 320 agents.\n“It isn’t enough to just open offices and add agents, you have to set up the offices for success with the latest technology, superior agent support and unrelenting commitment to consumer satisfaction,” said Co-owner and Broker Rich Johnson. “That’s the type of approach that has gotten us to where we are today.”\nWindermere Homes & Estates plans to add more agents.
