They have been out of power ever since, and only eight Liberal legislators in the new parliament have held a full cabinet post.\nAnother top candidate is Bill Morneau, 53, former chief of the C.D. Howe economic think tank and the head of human resources firm Morneau Shepell. He was first elected to office on Monday.\nTwo veteran Liberals, stressing the need to calm markets which might be jittery about a new and relatively inexperienced government, said they believe Goodale's previous tenure at finance meant he would be favorite for the job.\nA spokesman for Goodale declined to make him available.\nCrafting the cabinet is a job for Trudeau's transition team, which a Liberal source said would be headed by former senior federal bureaucrat Peter Harder.\nOther candidates likely to become ministers include:\n* Dominic LeBlanc, 47, a lawyer and friend of Trudeau's. Leader of the Liberals in the House of Commons\n* Chrystia Freeland, 47, a former Reuters journalist and author, currently international trade spokeswoman\n* Marc Garneau, 66, a former astronaut, now Liberal foreign affairs spokesman\n* Joyce Murray, 61, a former businesswoman, now the party's defense spokeswoman\n* David McGuinty, 55, a lawyer who serves as the party's transport spokesman\n* Melanie Joly, 36, a lawyer and public relations executive, close to Trudeau.
