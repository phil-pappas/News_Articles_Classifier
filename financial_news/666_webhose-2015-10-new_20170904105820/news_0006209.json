Bloomberg Share on twitter by James Chessell For a while there it seemed as if that 131-year-old stalwart of the British high street, Marks & Spencer, really was going to grace Australia with its presence.\nJust over two years ago, Marks & Spencer executives were said to be scouring for suitable spaces in malls along the east coast with the 333 George Street redevelopment in the heart of Sydney's central business district reported to be a favourite. Two new directors were then appointed to a private company, Marks & Spencer (Australia) Pty Ltd, which had lain dormant for years. And if that was not enough excitement, the £8.1 billion ($16.9 billion) company's chief executive, Marc Bolland, announced plans to open 250 new stores outside Britain over three years.\nHaving walked away from a partnership with Just Jeans in 2011, blaming the low Australian dollar and the Asian economic crisis, it appeared to be only a matter of time before M&S was back and Australian consumers were picking through the famous socks and underwear range.\nThis has clearly not happened. Marks & Spencer's long-established website remains its only direct relationship with local shoppers.\nHowever, many observers believe it is only a matter of time before this changes. Given other high-profile global retailers such as Spain's Zara, Japan's Uniqlo, Britain's Topshop and Sweden's H&M opening stores in Sydney and Melbourne in recent years, it made no sense that Marks & Spencer would choose to miss out on the Australian market. If all those rising overseas retailers could make a fist of it in Australia, then surely the venerable M&S could? Or so the argument goes.\nH&m pop up boxes rocking Pitt street mall pic.twitter.com/EilqHNhEWz\n— Carolyn Cummins (@msccummins) October 8, 2015 It is certainly possible Marks & Spencer will eventually add Australia to an international footprint covering about 450 stores in 49 territories including India, China and much of Europe. But while the official word out of the London head office remains \"no comment\" when the subject of Australian store openings is raised, there are enough signs to suggest M&S is in no great hurry.\nThe international expansion plans announced by Mr Bolland in April 2014 have been dialled back in recent months. M&S executive director of marketing and international, Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, said last month that slowing Chinese economic growth and Russian military aggression had prompted a rethink in both those countries.\n 'Bricks and clicks' offshore strategy \"It's reasonable in that context that you would expect a different outlook on the next three years for the company,\" Mr Bousquet-Chavanne told Reuters.\nMarks & Spencer has what it describes as a \"bricks and clicks\" offshore strategy, where it establishes flagship stores in major cities supported by stand-alone M&S Food and lingerie outlets and a country-specific online offering.\nThe retailer has learnt the hard way. In 2001, former chairman Luc Vandevelde shut down its entire continental European business after 26 years of trading, only to return with the opening of a new Paris store a decade later. Having watched the once-mighty British supermarket chain Tesco struggle in China, Marks & Spencer has said it is evaluating local partners in the region.\nMr Bolland hopes to boost international sales by a quarter and push profit up by 40 per cent. However, the results have thus far failed to impress, with offshore operating profit dropping 25 per cent to £92 million for the year ended March 2015, compared with an 8 per cent rise to £670 million in Britain.\nAnother reason not to get too excited about an Australian opening for M&S is is a lack of good sites. As far as Sydney is concerned, commercial property types claim 333 George Street is problematic because of the construction work going on in the area. Pitt Street Mall would be a logical location, but it is now effectively full with fast fashion outlets such as H&M, while Myer and David Jones are said to be not wildly keen about having another department store nearby.\nEven if there was space available, it remains to be seen whether Marks & Spencer would be interested. Pitt Street Mall is among the top five most expensive places in the world to rent retail space according to the 2014-15 edition of Cushman and Wakefield's Main Streets Across the World survey.\nMarks & Spencer reported its first increase in underlying profit for four years in April thanks to another strong performance from its food division, which continues to steal customers from the supermarket chains. However, the performance of its clothing business – which was run until July by future David Jones boss John Dixon – has been underwhelming for years now.\nYounger shoppers prefer the likes of Zara and the older, core M&S market is being presented with a better shopping experience with newer, more attractive department stores such as John Lewis.\nMeanwhile, supermarket chains such as Sainsbury's are devoting more of their floor space to apparel. And in a possible sign of things to come in Australia, Marks & Spencer faces increased competition such as value chain Pep & Co, which hopes to do to fashion retailing what Germany's Aldi did to supermarkets. Pep & Co is backed by South African billionaire Christo Wiese and is not a company lacking in confidence. It announced plans in July to open no less than 50 new British stores in eight weeks.\nSports Direct also expected Down Under Another British retail chain that has been expected to make its mark in Australia is Sports Direct.\nControlled by the mercurial owner of the Newcastle United football club, Mark Ashley, the London Stock Exchange-listed Sports Direct International has enjoyed an almost 20-fold increase in its share price since the global financial crisis in 2008.\nThrough the intelligent and ruthless exploitation of its own brands such as Dunlop and Londsdale – as well as the careful management of third-party suppliers such as Nike and Puma – Sports Direct has become a FTSE 100 company with a market capitalisation of more than £4 billion and genuine growth prospects.\nMr Ashley is not popular with corporate governance experts due to the company's remuneration policy. And he has used Sports Direct as a vehicle to launch raids on several other British retailers including struggling department store chain Debenhams. Yet the company's share price has outperformed most of its peers.\nIn July last year, Sports Direct bought into Australian \"flash sale\" website OzSale.com.au. It also announced plans to open three \"flagship stores\" in Australia and one in NZ, \"replicating its UK retail model\" in a partnership with a \"leading Australian retailer\" that will be announced \"shortly\".\nBut once again, precious little has happened.\nDespite recent speculation that Mr Ashley was keen to buy a stake in the ASX-listed Super Retail , which owns the Rebel Sport chain, Sports Direct has so far failed to make good on its promise about new stores in Australia.\nThe company's strategy is hard to predict at the best of times, given Mr Ashley rarely gives interviews. Even basic questions about its Australian expansion plans are ignored by Sports Direct's public relations company, Powerscourt. (Although a possible explanation for Powerscourt's ineptitude could be the fact Sports Direct's chief executive David Forsey faces criminal charges for alleged breaches of UK employment law.)\nHowever, it seem that, just like for Marks & Spencer, the Australian retail sector has proved to be a hard nut to crack for this particular UK retailer.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/EilqHNhEWz", "http://corporate.marksandspencer.com/media/press-releases/2014/marks-and-spencer-unveils-plans-for-further-international-growth-fuelled-by-250-new-stores-over-three-years", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/86817fda-6ea2-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a.html#axzz3oAkQXmv6", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/marks--spencer-eyes-site-in-george-street-20131219-2znxl.html", "http://beta.iol.co.za/business/international/retailer-ms-slows-foreign-expansion-1914633", "http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/01/pepco-becomes-latest-high-street-discounter-with-first-store-in-kettering", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10737831/Marks-and-Spencer-plans-massive-international-expansion.html", "http://www.powerretail.com.au/news/marks-and-spencer-australia/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/ms-postpones-move-into-australia-1166945.html", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e02f03c2-feb8-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3oAkQXmv6", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/marks--spencer-thinks-small-as-it-gears-up-for-australian-debut-20140128-31kpk.html", "https://twitter.com/msccummins/status/651977799079596033", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mike-ashley-swaps-debenhams-share-stake-for-options-in-baffling-move-9064348.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:13:20.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
