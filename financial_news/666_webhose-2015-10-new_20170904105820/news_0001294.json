Around 80% of this is oil and 20% gas. It is led by Tullow Oil, with partners Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Kosmos Energy LLC, Andarko Petroleum and PetroSA. \nThe reservoirs are spread over 800 kilometres and lie in water depths of between 1,000 and 1,800 metres. \nThe TEN appraisal programme started in January and continued in 2012 with the drilling of three wells. The Owo-IRA well was drilled and successfully tested in January at combined rates in excess of 20,000 bopd . \nEnyenra-4A was drilled in March 2012, intersecting 32 metres of oil-pay. Water injection tests on this down-dip well were carried out in April 2012, with results proving that the Enyenra channel sands are suitable for water injection to support oil production. \nThe Ntomme-2A well was drilled in January 2012 and \"found oil (the Ntomme discovery well) down-dip of the Tweneboa-3ST non-associated gas discovery\". \nThe well was production- tested in May 2012 at combined flow rates in excess of 20,000 bopd , confirming excellent quality reservoir. \nDevelopment of the TEN Project requires the drilling and completion of up to 24 development wells, of which 10 are ready for the first oil to be connected through sub-sea infrastructure to the Prof. John Atta Mills FPSO vessel moored in 1,500 metres of water. \nMr. Darko described efforts by the Partners to ensure timely execution of the project as evidence of their determination to see rapid development of the country's economy. \nFor him, gas from the TEN Project will go a long way to open up the economy, which will make it more competitive in the sub-region. \nCEO of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Alex Mould, reaffirmed the corporation's commitment to ensuring that the industry continues to work for overall national development. \nHe spoke about progress being made in local content policy, legislation and good practice, which has led to development of the TEN Project. \nHe said the foundations are being laid for the country to develop a viable industry, wherein world-class shipÂ­builders will partner locals in developing a world-class marine construction industry. \nThe sector, he said, holds great promise which when properly harnessed can positively impact on the lives of the people, but there was the need for increased participation by the state; therefore, the GNPC had among other things instituted a number of initiatives to enhance skills development of the youth in oil and gas to enhance employment. \nMr. Mould said making the petroleum sector an integral part of the wider economy has enabled resources from the sector to provide opportunity to bridge the national infrastructure gap, the institutional and national skills gap in the oil and gas industry and allied sectors, to ensure greater employment of Ghanaians. \nHe said oil and gas cannot transform the country's fortune by themselves, and any transformation can't happen overnight: it will take well- planned and coordinated efforts to fully realise and retain the benefits of oil and gas operations for the people of Ghana. \nTullow has interests in two licences offshore Ghana: Deepwater Tano and West Cape Three Points, with the Jubilee Field straddling both licence areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:56:53.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
