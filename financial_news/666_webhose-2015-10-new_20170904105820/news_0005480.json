The Navy is due to follow suit in late 2018.\nBogdan said another potential concern was the need to modify the jets needed for the initial combat-ready squadron, which reduced the number of planes available for pilot training. But the Pentagon was working closely with the Air Force to find solutions to the aircraft shortfall, he said.\nIn general, he said, the F-35 program was showing increased reliability and passing significant testing milestones, including ground test firings of internal weapons.\nHe said the department was still working to reduce Lockheed's control over the maintenance of the jets, resolve shortfalls of spare parts, reduce the cost of building the jets, and ensure completion of critical software.
