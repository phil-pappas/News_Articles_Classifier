Jay Cronan by Joanna Mather A row over how alcohol is taxed has deepened after a report by the Parliamentary Budget Office revealed the vastly different levies applied to wine, spirits and beer.\nThe report released on Wednesday shows the effective tax rate on the alcohol content in niche craft beers can be as low as $1.71, while the effective rate on a $40 bottle of wine is much higher at $45.55 a litre.\nThe tax on spirits and commercially produced beer is higher still.\nThe figures will add to tension among alcohol producers, who are split over whether wine should be taxed at the same rate as spirits and beer.\nAnd in a further development, the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education has told the government's tax review that levelling the playing field could boost government revenue by $2.5 billion a year, although it would cost jobs.\nThe Winemakers' Federation of Australia, members of which benefit from preferential tax treatment under current arrangements, insisted there was no broad appetite for change.\n\"We are of the firm belief that our unique role in regional Australia and the unique commercial challenges we face are appreciated and will therefore continue to be recognised in these tax rates,\" the federation's chief executive, Paul Evans, said.\nEach year, the government collects $6 billion, or 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, in alcohol taxes. There are effectively two types of taxes: one applied to mass-produced beer and spirits, and the other to wine.\n Alcohol content The PBO report says rates vary considerably according to product type, from as low as $1.71 per litre of alcohol for low-strength, non-commercial beer to $79.38 per litre of alcohol for spirits and ready-to-drink beverages.\nOn wine, rates range from from $2.99 for a $15 four-litre cask through to $45.52 for a $40 bottle.\nWhile beer and spirits are taxed according to their alcohol content, under the wine equalisation tax (WET) and rebate system, wine is taxed according to its wholesale price.\nWine producers can access a rebate of 29 per cent of the tax on domestic sales. But the federal Treasury has estimated that rorting of the system could cost taxpayers $350 million-plus by 2016 .\nThe Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education says preferential tax treatment of wine should be scrapped to boost revenue and reduce alcohol consumption.\nThe move should be a \"no brainer\" for the government, chief executive Michael Thorn says.\nThe foundation has provided the government with modelling by ACIL Allen Consulting showing what would happen if alcohol taxes were overhauled.\nIn one scenario the WET would be replaced with a tax rate of $56.46 a litre, which is half way between the full-strength draught beer rate and spirits rate.\nThis would raise an extra $2.3 billion extra but result in the loss of nearly 15,000 full-time jobs.\nTreasury Wine Estates and Pernod Ricard have broken ranks to advocate for a flat tax per bottle of wine which is still lower than spirits or beer. The move has angered thousands of other winemakers in the industry.\nDiageo Australia managing director, Tim Salt, said all alcohol should be taxed at the same rate , regardless of its form.\n\"The breathalyser doesn't discriminate between beer, wine and spirits. So why should the tax man?\" he told The Australian Financial Review in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:24:03.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
