Mr Mendes, also a justice at Brazil’s top court, recently asked prosecutors to investigate the campaign.\nEfforts to contact staff who worked in the campaign for comment were unsuccessful. Ms Rousseff’s office declined to comment on the probe.\nThe electoral court, known as TSE, voted 5 to 2 on the decision last week. An investigation aims to find out whether Ms Rousseff and her running mate, Vice President Michel Temer, abused their power while in office to run the campaign and whether illegal money was used as funding.\nThe opening of the police probe could add fuel to opposition attempts in Congress to impeach Ms Rousseff. Those efforts lost traction earlier in the week after Ms Rousseff and Lower House Speaker Eduardo Cunha forged an uneasy truce as both face the risk of being ousted from office.\nIf found guilty, Ms Rousseff’s victory last October could be invalidated, though the judicial case is expected to last for months if not years and can be appealed to the Supreme Court.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:27:30.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
