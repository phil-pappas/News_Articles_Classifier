A greater number of mega-deals has masked a marked drop in the volume of deals – in the mid-market, which strips out deals valued above $US500 million, numbers dropped by 159 to just over 1200 deals.\nBut signs of an uplift across the board were promising, he said, particularly driven by the property and telecommunications sectors.\n \"I do genuinely think that the last quarter of this year will be stronger by volume than the one just through,\" he said. \"Certainly I think that the private equity acquisition pipeline is stronger.\"\nAllens M&A co-head Guy Alexander called the market \"extremely hot\", underridden by activity in the infrastructure sector, particularly from privatisation projects. \"We are as busy now as we have been since the boom times,\" he said.\nAllens is acting for Oil Search in the potential $10.2 billion Woodside Petroleum takeover , along with other deals such as the $2.5 billion Equifax bid for rival data management company Veda .\nPressure to drive growth \"There is still pressure on boards to drive growth somehow, and organic growth is hard to find in fairly developed markets, so that drives M&A,\" he said. \"When boards start to see other companies doing M&A they feel more confident – it's self-fulfilling in many ways.\"\nHSF partner Simon Haddy said the uptick hoped for a year ago, when the Aussie dollar was tracking low, as were financing costs, and opportunities were opening in the market, probably didn't eventuate for the first half of 2015.\nBut the second half has seen the trends manifest in an increasing deal flow, he said, such as the $1.7 billion Swisse vitamins deal.\n\"Private equity deals are increasingly prevalent. They've probably not made their way into the public domain yet, but we think the signs are positive.\"\nBrisbane boutique Talbot Sayer Lawyers, which soared up the mid-market charts to take fifth place by deal number, has seen M&A activity driven by long-term strategic buyers from Asia, particularly in agribusiness in a bid for food security.\n\"We haven't acted for any foreign buyers but we've seen a lot of activity, particularly in the cattle space,\" said Talbot Sayer partner Tim Sayer.\nMr Sayer said that M&A activity should have been at all-time highs due to the economic conditions in the past year. That didn't happen – perhaps in part due to the uncertainty in government changes over the past five years, he said.\nBut he said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, despite causing another change, had a positive flow-on effect in business confidence.\nThe firm has a strong focus on private equity deals, which Mr Sayer said had been strong and countered the general trend, insulating the firm.\nThomson Reuters global head of capital markets & advisory Leon Saunders Calvert said Australian M&A activity reflected the \"slight uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific markets in 2015\".\n\"Ongoing access to funding and insight into the likely impact of China outfall in the wider region will be the determining factors in CEO confidence for continued deal activity going into the end of the year and into 2016.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:09:59.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
