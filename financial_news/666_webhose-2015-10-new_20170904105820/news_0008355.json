Bloomberg Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Success in finally hammering out a multilateral trade deal in Atlanta would be a big win for the negotiating skills of Australian Trade Minister Andrew Robb as well as for a Turnbull government anxious to emphasise good economic news.\nDespite the momentum, nothing can ever be guaranteed in these deals until it's all signed. Too many press conferences to claim a breakthrough had been scheduled only to be withdrawn as talks dragged on.\nBut assuming no more potholes – as looked likely – Robb should now be able to focus on explaining the benefits of the agreement to the Australian public.\nThis is vital in overwhelming inevitable complaints from various interest groups (especially the Nationals) as well as alarmist concerns about data and IP protection.\nIllustration: David Rowe And with Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison to back up the rhetoric, the TPP would become a useful marker of improved national confidence that future opportunities outweigh risks.\nCompromise on patents Robb led the fight to get a compromise on America's insistence on extending patent protection of biologic medicines to a minimum of eight years. This included many tense meetings with the US trade representative Mike Froman amid accusations Australia's obduracy was threatening the whole deal.\nInstead, Robb held firm to Australia's own position it would not extend the current five-year period of protection. He knew the additional and unwarranted cost to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would never sell at home.\n But like any good negotiator, Robb came up with a two-track plan to sell the US. Countries could sign onto the US version of an eight-year exemption or stick to their own national patent system as long as it met certain standards – as Australia's certainly does. This offered a way around the main roadblock to an agreement, particularly getting concessions in other sensitive areas like dairy market access.\nAustralia certainly won't get anything like it wanted on agriculture – particularly on sugar quotas. But any 12-nation Trans Pacific Partnership agreement would still represent enormous and overdue reduction in trade barriers, especially in services and intellectual property. And the terms had become the last best offer in a such a complex and protracted negotiation before US elections take over the timetable.\nThat's also true of Robb's other big negotiating success – the China Free Trade Agreement. But it looks increasingly likely he will now have to apply similar negotiating skills even more urgently to dealing with Labor's internal contradictions.\nInaccurate union campaign| That's because the agreement is still suffering parliamentary birthing pains thanks to Labor's objections. These are being fuelled by an aggressively inaccurate union campaign against the deal allowing Chinese workers to be employed at the expense of Australians. The criticism is really more about bolstering traditional union complaints against the whole concept of temporary visas for overseas skilled workers. But a highly misleading union ad campaign allows for no such subtleties.\nAnd with Bill Shorten's leadership more than ever dependent on the support of unions like Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, he cannot afford to ignore their demands. That's why Labor has been trying a double play – arguing it backs the agreement but that there should be simultaneous changes to the Migration Act, supposedly to \"protect Australian jobs\".\nAndrew Robb has quickly dismissed any prospect of agreeing to \"CFMEU wish list\" or doing anything to compromise the agreement or which looks like discrimination against China. And under Abbott's Prime Ministership, the government was determined to call Labor's political bluff for what it was. The emphasis was on beating up Labor for being beholden to militant unions and being willing to risk Australia's economic future.\nAll of which is true. But it is also precisely the problem.\nShorten has backed himself into a corner with the unions. There is indeed a risk he could undermine the national interest by blocking the free trade agreement if he is left without even a fig leaf to justify a switch. That stance might not be any good for Labor's image as a party that has any understanding of Australia's economic potential. But it would still help Shorten manage some of the internal party and union pressures short term – despite the broader economic and political damage this would cause.\nMore room to move Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott was prepared to contemplate this outcome as still offering a political win for the government and a powerful weapon with which to bludgeon Labor right up until the election. In a Turnbull government, a more pragmatic view about the need to get the deal done dominates, giving Robb more room to move.\nIf it is possible for legislation that actually doesn't change anything but offers Shorten a relatively painless way to save face, it is considered worth discussing if it means getting the FTA safely through the Senate by year end.\nThe most likely common ground for \"compromise\" – however meaningless in practice – is in the area of major projects over $150 million. Under the China deal, what are known as Investment Facilitation Agreements don't initially require testing of the local labour market to receive approval to use foreign workers.\nThis only becomes necessary later when a project progresses to the point of construction or final negotiations. At that point, Australia's normal immigration guidelines and requirements for visas, including labour market testing, apply anyway. So the government has argued anything else is superfluous – and that is right.\nBut one option for Labor would be to maintain this requirement needs to be legislated for all major project agreements rather than just following normal official practice. For the government, it should mean no real change.\nAny such deal would rely on Labor not ratcheting up unrealistic demands for substantive change. Robb's negotiating skills will again be tested – and testing of Labor. We should soon see the results.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:05:15.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
