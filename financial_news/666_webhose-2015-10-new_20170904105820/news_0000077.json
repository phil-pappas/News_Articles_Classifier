The Dow fell 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq 0.3 percent.\n\"It's not a very healthy recovery when pharmaceuticals are leading the charge,\" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA. \"Investors are picking up defensives and pretty expensive defensives at that.\"\nThe Topix subindex for pharmaceuticals gained 2.3 percent as investors moved out of cyclicals that had been bought during recent bouts of short-covering. Kyowa Hakko Kirin rose 4.8 percent and Daiichi Sankyo Co shares climbed 4.4 percent.\nJapan's steel sector, which tumbled 4.5 percent on Wednesday, bounced back 1 percent during morning trading. Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal rose 0.7 percent while JFE Holdings gained 1.3 percent.\nSteel has been one of the Nikkei's top performing sectors since late September and traders said it's remained active because of short-covering that has resulted in big price moves.\nThe broader Topix rose 0.9 percent to end the morning session at 1,483.88 while the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 gained 0.9 percent to 13,285.69.
