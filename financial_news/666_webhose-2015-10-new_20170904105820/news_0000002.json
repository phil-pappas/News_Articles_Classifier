Compared to home or auto loans the processing is faster and easier. Do credit cards and personal loans help your credit score or not? If yes then how? A higher CIBIL score is useful when applying for a home or auto loan as it not only improves the chances of the loan application being accepted but it can also get the applicant competitive rates.\nCredit Cards and CIBIL Score:\nCredit cards are the simplest way to start a credit trail; plus there is no interest to be paid unlike loans if the card is used wisely. So in case you have no CIBIL rating and are looking to have one, apply for a credit card; if you already have one then also following a few tips can help your credit score.\nThe basic mantra for maintaining a good credit score is paying on time! Nothing can beat this simple yet very important rule. A CIBIL score is all about the way one has treated his/her debt in the past. Nothing can spoil the credit score like delayed payments or missed payments. Once in a while it may happen but ideally should be avoided.\nNow the RBI has given a three day grace period also for making payments. Reporting to CIBIL or other credit agencies will be done in case of payment is delayed beyond three days; this can work in the favor of customer in case there are holidays or one forgets to pay on the due date.\nIf for any reason one is unable to make a full payment, explore the option of paying the minimum amount due. This will not be considered as a default and be reported to credit agencies. You will have to pay interest on overdue amount but are saved from getting a default in the CIBIL report and also paying charges for default.\nIn case one is making a fresh start with a credit history, make regular small transactions ideally below 30% of your sanctioned limit and pay them on time. For those who already have a trail and are looking at improving their CIBIL score, a low credit utilization ratio can do wonders.\nThis is second most important factor that affects the rating. A ratio can be lowered by either controlling the spending or increasing credit limit. Reduce unbudgeted and whimsical spending so that credit utilization stays low. If your eligibility criteria allows then get a higher credit limit sanctioned.\nOne card used regularly but not touching sanctioned limit and timely payments are enough to give you a stable credit trail. In case of multiple cards, cards with a deeper history and minimum or no defaults should be kept in case one wants to surrender a card for any reason.\nIt pays to sort out old pending issues with the credit card company. Too many credit cards reflect credit hungry behavior.\nPersonal Loans and CIBIL Score:\nA good mix of secured and unsecured debt is helpful for a good credit score. A personal loan is an unsecured loan; however it is an installment loan and is not revolving debt like the credit card.\nIt is not advisable to take a personal loan just to improve the CIBIL score as they are expensive and in case you already have revolving credit in the form of credit card then it is adding to the unsecured loan category in the mix of loans.\nSince personal loans are not for a specific purpose they can be used for any purpose from buying a new phone, a holiday or paying off your credit card dues. A personal loan can be used to pay off pending credit card dues in case one is looking to improve the CIBIL score; but after careful analysis and thought.\nIf one can get a personal loan at favorable terms (interest rate is lower than what is being charged by the credit card company) then it makes sense to use this option for paying dues which may have accumulated and reflect as outstanding in the credit card statement. This can improve the CIBIL score.\nIf a personal loan is required for some genuine reason then just be careful that one pays on time so that no defaults happen (which lower CIBIL Score).\nWhile a credit card is a non interest free way to get a credit trail, personal loans are an expensive and are no value add if one already has a credit card in getting a good CIBIL score.\nToo much unsecured loan on the other hand can harm the CIBIL rating.\n 03, 2015 1:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:07:23.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
