The fact that the new vehicle was lighter than the Bushmaster should give it \"enormous potential\" in the export market, Defence Minister Marise Payne said at a contract signing ceremony.\nVehicles made by U.S. defence giant General Dynamics Corp and its Force Protection unit were also tested by Australia's defence force, according to The Australian newspaper.\n($1 = 1.4180 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Sonali Paul ; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:45:14.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
