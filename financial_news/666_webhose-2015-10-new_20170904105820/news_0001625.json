Share on twitter by James Thomson There is little doubt that would-be chief executives of Woolworths would be spending a fair bit of time poring over the first-quarter numbers from Wesfarmers , released on Thursday.\nAnd what they have seen would give them plenty to think about.\nThe first point to make is that winning back any market share in the grocery business is going to be very, very tough. Coles is showing no signs of taking its foot off Woolworths' throat by using its market leadership to restore its profit margins in even a small way.\nInstead, it's investing more in discounting, which will probably come at the expense of margin but will ensure that Woolworths can't make any quick comeback. The next CEO will surely need patience in the supermarkets area, and probably even more money to invest in lowering prices.\nBut the numbers out of Wesfarmers' Bunnings subsidiary and its discount department stores Target and Kmart are also fascinating from Woolworths' perspective – even more so in the light of reports that private equity could be stalking Big W.\nPut simply, the numbers could help build a case for keeping or flicking Big W and Masters. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that KKR & Co and TPG Capital have made preliminary approaches about Big W, which could be valued at about $1.5 billion.\nKmart, which its clear cheap-as-chips strategy, found another gear after dropping its prices again; same-store sales rose 8.6 per cent and total sales 12.5 per cent to $1.1 billion.\nTarget, which sits between Kmart and Myer, and has been Wesfarmers' problem child, provided more evidence of its turnaround by returning to growth for the first time in years; same-store sales rose 3.2 per cent and total sales 3.1 per cent to $776 million\n For a chief executive who wanted to keep Big W, these results show the discount department store format is not dead and if Woolworths can get Big W's positioning right – it's arguably caught somewhere between Kmart and Target – then the chain has a future.\nOf course, for the CEO who wanted to flog off the Big W business, the Wesfarmers' numbers could be seen as providing as providing evidence that it need not be a fire sale.\nThe numbers for Bunnings set up a similar conundrum. The business is a powerhouse; even with Masters trying to lift its game, it delivered same-store sales growth of 8.2 per cent and increased total sales by 11.6 per cent to $2.5 billion.\nThese are the sorted of numbers that attracted Woolies into the sector in the first place, of course – surely with its retail experience it can grab a share of this $45 billion hardware pie by providing strong competition?\nIt hasn't worked out like that, but again these latest Bunnings numbers could be a bit of siren's song to Woolies next chief executive. If they can get the store format right, if they can get the product mix right, if they can get more good sites, then surely it can work.\nIf, if, if. The big problem for a new chief executive and for the newish chair Gordon Cairns is of course that turning around Big W and Masters is going to take so much time, money and effort at a time when all of those things arguably need to be focused on fixing the supermarkets business.\nAnd at every quarterly result that Woolworths delivers, the Big W and Masters numbers are going to be picked apart, potentially drowning out any good news the new chief may be able to deliver.\nSome very tough decisions lie ahead.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:07:05.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
