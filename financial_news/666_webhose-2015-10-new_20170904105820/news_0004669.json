Louie Douvis \"You can expand your empire if you're a corporate, by buying existing factories but what they're very reluctant to do is build factories.\"\nLondon-based Mr Buckland is one of the world's best-known strategists because of his work exploring the rise of the dividend cash cows and bond refugees in a world of ultra-low interest rates. After a correction in global markets, he sees the \"ageing bull market\" continuing before it is punctured by a true bear market.\nThe strategist said at the start of his career it would have been \"unthinkable\" that \"equity markets everywhere would be yielding more than bonds\".\nAnother feature of equity markets is that in many parts of the world they are shrinking. That might have consequences for capital markets that are not fully understood yet.\n On a kind of strike \"It's not particularly helpful if the main growth-sponsoring asset class, which is what equities are supposed to be, is on a kind of strike. It doesn't mean that equity isn't available. Maybe one of the things we're missing here is proper genuine equity – you coming to me with a good idea … We are seeing that kind of capital being provided now, but it's more by the venture capitalists,\" he said.\n\"We're providing an exit strategy for the VCs. The sharemarket is a capital extractor not a capital provider nowadays, which has profound implications.\"\nHe told The Australian Financial Review in 2013 that the traditional distinctions between equities and bonds have been blurred and warned the twist may have consequences for growth, investment and jobs creation. Low interest rates and the reliance on dividends creates a risk that \"we're almost forcing companies to under-invest,\" he said at the time. He also foreshadowed the transformation of mining companies from \"being devourers of capital to returners of capital\".\nLittle has changed. Further easing in 2015 from the commodity economies including Canada and New Zealand, and anticipation of more policy accommodation from China, mean that conditions stay loose and the great yield trade lives on.\nFinancial markets are pricing in a higher probability that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut rates soon, even though the central bank suggests it's in no rush to cut . On Wednesday, there was a 92 per cent chance of a move to 1.75 per cent linked to the RBA's February meeting.\nCitigroup is forecasting a 20 per cent rise in global equities by the end of 2016 . \"This global bull market is ageing, but not finished,\" Mr Buckland has said. The bank sees earnings per share growth of 8 per cent next year, which is close to what market pricing implies but lower than consensus.\nMr Buckland's team sees Australia as an \"underweight\" region, preferring exposures in Japan and Europe, however, Citigroup's index target for the ASX 200 is 6200 by the end of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:02:37.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
