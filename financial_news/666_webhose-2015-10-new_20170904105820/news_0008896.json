They contemplate whether they will have enough money or not; if they’ll out live those fund; and whether they have their savings allocated correctly to name a few.But many people don’t think about flipping through their employee handbook before retirement and as a result may be leaving unclaimed time and money on the table.I was recently talking to a family member at an event and learned he was retiring. After congratulating him, I asked when the big day was and what led to him making the decision.He was very specific, including both a date and time.“January 31, at 4pm” he said.“Okay, you’ve really got the date and time nailed down don't you,” I replied… adding, “Any significance to the 4pm?”He laughed, “Yes I was going to retire at the end of the year but after I told my boss about my plans he suggested I read through the employee handbook to see what I might be missing out on.\"It turns out that he is eligible for his annual bonus and 7 weeks of his vacation if he is employed through that date. While, I don’t know his exact pay and bonus arrangement, I don’t think it would be a stretch to say he may have added three additional months of pay by working the extra month. A return any investor would truly appreciate.[caption id=\"attachment_34674994\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Know your benefits before retiring (Photographer: Dennis Brack/Bloomberg News)[/caption]In another example, a client was struggling with her evolving position at work. New management and a host of changes including technology upgrades and training had her frazzled and wanting to retire like never before. She despised going to work, was uncomfortable with her younger co-workers and felt mentally and physically drained after each day. The issue was that it was all happening a year before she planned to retire. She hoped to exit at 62 and claim Social Security to make up for lost income and to cover health insurance costs.She contemplated going part-time but the stress combined with lost benefits and seniority just didn’t seem worth it. After 20 years of dedicated service she was faced with throwing it all away simply because so much had changed in just the last six months.Then I received the call. “Jim and I went through the employee handbook and found that I am eligible for a six month leave of absence. It’s unpaid, but we can use it to see if we can adjust our budget or for me to find something else I like to do part-time. If not, they will hold my position and I can just tough it out for the remaining six months before I turn 62.I applauded their efforts for not giving into the emotional toll and just throwing in the towel. Instead, they got creative and looked for ways to use what they earned as a long-term employee.There can also be health benefits to understanding your benefits handbook prior to retirementundefined. One client needed to have a knee replaced, so he decided to use his short-term medical benefits plus some vacation and sick time to not only get paid while he recovered but to also accrue the final few months for his full pension.The timing would also leave him retiring one week after his 66 th birthday and eligible for full Social Security benefits. By combining short-term medical with vacation and sick time, he literally walked into retirement feeling strong, confident, and secure.[/entity]In each case, those nearing retirement used their situation, timing, and employee benefits to improve both their personal as well as financial health. Therefore, don’t just focus on the binder that your financial professional prepares for you but also the one that your employer provides for you. It just may contain a creative option that allows you to maximize what you have worked for while reducing stress, improving your physical well-being, and adding extra dollars to your retirement savings.Join the movement to live a happy, healthy, and connected retirement in our Retirement Project Community .
