It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has also undergone significantly belt-tightening, with the government deficit having shrunken from -11pc in 2009. \nMr Rajoy's Partido Popular party, which has complied with Brussels' demand for austerity, has fallen behind the opposition Socialist party in polls ahead of the election on December 20. The vote has been billed as a plebiscite on the ruling government's economic policies. \nBrussels intervention could also embolden anti-austerity sentiment in the country - including the hard-Left Podemos movement which has vowed to resist economic diktats from the EU. The decision could also complicate Madrid's relationship with the Catalan government, which is demanding more fiscal autonomy after its separatist leaders won regional elections last month. \nPierre Moscovici, the EU's economics chief, denied the Commission's judgement was motivated by the looming general election. \n\"We use rules, there is no ideology in our work\", said Mr Moscovici. \"What counts is to talk about figures. We work on the basis of facts\". \nValdis Dombrovskis, the Commission's vice-president said: \"The substance of the analysis is not affected by elections\". \nMadrid will now need to provide more details on how it plans to curb local government spending and \"stay the course of reforms\" said Mr Dombrovskis. \nDespite being hailed as one of the eurozone's model pupils, Spain's economic recovery has attracted high-profile detractors. \nOlivier Blanchard, the recently departed chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said the country's \"growth miracle\" was largely illusory. \n\"When people talk about the Spanish miracle, I react\", said Mr Blanchard. \n\"When you have 23pc unemployment and 3pc growth, I don't call this a miracle yet.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:44:18.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
