Sylvia Liber Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan When union delegates representing BlueScope Steel workers gathered at the Australian Workers Union's Wollongong branch late on Tuesday afternoon, the atmosphere was uncomfortable, even stifling. An airconditioning unit had broken down, and the room temperature felt like 40 degrees.\nIt was hardly an ideal environment for these blue-collar warriors to be making one of the most momentous decisions of their working lives.\nNot only were they being urged to accept the loss of hundreds of colleagues' jobs, their union leaders were telling them to cop a three-year pay freeze and a workplace restructure that would see conditions hard won over decades eventually disappear.\nSuch concessions would have been unthinkable not long ago. But unions realised BlueScope's warning that operational costs, including 500 jobs, would have to be slashed at the Port Kembla steelworks or the plant would close was no ambit threat.\nGreg Combet, who as ACTU secretary and an ALP Minister had established relationships with BlueScope executives, was brought in to conduct a commercial in confidence audit of the company's books.\nBlueScope had to satisfy the demands of investors and institutions. The cost savings identified by BlueScope were benchmarked against the company's projected lower costs if it shut down the steelworks and imported steel from China. In just eight weeks, they had to identify savings equivalent to $60 million.\nCombet assured unions that BlueScope was not overreaching. The next stage was negotiation, and with Combet unavailable due to other commitments, Fair Work Commission vice-president Adam Hatcher was brought in to mediate. At times, the discussions verged on collapse. On three occasions, the parties threatened to walk away, unable to stomach what the other side was proposing.\nBut the deal was done before deadline. In industrial relations terms, reaching such a transformative agreement in just two months is akin to travelling at the speed of light.\n Almost half the 500 job cuts will come from union ranks and 228 operational staff will lose their jobs. A further 147 company staff will be cut as well as 136 contractors. The three year pay freeze will result in some workers foregoing more than $20,000 a year.\nBonuses will be surrendered, overtime payments reduced, and working arrangements rewritten, meaning there will be significant changes in the way employees do their work.\nAt the Tuesday meeting, as delegates sat in the heat digesting the enormity of the changes, the mood threatened to boil over. Up to one in four delegates indicated opposition. But by the time BlueScope workers met on Thursday, the level of support was overwhelming, with an estimated 95 per cent putting up their hands in favour.\n\"It's very difficult to have consensus about such huge structural change,\" one senior union official said on Friday.\n\"But while there's 220 jobs gone, there's still 1200 guys with jobs, earning $120,000 a year, and keeping most of their conditions.\nAnother key participant in the negotiations said it was not easy for the union delegates to accept the need for such radical change, especially when they are naturally suspicious of managers advocating dramatic cuts. But the pressure cooker environment proved to be an effective, albeit not ideal, way to deliver fundamental workplace change.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:56:18.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
