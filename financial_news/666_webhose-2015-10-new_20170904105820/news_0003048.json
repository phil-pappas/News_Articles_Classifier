Morgan , Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley annually averaged $41.73 billion, up from annual average of $25.08 billion from 2002 to 2008, they said.\nHelping boost profits were trading revenues that they and other dealers have seen returning to the levels before the financial crisis seven years ago.\nTheir annual income was also more stable than pre-crisis levels, they added.\nThere have been concerns tighter regulations have caused significant cutback in dealers' market-making activities, resulting in a decline in market liquidity and \"flash\" events including the one seen nearly a year ago in the Treasuries market.\n\"These trading revenue and income figures suggest that dealers continue to play a key role in liquidity provision,\" New York Fed economists Tobias Adrian, Michael Fleming, Or Shachar, Daniel Stackman and Erik Vogt wrote in their blog titled \"Changes in the Returns to Market Making.\"\nThe banks' \"Sharpe ratio\" on their income rose to 2.28 from 1.23, suggesting milder swings in their annual earnings since the global credit crunch.\n(Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by W Simon)\nBudget, Tax & Economy global financial crisis Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs New York Federal Reserve", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:46:12.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
