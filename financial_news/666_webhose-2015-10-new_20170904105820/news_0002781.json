Photo: Rob Homer\n Rather than being offered their superannuation as a lump sum upon retirement Australians will have their balance invested in an account-based private pension designed to provide them a steady income stream.\nThat is the intention behind the government's commitment to develop and consult on legislation by the end 2016 that would \"facilitate trustees of superannuation funds providing pre-selected comprehensive income products for retirement\".\nTreasurer Scott Morrison made the announcement on Tuesday as part of the government's formal response to last year's financial system inquiry, which endorsed 42 out of the inquiry's 44 recommendations.\nFSI chairman David Murray said he was pleased the government had acted on his call to remove impediments to the development of annuity and annuity-like products, and mandate that all super funds \"soft default\" members into a so called \"comprehensive income product for retirement\" or \"CIPR\" when they stop working instead of offering them a lump sum.\nAdvertisement It is expected that annuity style products, where people pay a premium for a guaranteed future income stream, would feature in the asset mix of CIPRs.\n\"We stopped short of recommending mandating annuities because there has been a backlash in other countries where that has occurred,\" Mr Murray told a Whitlam Institute superannuation symposium on Tuesday.\n\"But behavioural economics has shown that there tends to be a very good take up of annuities if superannuation trustees offer them to people at the right time.\"\nMixed response Challenger, Australia's largest provider of annuities, welcomed the plan.\n\"CIPRs will help people manage complex decisions at retirement by allowing retirees to opt-in to a retirement solution, which suits their circumstances including a stable income stream, flexibility and longevity risk protection,\" Challenger chief executive Brian Benari said.\nMercer senior actuary David Knox this week said mandating CIPRs was \"one of the most important steps\" the government could take to improve the system . Mercer rivals Challenger as one of Australia's largest providers of annuities.\nBT Financial Group chief executive Brad Cooper was \"broadly supportive\" of the move but warned against mandating overly prescriptive product requirements.\n\"Retirees have differing needs, therefore the recommended income product should be principles-based and supported by an integrated advice model.\"\nIndustry Super Australia chief executive David Whiteley said it would be \"absolutely critical\" that there be strong oversight to ensure default account based pensions are designed to be in the best interest of retirees rather then market providers.\n\"We are concerned that there might be a push from the financial sector to default people into an arrangement that uses equity in their home to augment their retirement income\".", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/mercer-calls-on-scott-morrison-to-adopt-david-murrays-attack-on-super-lump-sums-20151019-gkciu5"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:32:02.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
