The segregated data prior to 1997 are not available.\nInvestor appetite returned after RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan last month pulled off a surprise by announcing a bigger -than-expected policy rate cut of 50 bps to 6.75 per cent — the lowest in four and a half years — to spur growth, said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.\nFurthermore, prospects of a delay in the rate hike by the US Federal Reserve from the near-zero level has helped the inflows.\n“The odds of a US rate hike in October have lessened due to poor payroll data,” said Vinod Nair, Head-Fundamental Research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.\nSome other macro parameters helped too, with fiscal deficit for April-August narrowing to 66.5 per cent of the full-year target and infrastructure output growing 2.6 per cent in August.\nSince the beginning of the year, overseas investors have made a net investment of Rs 22,654 crore in equities and Rs 39,802 crore in debt market.\n 11, 2015 12:05 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:42:21.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
