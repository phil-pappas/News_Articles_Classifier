What’s not as obvious is how noisy it gets,” he said.\nThe company has begun looking at the past five years of noise data in U.S. cities known for being loud, starting with New York, San Francisco and Seattle. Yes, Seattle. (What, nobody remembers Nirvana ?)\nBlack says the data does have some limitations, as it only registers noise complaints made to police, and not actual decibel levels. That’s why places like Times Square (the area along Broadway between West 42nd and West 47th streets in Manhattan) doesn’t register as a noise hot spot, because complaining about noise in Times Square is like complaining about speeding at the Indy 500.\nStill, in a separate study, CitiQuiet, a Queens, New York-based maker of residential soundproofing materials and windows, named New York the loudest city in America , and seventh overall in the world. Mumbai, India, was named the loudest, with routine noise levels at over 100 decibels, close to the noise level of a jackhammer or power saw .\nBlack also notes that some seemingly noisy neighborhoods are actually very tricky to map. “An airport might be noisy and the neighborhoods surrounding it will be affected by the noise, but are they all affected equally? The answer is no,” Black says. “Take-offs and approaches have different noise levels and trajectories and certain neighborhoods on a given side of a major airport are likely to have vastly different average noise levels,” he says.\nSo if you’re going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some earplugs along with those flowers in your hair .\nThe heart of the city’s downtown — north of Market Street, The Mission, The Haight, North Beach and the Tenderloin — are a hotbed for noise complaints, according to Trulia’s data.\nIn Seattle, Capitol Hill and the University District rate high on noise complaints, the report found.\nIn Manhattan, the data shows the East Side is noisier than the West Side, as the five-year pattern shows more noise complaints east and south of Central Park than north and west of it.\nCan’t stand loud dogs? The City of New York helpfully separates noise complaints by category, including barking dogs, construction, and ice cream truck bells and speakers. That helped Black construct a detailed interactive map with all the noise complaints broken out.\nThe data also shows that the Beastie Boys might have gotten it right, as noise complaints taper off once you cross the East River. No Sleep Till Brooklyn indeed.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/staticresources/health/education/teachers/CommonSounds.pdf", "https://cartodb-trulia.cartodb.com/viz/0c43fbca-5b25-11e5-9a6e-0e73ffd62169/embed_map", "https://cartodb-trulia.cartodb.com/viz/64ea4544-58c9-11e5-a90e-0e6e1df11cbf/embed_map", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lVbe0inZ7Q", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/07Y0cy-nvAg", "http://www.trulia.com/blog/trends/noise-complaint-maps/", "http://citiquiet.com/the-top-10-noisiest-cities-in-the-world-2/", "https://cartodb-trulia.cartodb.com/viz/9f80a916-58a9-11e5-b99f-0e43f3deba5a/embed_map", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I0vkKy504U"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:12:28.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
