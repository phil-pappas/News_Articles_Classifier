While it will probably take some time for interest rates to be determined by the market, the reform fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund's requirements for the yuan to be designated a global reserve currency. The IMF is expected to make its decision as early as next month. Xaume Olleros Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray China's central bank has cut benchmark interest rates for the sixth time since November last year and removed its remaining controls on deposit rates, in a bid to prop up the economy by lowering corporate financing costs and boosting household income.\nThe People's Bank of China announced the move on its web site late Friday, cutting the one-year benchmark bank lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points to 4.35 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively.\nIt also removed the ceiling on deposit rates, an important reform that will allow banks to compete freely for customers.\nAnd it reduced the banks' required reserve ratio by 50 basis points to 17.5 per cent, which is expected to inject an estimated 700 billion yuan ($153 billion) into the banking system. The cash injection is aimed at countering the capital outflows in recent months.\nThis is what you need to know:\n❑ The latest easing move comes ahead of a key meeting by the country's political elite next week, at which they will set the next five-year plan for 2016 to 2020, including economic growth and development targets.\n❑ While the latest interest rate cut follows China's announcement this week the economy grew at 6.9 per cent in the third quarter – it's slowest pace since the global financial crisis – it is not necessarily a knee-jerk reaction. As Capital Economics points out the PBOC has been steadily reducing interest rates since November last year, cutting them roughly every two months. The last cut came 59 days ago, on August 25 and the previous cut came 59 days before that.\n❑ China now has a fully liberalised interest rate regime. While it will probably take some time for interest rates to be determined by the market, the reform fulfills one of the International Monetary Fund's requirements for the yuan to be designated a global reserve currency. The IMF is expected to make its decision as early as next month.\n ❑ This easing cycle is not over. Most economists expect one more interest rate cut this year, probably in December, followed by another in early 2016. Even though the central bank had cut rates five times before Friday's move, real interest rates are still higher than a year ago, leaving companies struggling to service their debt.\n❑ The easing is both good and bad news for the global economy. On the one hand, it shows China is continuing to reform and open up its economy. However, it also suggests Chinese policymakers are concerned. Economic activity is subdued and there is downward pressure on prices. This clearly has implications for China's major trading partners and the stability of the global economy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-10-24T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:09:45.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
