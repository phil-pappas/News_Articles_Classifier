But a new analysis from the jobs site Glassdoor suggests there actually may be some positions that just generally offer a better deal when it comes to having a career and sufficient time to live your life.\nWork-life balance in this context could mean not having to work long hours every week. Or it could mean carrying a big workload but having a very flexible schedule in which to get it done.\nThe results are based on employee ratings of work-life balance for the same position across at least 81 different employers.\nMany of the top 25 jobs on Glassdoor's list are in technology, recruiting, marketing or engineering.\nData scientists and search-engine optimization (SEO) managers came in as No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. They also happen to be in high-demand these days since companies of all stripes -- including brick-and-mortar retailers -- run online sites, said Glassdoor spokesman Scott Dobroski.\nThere is, however, no correlation between pay and work-life balance. Some positions on the list are 6-figure jobs, while others have salaries that rank low among 5-figure jobs.\nHere's the full list:\n1. Data scientist: $114,808 a year\n2. SEO manager: $45,720 a year\n3. Talent acquisition specialist : $63,504 a year\n4. Social media manager : $40,000 a year\n5. Substitute teacher : $24,380 a year\n6.
