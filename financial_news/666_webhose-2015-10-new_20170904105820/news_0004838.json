The Vivendi stake-building sent both shares up sharply as analysts speculated that Vivendi could seek to take over or merge the two groups. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Ubisoft rose 2.6 percent to 25.99 euros at 0705 GMT. Gameloft rose 4.5 percent to 4.56 euro to while Vivendi (Swiss: VIV.SW - news ) fell 1 percent to 21.40 euros. \nLed by French tycoon Vincent Bollore, chairman and the largest shareholder, Vivendi has largely exited the telecoms business by selling off its largest unit French mobile group SFR as well as operators in Morocco and Brazil so as to focus on media and entertainment. \nDisposals have given Vivendi a war chest of about 10 billion euros with which to make acquisitions so as to further Bollore (Other OTC: BOIVF - news ) 's stated aim of building a European media powerhouse to compete with the likes of pay-TV group Sky PLC (LSE: BSY.L - news ) to Germany's radio and publishing group Bertelsmann. \nVivendi now owns the largest record label Universal Music Group and French pay-TV operator Canal Plus (Paris: FR0000125460 - news ) , as well as a 19.9 percent stake in Telecom Italia (Other OTC: TIAJF - news ) and about 1 percent of Spain's Telefonica (Amsterdam: TA6.AS - news ) .
