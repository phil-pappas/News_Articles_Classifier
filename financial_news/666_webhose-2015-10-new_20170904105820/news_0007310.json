These are properties that debt recovery tribunals (DRTs) have allowed banks to sell through auction, after their owners defaulted on loan repayment. The government portal, which is yet to go live, will provide details such as the floor area of the properties and allow anyone to bid directly after electronically making the earnest money deposit. The new portal will remove banks from the auction process, although the sale proceeds will flow into their accounts for loan recovery.
