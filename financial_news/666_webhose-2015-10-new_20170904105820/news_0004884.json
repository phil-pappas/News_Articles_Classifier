BHP Billiton has risen 10.6 per cent in the space of a fortnight, while Rio Tinto has gained 13.2 per cent. It is a stark turnaround from the nadir in which both companies were sold off heavily and BHP fell 6.6 per cent in one day .\nThe rally has been helped by a pause in the pessimism over China, but its outlook is still murky. The pessimism over China had paused, he said, Ng Han Guan Angus Gluskie, managing director of White Funds Management, said a confluence of factors drove the rally.\n\"Oil prices have bounced noticeably off their lows and the energy sector rally has mirrored this,\" he said.\nThe pessimism over China had paused, he said, with some recent data suggesting its slowdown may be easing, improving the export outlook.\nMeanwhile, after the savage sell-off in the preceding weeks, short sellers had raced to cover their positions, Mr Gluskie said.\n Kate Howitt, portfolio manager at Fidelity's Australian Opportunities Fund said the rally appeared to be more of an snap-back from an extreme sell-off than any change in fundamentals.\n\"In the miners, you've reached the point of seller fatigue,\" she said.\nBut the fundamentals for the miners had not improved, Ms Howitt said.\n\"The stocks don't look extraordinarily cheap, they are not trading on vast P/E (price-earnigs ratio) discounts, nor trading on exceptionally high dividend or cash flow yields to the broader market,\" she said.\nThe only \"green shoots\" may be movement at the margins on the prospects of China that may improve commodity prices, she said.\nIndeed, Mr Gluskie said a continuation of the rally depended on news from China.\n\"There is the potential for investors to become more comfortable that Chinese data is showing a maturing of growth, rather than a collapse,\" he said, with data pointing to this scenario.\n\"Should this line of thought develop there may be some continuation of the recent relief rally.\"\nMost commodity markets were still oversupplied, however, and when the US Federal Reserve finally lifts interest rates, which will in turn strengthen the US dollar, that will keep the pressure on both commodity prices and resources stocks' earnings, Mr Gluskie said.\n\"This is not only likely to limit the extent of any rally, but may also promote some further bouts of mining-related stock weakness.\"\nSo what to buy? The so-called \"defensive\" stocks, those that are less susceptible to economic cycles, have lagged since September 29. The health index is up just 3.3 per cent compared to the ASX 200 which is up 7.4 per cent, while the industrials sector has risen 3.4 per cent.\nMs Howitt said some of these stocks, including Qantas and Transurban, which fell 4.2 per cent and 3.9 per cent respectively in that period, were victims of their own success.\n\"For stocks that have run up the most, it is just logical for investors to take some profit off the table,\" she said.\nIn a low interest rate and low growth environment, where assets had been bid up for years through excess liquidity, defensive stocks remained the \"least bad\" option, Ms Howitt said.\n\"Commodity stocks that have sold off are good trading opportunities but how much much more is left in them? It becomes a riskier game from here,\" she said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asx-loses-55-billion-in-savage-resources-stocks-selloff-20150929-gjx6hn.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-10-12T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:07:43.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
