Money to pay for government operations runs out Dec. 11 unless Congress acts. Top House and Senate aides have been meeting with White House officials in search of a deal.\nWith time running out in Boehner's tenure, congressional officials say he is pushing for a deal. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about confidential negotiations.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
