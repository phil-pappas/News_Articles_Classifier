Photo: Bloomberg\nChina's economy grew 6.9 per cent year-on year in the third quarter, beating estimates by a fraction, and dismissing expectations of an imminent boost to monetary stimulus.\nThe result suggests fears of a hard landing in China are overdone, even though it is the weakest quarter of growth since 2009.\nConsensus forecasts were looking for a figure of 6.8 per cent growth for the 12 months to the end of the September quarter. The outcome, revealed by Beijing on Monday, keeps China's official gross domestic product target of around 7 per cent for 2015 within reach.\nAustralian markets reacted positively to the report, lifting the S&P/ASX 200 Index around 10 points. The Australian dollar rose, spiking as high as US72.91¢ off the day's low of US72.39¢. It settled at US72.69¢.\nAdvertisement For September, China's industrial production missed estimates at 5.7 per cent versus expectations for 6 per cent. Retail sales were a bright spot, up 10.9 per cent year-on-year and in line with forecasts. Fixed asset investment increased 10.3 per cent compared with expectations for 10.8 per cent.\nThe People's Bank of China has eased financial conditions and devalued the yuan in order to manage the slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy which has crashed commodity prices and hit global trade activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:27:43.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
