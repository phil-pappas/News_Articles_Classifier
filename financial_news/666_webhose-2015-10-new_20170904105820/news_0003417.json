So when Dick Vosburgh said he'd spliced together a sequence of BBC Radio 1 DJ Jimmy Young's slightly painful punning links but didn't know what to do with them, nobody turned a hair when I said I'd like to have a go at turning them into an animation.\nThey probably thought I'd done plenty of that kind of thing in America and was a highly-trained operative in the field, rather than the speculative first-timer I actually was.\nTerry Gilliam, author of 'Gilliamesque', is at far right. The others in the Monty Python team, left to right, are: Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Michael Palin, John Cleese and Terry Jones. Harper Collins I was given two weeks to do it – and 400 quid. So I just got some head shots of Jimmy Young blown up, airbrushed a body on and made him speak by wiggling his mouth. When you're trying something for the first time, you can sometimes achieve a wonderful blend of naivety and pragmatism – not really knowing what the obstacles are enables you to find a way around them by sheer beginner's luck.\nAs soon as my first animation was broadcast, things began to happen very quickly. The reaction (both publicly and professionally) was huge. I wasn't thinking, \"At last, this is my big break.\"\nIt was more a question of \"I seem to have found a way of doing this, so if everyone wants me to, then I might as well.\"\nThe idea of taking images out of their original context was at the heart of what I was doing, and the new technique I'd hit on more or less by accident quickly began to generate its own momentum.\nA later cover Terry Gilliam did for the album, 'Monty Python Sings'. He says, \"It was my version of The Rolling Stones' logo with the satve turning into a guitar string mouth tightener.\" Terry Gilliam, Gilliamesque I'd find images of people in serious situations – soldiers in war-time, politicians on the campaign trail – and liberate them by putting them in a dress or making them do something ridiculous. The more solemn and even humourless the original character, the more potentially funny he or she was.\nI'm not sure I could have got started in a world where everything is copyrighted and you've got to pay for all of it.\nThe same year, 1968, I started working with several of the men, Oxbridge graduates who were soon to become my co-Pythons: John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Graham Chapman and Terry Jones. There was no doubt who was the barbarian at the gates; some of the violence in my Monty Python animations would come from my frustration at not being able to express myself as clearly as everyone else.\nOne of the fundamental appeals of animation is that the restrictions of everyday mortality do not apply. People can be squished and stomped, and still bounce back up. We're free from the limitations of what God made, and in terms of the world I'm working in, I actually become God.\nOne crucial image in the Monty Python skits was the big foot - which Terry Gilliam acquired for his animations via the work of Italian 16th-century painter, Bronzino. Terry Gilliam, Gilliamesque While the others would be shut up in rooms writing, I would be off truffling out images to take to a place called Atlas Photography, just off Regent Street. I'd go roaring in there at night with old engravings from art books, all earmarked with little markings and dimensions, then they'd blow them up as required for me.\nIt didn't matter where the pictures came from – obviously it helped if they were out of copyright, but it wasn't necessary to think too strictly in those terms so if I found myself a wonderful face in a Richard Avedon book, I would just think, \"I'll have that\".\nMy karmic payback for this carelessness with the copyright of others would come a few years later when Atlas shut up shop. All the negatives of the photos I'd had taken were stored there, and someone threw out the whole lot without telling me.\nNot since the fabled destruction by fire of the Great Library of Alexandria has there been such a loss to humanity.\n'The man with giant legs'.
