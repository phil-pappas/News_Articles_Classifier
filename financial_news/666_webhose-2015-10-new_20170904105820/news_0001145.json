Glenn Hunt by Phillip Coorey James Eyers Treasurer Scott Morrison has accused Westpac Banking Corp of gouging customers by overcharging them for the cost of creating a safer banking system through a 0.20 percentage point increase in mortgage rates .\nAs analysts tipped the other big banks to follow suit, Mr Morrison told The Australian Financial Review the increase on property investors and people who live in their own house was up to twice that needed to support new requirements imposed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority designed to protect banks from another financial crisis.\nWestpac plans to raise $3.5 billion through a share sale to existing investors.\nThe bank will have to wear political criticism for making customers share some of the cost. Mr Morrison said he was glad other banks hadn't followed Westpac – although analysts speculate they will .\n\"The decision by Westpac to increase the variable mortgage rate by 20 basis points is a commercial decision by the bank to support their capital raising requirements,\" Mr Morrison said.\n\"This is in excess of what I am advised would be sufficient to meet the new requirements set out by APRA and the recent similar capital raisings of their banking competitors.\"\nThe higher rates will cost the average Westpac customer around $10 per week, it said.\nSome economists think the hike will make it easier for the Reserve Bank of Australia to lower rates and an index that tracks interest rate swaps rate the chances of 25 basis point cut in November at 57 per cent, compared with 39 per cent before Westpac's announcement. Goldman Sachs economist Tim Toohey said a 25 basis point cut to the cash rate to 1.75 per cent in November meeting was \"highly likely\" and there is a strong case for a further rate cut in early 2016.\n \"In our view, it is highly likely that the other three large Australian retail banks will all soon follow suit,\" he said.\nMaintaining profits Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer said it was important that banks remain highly profitably to ensure they can support the economy in a downturn.\nDespite regulatory costs, he said the bank would keep its return on equity target of 15 per cent.\n\"The whole idea of 'unquestionably strong' is that in the event that the economy gets into trouble, we need banks to be able to continue to generate loans to support the economy,\" he told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"And in order to do that they need to have a healthy return on equity, which generates equity that can support ongoing lending.\"\nWhile interest rates for property investors have already been raised after the APRA said in July that banks needed to carry more capital against mortgages by July next year, Westpac's move its the first rate increase for owner occupiers since early 2012.\nNational Australia Bank chief Andrew Thorburn left the door open for rate rises. He told an Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney APRA's moves to lift risk weightings on mortgages \"are directly linked to the cost of capital being applied to home loans.\n\"So I don't think it is unreasonable to link, from a shareholder perspective, the sustainable returns on the capital that is being applied to that product line to be considered again.\"\nThe increase in interest rates for Westpac's main brand does not extend to customers of St George or Bank of Melbourne but these are under review.\nThe big banks have raised almost $20 billion in additional core equity capital this year.\nCLSA analyst Brian Johnson said he believed Westpac and other banks would need to raise more capital in response to pressures from global regulatory changes known as Basel IV.\n\"This is an Arnold Schwarzenegger style capital raising: I'll be back,\" Mr Johnson said. \"They are not where they need to be.\"\nThe Westpac raising will lift its pro-forma common equity tier 1 capital ratio to 9.3 per cent, the highest of the major banks but still below the level of 10 per cent that analysts say would represent unquestionably strong capital. This could lead to more rate increases.\nWestpac shares will remain in a trading halt for the rest of the week as the share auction is conducted on Thursday; they are expected to resume trading on Monday next week.\nThe capital raising will be in the form of a fully underwritten, pro rata accelerated renounceable entitlement offer, with a offer price of $25.50, a 13.6 per cent discount to the company's closing price on October 13 of $30.44, adjusted for dividends.\nThe $3.5 billion capital raising follows Westpac's $2 billion raising announced at the half-year results in May. Since then, Commonwealth Bank has raised $5.5 billion and ANZ Banking Group has raised $3 billion, while NAB raised $5.5 billion in May.\nPressure to cut A revival of concerns about the slowdown in China, following mixed trade data on Tuesday, and signs that the US Federal Reserve may delay an interest rate increase are adding to the pressure on the RBA to cut rates.\nThis was reflected in a separate index compiled by Citi, which now sees a 100 per cent chance of a rate cut by February and a 60 per cent chance of another move by July.\nSince lowering the cash rate to 2 per cent this year, the RBA has been reluctant to cut further, partly for fear of adding fuel to already overheated residential property markets in Sydney and Melbourne.\nGovernor Glenn Stevens and other officials have questioned the efficacy of another cut, while maintaining that the much-needed rebalancing of the Australian economy away from mining-related investment is taking hold.\nSome commentators think Westpac's rate increase will not bother the Reserve Bank because it could slow the housing-construction boom and won't effect the dollar, which has been driven down by cuts in official interest rates.\nHousing construction and investment is starting to show signs of cooling.\nNew capital adequacy rules and regulatory controls on lending to buy-to-rent or buy-to-sell investors aimed at cooling this segment of the mortgage market are showing signs of working.\nBy extending these additional interest costs to owner-occupiers, Westpac could help take heat out of this segment of the market, say commentators.\nMacquarie Group, for one, sees houses prices declining by an average 7.5 per cent after March next year.\nAlthough not a huge drop, it would hit the so-called \"wealth effect\" of home-owners, whose spending has been driven by perceptions of growing asset value in the absence of income growth from wages or other investments. A cooling market would also discourage further investment by developers, hitting the jobs market and affecting ancillary spending on furniture and household services. Given the long lead times between housing starts and completion, it could drive supply above demand.\nForce the hand of the RBA With other areas of the economy still sluggish, despite the benefits of a weaker dollar, a slowdown in housing would again force the RBA's hand, says Macquarie Securities analyst James McIntyre.\n\"In our view, the announcement by a major bank of an out-of-cycle 20 basis point rate hike – for investor and owner-occupier loans – all but seals the deal for a November rate cut front the RBA,\" he said.\n\"Other banks are likely to reprice loans at some point,\" he said.\nNomura's fixed income strategist for Australia Andrew Ticehurst agrees Westpac's move could encourage similar increases at the other three big lenders.\n\"Nomura's house view is for a 25 basis point RBA rate cut in February, and not this year,\" he said.\n\"But particularly if the other three big lenders follow Westpac's lead, this would of course increase the possibility that the RBA could respond this year,\" he said.\nCredit Suisse equity analyst Damien Boey said Westpac's move added weight to the bank's view that the RBA would cut rates again.\nHe said latest lending data showed that the macro-prudential crackdown was working. \"That's all not boding well for the growth outlook when you consider that we are in the middle of a rebalancing exercise and we need the housing and credit-intensive sectors to pick up the slack,\" he said.\n\"I think the issue here is that people are coming around more to the view that rate cuts will be required,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:08:19.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
