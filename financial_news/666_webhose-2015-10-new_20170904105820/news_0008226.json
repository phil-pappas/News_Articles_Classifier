But there’s also an ethical one - scientists say 80% of our fossil fuels must stay in the ground to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\nNot all hope for a greener planet is yet lost. In the future, local government staff could see their pensions go into the community, instead of polluting coal and gas, as chancellor George Osborne has announced plans to pool local government pension funds to pay for local infrastructure . For the moment, however, it’s up to individual pension funds to make ethical decisions about their investments; fortunately,UK local authorities don’t have to look far for green investment inspiration.\nRelated: ‘I was horrified’ – the council staff campaigning to divest their pensions\nThere are many sustainable and low-carbon investment options, and camapign groups maintain that divesting fossil fuel funds will free up local government to promote local growth and be a bit greener. Pension funds could then be used to help meet climate commitments, rather than fuelling climate change. Divestment movement Fossil Free suggests that £14bn could be used to build 218,750 energy-efficient social rent homes or 60,000 wind turbines around the UK.\nSolar power In 2013, Lancashire county council announced its pension fund had invested £12m in Westmill , a community-owned solar development in south Oxfordshire. Westmill Solar can generate enough electricity to power 1,400 homes and it promised investors an 11% yearly return.\nJo Ram from Community Reinvest, sees this as a model for other councils to follow. Instead of investing at a pre-construction high-risk stage, Lancashire provided funds after the wind farm had already been built, making it a much safer investment. “It suggests a lot of current renewable energy projects that will come up for refinancing soon are good reinvestment options,” she says.\nSocial housing There are other positive avenues for investment being explored across the country. In December last year, Islington council confirmed plans to use its pension fund to build new homes, looking to invest £150m in social housing – the first London borough to invest pensions in housing.\nManchester also plans to invest in housebuilding. In April 2014 the city council partnered with the Greater Manchester Pension Fund and the Homes and Communities Agency, to create the housing investment fund. It would build on land owned by the council while an investor, in this case the pension fund, finances the build. Councillor Kieran Quinn, chair of the Greater Manchester Pension Fund, said other authorities could use this idea as it would secure a good return for pensions.\nRelated: How to get your pension fund to divest from fossil fuels\nGreater Manchester has one of the biggest UK pension funds, holding £1.3bn of fossil fuel stocks , so has been a target for campaign groups calling for divestment. But Ram, of Community Reinvest, points out that Manchester is looking at greener options and has already reserved 1% of its pension fund for impact investment, which she says covers positive impact.\nCommunity energy Strathclyde Pension Fund, the UK’s largest, was just behind Manchester in terms of the size of its investment in fossil fuel companies, at £751m. But it announced in February that it has committed £10m to community power projects backed by the UK’s Green Investment Bank. Albion Community Power will manage the capital with investments said to be for a hydro-electric power station in western Scotland. Strathclyde, which manages benefits for over 200,000 public-sector workers in Scotland, is investing over three years, and expects a return of 11–13%. The chair of the fund, councillor Paul Rooney, says: “There are opportunities for the fund to make investments that not only benefit our members, but also the communities they live in – creating new jobs or improving infrastructure.”\nFor Community Reinvest, pension funds are an opportunity to invest in the future of communities, a sentiment likely to appeal to many council employees. “These are young people investing in pensions, not just the older generation,” Ram says.\nVarious local authorities across the UK are thinking this way: Croydon switched its pension fund to a global ethical investment fund managed by Legal & General last year; Oxford city council became the first UK local authority to pass a motion on fossil fuel divestment ; Bristol and Nottingham are looking into setting up municipal energy companies . It is now up to the rest to think about investing more sustainably for the future.\nSign up here for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.
