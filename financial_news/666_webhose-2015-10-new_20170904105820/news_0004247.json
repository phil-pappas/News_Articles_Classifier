That kind of desecration and direct continuing today is not deniable or tolerable,\" Jacqueline Johnson Pata, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, told Reuters on Wednesday.\nO'Brien's publicist did not return a request for comment.\nIn an interview last month on U.S. syndicated morning talk show \"Live with Kelly and Michael,\" O'Brien said he and fellow \"Scorch Trials\" cast members took items from the historic location where they filmed last winter.\n\"It was this ancient Indian burial ground, I guess,\" he said. \"They were very strict about littering and don't take any artifacts like rocks, skulls - anything like that. And everyone just takes stuff, you know, obviously.\"\nThe site in question is the 22,000-acre Diamond Tail Ranch in the high desert between Santa Fe and Albuquerque. It is not home to any known Indian burial grounds, property manager Roch Hart told Reuters, and he has not been able to detect missing items.\nHart said artifacts at Diamond Tail include pottery shards and chippings of rock tools. While he has not been able to pinpoint specific tribes as the owners, he estimates that items date from the years 800 to 1700.\n\"Whether it be a thousand-dollar pot that was found, or a pottery shard ... we consider it all sacred,\" he said.\nThe ranch has hosted about 10 films in the past three years, including \"Frontera\" starring Ed Harris. If the theft allegations prove true, Hart said he will rethink plans.\n20th Century Fox said Wednesday it was doing a \"thorough investigation.\"\n\"If any artifacts were mishandled or removed from the location, we will do everything to ensure they are restored,\" the studio said in a statement.\n(Editing by Piya Sinha-Roy and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:09:07.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
