That missed the 864 million-euro estimate in an analyst survey compiled by Bloomberg. Net interest income fell to 1.27 billion euros from 1.40 billion euros a year earlier.\nSwedish banks have been pummeled by negative central bank rates, while markets buffeted by China’s slowdown and a commodities rout have made it more difficult to earn commissions and fees on trading. Negative rates alone are costing Sweden’s four biggest banks more than 1.4 billion kronor ($169 million) each quarter.\nBanks are struggling to earn money on lending as rates go negative\n“The summer months featured a seasonally lower activity level, although in the autumn we have not seen the usual pick-up in corporate and market activity,” Chief Executive Officer Christian Clausen said in the report. “Deposit margins continue to be under pressure and lending growth remains low.” He said the bank’s net interest income was nevertheless “holding up well.”\nSwedbank , the country’s biggest mortgage lender, on Tuesday reported a 14 percent decline in net income last quarter after weaker markets weighed on revenue from commissions. The bank’s total revenue declined after both net interest income and fee income fell.\nNordea said in August it will replace Clausen as CEO with Casper von Koskull, its head of wholesale banking, who takes over from Nov. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:39:48.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
