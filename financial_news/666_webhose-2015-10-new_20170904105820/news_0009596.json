If so, sensitive personal information about you may be at risk as both companies have recently been added to a growing number of companies who’ve had their databases compromised. Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself: 1) Change your account passwords if they’re compromised. If you share the password with another site (which you shouldn’t do), change that one as well. In fact, it’s probably a good idea to change your most sensitive passwords periodically anyway and make sure they’re not too easy to figure out. If you find managing a bunch of different passwords hard, you can get password management software to do it for you for as little as $12. It might be one of your better investments this year. 2) Check your statements for unauthorized chges. Not every identity theft involves opening new credit. If a thief uses your debit or credit card number, be sure to report it as soon as possible so you can get the charges reversed, cancel the card or bank account, and get a new card or bank account number. Make sure you update any automatic payments with the new number to avoid missed payments. (You might want to have a separate card for automatic payments that you don’t use for anything else to avoid having this problem in the future.) 3) Take steps to guard your information. Not all identity thefts happen as a result of someone else’s security breach. There are lots of ways your information can be stolen and fortunately you can prevent much of it yourself.Shred all documents that contain sensitive information. Be careful of providing sensitive information over the phone or clicking links from emails and type in the company’s web site yourself instead. Consider carrying non-RFID enabled cards or at least protect them. Use virus and malware software and avoid submitting sensitive information over unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Finally, credit cards tend to have stronger fraud protections than debit cards so try to use the former in potentially unsafe situations like online purchases, gas station card machines (which can be equipped with card skimmers ), and anytime you’re handing the card to someone who walks away with it. 4) Sign up for credit monitoring. A credit monitoring service will alert you if anything happens to your credit, whether it’s an identity thief opening a new line of credit in your name or a bill that was unpaid because it was sent to the wrong address. Either way, you’ll want to be alerted so you can fix the problem before it gets worse.If your information was exposed, the company may offer you free credit monitoring and identity theft protection for a period of time. You can get also get free credit monitoring from companies like CreditKarm a or Credit Sesame . There’s no excuse not to have it at that price. 5) Consider setting up a security freeze. Credit monitoring lets you know if something happens after the fact but a more preventative measure would be to place a security freeze on each of your three credit reports: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. In order to open credit in your name, someone would need to lift the freeze with a PIN that you set up. Aside from a nominal cost that varies by state (typically free to $15 per bureau), the only downside is that you’ll have to lift the freeze before applying for credit yourself and then reinstate it. (You might want to freeze your children’s credit files too as identity theft of children is a real problem.) 6) Get your credit reports and dispute any errors you may find. The official site to get free copies of your credit reports every 12 months is AnnualCreditReport.com . (Don’t be fooled by copycat sites that require you to sign up for a service with a monthly fee.)It’s been estimated that 70% of credit reports have errors that could be hurting your score. It’s bad enough to be penalized for your own mistake. You don’t want to be penalized for someone else’s too whether intentional or not. 7) Try to file your taxes early in the year. One common scam is for identity thieves to file a tax return in your name to get a refund so make sure you get your return in before they can. Also, don’t believe anyone who says they’re calling from the IRS and threatens you with arrest unless you pay back taxes, even if they know your Social Security number.Unfortunately, there are no 100%-fool proof ways to protect your information even if you try to live completely off the grid . However, taking these steps will minimize the danger.
