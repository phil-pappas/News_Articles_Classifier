In fact, the juicier the scandal, the better it makes for bringing in big money at the box office. There's plenty of examples where art imitates the business world. \nLeonardo DiCaprio's securing of rights to make a movie on the Volkswagen emissions scandal is the latest in a long line of movies already made about corporate irresponsibility. In fact, there are a handful of movies about recent scandals in production as we speak. \nTheStreet compiled a list of those recent scandals set to hit theaters as well as a bunch of movies that were already on the silver screen, but deserve to be queued up again. Make sure to check out the whole list and when you're done be sure to find out which movies were inspired by Wall Street . More Headlines 9 of the 10 Most Expensive Cars Ever Sold Are Ferraris \n1. The Volkswagen Scandal \nThe wheels are still churning on Volkswagen's huge emissions-cheating scandal, but that hasn't stopped Leonardo DiCaprio from buying the rights to make a movie about it. \nThe Wolf of Wall Street (another movie on this list) star's production company Appian Way and Paramount Pictures have \"acquired rights to a book proposal by New York Times journalist Jack Ewing,\" according to CNBC earlier this month. \n\"Ewing's book will investigate how a 'more, better, faster' ethos fueled one of the greatest frauds in corporate history ,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter . \nNews broke about Volkswagen's diesel fuel efficiency scandal in September. \nThe German car maker admitted to using software to cheat on emission tests on its diesel cars in the U.S. by installing specific software designed to fool emissions tests, making it look like the cars involved (the tally is actually 11 million cars worldwide across its vehicle brands) were more fuel-efficient than they actually were. \nSeveral VW top executives have been removed. Volkswagen's CEO Martin Winterkorn stepped down last month. The company could face billions in fines as well as expenses related to recalls. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:17:41.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
