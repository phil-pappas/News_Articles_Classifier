The rate of store closures peaked in 2012, at 20 a day. \nHowever the study also revealed a net reduction of 437 shops in the six-month period, with 2,634 outlets closing compared with 2,197 openings. This represents a slight widening of the gap when compared with the previous year. \nCheque-cashing businesses suffered the biggest number of failures with 110 shops closing down during the first six months of the year. Banks and other financial institutions also retreated from the high street, with 97 units shutting over the period. \nTraditional clothes and shoes shops are also suffering as people increasingly purchase fashion items online. Women's clothing stores are among the hardest hit, with 33 closing down during the first six months of the year. \nInstead coffee shops are proving to be the most active part of the high street, with 26 new openings during the first six months of the year. A combination of self-employed people working out of coffee shops and changing tastes have helped drive the rise of the cafe. Coffee chain Costa said earlier this year it was planning to open another 500 UK stores, building on its existing 1,755 shops. \nAnd in fresh evidence that consumers may be feeling more confident about treating themselves, the number of jewellery shop openings also surged. \n“What's clear is that a tidal wave of change on the high street is still washing through and that consumer shopping behaviour means we're not going to go back to the traditional high streets of the past,\" said Mark Hudson, retail leader at PwC. \nConsumers’ struggles between healthy eating and fast-food cravings also appears playing out on the high street with the number of pizza and takeaway stores rising as well as a surge in the number of health food shops taking on new premises. \n“The near-term winners and losers are on or off trend - for example, health foods are one of the sectors thriving but payday lending is suffering. High streets are in a constant state of evolution and that's not going to change,” Mr Hudson added. \nAmong the losers were bakeries, with 26 closing their doors, and pubs, of which 20 called time in the first-half. \nThe rate of charity shop openings continue to show no signs of abating, with 26 popping up. Charity shops receive tax breaks including an 80pc relief on business rates , which is an indicator that traditional retailers continue to struggle with the rising levy. \nEarlier this month Chancellor George Osborne announced an overhaul of the business rates system so that local councils will gain control of the rates they collect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:29:34.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
