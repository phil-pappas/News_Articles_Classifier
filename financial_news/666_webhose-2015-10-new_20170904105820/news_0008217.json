Almost.\nTwo months after the first correction since 2011 broke a yearlong calm in US equities, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is jumping again, climbing as much as 1.8 per cent Thursday to bring its gain from its lowest close in August to 10 per cent. The benchmark gauge for American equities now sits at a level last seen on August 19 and is fewer than 7 points below its December 31, 2014 closing price, making its performance year-to-date just about flat.\nSlicing it differently: US shares have climbed back into the trading range they tumbled out of in August during a six-day selloff that wiped out $US2 trillion in market value. Half of the S&P 500's 10 major groups now are trading above their August 19 closing levels, with energy stocks and consumer staples leading. While few investors are ready to sound the all clear, some see signs the worst is behind them, citing the market's ability to go up even as corporate earnings fall flat.\nThe benchmark gauge is fewer than 7 points below its December 31, 2014 closing price.

Now we can look at a slow-growth yet positive-trending economy,\" said Bill Schultz, who oversees $US1.2 billion as chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \"The question is now how much will earnings increase. The market is betting there's a better chance of that now than in the past couple months.\"\nThe S&P 500 surged 1.7 per cent to 2052.58 at 4pm in New York, sparked by a batch of better-than-estimated earnings from companies including McDonald's and EBay, bolstering optimism on the health of corporate America. Prospects that Europe will move to boost its economy provided a further lift as European Central Bank president Mario Draghi said policy makers will investigate fresh stimulus measures.\nThe rally is also an affirmation of sorts for Wall Street stock forecasters who clung to optimistic outlooks even as the S&P 500 slid more than 11 per cent to 1867.61 between August 17 and August 25. Getting to the median estimate of 21 strategists tracked by Bloomberg of 2150 would've taken a 15 per cent rally from August's lows. Today it requires less than 5 per cent.\nJohn Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer & Co remained unchanged on his year-end price target of 2311 during the selloff. He's now the most bullish out of 21 people surveyed. RBC Capital Markets' Jonathan Golub, whose forecast is 2100, said in an interview today that his target now has some \"upside\" again.\n\"It's frankly happening more than I'd expected or hoped for and I may have not been bullish enough about the resiliency of this market,\" Golub said by phone.\nThe S&P 500 is on track for its fourth consecutive week of gains, the first time its done so since December 2014. Meanwhile, this month is setting up to be the market's best October since 2011's nearly 11 per cent increase.\nComments from the ECB's Draghi are \"definitely\" supporting today's gains, said John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers, which manages about $US1 trillion in assets. \"That's what's really driving this rally and today's risk-on environment. Earnings expectations were very, very low and it's been easy to beat those expectations and that's also been contributing to this rally.\"\nSo powerful was the advance that stocks that fell on earnings news in early trading were surging by midday. Caterpillar lost as much as 2.7 per cent after a premarket report showed sales fell the most in five years, only to erase the loss within the first 30 minutes of trading. The same was true for copper producer Freeport-McMoRan, which also saw its earnings miss spur a 3.5 percent decline that was reversed within minutes of the market open.\nOf those companies that have reported results so far, 44 per cent have topped sales estimates and 74 per cent have beaten profit projections. Third-quarter earnings are projected to fall 6.7 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nMeanwhile, volatility across global markets is dissipating after whipsawing stocks, bonds and commodities for two months. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Market Risk Index is at its lowest level since August, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index of US equity turbulence recently posted the longest streak of daily declines since 2009.\nInvestors are looking to corporate America for clues on the strength of the economy as the Federal Reserve considers raising interest rates for the first time since 2006. Mixed data in the US and volatile financial markets kept the central bank from tightening last month and reduced expectations for an increase this year.\nMarch is the first month for which traders are pricing in at least even odds of a liftoff, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability of a boost this month is now only 6 per cent, and about 32 per cent for December.\nA report today showed sales of previously owned homes rose in September to the second-highest level since February 2007, while a separate data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hovers near the lowest in four decades.\nNine of the S&P 500's 10 major groups rallied Thursday, with seven posting gains in excess of 1.6 per cent. Energy, tech and industrial stocks have lead the post-selloff rally, with each group rising more than 12 per cent since August 25. The market has undergone a change in leadership, as the first seven months of the year saw health-care and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge with gains exceeding 11 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:03:11.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
