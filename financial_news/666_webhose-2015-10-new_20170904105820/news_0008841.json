However, analysts at Morgan Stanley, led by Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Adam Parker, note that the traditional relationship which sees the S&P 500 drive price action in Asian equity markets has been turned on its head; the tail is now wagging the dog.\nAsian markets have never had such an influence over the gyrations of U.S. equities, according to the analysts.\nStarting in July, the S&P 500&apos;s daily returns began to closely track the preceding performance of three major Asian equity indexes -- Japan&apos;s TOPIX, Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng, and China&apos;s Shanghai Composite:\nMorgan Stanley \"The TOPIX is now more correlated with the S&P than at any time since at least 2000, including the financial crisis,\" wrote Parker&apos;s team. \"Meanwhile, the Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite returns are also at cyclical highs in terms of same day S&P 500 correlations.\"\nIn order to demonstrate that daily returns for the S&P 500 and select Asian equity indexes have done more than move together, the analysts used a Granger causality test to try to find which variable contains predictive information about the other.\n\"Amid continuing equity volatility, Asian equity markets now exert an unprecedented influence on daily S&P 500 returns,\" Parker & Co. concluded.\nThese findings support the notion that the U.S. equity market selloff in late August was not a made-in-America event; the S&P 500 was simply taking its marching orders from the moves across the Pacific.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iqcPQEObckp4/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:43:12.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
