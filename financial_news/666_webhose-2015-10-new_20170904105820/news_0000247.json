In the US, crude stockpiles surged … and supply glut remains a concern,” said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.\nGupta said a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers yesterday “did not produce any meaningful results as no potential production cuts were addressed”.\nRussia had said it was prepared to discuss a reduction with members of the cartel at the meeting in Vienna.\nGupta said the market will be looking at a December 4 policy-setting meeting of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which is expected to “provide vital clues about price development in the medium term”.\nOPEC, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, has maintained high production levels despite the oil price decline, as members seek to maintain market share.\nFirst Published on October 22, 2015 12:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:57:45.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
