Official figures showed British consumer price inflation was zero in the 12 months to August.\n\"The low level of inflation expectations probably will not prevent pay growth picking up a bit in the coming year, but probably does signal that any pickup in pay will be modest rather than sharp,\" Citi economist Michael Saunders said.\n\"Against this background – and with signs that growth is slowing – there is no urgent need for the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to hike rates at present,\" he said, adding that Citi expected that rates would not rise in the next 12 months.\n\n(Writing by William Schomberg; editing by Michael Holden)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:23:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
