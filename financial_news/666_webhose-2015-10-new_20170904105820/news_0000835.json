This oxygen will last till the subsidy of the popularity ends…Sena is standing firm on its thoughts, struggle and patriotism. The party has never changed its stand on the issues of Hindutva, patriotism, Maharashtra’s identity and issues concerning common man’s life. Our beliefs will not change at any cost,” the Sena said in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.\nShiv Sena has waged a war against the enemies of the country. The party does not face challenge by anybody, it said adding, peoples’ support will ensure that the Sena’s flag flutters over Maharashtra in the future.\n“The future belongs only to the Sena and the Dussehra rally of the party has sent this message across to everybody. We will fight it out with whosoever is willing to join us, or else, we are fully prepared to fight it out all alone with the confidence instilled in us by the Sena chief. Nobody should dare block our path!” it said.\nThe saffron party also hit out at NCP supremo Sharad Pawar apparently over hosting Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his hometowm Baramati last week.\n“With no work left in Delhi, Pawar has opened a new business of lodging and boarding and finding solace in hosting political leaders at Govind Baug in Baramati. With ageing, Pawar’s politics is also on the wane,” it said.\n“Pawar’s politics is something that should not be taken seriously. You never know when he becomes secular and when he starts praising BJP,” the Sena said.\nTaking a dig at Congress , it said the Sonia Gandhi -led party has become virtually a non-entity in Maharashtra. “There are no (Congress) leaders, workers and hence no voters.”\nFirst Published on October 24, 2015 1:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:58:56.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
