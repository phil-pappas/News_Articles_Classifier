Jet fuel must also meet ASTM International specification D 1655 and military specifications MIL-T-5624P and MIL-T-83133D (for grades JP-5 and JP-8). Jet fuel is used for both commercial and military turbojet and turboprop aircraft engines.\nKerosene-type jet fuel inventories In its weekly petroleum report released on October 7, 2015, the EIA stated that jet fuel inventories for the week ending October 2 were at 40.3 MBPD (million barrels per day)—a 0.2 MBPD increase from the week previous week, which ended on September 25.\nUS East Coast and West Coast jet fuel inventories registered decreases of 0.5 MBPD for the week ending October 2, while Midwest and Gulf Coast jet fuel inventories increased by 0.7 MBPD. The Rocky Mountain region registered no change in inventory.\nWhy watch jet fuel inventories? Jet fuel inventories and the price of jet fuel are directly related, and so both have a huge impact on consumer spending. An increase in jet fuel prices, for example, results in an increase in airline and flight costs.\nWhen jet fuel supplies decrease, on the other hand—and inventory rose by 1,568 TBPD (thousand barrels per day) for the week ending October 2 and by 1,620 TBPD for the week ending September 25—can cause prices for consumers to go up, but they can also aid industry price recoveries. In any case, unfavorable consumption growth is the limiting factor from a pricing perspective.\nAffect on oil producers This is all to say that increases in jet fuel inventories, and the consequential decreases in jet fuel prices, have been seriously hurting the margins of oil refiners like Holly Frontier (HFC), Western Refining (WNR), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX), Valero Energy (VLO), and Tesoro (TSO)—which, together, account for 3.22% of the Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE).\nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Ample Distillate Fuel Inventories as Winter 2016 Nears jet fuel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:27:15.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
