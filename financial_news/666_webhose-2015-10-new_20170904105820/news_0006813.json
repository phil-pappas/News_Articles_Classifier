The contract then goes to a ratification vote of the UAW's 52,700 workers at GM, which confirmed a tentative accord has been reached.\nLast week, the union's new contract with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV was overwhelmingly ratified by worker vote.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Kenneth Maxwell)\nUnited Auto Workers General Motors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:43:05.925+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
