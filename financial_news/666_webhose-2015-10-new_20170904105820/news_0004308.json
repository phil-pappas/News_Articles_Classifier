There is justification for removing many of these pockets of what some people call 'tax shelters'; there's no question about that.\"\nHe said the Turnbull government already had the perfect blueprint for tax reform. It just needed to look across the Tasman at what New Zealand Prime Minister John Key had done - that is, to deliver tax cuts and increase the GST.\nMr Leibler said at 46 cents in the dollar, the top tax rate in Australia was far too high. \"If we get the top rate down to where they've got it in New Zealand - at 33 cents in the dollar - the trade-off would be sacrificing some of these benefits that flow disproportionately to people who make a lot of money,\" Mr Leibler said.\n\"We do need to deal with these issues to make the tax system fairer and spread the burden.\"\nTax system is a jigsaw The tax system was like a \"big jigsaw puzzle\", he said. \"In order to complete that puzzle you've got to have all the pieces sitting together.\"\n Mr Leibler's comments came as PwC chief executive Luke Sayers also called for personal tax cuts.\nHe said PwC economic modelling showed that by increasing and broadening the GST rate, the government could increase revenue and compensate low-income Australians.\n\"This means no household with earnings of less than $100,000 per annum would be worse off,\" Mr Sayers said.\n\"Everything has to be on the table\", including the sacred cow tax breaks for super and negatively geared property, he said.\n\"We can't make the job of improving our tax system about business versus society or the rich versus the poor,\" Mr Sayers said.\nMr Leibler said one of the most important things that Malcolm Turnbull had done was to say: 'We're not taking anything off the table; just because the [Labor] Opposition likes it doesn't mean we will rule it out.'\"\nHe did not think Mr Turnbull would introduce any significant tax changes during this term of government, but that he would take a comprehensive tax reform package to the next election.\nDon't mess with voter expectations Although Mr Leibler agreed with financial systems inquiry head David Murray that superannuation concessions were benefiting wealthy retirees and should be examined, he said Australians should not face retrospective tax changes.\nPrevious governments had passed laws encouraging people to save for retirement by giving them tax advantages.\n\"You cannot play around with super as to defeat the legitimate expectations of those already in the super system,\" he said.\n\"The same applies with negative gearing - again, it's very important that there's no retrospectivity.\"\nIt was also hard to separate negative gearing for property - which many see as fuelling house prices - from other types of investments, such as shares.\n\"It's a complex process,\" Mr Leibler said. \"But we have to be open to at least looking at it.\"\nThe current 50 per cent capital gains tax discount was \"about right\", but if the top marginal tax rate was reduced to 33 per cent, then \"it's a different kettle of fish and one can look at reducing or eliminating the CGT discount\".\nMr Leibler rejected a report released today by the Australian Council for Social Service (ACOSS) that suggests that any change to the GST only be done as a last resort , and that the exemption for fresh food be retained.He said everyone should be hit with GST rises, and then lower income earners could be compensated.\nGreater reliance on GST would also ensure that more people are brought into the tax net. \"GST is very difficult to avoid,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@NassimKhadem", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/david-murray-says-its-time-to-tackle-superannuation-concessions-for-rich-20150218-13i03m.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/want-money-for-health-education-close-tax-shelters-benefiting-rich-acoss-20151019-gkd0j2.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:08:27.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
