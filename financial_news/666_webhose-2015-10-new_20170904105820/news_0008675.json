Several years ago, James received his first AmTryke – a therapeutic three-wheeled cycle – and enjoyed increased freedom and mobility for a time. James has now outgrown his original AmTryke and needs a new one, however it is a costly piece of medical equipment presently outside the financial reach of his parents.\n“When children in our community require help, the only thing we can do is roll up our sleeves and make sure they receive what they need,” says Maria Golseth, owner and manager of the Golseth Agency. “This is especially true for children who have special needs and require special solutions.”\nGolseth and her team are utilizing an extensive list of professional contacts and personal relationships in an effort to advocate on James’ behalf and gather donations that will be used to purchase his new AmTryke. The team is also working on a web-based social media presence that they hope will draw in support and donations from other nearby communities.\nIn addition to working to ensure James receives his new AmTryke and enjoys improved freedom and mobility, the Golseth Agency team has worked with several other local causes and charities over the past few months and plans to work with another new charity every 30-60 days as part of an ongoing community involvement program entitled “Agents of Change.”\nReaders who wish to assist the Golseth Agency as they work to procure an Amtryke for James are asked to visit the dedicated charity page established by the Golseth team and make a personal donation to his cause: http://www.thegolsethagency.com/Help-James-Ride-Towards-Independence-_17_community_cause .
