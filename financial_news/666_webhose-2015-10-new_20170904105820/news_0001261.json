Photo: FDC\nUS casino magnate Steve Wynn says billionaire James Packer is in a \"preposterous\" situation not knowing how many gaming tables he can operate in Macau less than two weeks before the opening of the $US3.2 billion ($4.4 billion) Studio City development.\nMelco Crown Entertainment, headed by Lawrence Ho and 34 per cent owned by Mr Packer's Crown Resorts, is awaiting a decision by Macau's government over the number of tables it can install at the casino ahead of its opening on October 27.\nMr Wynn, who plans to open a new Macau casino in March 2016, issued his most strongly worded comments about the industry-wide issue on Friday and said he was frustrated by the lack of clarity from Chinese and Macau regulators over table allocations.\nCasino magnate Steve Wynn said Macau firms including Melco Crown face a confusing regulatory environment in the world's largest gambling hub. Photo: Wikipedia/Create Commons\n\"The notion that a person who spent $US2.5 billion - I'm talking about Melco now - would not know how many tables they're going to have three weeks before they open is so preposterous that it's worthy of comment,\" said Mr Wynn in a third quarter earnings call on Friday. \"My frustration is on behalf of our colleagues at Melco who made commitments for 400 tables. Why on earth they have to deal with half as many is beyond my - anything that I can understand in the 45 years of experience I've had. It isn't good for Macau. Hopefully the leadership of the community will intervene...relieving the predicaments...[for] Lawrence Ho and Jamie Packer's company Melco.\"\nAdvertisement Melco had banked on receiving 400 tables but may only receive half that allocation due to Macau's annual 3 per cent cap on table growth. The policy was introduced to create a more diversified tourism offering as Beijing cracks down on fraudulent activity and illegal cash flowing across the border\nBut Mr Wynn said the table cap allocation was counter-productive and would have had a negative impact had it been introduced in Las Vegas.\n\"Here in America, we would never have a Las Vegas of the diversity we've had if the city had told us how many tables we could spread,\" said Mr Wynn. \"The table cap is the single most counter-intuitive and irrational decision that was ever made. Here we are spending billions of dollars creating non-gaming facilities, and then arbitrarily someone says, well you should only have this many tables. No jurisdiction ever has imposed that kind of logic on us.\"\nMr Wynn, perhaps best known for developing the vast Bellagio resort in Las Vegas in the late 1990s, also fired a warning at the regulators governing Macau and said their current action may damage the city's reputation.\n\"The hospitality profile of the city will be severely compromised, and that will take years to recover. Years,\" he said. \"You only get one chance to make a good impression. And if you bogey that impression, if you blow it, it's a long time to fix it and maybe never. What is important is that the Macau market as it's viewed by the world never loses its viability, because the day that it loses its viability, it will lose its long-term longevity and the entire thing gets really damaged, severely. And that will impact the community of Macau in a very negative way.\"\nMelco's Studio City aims to attract a more family-friendly crowd, with a mix of Warner Brothers-themed rides, a Batman flight simulator and Asia's highest ferris wheel, set between two art deco hotel towers.\nMr Wynn acknowledged the industry is going to enormous lengths to build non-gaming facilities, but said the government's clampdown on the casino part of the equation missed the fact that one of the attractions of travelling to Macau was its gambling offering.\n\"Besides eating and entertaining and shopping and going to the spa, they want to play, or they wouldn't come to Macau. So we support these extravagant non-gaming diversifications with the casino. That's the truth of it. That's that irrevocable, undeniable, inexorable truth of it. The gaming allows the non-gaming to flourish.\"\nWynn's Macau third quarter net revenue fell by 38 per cent to $US585 million as its earnings from VIP gamblers fell sharply.\nThere may be hope on the horizon for Mr Wynn and Mr Packer. Shares in casino stocks with operations in Macau have surged in the last two weeks, on reports that Beijing would introduce \"supportive policies\" to help arrest a 16-month fall in gaming revenue in the Chinese city state.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/gambling/crown-under-pressure-as-gamblers-flee-macau-casinos-20150901-gjcngi", "http://www.afr.com/business/gambling/james-packer-tipped-to-get-more-gaming-tables-than-expected-at-new-macau-casino-20151014-gk8nai", "http://www.afr.com/business/gambling/crown-resorts-set-for-macau-boost-from-beijing-20151007-gk3b34"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:23:42.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
