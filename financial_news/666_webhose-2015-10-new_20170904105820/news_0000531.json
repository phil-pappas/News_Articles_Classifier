The 100th edition, Managing Market Data – A Job for Super Heroes, addresses the challenges investment organizations face when managing the mountain of market data that firms require today. The first edition of the Cutter AdvantEdge was published in July 2002, and covered efficiencies in trade operations. At that time, only half of firms with more than $1bn in AUM used a trade order management system.\nSubsequent editions have covered the important bellwethers for the industry, like increased regulatory oversight, industry globalization, the rapid expansion of technology solutions, and the proliferation of data. An edition entitled Devilish Derivatives from 2007, exploring the challenges of processing credit default swaps, proved to be a harbinger of events arising in the 2008 credit crisis. In 2012, an issue covered the relatively new concept of the Investment Book of Record (IBOR), which is now a standard component of many firms, and widely offered by vendors.\n“Because our clients are leading asset managers, insurance companies, and pension funds, we hear about their challenges first-hand, so we can recognize when trends are emerging,” explained John Clark, President of the Cutter Associates consulting practice. “It’s our job to keep the investment management community informed, and the Cutter AdvantEdge is one of the ways we do that.”\nSo what’s in the future? According to Clark, many issues never go away. “Most of our clients are going through continuous improvement initiatives to gain competitive advantage and increase efficiency. Firms are now focusing on data as a strategic asset and investing in tools, management and governance. Getting data in order enables them to respond more quickly to changes in their business model and increasing regulatory requirements.”\nThe latest edition of the Cutter AdvantEdge, as well as a library of past editions, is available online at the Cutter Associates website, http://www.cutterassociates.com .\nAbout Cutter Associates LLC\nCutter Associates, LLC serves the operational and technology needs of the global asset management industry, providing clients the tools and services they need to be successful.
