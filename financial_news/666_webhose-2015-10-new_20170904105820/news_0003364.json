View photo\nWal-Mart Stores Inc Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg \nLi & Fung Ltd., the global sourcing company, dropped the most in more than four months in Hong Kong trading after its biggest customer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., predicted a decline in annual earnings.\nThe Hong Kong-based company plunged as much as 7 percent to HK$5.86, the biggest intraday loss since May 26. The city’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.9 percent. Wal-Mart shares tumbled 10 percent at the close in New York Wednesday, the biggest one-day drop since January 1988.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Wal-Mart Tumbles Most in 15 Years After Predicting Profit Slump \nEarnings will decrease 6 percent to 12 percent in fiscal 2017, which ends in January of that year, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said at its investor day on Wednesday. Analysts had estimated a gain of 4 percent on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe dour outlook follows a protracted sales slump at Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores and mounting concern that the chain is losing ground to online competition such as Amazon.com Inc.\nThe world’s largest retailer is seeing “some pressure” on consumer spending in China, Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.\nGlobal Brands, a spinoff of Li & Fung and which relies on the U.S. market for majority of sales, fell 1.2 percent at HK$1.62 in Hong Kong as of 10:07 a.m.\n(An earlier story was corrected to say Wal-Mart predicted annual decline.)\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nWal-Mart Heirs See $11 Billion Vanish in a Day on Share Fall The 19-Hour Flight Is Coming Back Brazil's Next Big Crisis Is Scaring Bankers and Wiping Out Jobs Read Li & Fung Plunges After Wal-Mart Predicts Earnings Decline on bloomberg.com\nWal-Mart Stores Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:50:21.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
