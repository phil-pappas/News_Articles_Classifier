He was deemed to have a prima facie case to do so in an interlocutory hearing, but that never went further.\nIn Australia, the possible extension is not as significant a change as it sounds: celebrities can already protect their rights under misleading and deceptive provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the law of passing off, says King & Wood Mallesons intellectual property guru Katrina Rathie. This would simply add another string to the litigious bow.\nIt is to our homegrown celebrities (please don't say B-grade, that's not nice) who may not have quite the Kardashian-sized – or should we say Hugh Jackman-sized – fame offshore to whom the spoils might go. Countries without our mighty protections who are also signatories, such as Vietnam, would have to recognise \"well-known\" status without requiring trademark registration.\n \"It's recognising the world's getting smaller,\" Rathie says. \"The trademark rights have been a little bit slow to catch up with that instant fame and notoriety one can get.\"\nSo watch out, enterprising offshore plants eager to print off a line of \"Hayne Plane\" 49ers jerseys: the NRL-cum-NFL star, who appears to have trademarked his moniker in the US, Australia and New Zealand , may catch up with you yet.\nBarrister bloodsport The flags are up for a match of a different kind in NSW, as barristers flex their advocacy muscle in the 2016 Bar Council elections.\nThis year is proving a superior spectator sport to the last, when a \"ticket\" of 21 barristers in favour of reinstating the Queen's Counsel moniker managed a striking coup. What unfolded was a politically charged year in which the Bar Council resolved to – surprise, surprise – lobby the government to reinstate the Queen's Counsel moniker.\nThis time, they face competition in the form of an alternative 21-member ticket. Chambers are running short of popcorn and Twisties as campaign pitches circulate.\nCrown Prosecutor Margaret Cunneen, SC, may have been first to fire ahead of the opening of voting two weeks ago , lamenting a \"highly partisan\" NSW Bar Association.\nNow, her fellow ticket runner David Bennett, AC, QC, has sought to remind his colleagues of those good old punctilious days. The ones before the association \"lost its way\", seen in its \"engagement with the media and the Australian political process\" on such shocking, pro-rule-of-law topics as the pummelling of Human Rights Commissioner Gillian Triggs. Back in Bennett's day – he was president from 1995 to 1997 – it \"spoke only very occasionally, and therefore with great authority, on important rule-of-law and professional issues\".\nJust don't refer to such vocal periods as that under former president Michael Slattery, QC.\nShockingly, the alternative ticket – including Noel Hutley, SC, Andrew Bell, SC, current vice-president Arthur Moses, SC, High Court-blooded Michael McHugh, SC, and Catherine Gleeson – is promising to \"correct publicly stated misrepresentations about the rule of law\" and \"the infringement of rights\". \"Good governance\" and transparency is also in the pitch, which takes a veiled swipe at \"party politics and secret meetings of Bar Councillors\" that have \"no place at the NSW Bar\".\nThe bloodsport may have inspired the choice of \"fiction\" for the next meeting of the Bar's Book Club: Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness . Who will take on the role of Kurtz?", "external_links": ["http://ipwhiteboard.com.au/trade-mark-confidence-signals-big-things-to-come-for-the-hayne-plane/", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bar-wars-rival-faction-hits-back-at-margaret-cunneen-email-as-nsw-bar-association-elections-loom-20151009-gk545o.html", "https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh", "https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip3/WikiLeaks-TPP-IP-Chapter/WikiLeaks-TPP-IP-Chapter-051015.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:06:56.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
