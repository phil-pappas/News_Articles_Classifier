ADVERTISEMENT \"The fact that builder confidence has held in the 60s since June is proof that the single-family housing market is making lasting gains as more serious buyers come forward,\" said NAHB Chairman Tom Woods, a home builder from Blue Springs, Mo.\n\"However, our members continue to tell us there are still pockets of softness in some markets across the nation, and that they face challenges regarding the availability of lots and labor,\" Woods said. \nTwo of the three index components posted gains in October. \nThe index measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased seven points to 75, and the component gauging current sales conditions rose three points to 70. \nMeanwhile, the index charting buyer traffic held steady at 47. \n\"This upward momentum shows that our industry is strengthening at a gradual but consistent pace,\" said David Crowe, NAHB chief economist. \n\"With firm job creation, economic growth and the release of pent-up demand, we expect housing to keep moving forward as we start to close out 2015.\" \nRegionally, all four areas posted gains. The West registered a five-point increase to 69 while the Northeast, Midwest and South each rose one point to 47, 60 and 65, respectively.
