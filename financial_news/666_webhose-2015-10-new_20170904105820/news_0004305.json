Indeed, U.S. construction surpassed projections, reflecting a soaring demand for rental apartments. As millennials cannot afford their own house and are more indebted, which makes buying a difficult option, demand for rented apartments also tends to reflect more directly the state of the labour market.\nConstruction, of course, is one of the sectors that is not suffering from a strong dollar and a decelerating global economy as much. However, overall, 3 rd quarter growth projections in the US indicate that the economy is on a very serious break. Analysts project a 1,5% surge in GDP growth, against a 3,9% in the second quarter.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:09:42.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
