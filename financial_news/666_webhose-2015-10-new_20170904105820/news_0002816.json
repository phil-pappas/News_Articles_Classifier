The seven man-made outposts include a runway for aeroplanes and buildings to potentially hold military personnel and hardware.\nBeijing has reclaimed 17 times as much space in two years than the other claimants in Vietnam, The Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei have reclaimed over the previous 40 years, the Pentagon has said.\nAustralia and the US do not take sides over who has sovereignty over the islands, arguing it should be determined by international law. They are concerned about China's aggressive and bullying conduct.\nRory Medcalf, head of the National Security College in Canberra, said Australian support for US freedom of navigation exercises would \"send a strong signal of encouragement to other US partners and allies in the region\".\nThe annual Australiaâ€“US Ministerial Consultations kicked off in Boston on Monday, including an inaugural meeting between US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter and Senator Payne.\nEntering the main meeting on Tuesday, Ms Bishop intended to seek clarity from the Obama administration on ostensible overtures by Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to the White House last month.\n\"We will be seeking from the United States their read on President Xi Jinping's statement in Washington that China does not intend to militarize the claimed artificial reefs in the South China Sea,\" Ms Bishop said. \"That was a significant statement that he made at the time of meeting President Obama.\"\nOther topics on the AUSMIN agenda include military operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ongoing challenges in Afghanistan, relations with India and Japan, US marine forces in Darwin, the government's Defence White Paper and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nAt a working dinner in Boston on Monday night, other attendees included the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, Australia's Ambassador in Washington Kim Beazley, US Ambassador in Canberra John Berry and Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Varghese.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/world/asia/us-asia-south-china-sea-patrols.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-13T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:50:55.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
