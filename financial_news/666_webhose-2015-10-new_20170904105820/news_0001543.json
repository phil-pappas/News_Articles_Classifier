Are UK interest rates forecast to rise in 2016? EXPERTS are torn about when UK's interest rates are set to rise, with financial markets looking to 2017 for a hike, while top economists predict a hike at some point in 2016. PUBLISHED: 18:09, Wed, Oct 14, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:35, Wed, Oct 14, 2015 PA Wire When are UK interest rates going to rise? \nEither way a hike is looking further off than it was in the summer. In July Bank of England (BoE) policymakers suggested that British households should prepare their mortgages and other bills for a gradual increase in base rate around the start of 2016.But it now looks as though low interest rates are set to stick around for longer yet, with one of the Bank's policymakers even saying another cut could take place before families see a rise. The UK's core rate has been at 0.5 per cent since 2009 when the financial crisis struck, and during this time Britain's savers have struggled to get a decent return on their cash.The rate is set by the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and only rises when the nine members agree that a hike should take place.At the moment opinions are split. In the most recent meeting one member, Ian McCafferty, felt that a hike was due. However, another member Andy Haldane has said that Bank’s next move to be to cut rates rather than raise them.The UK's low inflation, which turned negative in September, is part of the reason that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates. Another reason is that the global economy is looking at risk from another financial crisis off the back of China's economy slowdown. The case for a rate is the Britain's strong employment and wage data.

This is based on our belief that the UK will see some improvement in growth from its third quarter soft patch and that consumer price inflation will start rising gradually from late-2015. \"We also expect earnings growth to strengthen further, although this will likely be partly offset by a further pick-up in productivity.\"However, we do now lean towards the view that the Bank of England will wait until May before lifting interest rates from 0.50 per cent to 0.7 per cent rather than go in February. \"Further out, we only expect interest rates to reach 1.00 per cent by the end of 2016, 2.00 per cent by end-2016 and 2.50 per cent by end-2018.\"Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Downside risks to the UK economy are still numerous. Global concerns, especially surrounding China and other emerging markets, have been well-documented, but there are also signs the domestic economy could be faltering.\"Last week’s PMI survey for the services sector, which accounts for around three-quarters of economic output, showed business activity growing at its slowest pace for more than two years.\"While the impact of rising wages remains notable by its absence in the inflation figures, I expect the Bank of England to focus on the risks and exercise caution on interest rates. \"I see them remaining at 0.5 per cent into the second half of next year, and quite possibly even longer than that.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:16:20.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
