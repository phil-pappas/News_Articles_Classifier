Some would be Islamic bonds, or sukuk, targeting investors in the region.\nDonors would also be asked for grants to cut the interest rate for countries hosting the bulk of refugees from commercial rates to as low as zero, said World Bank vice president for Middle East and Europe, Hafez Ghanem.\n\"People are focusing on the situation in Syria because of what's happening in Europe but actually you have the situation in Yemen, which is also very serious,\" he said after the meeting, held during annual World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings. Tunisia and Turkey were also struggling with a wave of refugees.\nThe United Nations expects hundreds of thousands of migrants to reach Europe this year as they flee war and poverty, the biggest wave of displaced people since World War Two.\nExpressions of support had come from Group of Seven countries and other European countries for the initiative, which could raise funds in the \"double-digit billions\" over five to 10 years, Ghanem said.\n\"All of us have self-interest in this,\" he said.\n\"The instability in the Middle East and North Africa is affecting the whole world, it's not just through refugees, but also through terrorism, fluctuations in oil prices, so it is really the whole international community has an interest in containing this and in helping those countries regain stability and get back on a path of development and growth.\"\nA working group will finalize details of the proposed fund raising -- which would make resources available to other development agencies as well -- by February.
