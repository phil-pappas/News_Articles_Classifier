Yields in the district are more than 5.5 percent, compared with an average 3.3 percent in central Paris.\nPrivate-equity investor Carlyle Group LP, which is currently spending at least 70 million euros ($80 million) refurbishing the district’s 19-story Tour Arago building, says it’s in the market for more properties, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Lone Star Funds, Perella Weinberg Partners and AEW Europe also bought properties to fix up.\n“We’re bullish there are better times ahead for La Defense,\" said Adam Metz, head of international real estate at Washington D.C.-based Carlyle Group. “The Paris commercial business district has already had quite a bit of price growth so the economics are better for La Defense.”\nThe district is home to most of the city’s tallest towers and draws 160,000 workers a day to the offices of companies such as Axa SA and Total SA. With 3.5 million square meters (37 million square feet) of office space, the area -- which replaced a rundown industrial district following a 1958 government revitalization program -- is more than twice the size of London’s Canary Wharf.\nInternational Investors International investors such as pension funds and insurers are competing for trophy assets that offer steady rental income as the European Central Bank’s attempts to jump start economic growth triggered a 6 percent slump in the value of the euro against the dollar this year, making property cheaper for buyers outside the region.\nBuyers in La Defense are also counting on the ECB’s quantitative-easing program boosting the economy, with French gross domestic product set to grow 1.1 percent this year from 0.4 percent in 2014, according to a European Commission forecast . A lull in the skyscraper construction cycle until 2018 and a government plan to to add more train links to the area should also help the district.\nGoldman Sachs in May agreed to buy the Pascal towers, which is rented to the French government until the end of 2016. The firm plans to completely refurbish the buildings and turn them into a grade A property after the tenant leaves, according to Jim Garman, the global co-head of real estate investing at Goldman Sachs in London.\n“The location is terrific,” Garman said in an interview. “We are confident that we will be able to deliver a high-quality property with competitive rents which will be attractive to corporate occupiers.”\nPension Funds Paris-based AEW Europe, which manages almost 17 billion euros of real estate in the region for investors including Asian pension funds and insurers, is about to acquire part of a 1980s tower that’s more than half empty. It plans to renovate the space, find new tenants and then resell the property, according to Guillaume Turcas, the company’s head of offices asset management.\n“In La Defense you can buy some affordable real estate versus inner Paris,” Turcas said in an interview. “If you’re in an area like La Defense -- it’s 10 minutes on the train to Champs Elysees -- it’s obviously a market that will go up. It’s just a bit forgotten right now.”\nNew York-based Perella Weinberg acquired the 16-story Les Miroirs last year, while Dallas-based Lone Star bought the Coeur Defense skyscraper for about 1.3 billion euros.\nThe leasing market in La Defense has been hurt by a glut of construction, with eight new buildings completed in the past two years. As a result, 12 percent of offices stand empty compared with 5 percent in the central Paris business district.\nAverage monthly rents for previously occupied buildings are at 33 euros per square meter, according to data compiled by JLL, the lowest since 2007. That compares with an equivalent rent of as much as 58 euros in Canary Wharf, Savills Plc data show.\n“There is an expectation that we’re at the bottom of the leasing market,” said Magali Marton, head of European research at broker Cushman & Wakefield in Paris. “Opportunistic investors believe they can add value with refurbishments.”", "external_links": ["http://www.jll.fr/france/en-gb/news/45/will-there-be-more-americans-in-paris?\\", "http://www.arcora.com/projets/tour-arago-a-la-defense/\\", "http://www.arcora.com/projets/tour-arago-a-la-defense\\", "http://www.chambersandpartners.com/86/11/editorial/7/1\\", "http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/forecasts/2015_spring/fr_en.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:41:49.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
