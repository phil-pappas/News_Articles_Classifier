The company announced that its revenues have increased materially when compared to the second quarter of 2015, when it got a hit by an FCA probe on client on boarding procedures. \nAfter the regulatory issues have been waived, the brokerage has announced impressive results in the third quarter of 2015. Revenues have increased by a massive 80 per cent when compared to the second quarter to reach $80.9 million. \nDespite this positive outcome in terms of revenues some worrying signs persisted â€“ the number of new customers has dropped to 17,047 which is lower by almost 12 per cent when compared to Q2. This can in part be explained by rising average user acquisition costs (AUAC) and rising average revenues per user (ARPU). \nBoth figures have spiked materially higher with ARPU coming in at $1354, while AUAC hit $1468. The numbers are materially higher than last quarter when we saw the first metric was at $823 while the second was $1278 per client. With both metrics rising and ARPU surpassing AUAC once again, the performance of the brokerage appears to have stabilized. Got a news tip?
