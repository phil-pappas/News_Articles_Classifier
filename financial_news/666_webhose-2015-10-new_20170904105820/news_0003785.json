The IFS director, Paul Johnson, was quoted as arguing that in the light of these findings the current practice of generous annual increases in the state pension should be scrapped. \nHaving worked for the IFS myself for nine years I bow to no one in my respect for its ability to crunch numbers. But on this occasion I believe that the policy conclusion it has drawn is completely wrong and risks undermining one of the big policy successes of recent years. \n• George Osborne's pensions triple lock 'will help drive Britain into deficit' \nSince the coalition government took office in 2010, the basic state pension has been increased each year according to a policy known as the “triple lock”. Under the triple lock you look first at the growth in prices (as measured by the consumer prices index), and then at the growth in average earnings. The basic state pension must go up by the higher of these two figures. \nIn addition, if both wage inflation and price inflation are very low, there is a floor of 2.5pc, which is the minimum increase every year. This floor is designed (among other things) to avoid a repeat of Gordon Brown’s notorious 75p increase in pensions in 2000. \nIt is true that this method of increasing pensions produces an upward ratchet in the value of the state pension. But it follows a period of three decades from 1980 to 2010 when the pension generally rose only in line with prices. As a result, by 2010 the pension had fallen to barely a sixth of the national average wage and millions of pensioners depended on means-tested top-ups. \nUnless we progressively reverse that decline we will continue to have one of the poorest state pensions in Europe, despite being one of the richest countries on the planet. This cannot be right. \n• 'The triple lock should be written into law': Steve Webb looks back on five years as pensions minister \nIf the triple lock policy were abolished it would have a devastating impact on the retirement prospects of millions of women. Although women generally build up smaller state pensions than men, the state pension makes a much bigger contribution to their overall income in retirement. This is because women are less likely to have company and private pensions, and the amounts they get from such pensions are smaller on average. \nFor most women, the state pension provides more than half of their total income in retirement, so a weakening of the state pension will disproportionately disadvantage them. \nOf course, the policy that determines how pensions rise every year doesn’t affect just the pension you get on the day you retire it also determines the shape of your income through retirement, a period of two decades or more on average. \nIn the past, those who were fortunate enough to be members of final salary pension schemes had generous inflation protection throughout their retirement. But with membership of such schemes plummeting, growing numbers of people will find that the only inflation-protected income they have in retirement comes from the state pension. \nIf we weaken the inflation protection that comes from the state at a time when dwindling numbers of people will have index-linked incomes from private sources, generations of pensioners will see year-on-year declines in their real living standards from the day they stop work. \nThe IFS’s central argument is essentially that the new generation of pensioners have “never had it so good” the words made famous by Harold Macmillan when he hailed Britain's growing prosperity in 1957 . As well as benefiting from house price inflation, they have in many cases had years of membership of high-quality company pensions. \nBy contrast, the working age population has, in recent years, had prolonged periods of pay freezes or below-inflation pay rises. From this, the IFS concludes that we should now be redistributing money away from pensioners and towards the younger, working age population. \nBut the IFS itself acknowledges that all of this is about to change. Income from old-style company pensions is likely to decline over the coming decades, while the new workplace pensions coming in under automatic enrolment will take many years to build up to worthwhile amounts. \nJust at the point that income from company and private pensions seems set to decline appears to me to be exactly the wrong time to start undermining the state pension as well. \nSome have argued that the triple lock is simply unaffordable in a world where we are all getting older. But this ignores the two other major changes that are happening to the state pension. State pension ages are rising, such that today’s teenagers will be lucky to get a pension before they reach the age of 70. At the same time, the new state pension, while providing a boost to many women, self-employed people and low earners, does strip out long-term cost pressures from the system. \nTaken as a whole, a decent, simple state pension paid at a later age is entirely affordable, and is a big improvement on the complex and inadequate mess we have at the moment. \nThe triple lock is one of the big successes of recent pensions policy. It makes sure that pensioners do not fall behind the working age population when wages grow strongly. It makes sure that pensioners’ spending power is maintained when inflation is high. And the 2.5pc floor makes sure that pensioners are never again insulted by being handed pennies by the Government. \nWe have the chance to make sure that old age is no longer synonymous with poverty. We must resist the siren voices who would have us turn back just as we are starting to win that battle. \nSteve Webb was Liberal Democrat minister of state for pensions between 2010 and 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:33:59.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
