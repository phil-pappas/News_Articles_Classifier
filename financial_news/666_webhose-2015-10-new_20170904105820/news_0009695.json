The Indiana Ronald McDonald House facility allows approximately five thousand parents per year to stay close to their children as they receive critical care at nearby hospitals.\n“I’ve seen the miraculous results of keeping families together during difficult times, and we are truly honored to assist the Ronald McDonald House as they continue their mission,” says Rob McBride, owner and manager of Aspire Insurance & Financial. “We’re asking our fellow community members to come out and help us support the Ronald McDonald House charity.”\nMobilizing an extensive network of personal and professional contacts, McBride and the Aspire team are reaching out to friends, family, neighbors, and clients in an effort to advocate for the Indiana chapter of the Ronald McDonald House and to gather donations that will be used to fund their efforts. In addition, the team is constructing a social media page that they hope will draw in more support from families across Indiana.\nAspire Insurance & Financial is also supporting several other charities in the Indianapolis area, and plans to work with a new charity every two months from here forward as part of an ongoing community involvement campaign.\nThose who wish to stand with Aspire Insurance & Financial as they support the Indiana chapter of the Ronald McDonald House are encouraged to visit the Aspire Insurance website and make a personal contribution to the charity from this page: http://www.aspireindy.com/A-Home-Away-From-Home-At-The-Ronald-McDonald-House_15_community_cause .
