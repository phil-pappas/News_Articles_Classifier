Photo: Peter Rae\nGenworth Mortgage Insurance Australia faces investor and analyst backlash on Monday after the lenders mortgage insurance giant revealed late on Friday that its chief executive, Ellie Comerford, was leaving the company.\nGenworth, which has a market valuation of $1.6 billion, announced Ms Comerford was retiring from the insurer and will remain in an advisory role until May 31 to \"assist with transitional matters\".\nIn our view, losing the CEO is unlikely to address any of the concerns the market has around the stock.\nRoss Curran, CBA Ross Curran, an insurance analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said Ms Comerford's resignation would likely come as a surprise at a time when the share price has been trading close to record lows.\nGenworth's share price has plunged 22.86 per cent in the past year to $2.48, compared with the 0.3 per cent losses of the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index.\n\"We expect the market to react negatively to the group losing what we consider a talented executive a little over a year since the group listed,\" he wrote in a note to clients late on Friday evening.\nAdvertisement One fund manager said Ms Comerford's departure was \"unusual given it [Genworth] only listed last year\".\nGenworth chief financial officer Georgette Nicholas will be acting chief executive while a global search takes place for Ms Comerford's successor. Luke Oxenham, the company's director of corporate finance and investor relations, has taken on the role of acting chief financial officer.\nMs Comerford's shock departure comes after a series of other high-profile CEO exits this year. The rate at which Australia's largest companies are losing their CEOs has almost doubled, with Woolworths boss Grant O'Brien â€‹ and Bradken's Brian Hodges joining the list of CEOs to exit. Iain Nairn abruptly resigned from the top job at retailer David Jones last month.\nMs Comerford has led the $1.6 billion lenders mortgage insurer for the past five years. She was previously chief operating officer for the international division of insurance group First American Financial Corporation, and had worked in Citigroup.\nShe was in charge of Genworth when the group's parent company in the US put its plans to partially float the Australia arm on ice during 2012, and oversaw the company's IPO in May last year.\nThe company has been suffering a series of headwinds in the past 12 months, including the loss of a major contract with major client, Westpac Banking Corp.\nMr Curran said Genworth's share price had been affected by increasing concerns over rising house prices in Sydney and Melbourne, housing arrears risks, and comments from Genworth's US parent about selling down its remaining stake in the Australian arm.\n\"In our view, losing the CEO is unlikely to address any of the concerns the market has around the stock and we do not expect to see positive movement on the back of the announcement,\" he said.\nGenworth reaffirmed its earnings guidance for this financial year on Friday.\n\"This is a great company which serves its customers and those Australians who have been able to realise their dream of home ownership, and I have been proud to lead it,\" Ms Comerford said in a statement.\n\"The board would like to thank Ellie for her leadership and contributions over the past five years which culminated in the successful completion of the IPO and delivery of solid financial results to date as an ASX 200 company,\" Genworth chairman Richard Grellman said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/genworth-faces-investor-displeasure-over-ceos-sudden-departure-20151011-gk6ai5", "http://www.afr.com/business/retail/clothing-and-accessories/david-jones-ceo-change-planned-for-months-sources-20151001-gjzcai", "http://www.afr.com/business/woolworths-ceo-grant-obrien-to-depart-with-about-10-million-payout-20150911-gjkis1"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:17:26.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
