The dollar hit a three-week low against the Swiss franc of 0.95870 franc, while the dollar index also hit a three-week low of 94.692.\nThe dollar rose, however, against the safe-haven yen as the outlook for accommodative central bank policy around the world drove traders into riskier currencies.\nThe Australian dollar hit a 7-week high against the greenback of $0.7344 and was set for its strongest weekly performance since late 2011 on gains in commodity prices and the view that accommodative central bank policies would support global growth.\nThe New Zealand dollar, another commodity currency, hit a more than 10-week high against the dollar of $0.6722.\nSome riskier emerging market currencies also gained against the dollar on the outlook for accommodative central bank policy. The dollar was last down 0.82 percent against the Brazilian real to trade at 3.7522 reals after hitting a more than five-week low of 3.7239 reals earlier in the session.\n\"Metals had a good day, which is good for commodity currencies, and central banks are not removing accommodation, which is good news as well for risk appetite,\" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York.\nThe euro was last up 0.71 percent against the dollar at $1.13555. The dollar was last down 0.47 percent against the franc at 0.96150 franc. The dollar was last up 0.28 percent against the yen at 120.270 yen.\nThe dollar index was last down 0.44 percent at 94.896.
