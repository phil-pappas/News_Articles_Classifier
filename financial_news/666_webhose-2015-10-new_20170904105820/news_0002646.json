seed system, fertilizer marketing and distribution system, harvesting access and maintenance system research and technology dissemination, community mobilization, farmer-based organization and credit management system, as well as monitoring and evaluation. \nDr Alhassan said for effective and comprehensive implementation of the strategy and its proposed interventions, it had become necessary to revise the document to include emerging issues facing the sector, so it would be a living or organic document. \nHe said since it was launched in 2010, it had been one of the documents guiding rice development in Ghana, as many areas identified in the strategy document were being applied by some stakeholders in their operations. \nThey include NGOs (JAK Foundation) and public sector institutions, thereby giving some level of confidence that the document is useful and already receiving some level of attention. \nRice seed system, fertilizer marketing and distribution, post-harvest and marketing, irrigation and water control investments, equipment access and maintenance, research and technology dissemination, community mobilization, farmer-based organization, and credit management are the main strategic areas highlighted in the NRDS, he explained. \nHe said a number of interventions had been designed, focused on the above areas which include; rice sector support project with emphasis on the development of water harvesting and regulatory structure supported by 'AFD,' rice seed scaling project, supported by USAID, improvement and scaling up of the system of rice intensification in Ghana supported by World Bank/'WAAPP.' \nOther interventions are; West Africa seed program supported USAID/West Africa, Enhanced Access to quality rice seed initiative supported by world bank/WAAPP, EDAIF sponsored rice project, preparation of the rice seed road map, supported by CARD, inland valley rice development project supported by AfDB and the Nerica Rice Dissemination project supported by AfDB. \nMeanwhile a rice seed road map is being finalized for approval \nDr Alhassan, however, noted that the interventions were not fully addressing the issues, and expressed the hope that other partners would provide technical and financial support to pipeline proposals that came out from other thematic areas in this strategy document.. \nMr Alhassan Imoro of the Crop Services Directorate, disclosed that domestic production (milled rice) between 2009 and 2014 increased from 235,000MT to 417,000MT and total area cultivated, within the same period also increased from 162,000 to 224,000 hectares. \nHe said rice consumption in Ghana had seen a tremendous growth in the past six years, from about 542,000MT in 2009 to around 748,000MT in 2014. \nGhana, he said, therefore, relied on imported rice to meet its local consumption, spending an average of about 290M US dollars of its scarce foreign currency annually. \nHe said rice imports into Ghana over the past six years ranged from 384,000MT in 2009 to 414,000MT in 2014. \nMr Michael Azebeokhal Nassamu, CARD Regional Consultant, said the validation was necessary to make the document a government one that could be referred to and used, adding that after the validation CARD would ensure that a 15-member task force that had been set up, would market the concept. \nGNA Business & Finance Follow Us For my mercy and compassion not to be shut, I do not have a good view on money.
