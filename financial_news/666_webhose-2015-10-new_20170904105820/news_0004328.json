Earlier this year the startup raised $1.5 billion in new capital, sending its value up to $25.5 billion. \nThe company was launched in 2008 and now has some 40 million users worldwide. \nTraditional hotel chains see Airbnb as a rival and accuse it of helping people avoid taxes and of hosting illegal accommodations on its website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:41:46.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
