Other major updates this week include pipeline updates and regulatory approvals.\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories \n1. Pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts has said that it will list both Amgen and Regeneron’s PCSK9 inhibitors on its National Preferred Formulary putting to rest concerns about which of the treatments will be listed on the formulary that covers about 25 million Americans.\nAccording to the PBM, National Preferred Formulary clients will spend about $750 million on PCSK9 inhibitors, much less than what the industry had forecasted. Moreover, in the backdrop of concerns regarding high pricing, the PBM said that it will provide additional long-term protection for its payers and patients by capping the entire plan cost in 2016 for PCSK9 inhibitors for clients enrolled in the Cholesterol Care Value (CCV) program.\n2. Alkermes got some good news with the FDA approving its new schizophrenia treatment, Aristada. The company is prepared to launch Aristada immediately, which should be an important contributor to the company’s top-line.\nAnother company that fared well is Spark Therapeutics ONCE, which saw its shares jump on positive top-line results from a phase III study on its lead gene therapy product candidate, SPK-RPE65. Given the positive data, the company intends to file for FDA approval next year (Read more: Spark Therapeutics' Gene Therapy Yields Results for Improving Blindness).\nMeanwhile, Acorda’s ACOR shares were up on news that the company has settled its patent infringement lawsuit with Allergan for its flagship product, Ampyra (Read more: Acorda Soars, Settles Ampyra Patent Dispute with Allergan).\n3. Amicus FOLD, focused on developing treatments for rare and orphan diseases, saw its shares plunging on news that it is facing a delay in its regulatory filing plans for its experimental Fabry disease treatment, migalastat, in the U.S. With the FDA asking for additional data, the company will not be able to file an NDA by year end, as planned (Read more: Amicus Therapeutics Plunges on Delay in NDA Submission).\n4. Action in the biosimilars market is heating up. Novartis’ Sandoz, which had launched the first biosimilar in the U.S. last month, is now seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of another of Amgen’s key drugs, Enbrel. Enbrel, a TNF-alpha inhibitor approved for a wide range of autoimmune diseases, delivered sales of about $2.5 billion in the first half of 2015 (Read more: Novartis' Sandoz Files for Enbrel Biosimilar in the U.S.).\nMeanwhile, Baxalta and partner Momenta have moved their biosimilar version of AbbVie’s ABBV blockbuster drug, Humira, into a pivotal study (Read more: Baxalta, Momenta Begin Pivotal Study on Biosimilar of Humira).\n5. XOMA received a much-needed boost with the company entering into an immuno-oncology related agreement with Novartis. The deal will see XOMA receiving $37 million upfront and the scope to get an additional $480 million on the achievement of certain milestones. Novartis has also agreed to push out the maturity date for a $13.5 million loan to 2020.\nThe deal will provide XOMA with much-needed funds – the company believes that along with its cost-cutting efforts, it has enough to fund operations into 2017 (Read more: XOMA Shoots up on Immuno-Oncology Deal with Novartis). The Novartis deal comes as a relief for XOMA which has had a challenging year – the company suffered a major setback back in July with its lead pipeline candidate, gevokizumab, failing in a phase III study in patients with Behçet's disease uveitis.\nPerformance \nOver the last five trading days, Biogen BIIB recorded a decline of 0.81% while Vertex was the highest gainer (9.65%) among the major biotechs.
