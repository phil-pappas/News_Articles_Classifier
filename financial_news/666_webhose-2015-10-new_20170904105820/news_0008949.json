CEO Doug McMillon said 450 people will be laid off at the company’s headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., according to a memo sent to all Wal-Mart staff today. \n“After months of evaluation, we’ve concluded there is an opportunity to better position our Home Office teams to move with speed and purpose,” McMillon wrote in the memo. The company is at “an important time in our history,” he said. “This in part means pulling back in some areas and investing in others.” \nLaid-off employees will receive 60 days of pay, plus two weeks of pay for every year of employment with the company, said a Wal-Mart WMT, +0.23% spokesman. Job search assistance will be available for those who want it, he said. \nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:55:26.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
