At the Barclays Financial Services Investors Conference held in September, John Gerspach, CFO of Citigroup, noted that the bank has been doing well and client activity is positive despite the volatility in global markets.\nHowever, revenues from fixed income and equity markets are expected to decline 5%, as global weakness has affected trading volumes. Citigroup has been focusing extensively on efficiency, streamlining its operations and exiting its low-return segments and businesses.\nAnalysts estimate for 3Q15 earnings According to the analysts’ estimates on Bloomberg, Citigroup is expected to report revenue of $19.9 billion, up slightly from 2Q15’s revenues of $19.5 billion and $19.7 billion in revenues reported in 3Q14. Net income is expected to be $4.7 billion, compared to $4.8 billion reported in 2Q15 and $2.8 billion in 3Q14.\n\nPlus, analysts expect Citigroup’s (C) earnings per share (or EPS) to be $1.56 compared to $1.51 in 2Q15 and $0.88 in 3Q14.\n\nCitigroup has been successful in posting positive results, surpassing analysts’ expectations in the past six quarters. After the Federal Reserve’s decision and ahead of its 3Q15 earnings results, Citigroup has received significant sell-side coverage. Analysts revised expectations on the earnings release now that interest rates have been kept on hold.\nInvestors are paying extra attention to banks’ earnings, as they are barometers of economic health. Other banks to report earnings during the week are Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), BB&T Corp (BBT), and US Bancorp (USB). Investors seeking exposure to these banking stocks could invest in the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF), which invests ~49% of its portfolio in US banks.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Financials Pumped Up Ahead of 3Q15 Earnings Part 2 - Citigroup Performs in Line with the Financial Sector in 2015 Part 4 - Citigroup’s Focus on Efficiency Could Boost Its Profitability Citigroup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:51:33.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
