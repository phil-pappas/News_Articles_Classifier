Bogdan said the nine other countries buying the airplane were also concerned about the ejection seat issue.\nThe fixes include adding a switch to slow the ejection mechanism for lighter pilots, a redesign to reduce the weight of the pilot's helmet, and a change to the parachute itself.\nU.S. military authorities on Aug. 27 restricted pilots weighing less than 136 lbs (62 kg) from flying the jets until it resolves issues with the seats made by UK-based Martin Baker Aircraft Corp.\nThis is the latest problem to beset the F-35 program, which is years behind schedule and well over initial cost estimates, but officials said the program is making solid progress and most other technical issues have been resolved.\nOnly one pilot of 215 pilots trained to fly the jets was affected by the restriction, and he has been transferred to the F-22 fighter jet program, according to a U.S. official.\nThe ban was put in place after tests discovered increased risk of neck injury to lightweight pilots during the catapult of the seat, the resulting wind blast, and the actual opening of the parachute, Bogdan told the committee.\nBogdan said lightweight pilots had a 1 in 50,000 chance of hurting their neck from an ejection, compared with pilots weighing 136 pounds (61.69 kg) to 165 pounds (74.84 kg), who had a risk of 1 in 200,000 of a neck injury.
