Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro The debt of Australian banks has been caught up in the turbulence in credit markets as risk spreads move to their highest in two years.\nThe spike in bank spreads, which has accompanied growing fears about the impact of a slowing China and declining commodity prices, may pressure funding costs for the banks, under pressure to raise more long-term debt from the wholesale markets.\nLast week, the cost of insuring against a default of a major Australian bank spiked above 100 basis points, the first time this key indicator of wholesale costs has traded in triple digits since September 2013.\nCredit default swap spreads have now jumped by almost 55 per cent since late July, when contracts traded hands for under 60 basis points, and almost 30 per cent from mid-September.\nAustralian banks, which source around $100 billion of funds annually from wholesale markets, have historically been vulnerable to changing conditions.\nThe current widening will have a \"minor\" impact on bank funding costs, according to Jonathan Rochford of credit fund Narrow Road Capital, relative to regulatory changes forced upon them by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\"The bigger issue is APRA requirements for the banks to have more long term debt and equity, and the change in rules around what is a retail term deposit and what isn't,\" he said.\nAustralia's banks have already raised $16 billion of equity this year to strengthen their balance sheets, but more recently APRA has signalled some concern that the banks have not done enough to shift more funding from cheaper short term markets into long term debt , which could put upward pressure on costs, particularly as spreads widen.\n The moves in Australian bank and corporate debt spreads reflect skittishness in global credit markets.\nBoth equity and credit traders have kept a close watch on two US high-yield bond Exchange traded funds – the iShares High Yield Corporate bond ETF and the SPDR High Yield Bond ETF – which have declined 4 per cent in a month and 8 per cent so far in 2015.\nHybrids punished Australian retail investors that have taken exposure to the banks via low-ranking hybrid securities have also been punished, although they've been spared some of the pain felt by equity investors.\nWhile CBA shares have shed 20 per cent over six months, CBA's Perls VII hybrids have fallen by 9 per cent, although both securities are down around 11 per cent so far in 2015.\n\"Bank hybrids have been overbought for the last two years and the recent movements are reflective of fair value,\" said Mr Rochford. \"I think they will follow the cycle with credit generally from here on, but there remains better value elsewhere.\"\nWhile bank spreads have pushed wider, metals and mining companies have been particularly hard hit. Falling oil prices have increased default risks among highly indebted energy borrowers that account for a large share of the credit universe.\nMeanwhile, a fall in the iron ore price has weighed on the majors, with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto credit default swap spreads also having surged in recent weeks.\nFor BHP the spike spreads complicated its efforts to sell a multicurrency hybrid security aimed at shoring up the miner's strong A+ credit rating.\nAlready-skittish credit markets were on high alert in recent days. Last Monday, shares in commodities trading giant Glencore lost 30 per cent as analysts questioned its solvency should base metal prices slide further.\nThat led to a spike in the cost of insuring against Glencore debt to above 1000 basis points, a move reminiscent of the 2008 global financial crisis , as counterparties moved to hedge their credit risk.\nThe credit moves may have exaggerated the extent of lenders' concerns, but cannot be ignored.\n\"There are some commodity trading banks that will have exposure to Glencore but the market isn't at the point of calculating how much they might lose,\" said Mr Rochford. \"The risk is that with credit rating where it is and spread where it is, it only takes a few rumours of collateral and margin calls for the situation to spiral.\"\nThe weaker conditions in credit markets have slowed corporate bond issuance, even as companies race to secure funds before a potential hike in US interest rates.\nSome Australian firms have still braved hostile capital markets for long-term funding. Last week Westfield Corporation raised $US1 billion of five-year bonds , but the property giant was forced to price the debt above its marketing range and dropped plans to issue longer-term 10-year debt on account of the weaker conditions.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/are-mysterious-commodities-traders-like-glencore-and-noble-too-big-to-fail-20151001-gjzk97.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/apra-says-big-banks-at-risk-from-shortterm-wholesale-debt-addiction-20150916-gjnqha.html", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-05T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:05:56.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
