Photo: Edwina Pickles\nInsurance Australia Group is losing another key executive, Leona Murphy, who heads the company's strategy division following the retirement of chief executive, Mike Wilkins, in November.\nMs Murphy will leave IAG on December 31, a month after Mr Wilkins steps down as CEO of the $13.47 billion insurer. It is understood Ms Murphy informed the company of her intention to leave IAG at the start of this year.\nMs Murphy, IAG's chief strategy officer, will return to Queensland to focus on her career as a non-executive director.\nDuring her time at the insurance company, Ms Murphy was heavily involved in disaster mitigation and community resilience. She was previously chief transformation officer when IAG integrated Wesfarmers' insurance underwriting unit into its folds and was named one of Australia's 100 Women of Influence for 2015.\nAdvertisement \"Leona has been a key member of our team and was instrumental in IAG's journey over the past eight years. In particular, her leadership and commitment to creating a purpose-led organisation and to delivering on our transformation agenda have ensured that IAG is well-placed for the future,\" Mr Wilkins said in a statement.\nThe news of her pending departure comes after Mr Wilkins flagged his retirement earlier this month.\nFormer commercial insurance boss Peter Harmer, who was previously CEO of broking behemoth Aon in the UK, will take over the reins of IAG next month. It is understood Mr Harmer will review the company's business strategy and decide on Ms Murphy's potential replacement after he takes on the CEO role.\nIAG, which owns NRMA and RACV, axed its China expansion strategy last month after concerns from shareholders and not finding the right opportunity for a national presence in the world's second-biggest economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:39:05.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
