In fact, according to research by talent management firm Saba and WorkplaceTrends.com, 40% say they would leave if a better option became available, and 31% say their skills and talents are not being recognized.

However, the study also reveals 31% of employees polled said they would share their goals, background talents and what motivates them, but the right questions often are not asked. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:42:42.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
