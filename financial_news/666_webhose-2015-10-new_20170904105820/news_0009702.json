This award looks to honor those within the credit union movement who provide financial literacy for all ages. The judges award credit unions that institute financial education programs that are compelling, appropriate, relevant, focused, innovative, proven, and organized.\nWith the intent of reaching a broader audience and incorporating members and non-members into an educational experience, Belvoir Federal decided to take a unique approach to their Financial Education Program, whereby bringing seminars to the workplace.\nOnce a month, a seminar is held at a secure facility where a branch is located or at office buildings on Fort Belvoir (such as the Firehouse). The seminars are typically presented during a lunch hour to allow maximum attendance and the credit union provides lunch.\nThe program series is based on each seminar building off the previous seminar so at the end of the year, the attendees will have a wide array of financial knowledge and tools to help them become financially savvy consumers.\n“By bringing the Lunch & Learn series to the front door of members and non-members, we have created a highly successful program, which allows financial education to reach numerous people,” stated Shannon Lindstrom, Belvoir Federal’s Financial Counselor . “Our educational series go beyond the typical home buying seminar to include meaningful and impactful topics relevant to all adults.”\nPopular topics presented by Belvoir Federal’s Financial Counselor include, How to Establish a Debt Pay down Plan, How to Improve Your Credit Score, Emergency Preparedness for Your Finances, and How to Prevent Identity Theft.\nAbout Belvoir Federal Credit Union\nBelvoir Federal is a member-owned, full-service financial institution that provides the foundation for the financial success of our Members.
