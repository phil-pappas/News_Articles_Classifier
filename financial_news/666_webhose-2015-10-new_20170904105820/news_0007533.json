It has launched its first tea brewing machine in France. \nThe group -- whose sales are often seen as a reflector of spending power in many parts of the world-- said volumes were up across the globe in the third quarter. \nUnderlying sales grew by 8.4 percent in emerging markets, Unilever said. \nChina saw double-digit growth boosted among other things by \"the rapid development of online sales,\" while in Turkey double-digit growth was driven by selling ice cream, leaf tea and hair care products. \nSales figures in Latin America climbed as Unilever increased prices while North America \"returned to growth boosted by both volume and price.\" \nIn Europe, \"strong volume growth more than offset continued price deflation across our markets.\" Growth was especially good in Britain, Germany and Central and Eastern Europe, Unilever said. \nUnilever chief executive Paul Polman however cautioned that despite sales rises, \"we continue to see soft global markets with no immediate signs of getting help from an improved global economy.\" \nThe group expected \"underlying sales growth for the year towards the upper 2-4 percent range,\" steady improvements in Unilever's operating margins and strong cash flows, Polman added. \nUnilever stock was up by around 3.5 percent to almost 39 euros per share on early morning trade on the Amsterdam stock exchange's AEX index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:25:55.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
