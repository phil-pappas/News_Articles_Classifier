Half of those polled during the month of September by ACCC said they are footing at least some of the bills for at least one adult child over the age of 24. Nearly 41 percent of those polled are providing support for one adult child. Another 10 percent are supporting two. Just one percent said they are supporting three or more adult children.\nThe online poll of 98 consumers was conducted at ConsumerCredit.com by American Consumer Credit Counseling - a national non-profit that helps consumers with budgeting, financial education and debt management .\nAccording to the survey, the most common form of support was providing or paying for housing. But consumers responding to the online poll also said they are helping their adult children with household bills (26 percent), providing transportation (20 percent), covering medical expenses (14 percent), and helping with spending money and other expenses.\n“Parenting doesn’t end when your children reach age 18 and, for many people, neither does the financial responsibility of supporting them,” said Steve Trumble, President and CEO of American Consumer Credit Counseling, which is based in Newton, MA. “Setting aside the often crushing burden of student loan debt, everyday expenses for adult children are something parents are trying to manage every day.”\nOf the respondents who said they are supporting adult children, 76 percent said it is hurting their ability to save for the future. More than 25 percent of all those polled are providing over $250 a month worth of financial support, while 14 percent are spending over $500 a month to help their adult children.\nThe survey also found that 59 percent of the adult children receiving parental support live at home with their families, and 65 percent of those adult children are working.\nACCC is a 501(c)3 organization that provides free credit counseling, bankruptcy counseling, and housing counseling to consumers nationwide in need of financial literacy education and money management.
