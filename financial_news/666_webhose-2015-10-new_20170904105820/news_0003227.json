Photo: iStock\nCommercial insurers are expected to stop dropping their policy prices despite stiff competition from new competitors, as they try to prop up ailing profit.\nData from BizCover, a commercial insurance comparison website, showed overall prices for commercial cover continued their downward spiral in the three months ended September 30, falling 1 per cent from the previous quarter.\nHowever, BizCover founder and managing director Michael Gottlieb said the falls were likely to stop and prices charged by big insurers would rise again soon, despite the absence of traditional triggers for price rises like natural disasters.\n\"While pricing continues to fall, the rate of reduction has slowed markedly and is more concentrated, pointing to a stabilisation in rates over the next few quarters,\" he said.\nAdvertisement Commercial rates from Australian insurers such as Insurance Australia Group, Suncorp Group and QBE Insurance Group have been under severe pressure over the past 18 months because of an influx of capacity from reinsurance lowering the cost of cover. Alternative sources of capital, such as pension funds, have been adding to the insurance pool.\n\"There is still excess capacity in the market, and the reality is that while this excess capacity exists pricing will continue to trend downwards, although at a much slower rate than in previous years,\" Mr Gottlieb said.\nThe commercial insurance arms of companies such as IAG, Suncorp and QBE have been battling fierce competition as insurers jostle for market share. International companies, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, have also made their way into the Australian market, lifting the pressure further on existing players.\nLack of disasters A lack of severe natural disasters in recent years have hampered insurers' ability to increase rates, as reinsurance costs remain low. Premium prices in the professional indemnity and public liability market are still about 40 per cent lower than their values three years ago.\nThe research comes after Austbrokers chief executive Mark Searles flagged that the dramatic fall in commercial insurance rates should slow and prices rise at the end of fiscal 2016.\n\"We're bobbing at the bottom at this point in time [of the insurance cycle],\" he said at the company's full-year profit results in August.\n\"We have seen a gradual improving of the environment, and then hopefully ... move towards a price increase environment but we won't see that until, we believe, the back end of the financial year.\"\nAustralia's professional indemnity and public liability markets are dominated largely by technology and allied health sectors, which excludes doctors and nurses but covers professionals like physiotherapists and occupational therapists.\nThe two sectors experienced large premium decreases during fiscal 2013 and 2014, and remained stable the year after. However, prices had started to creep up slowly, Mr Gottlieb said.\n\"As an example, the cost of professional indemnity insurance for some allied health professionals can be as low as $20 per month,\" he said.\n\"Pricing for occupations that insurers regard as low risk have decreased disproportionately over the past two years and are now at levels where insurers are no longer willing to reduce any further.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:11:43.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
