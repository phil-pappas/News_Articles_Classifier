The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule, known as TRID, produces a shorter stack of paper before closing, but it also makes a nice set of shackles if you're making changes before sealing the deal. It should be simple, but right now there's a bit of a learning curve for lenders and title companies, which could delay the closing date. \n“Buyers should understand that the timelines their lender is giving them are partially based on the amount of time it takes the lender to verify and process their application and partially based on the new federal guidelines,” says Melissa Kozicki, the director of compliance for the mortgage-building division of online real estate firm Altisource. “The buyer is never obligated to proceed during the process buts need to understand that changes -- changes to the loan program, opting to pay lower closing costs through a higher rate, opting to buy down their interest rate, an appraisal coming in low, changes to the sale price -- could cause legitimate delays based on these new rules and that the closer to closing they get, the more likely it is that a delay could become a major problem.” More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:11:53.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
