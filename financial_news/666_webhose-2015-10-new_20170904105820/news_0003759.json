Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup The creation of regulator-rated venture capital and private equity funds will be among the ideas on the agenda next month at a Labor-led meeting aimed at encouraging superannuation funds to invest in tech-focused venture capital.\nRepresentatives from organisations such as StartupAUS, the Australian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia will meet as part of the newly formed Innovation Investment Partnership. The initiative forms a key pillar of Labor's innovation policy, as it looks to counter Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's push for the Coalition to be viewed as the party for innovation.\nIn a letter to invited parties, seen by The Australian Financial Review , Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said the need to open up pathways to strengthen investment in innovation loomed as a major economic priority for Australia.\n\"Building the linkages between VCs and super funds will provide an added longer-term benefit for startups â€“ sharpening up their commercial and business acumen through the process of seeking funding support,\" he said.\nAVCAL chief executive Yasser El-Ansary said he would be pushing for the government to address imbalances in the regulatory framework that \"effectively penalises [super funds] for allocating money into unlisted asset classes\". Glen McCurtayne \"This may include ... exploring ways in which we can have the right policy architecture and regulatory framework for super funds to invest in ... businesses, creating a bundle of regulator-rated or verified domestic venture capital and private equity funds, as well as encouraging self-managed super funds to aggregate capital for certain asset classes.\"\nThe letter also proposed examining the merits of a liquidity \"back-stop\" for superannuation funds.\nIndustry representation The Australian Information Industry Association, the Australian Industry Group, the Financial Services Council, the Business Council of Australia and Industry Super have also been invited to attend the roundtable.\n It will be hosted by Mr Shorten, shadow treasurer Chris Bowen, shadow minister for financial services Jim Chalmers, and shadow parliamentary secretary assisting with digital innovation and start-ups Ed Husic.\nIn 2014, local and foreign superannuation/pension funds contributed 18 per cent of new investments to venture capital and private equity funds, according to AVCAL's annual yearbook. But this equates to a tiny percentage of the overall wealth held in superannuation.\nAVCAL chief executive Yasser El-Ansary said he would be pushing for the government to address imbalances in the regulatory framework that \"effectively penalises [super funds] for allocating money into unlisted asset classes\".\n\"The rules as they stand are centred almost exclusively on costs and fees, when there should be a more balanced approach that takes into account net returns after fees and costs,\" Mr El-Ansary said.\n\"Some of the rules in place at the moment require super funds to separately disclose a range of ordinary business running costs incurred within the businesses that they invest into, which are not required to be disclosed in the same way if the investment is made into a publicly listed business.\"\nRepresentatives from all sides of the issue agreed that a mandate for superannuation funds to invest in venture capital would be the wrong way to tackle the issue.\nSuper funds keen ASFA chief executive Pauline Vamos said super funds were increasingly interested in investing in venture capital funds, but the risk factor had to match up with their strategy.\n\"This is a very important conversation and it's one that's already been started within the industry. But you have to understand the risk you're taking and the likelihood of reward ... and what the timeline is on receiving the reward,\" she said.\n\"These sorts of investments do fit super funds because they're longer-term investments, but how much money that can be invested depends on the liquidity and scale.\"\nIn the 2014 financial year, overall venture capital fundraising was 21 per cent lower than in the previous year, totalling $120 million across four funds, according to AVCAL figures.\nBut there were positive signs for the 2015 financial year. In April Brandon Capital Partners successful raised $200 million from AustralianSuper, HESTA, StatewideSuper and Hostplus for a medical research fund.\nMost industry groups agreed there was a general need to facilitate more early-stage capital.\nAi Group chief executive Innes Willox said the government should develop intermediaries to aggregate investment opportunities.\n\"Many super funds are already investors and keen to explore new opportunities,\" he said.\nAIIA chief executive Suzanne Campbell said the roundtable moved these discussions from being theoretical to meaningful.\n\"I'd like to see ... a commitment to play by the stakeholders. This should be the first conversation, not the last.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:04:49.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
