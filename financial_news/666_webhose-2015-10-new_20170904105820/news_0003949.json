The idea is that it will eventually become part of the proposed East West Rail link between Oxford and Cambridge. \nDavid Cameron, the prime minister, who is the MP for the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, said it was “an historic moment” for the county. \n“From today there will be more trains, faster journey times and better transport links for people living and working here,” he said. \nChiltern has spent £130m on the line and Network Rail has financed the balance. Rob Brighouse, the managing director of Chiltern, said the train operator was tapping into “latent demand in north Oxfordshire”. \nOxford is “the only rail connected city where more people choose to get the bus than the train into London”, he added. Existing services between London and Oxford “are very crowded”, Mr Brighouse said. \nThe Chiltern route also services Bicester, the outlet mall that is visited by 6.3m shoppers a year and has become a popular destination for Chinese tourists to Britain . \nMeanwhile, the new Oxford station is on the outskirts of the city, rather than in the centre, which means travellers can avoid congestion. \n“By putting the station on the very edge of oxford, we saw we could knock 30 to 45 minutes off the door to door journey time,” Mr Brighouse said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:34:07.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
