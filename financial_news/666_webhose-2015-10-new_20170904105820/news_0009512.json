Say, for example, if it is the corner of George and King streets at 388 George Street, then luxury retailers will say 'yes', as it has direct access from [the] Louis Vuitton building to Chanel/Dior in King Street; otherwise, luxury retailers will say 'no' as George Street is still a mix of everything from fast food, such as McDonald's, to souvenir stores and convenience stores,\" Mr Alamsyah.\nGeorge Street is also a deterrent for some retailers as it undergoes years of construction to become a pedestrian zone. As a result, King Street is viewed as the future of the luxury precincts.\nMr Alamsyah said, potentially, Brookfield/Investa Office Fund might refurbish 388 George Street in 2018-19; and DEXUS Property might refurbish 175 Pitt Street at the same time.\n\"It is also understood that Victor Comino​ might remix the Wittner Shoes building at 138 Pitt Street and a new super luxury retailer will take over the ex-Tag Heuer [spot] at 119 King Street and last, but not least, private owners who have bought the Trust Building at 155 King Street/72 Castlereagh Street might also activate this corner into a true luxury brand opportunity,\" he said.\nIt is understood that Knight Frank is assisting these property owners.\n\"Furthermore, the ultimate future for the super luxury is Castlereagh Street as GPT/QIC might start their retail redevelopment in 2016-17 on the corner of King and Castlereagh streets, being the MLC Centre,\" Mr Alamsyah said.\nThe upmarket Hermes was yet to make a final decision on a new Sydney site, despite speculation it had signed at the MLC Centre.\nKnight Frank and Tim Green Commercial are working with the owners of 112 Castlereagh Street to remix the Commonwealth Bank building at the corner of Castlereagh and Market streets, opposite Prada/Gucci and David Jones.\n\"Therefore, with so many options in King Street and Castlereagh Street for luxury retailers to choose from, George Street might only get premium/semi-luxury retailers but luxury/super-luxury retailers will go to King and Castlereagh streets\", Mr Alamsyah said.\nKnight Frank's director of retail leasing, Michael Hanscomb,​ said: \"The high demand from international luxury brands is not only strong in Sydney, but is also very strong on the east coast of Australia with Melbourne's Collins Street and Brisbane's Edward Street being in highest demand.\"\nMr Alamsyah said Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, Dior, Chanel, Cartier, Rolex and Patek Philippe had established flagship stores in the Sydney CBD, but Hermes, Bottega Veneta​ and Burberry might have not found their ideal homes yet as either their existing stores were too small or too old or too bulky or too hidden inside a shopping centre with not enough street exposure for brand image.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:24:36.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
