September retail spending, however, grew at an annual rate of 10.9 percent, beating a 10.8 percent forecast. \nSome analysts said the Chinese growth figures would put pressure on Beijing to further cut interest rates and take other measures to stoke activity. \n\"Figures out of China are mixed. However, at this point in time, news that is not exceptionally bad or deteriorating is probably perceived as good,\" Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said. \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Atul Prakash; Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:24:19.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
