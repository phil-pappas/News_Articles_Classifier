The markets soared today with the major indices gaining by 2%-3% over Thursday’s closing values. Factors that pushed equity prices higher on Monday included stable Asian markets, continuation of the positive bias imbibed by last week's monetary easing, and optimism surrounding the earnings season due to lower commodities’ prices. Market observers cited that lower chances of a US rate hike in October due to a slowdown in the US jobs market had relieved investors and increased their risk taking appetite. Last month, the US economy added just 142,000 jobs from 173,000 jobs created in August 2015. The August figures are being revised downwards. The jobs data is expected to deter the US Fed from raising rates. The rates were last raised in 2006. The US Fed will decide whether to raise interest rates during its Federal Open Market Committee meet scheduled for October 27-28. With higher interest rates in the US, the Foreign Portfolio Investors are expected to be led away from emerging markets such as India. Expectations of a Japanese monetary and fiscal stimulus and up-tick in Chinese consumer sentiment stabilised the East Asian markets. The rupee continued to gain strength on Monday. It gained 23 paise to close at 65.28 against the US dollar from its previous close of 65.51 against a greenback. It touched a day's low of 65.14 against the US dollar.
