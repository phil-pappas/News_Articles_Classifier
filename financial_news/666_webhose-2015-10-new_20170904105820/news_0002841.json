PUBLISHED: 17:53, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:11, Fri, Oct 16, 2015 GETTY People who areheavy overdraft users are trapped in bank accounts, according to TSB \nOverdraft charges vary hugely between providers, but customers who are in the red are the least likely to switch to a better deal, found analysis by TSB. People who use their overdrafts are among the most profitable for banks and face the biggest barrier to take advantage of competition, said the bank. In a report looking at competition in banking, TSB said: \"These people can’t switch. They are trapped because they have to pay off their old overdraft which may be hard or simply not possible in the short term. \"There is also no guarantee that they will get the same overdraft at a new bank, so they risk a significant reduction in the flexibility their banking services might provide. \"Meanwhile banks will take three, six, or nine months of data before they can make an informed choice to match the customer’s existing overdraft. \"Not everyone can afford to take that risk.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:22:41.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
