The currency had traded as high as US73.38¢ in European trading before starting to slide during the overnight session. It touched a low of US72.50¢ about 10am in New York. New Zealand's dollar retreated from a more than three-month high, losing 0.7 per cent.\nThe local currency failed to get any support from base metals which traded down ahead of the weekend too. Copper prices fell, posting the first weekly loss this month, amid mounting concerns of a slowdown in consumption by China. Futures slid 0.8 per cent to settle at $US2.4035 a pound in New York, leaving prices down 0.4 per cent in the week.\nThe currency touched a low of US72.50¢ about 10am on Friday in New York.

Vale is set to announce record third-quarter output for iron ore on Monday, days after Rio Tinto said iron ore shipments from its Pilbara operations rose 16 per cent to 85.6 million tonnes for the September quarter on the year prior, and were slightly ahead of analyst expectations.\nAdvertisement Separately, China is due to release gross domestic product data on Monday with the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg now looking for 6.8 per cent growth, below the government's 7 per cent target and the slowest quarterly pace since 2009.\n<h2>Greenback gains</h2>\nAs the $A was losing ground, the greenback rose broadly on Friday, as traders reckoned the Fed might raise interest rates later this year and the ECB may provide more stimulus, buying bonds for a longer period of time to check rates, to help the euro zone economy.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, climbed for the second day from a seven-week low after news that annual US core inflation picked up more than forecast in September to 2 per cent.\n\"I don't think the inflation data was instrumental but at the margin it pushes in that direction (of the Fed hiking in December),\" said Adam Cole, RBC Capital Markets' head of FX strategy in London.\nOn the other hand, the euro zone inflation outlook suffered a setback as regional year-over-year price growth turned negative last month. That raised expectations the ECB would increase or extend its quantitative easing program under which it aims to buy €1.1 trillion of bonds.\n\"In the near term, the dollar could gain further against the euro as there's more speculation about more QE from the ECB,\" said Lee Ferridge, State Street Global Markets' Head of Macro Strategy, North America in Boston.\nThe dollar index was up 0.2 per cent at 94.572 but was still on track for a third straight week of declines, having fallen to a seven-week intraday low of 93.806 on Thursday.\nAgainst the euro, the greenback dipped nearly 0.1 per cent at $US1.1374, on track for a slim 0.1 per cent on the week. It hit a seven-week low against the euro on Thursday at $US1.13630.\nThe dollar was up 0.45 per cent at 119.40 yen, recovering from a seven-week low near 118 yen on Thursday. It was on track for its steepest weekly loss against the yen in six weeks.\n<h2>Net US long bets drop</h2>\nThe greenback's gain was limited by Friday's mixed US data on industrial output, job openings and consumer sentiment.\nWhile the latest US inflation data rekindled some bets on a rate hike by year-end, some analysts and traders have clung to the view the Fed policy-makers would delay a rate increase into 2016 due to recent evidence of a slowing global economy and volatile market conditions.\n\"The recent Fed speak is that they wouldn't pull the trigger at the next meeting or December,\" said Pete Karabatos, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. \"Still our (economic) picture here is brighter than the rest of the world.\"\nSpeculators reduced bullish bets on the US dollar in the latest week, with net longs falling to their lowest in more than a year, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday.\nThe value of the dollar's net long position dropped to $US18.97 billion in the week ended October 13, from $US20.89 billion the week before. That was the smallest net long position since the week of July 22, 2014. This was also the first time in 15 months that net dollar longs came in below $US20 billion. To be long a currency is to make a bet it will rise, while being short is a bet its value will decline.\nInterest rate futures are now banking on the Fed raising rates in March next year, with a 52 per cent chance, according to the CME Group FedWatch. For the month of October, the dollar index so far was down 1.7 per cent, although year to date, the greenback was still up 4.9 per cent. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate US dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.\nWith Bloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/rio-tinto-cuts-into-ore-stockpiles-as-it-races-to-hit-target-20151015-gkahw6"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:11:13.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
