Since January, iron ore has lost 25.2 per cent, this year, alongside copper, which shed 17.37 per cent. Both are significantly exposed to China, while the more broadly sold Brent crude oil has also been hit, shedding 15.05 per cent this year.\nBoth iron ore and oil prices have been pushed down by oversupply issues, which must be remedied for Capital Economics' predictions of a price rescue to come true.\nChief economist Julian Jessop said responses to the price slump were beginning to affect supply, forecasting a pick-up in oil faster than iron ore, where considerable reserves of supply remain.\n\"Also, markets have been too pessimistic about the outlook for demand,\" Mr Jessop said.\n\"The recovery in the global economy has paused as key emerging markets have faltered but we do not believe that the world is on the cusp of a major downturn.\"\nMr Jessop also cites a turnaround in commodity investor sentiment as global equities and bonds are hit by volatility and high prices.\nCapital Economics is forecasting a swifter turnaround for gold but also oil when compared with iron ore, as production in nations not bound by the OPEC agreements slow production.\nMorgan Stanley Research analysts have upgraded their position from bearish to neutral on Brent crude oil as the fundamentals remain challenged and new supply from Iran will maintain current oversupply rates.\n\"Demand has been and should remain fairly robust, although comps could be tough in 2016. The dominance of macro themes and fund flows could set traders up for volatility based on China, the US dollar or oil supply and storage concerns.\"\nThe Morgan Stanley research analysts are bullish on just one commodity: coking coal. They remain neutral on nickel and copper but are expecting upside price risk based on weak mine supply growth and production cuts.\nBut the iron ore story is a different one, with most analysts agreeing that there is less upside. Producers continue to pump out the commodity at record rates while more mines, such as Roy Hill, are due to come online and begin exporting this year.\nSource: Capital Economics Morgan Stanley Research remains bearish on iron ore because of increased supply and slowing Chinese demand for steel.\n\"We continue to warn investors of the price risk of the seasonal pullback in Asia's total steel production rate, around September and October,\" the analysts said, forecasting a medium-term price outlook of $US55 to $US70 per tonne.\nCiti is less optimistic about oil, describing its recent price improvement as a \"dead dog bounce\", likening it to a previous improvement in oil prices were they appeared to stabilise before the sharp decline that became this recent slump.\n\"Like the price rebound earlier this year, it follows a reading by technical analysts declaring that prices reached a bottom and a turning point was at hand,\" analyst Edward Morse said.\n\"And like a self-fulfilling prophecy the chartist readings were followed by inflows from algorithmic traders to buy dips.\"\nWhile the iron price has been gutted by oversupply, Australia's iron ore exports to China have risen 8 per cent this year as local mines are relatively low-cost producers of higher grade iron ore.\nHSBC is forecasting the price per tonne will remain between $US50 and $US60 for the foreseeable future.\n\"We are forecasting the iron ore price to remain around this level over the next year or so. Although the overall iron ore story is a challenging one, Australia is faring reasonably well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:33:33.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
