It also means that the recent surge in consumer and corporate credit across many emerging market countries could — ultimately — act as the primary catalyst for the next global economic downturn.” \nIn the piece, Henry McVey and his team cite several key takeaways: \nChina is in structural slowdown mode, as excess debt and capacity now weigh on profits, not just GDP . Slowing Chinese GDP data seems to garner all the headlines these days, but after our most recent trip, we think the focus should be on trends in corporate profits. Japan is no longer just a macro story ; focus on the micro too . The positive macro story in Japan is – on the margin – waning. As such, we think primarily just those companies that are actively shedding assets and/or returning cash to shareholders will outperform handily from current levels. Overall, Asia is in somewhat of a funk . Our trip reconfirmed our thesis that many EM Asia countries recently redirected their economies — potentially at just the wrong time — to take advantage of what they thought would be ongoing strength in China’s economy. However, with China’s growth now stalling amid lower commodity prices and weak inbound trade, many EM countries are now enduring weaker than expected growth, bigger deficits, and heightened political tensions.
