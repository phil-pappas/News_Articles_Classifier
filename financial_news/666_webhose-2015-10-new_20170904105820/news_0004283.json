Bloomberg by Tracey McNaughton In communicating its decision not to raise interest rates last month the US Federal Reserve raised the importance of international economic and financial market developments.\nThe last time the parochial authority allowed international market turbulence to halt a domestic tightening cycle was 17 years ago. Back then the focus was on the failure of US hedge fund LTCM, the Asian financial crisis and the Russian debt default. Now, it is China.\nHaving been rocked by yet another tantrum in August and September, investors are assessing the data for any structural damage.\nSince the decision by the Chinese authorities to devalue the renminbi on August 11 markets have been reflecting on just how abruptly the pace of growth is slowing in China.\nPerversely, doubts about slower growth can become self-fulfilling. Questions about the pace of slowing have led to a rise in private capital leaving China; this has put downward pressure on the currency, causing the Chinese authorities to intervene in support by selling US dollars and buying renminbi. This intervention creates a tightening of financial conditions which in turn weighs on economic growth.\nThe PBOC has attempted to offset this tightening by cutting official interest rates (five times in nine months). Yet financial conditions in China are still as tight as they were back in October 2008.\nThis circularity highlights an impossible trinity: no country can have a fixed exchange rate, an open capital account and enjoy an independent monetary policy regime at the same time.\nCurrency war The end game requires China to do something more â€“ re-introduce capital controls to stop the bleeding from its foreign reserves, introduce more domestic stimulus measures to support growth, or let the currency adjust more freely to market forces (and potentially raising fears of a currency war).\nThis latter option is the most difficult, most politically contentious, and therefore the least likely in the near term.\nOn capital controls, however, the PBOC plans to impose a 20 per cent reserve requirement on financial institutions' forward FX purchases. The reserves will be held for one year with no remuneration, thereby helping to reduce FX speculations and related outflows.\nOn domestic stimulus, key support measures already announced in recent months fall into four broad categories: ongoing monetary easing to contain real financing and debt servicing costs; fiscal funding and public-private partnership programs to support infrastructure and public works investment; accelerating local government debt swaps and bond issuances to alleviate financial pressures for local governments; and rolling out initiatives to support private sector development and consumption such as lowering taxes and fees for SMEs, reducing deposit requirements for first and second home purchases, and expanding pension and health care insurance coverage.\nGiven the government's explicit willingness to do whatever it takes to stabilise growth between 6.5 and 7 per cent, we think these measures will revive growth in China in the coming months. This, in addition to evidence of a stabilisation in the property market, will provide at least a key (though not complete) counterbalance against China's ongoing heavy industry downturn.\nOur base case for global asset allocation therefore remains that China is slowing, but in a stable fashion. This weaker growth profile is more than offset by a strengthening growth profile in the United States, Europe and Japan. This leaves us cautiously overweight on equity markets, particularly those in Europe, Japan and north Asia.\nTracey McNaughton is head of investment strategy at UBS Global Asset Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:55:20.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
