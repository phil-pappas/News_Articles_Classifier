Chandler home has 20 bedrooms and seven baths and is listed for sale at less than $30,000. The house was assessed at more than $600,000. \nBut the entire 10,000 square foot mansion must be relocated to make way for a parking lot for the St. Hedwig parish next door. \nA real estate agent responsible for the listing estimated moving the home locally could cost up to $300,000. He says calls have come in from around the country since the listing went up Sunday night.
