He contends that \"excessive reliance on unconventional monetary policy\" is not without side effects, many of which are only now being felt in markets.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: In North America's Costliest City, Rich Chinese Take the Blame \nAt some point during Fed QE, the markets started reacting positively to bad news. In our view, this is when things started going wrong. Bad news became good news for asset prices, as markets expected more QE by the Fed. Asset prices were increasingly deviating from fundamentals, as the markets were trading the Fed instead of the economic reality. This was clearly not sustainable.\nVamvakidis argues that the market's violent reaction to the Fed's announcement in the spring of 2013 that it planned to \"taper\" its bond purchases was one sign that QE had already gone wrong.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Man Who Called China's Boom and Bust Says Use This Rally to Sell \nWe should have known something is wrong. The Fed “taper tantrum” could have been the first signal that QE had gone too far. The second warning may have been the across-the-board emerging markets sell-off that started in mid-2014, as QE tapering was coming to an end and the market started pricing Fed tightening, a sell-off that intensified substantially this year.\nAll of this doesn't mean Vamvakidis believes QE should have never happened, of course.\nHe does recognize that the Fed policy helped the U.S. avert another great depression in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but he doesn't believe that bond-buying should be the first choice for action whenever something goes south in the economy. He calls the first round of QE \"a necessity,\" but is more skeptical of the Fed's subsequent programs known as QE2 and QE3.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Billionaire’s Dropout Grandson Wants to Kill Work E-mail \nMoreover, he notes that despite the continued expansion of balance sheets at a number of central banks around the world, monetary policy conditions have tightened and liquidity has fallen as shown in the below BofAML charts: \nSo what happens next? Vamvakidis contends that markets are embarking on a big readjustment:\nThe story of the year so far may be that of a negative feedback loop leading to a bad equilibrium. First, risk assets sold off expecting the Fed to tighten. Then, the sell-off went too far and started affecting the real economy, including in the US. Now, the Fed is not tightening as a result. However, postponing Fed tightening does not necessarily increase the demand for risk assets. This is a new regime, in which bad news is bad news. This is how it is supposed to be, but the adjustment back to normal has not been and is not going to be smooth, in our view. \nBuckle up.\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nGross to Sue Pimco for 'Hundreds of Millions' Over Ouster It’s Apple’s World, So Why Do Other Smartphone Makers Even Bother?
