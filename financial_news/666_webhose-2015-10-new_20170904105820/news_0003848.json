This reflects a broader fall in crude oil prices.\nWhy are retail gasoline prices up? The increase in wholesale spot prices has also resulted in higher retail gasoline prices, particularly in Southern California. California retail gasoline prices are typically higher than the US average as a result of higher taxes and differences in gasoline specifications.\nExxonMobil’s impact on gasoline prices in California According the Los Angeles Times , a major contributing factor to the high gasoline prices has been low production at the ExxonMobil (XOM) Torrance refinery, which was damaged in a February explosion.\nThe plant, which normally accounts for 10% of the state’s capacity and 20% of capacity in Southern California, has operated at less than 20% of normal production since the explosion.\nRefiners making profits from high gasoline prices Due to a high crack spread and access to crude oil at lower prices, refiners’ operating costs are quite low. High gasoline prices are boosting refiners’ margins, especially those of companies operating in California such as Phillips 66 (PSX), Tesoro (TSO), ExxonMobil, Valero (VLO), and Chevron (CVX). ExxonMobil and Chevron account for 29.8% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE).\nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - California Gasoline Imports Push Prices Higher Basic Materials Industry Southern California California ExxonMobil gasoline prices", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:47:48.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
