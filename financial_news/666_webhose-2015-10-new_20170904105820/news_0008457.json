More Colombia to sign peace deal with rebels \n“This measure is to recover economic stability and meet the targets of our fiscal adjustment,” said Ms Rousseff. \nThe development follows a market sell-off of Brazil’s currency, the real, on doubts over whether the left-leaning president and her Workers’ party, the PT, would be able to restore sinking public finances. \nMs Rousseff has flip-flopped on promises to reduce the growing budget deficit, which at 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product is undermining confidence and helping to deepen the recession. \nShe has also faced a rebellion in her main coalition partner, the PMDB, a loose grouping of regionalist politicians, who have signalled support for impeachment if the increasingly unpopular president does not share more power. \n“Shoring up in a lasting way the relationship with the PMDB will prove quite difficult, given that the party has already announced its intention to field its own presidential candidate in 2018,” Goldman Sachs said in a report. \nMs Rousseff had been expected to axe 10 ministries on Friday. Instead, she cut eight, as well as reducing ministers’ salaries by 10 per cent. \nShe also announced a rationalisation of the senior bureaucracy, cutting 30 secretaries and 3,000 jobs. \nAmong the most important ministerial changes, Ms Rousseff replaced her chief of staff, Aloizio Mercadante, with her defence minister, Jaques Wagner. This measure is to recover economic stability and meet the targets of our fiscal adjustment \n- Dilma Rousseff \nWhile Mr Mercadante, seen by analysts as a divisive figure, will remain as education minister, his removal from the key political co-ordinator post is expected to help smooth Ms Rousseff’s relations within the cabinet and with an estranged congress. \nAnalysts said the new cabinet was a hybrid of appointees favoured by Ms Rousseff’s predecessor and mentor, the former PT president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and of the PMDB. \n“The face of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has returned to command the presidential palace while the Esplanade [the Esplanade of Ministries, an avenue in Brasília] was sold in one swoop to the PMDB,” said Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. \nIt was not clear, however, for how long the reshuffle would head off the impeachment movement. \nThe government’s chief opponent in the house, Mr Cunha, was struck a serious blow this week when Swiss authorities froze secret accounts he and his family allegedly kept in Switzerland. \nMr Cunha has already been implicated by Brazilian authorities in a big corruption scandal afflicting Petrobras, in which he is alleged to have received bribes from the state-owned oil company’s contractors. He has denied the charges. \n“Since Eduardo Cunha is a Brazilian, citizen he cannot be extradited to Switzerland,” the Office of the Attorney-general of Switzerland said in a statement. For this reason, it was “transferring the ongoing proceedings against Cunha to Brazil with the aim that the issue at stake can be further investigated and judged by the Brazilian judicial authorities”. \nMr Cunha has declined to comment on the allegations of the accounts. \nHe is considered the government’s most dangerous critic because as house Speaker he has the power to kick off the impeachment process. \nBut in a possible concession to him, Celso Pansera, reported by Brazilian media to be one of Mr Cunha’s close allies, was appointed science, technology and innovation minister. \nAdditional reporting by Carina Rossi  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:26:57.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
