Photo: Virginia Star\nMost people think that we have financial penalties to encourage people to do the right thing. Why should it be any different for employers who do not pay super to their employees?\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday So it is with some surprise to learn of the government's plans to reduce the penalties for employers who do not pay their employees' superannuation entitlements to, well, practically nothing.\nWe are told that this is good policy as it will somehow encourage employers to pay up.\nAdvertisement Employers who always meet their superannuation obligations would want to see their competitors who do not meet their legal obligations penalised so they can compete on a level playing field.\nUnder the government's proposals, from the middle of next year, all employers, not just small employers, will face a tiny administrative fee for not paying super.\nWhat happens now is that if an employer is late in making a contribution, the employer pays the contribution not at ordinary time earnings, but on total earnings.\nThat can be an effective penalty for employers with workers who do overtime.\nUnder the proposed changes, the late super contribution would equal the standard calculation of superannuation. In other words, employers just have to pay the super that they should have paid.\nThere is currently an interest charge for the employer of 10 per cent a year on late payments. But under the proposed changes, the way that is calculated changes so that the interest penalty is less.\nLet's take an employer who does not pay 12 months' worth of super for an employee on average wages who does the typical amount of overtime.\nUnder the present arrangements, the effective penalty for not paying a year's worth of super for this worker is about $200.\nUnder the changes, the penalty would be of the order of tens of dollars.\nMuch of the non-payment and underpayment occurs with younger and lower-income workers.\nOne estimate is that about 650,000 workers are missing out on up to $2.5 billion a year in superannuation payments. Did I hear someone mention 7-Eleven?\nThe proposed changes are all part of the government's moves to help small businesses and remove red tape – a very worthwhile aim.\nThe government says the current penalties are too high and may stop some business owners from reporting late super payments.\nBut paying superannuation is a legal obligation. And, if a business cannot survive after meeting its legal obligations to those it hires, well, that's business.\nIt sends the wrong signal to employers that their employees' super can be used as a source of cash to tide them over, or to stop the business from going under.\nSuperannuation is not employers' money that can be used in this way.\nAnd there is a real risk that removing penalties for non-payment will only exacerbate the problem of non-payment of super.\nThe Turnbull government has a new minister for small business and hopefully these proposed changes will be reviewed.\n @jcollett_money", "external_links": ["https://membercentre.fairfax.com.au/NewsletterSubscription.aspx", "http://twitter.com/@jcollett_money"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:03:23.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
