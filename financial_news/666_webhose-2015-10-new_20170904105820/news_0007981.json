Slowing auction clearance rates point to broader softening in the housing market, particularly in Sydney. Photo: Rob Homer\n\"Recently there have been tentative signs of some slowing in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets: auction clearance rates have fallen and price growth has eased in Sydney of late,\" the RBA's Financial Stability Review said.\nAdvertisement It comes amid predictions of house price falls and Westpac's shock move to this week jack up interest rates by 0.2 of a percentage point for the first time in more than three years. Other banks are likely to follow to some extent, analysts say, which could take more heat out of the property market.\nThe rate hike has also sparked predictions the Reserve Bank may cut interest rates next month as it tries to stimulate the economy and create jobs growth. The RBA did not comment on interest rates, only saying competition between banks remained strong, despite Westpac's move.\nIllustration: Ron Tandberg\nAlmost 900 properties in Sydney are set to go under the hammer this weekend, but vendors face a market in which clearance rates have fallen from almost 90 per cent in May to about 70 per cent in recent weeks.\nOfficial figures also point to a slowdown in new bank lending to property investors, a key driver of the boom, due to tougher restrictions on banks enforced by regulators.\nFurther highlighting a decline in sentiment, the Westpac Melbourne Institute index of whether consumers think now is a good \"time to buy a dwelling\" is about 30 per cent from its peak in 2013. The index has fallen especially sharply in NSW.\nDespite highlighting risks in the property market, which also included poor lending standards from banks, the RBA said the economy was better placed to manage these risks.\nThis is because banks have raised about $18 billion in funds for absorbing losses, they have recently toughened credit standards, and the signs of slowing in the Sydney and Melbourne housing markets.\nThe central bank's comments come after several analysts have also argued prices are close to peaking, including Macquarie economists' prediction of a 7.5 per cent fall in prices across the nation from next March.\nThe Reserve Bank said key risks to the Australian banking system centred on commercial and residential property, as it highlighted previous flawed lending from the country's major banks.\n\"The risks surrounding housing and mortgage markets seem higher than average at present. Housing markets have been buoyant in Sydney and Melbourne over much of the year, with very strong price growth and a historically large role being played by investors,\" the report said.\nDespite these risks, it said evidence suggested levels of household financial stress was \"fairly benign,\" even though the rate of unemployment had risen.\nThe report highlighted poor lending standards by the country's big banks, citing recent probes by regulators that had uncovered flaws in how banks were assessing borrowers for loans. It said standards had since been tightened.\n\"In some cases, practices have not met prudential expectations, potentially placing lenders at risk of breaching their responsible lending obligations under consumer protection laws,\" the RBA said.\nFor instance, a review by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, published in August, revealed significant flaws in credit standards in the booming interest-only mortgage market.\nCiti economist Paul Brennan said the Reserve Bank appeared \"relatively\" sanguine on property, though it was unfortunate lending standards had not been improved earlier.\nIn a note to clients, Mr Brennan also stressed the fine line for policymakers in trying to cool down housing without sparking a significant slump.\n\"If sentiment turns too much, then this could trigger significant downward pressure on prices and rents that creates potential macroeconomic and financial disruption,\" Mr Brennan said.\nAside from residential property, the RBA said there were rising risks in the major banks' lending to commercial property.\nThe RBA said banks had also become 'increasingly weary of lending to property developers in markets that look oversupplied\".\n\"Speculative demand could lead to an excess increase in construction activity and future supply overhang,\" the RBA said, identifying inner city Melbourne and Brisbane as particularly vulnerable.\nWith Jonathan Shapiro", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:35:48.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
