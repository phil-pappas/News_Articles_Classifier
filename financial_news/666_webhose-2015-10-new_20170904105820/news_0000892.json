It is looking at a range of sites, with the Australian Technology Park one preference.\nUrbanGrowth​ NSW is selling the ATP with expectations that developer Walker Corp will emerge the victor and bring the bank with it as anchor tenant.\nAs first revealed by BusinessDay , internet provider Google is keen to make the White Bay power station in the Bays Precinct, Balmain, its new home where it can build a campus-style office complex.\nGoogle is in the market for more than 60,000 square metres of space and is also considering a city address, including Brookfield Property Partners' 10 Carrington Street development.\nAt Darling Quarter, it is a 26,000-square-metre campus-style office and the only commercial building in Sydney's new urban neighbourhood, Darling Square in Darling Harbour, and will target a 6 Star Green Star design rating and 5 Star NABERS​ energy rating.\nLend Lease managing director, urban regeneration, Jonathan Emery said it was flexible office space in the heart of Sydney's expanding media, knowledge, digital and creative precinct.\n\"Darling Square will have around 2500 workers and 4500 residents, including over 1000 students, who will enjoy a vibrant village atmosphere that also includes new public spaces, shops and cafes,\" Mr Emery said.\nThe deals are set against the backdrop of a solid leasing sector.\nAs a result, the Sydney CBD vacancy rate tightened to 7.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2015, well below the 20-year average of 8.3 per cent, JLL said.\nIn the latest DEXUS​ Office Demand Barometer, it says while some parts of the city have eased, it remains in positive territory, indicating that conditions for tenant demand in Sydney are likely to remain positive over the next six months.\nThe DEXUS Office Demand Barometer registered 1.1 per cent for September, a decrease of 0.4 per cent from 1.5 per cent in the June 2015 quarter.\nVolatility in the Australian sharemarket was a major influence on the barometer as the S&P/ASX Index fell 8 per cent over the past three months.\nPeter Studley​, general manager, research at DEXUS, said subdued confidence was also a factor as the latest NAB Business Confidence Index for the finance, business, and property sectors slipped in September.\n\"Office property owners can take comfort from the fact that this quarter's easing is as a result of movements in the more volatile components of the barometer,\" Mr Studley said.\nJLL's head of strategic research, Australia, Andrew Ballantyne, said while financial market volatility negatively impacted on business confidence over the quarter, businesses were willing to read through the short-term volatility and make long-term strategic real estate decisions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:23:17.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
