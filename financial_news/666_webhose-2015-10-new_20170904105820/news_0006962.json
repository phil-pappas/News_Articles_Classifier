A similar meeting held in May failed to achieve cooperation between the two sides. \nNon-OPEC producers have refused to work with OPEC in cutting supply to reduce a surplus that has prompted oil prices to sink below $50 a barrel from $115 in June 2014. \nIn turn, OPEC has refused to limit supply alone and many of its members have raised output. \nMost OPEC countries have sent their national representatives - oil experts who rank below ministers - to the event, although Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino and his Ecuadorean counterpart Pedro Merizalde-Pavón are attending. \nCash-strapped member Venezuela is pushing for OPEC and non-OPEC cuts and has proposed reviving OPEC's price band mechanism, attempting to set a price floor of $70 a barrel. \nBut the Gulf OPEC members, including top exporter Saudi Arabia, have shown no interest in returning to a strategy of supporting prices, seeking instead to fight for market share. \n(Editing by Dale Hudson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:51:49.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
