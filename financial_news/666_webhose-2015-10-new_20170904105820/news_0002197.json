She has honed her entrepreneurial spirit, leadership acumen, and real estate expertise over an impressive 17-year career in the financial services industry.\n“Heather’s entrepreneurial achievements and willingness to take risks exemplify what CREW is all about,” said Lori Kilberg, President of CREW Network and Partner at Hartman Simons & Wood LLP. “Celebrating the accomplishments of remarkable women like Heather is one way CREW helps influence and advance the commercial real estate industry, so it was our pleasure to recognize her at this year’s national convention.”\n“It was a great honor to accept the Impact Award for Entrepreneurial Spirit at the CREW National Conference in front of over 1,000 of my most distinguished CREW colleagues,” said Heather Schwarz. “Thank you to the organizers for the recognition!”\n“As EarlyShares and our flagship brand, Property.com, continue to disrupt commercial real estate finance and grow alongside the real estate crowdfunding market, we look forward to supporting CREW’s mission of advancing and celebrating the achievements of women in our industry,” Schwarz continued.\nEarlyShares introduces investors to the kinds of commercial real estate opportunities that have traditionally been difficult and expensive to access.
