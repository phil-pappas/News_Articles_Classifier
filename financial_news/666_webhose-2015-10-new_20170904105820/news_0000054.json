From cutting out a few little luxuries to rethinking living arrangements, most people are surprised at how small regular savings can quickly add up.\n“Everyone is different, but there is fat to be trimmed from every budget and it can amount to hundreds of dollars each month,” says People’s Choice Credit Union spokesman Stuart Symonds. “Online budget planner calculators can help you find the savings.\n“You may need to give up your privacy by moving in with family member or roommates to save a deposit more quickly.”\n2 CO-OWNERSHIP\n“You can pool your borrowing power with family and friends and co-own a property, while retaining control over your own mortgage ,” Symons says.\nHowever, any co-ownership agreements need to be carefully put together, with exit strategies in place, to avoid a bust-up down the track.\nScrimp and save and your first home will deposit will gradually accumulate.
