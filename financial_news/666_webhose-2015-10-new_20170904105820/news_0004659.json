Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Australia's biggest initial public offering for the year looks set to be a rip-roaring success and restore some backbone into the sharemarket after a rocky couple of months.\nShares in registry company Link Group priced at the top of the range at $6.37 each as revealed by Street Talk Online, and there will be significant scale backs as institutional investors look for solid, reliable earnings from a company with reasonably high barriers to entry and the balance sheet strength to make more acquisitions like the Superpartners buyout.\nRothschild, which was running the deal, was playing hardball on Thursday and told fund managers in no uncertain terms they risked missing out on shares if they had the audacity to bid below the $6.37 a share ceiling price.\nSources said some chunky orders came through on Wednesday night from good quality, long-only overseas funds who are in for the long haul. Buy and hold was the mantra for this one rather than a quick flip, the bookrunners were saying. The offshore demand meant the price was pushed right to the top end of the new range.\nThe price range was lifted from the initial range of $5.41 to $6.37 a share, as revealed by Street Talk on Wednesday, to $5.90 to $6.37 a share. Guidance of $6.15 per share and higher was initially released to bidders on Thursday morning.\nWhen the hammer finally fell at 2pm on Thursday, Link had raised $946.5 million. Majority owner Pacific Equity Partners will be all smiles now with the company scheduled to list on October 27, with a market capitalisation of $2.29 billion.\nMacquarie Capital, Citi, Deutsche Bank and UBS are joint lead managers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:10:22.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
