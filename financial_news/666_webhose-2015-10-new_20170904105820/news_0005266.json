One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to meet the needs of about 10,000 U.S. homes for a year.\nThe pipeline gathers gas from the Gulf of Mexico and transports it onshore for processing, Stockton said.\nThe pipeline is owned by Williams Partners' Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Co (Transco).\nWilliams said service to customers was not interrupted because no gas was flowing through the pipeline at the time of the blast. The company said the pipeline did not rupture.\nPersonnel were performing maintenance on a piece of equipment in the station yard called a \"slug catcher\" which is used to collect hydrocarbon liquids and other impurities from the gas stream.\nThree contractors performing the maintenance died and two others sustained serious injuries, Williams said in a statement.\nThe 13 Williams employees stationed at the facility have been accounted for and were not injured, the company said.\n\"We are deeply saddened by reports of serious injuries to personnel working at the scene. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families at this very critical time,\" said Warren Toups, Williams Operations Manager.\nThe building containing the compressor engines was not damaged, the company said.
