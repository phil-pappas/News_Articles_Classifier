However the decline in sales accelerated in the period, hit by weak consumer electronics demand in its top market of Brazil and by the August bombings in Thailand.\n\"This is a good set of sales results for Casino. The bad news in Latin America, mainly Brazil, and Thailand was known before,\" Bernstein analysts, who rate the stock with an outperform rating, said.\nUnilever rose 3.6 percent after the consumer goods maker reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales, although it added that sluggish global markets continued to weigh on its performance.\nBurberry fell 8.3 percent after a sharp sales slowdown in China and Hong Kong led the British luxury goods company to miss forecasts for first-half sales growth and warn of an increasingly challenging environment.\nA tumultuous summer for global markets has dampened expectations for this earnings season, with analysts expecting a 13.5 percent fall in year on year growth, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine data.\nStrategists at JP Morgan said in a note that all the major European countries they track are seeing more earnings downgrades than upgrades, with Italy and Spain in particular experiencing a major reversal of their upward earnings trend.\nTeliaSonera fell 3 percent after U.S. short-seller Muddy Waters revealed it had a short position in the Swedish firm, and made serious criticisms of it. It closed off its lows after TeliaSonera dismissed the criticism.
