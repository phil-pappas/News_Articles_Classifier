Thawley's predecessors – whether Peter Shergold or Terry Moran or Ian Watt – would never have attended such a gathering, nor would right-wing commentators have invited them as fellow travellers.\nThe Australian Public Service finds itself in a strange place – led by a man seemingly reliving his glory days as a foreign policy neo-con in George W. Bush 's Washington and a Treasury secretary (straight out of wealth management giant UBS) with a curious preoccupation with the quality of his staff's clothing . John Fraser 's boffins are calling it the \"Armani rule\". Clearly, nobody told them (or their secretary) that Giorgio Armani 's suits went out of fashion in the 1990's.\nAnd it's been a torrid few years for the federal bureaucracy, chaos having become a central part of their job descriptions since the arrival of the Mad King Kevin Rudd . By all accounts, the paralysis of the executive branch had become nearly as bad under Abbott.\nIllustration: Rod Clement Given Turnbull's determination for a return to a pre-Rudd APS operation and culture, can Thawley remain at its helm? Highly unlikely.\nRemember that Martin Parkinson 's name kept bobbing up right after last month's leadership spill as a likely chief of staff in the new PM's private office . Another bureaucrat, Drew Clarke , remains acting in that position – and if the PM has his way, Clarke will be settling in permanently.\nParkinson was sacked as Treasury secretary by Abbott (despite the protestation of Treasurer Joe Hockey ) in his first days as PM, but stayed on for the 2014 budget and the G20 in Brisbane. He's since moved on with his life, joining the board of chemicals and explosives company Orica.\nClearly, Parkinson won't be lured back by a staffer's gig – even the highest one (although that role will be greatly diminished compared with its previous, infamous occupant). Nor would he be lured back to his old job in a great, vindicating restoration.\nOrica director and former Treasury secretary Dr Martin Parkinson Alex Ellinghausen But, as secretary of Prime Minister and cabinet? A hard offer for a patriot, aged just 57, to turn down. And directorships like Orica will still be there for the taking once he's remade the APS in his own, and Turnbull's, image – just ask Mike Codd (Qantas), Max \"Shit Happens\" Moore-Wilton (Sydney Airport, Southern Cross Austereo), Ian Macfarlane (ANZ and Leighton) and NAB's new chairman Ken Henry .
