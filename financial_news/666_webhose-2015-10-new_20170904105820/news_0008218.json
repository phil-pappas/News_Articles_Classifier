Photo: Michele Mossop\nStruggling retailer Woolworths plans to unveil a new loyalty program rewarding customers with discounts on groceries as early as Sunday, in a move that will shift the focus from its reliance on giving its customers Qantas frequent-flyer points.\nIt's not clear what role, if any, Qantas will play in the new Woolworths Everyday Rewards program, which has leveraged its relationship with the airline to market the program since 2009 and now has grown to almost 8 million members. Sources said Qantas and Woolworths were still negotiating the terms of a new arrangement, which would apply to purchases after the current deal expires on December 31.\nThe cost of the alliance with Qantas is understood to be a major stumbling block for the supermarket chain. Woolworths pays Qantas for each of the points, in a deal retail analysts estimate costs the company about $80 million a year. Qantas, in turn, books that revenue in its loyalty division.\nOne retail analyst said it made sense for Woolworths to nurture customers' loyalty with discounts on its own products. \"I believe Woolworths will come away from its loyalty program and move into a transactional rewards program,\" the analyst said.\nAdvertisement However, the response to reports Woolworths was looking to end its relationship with Qantas was fierce, with many consumers threatening to stop shopping at Woolworths . Therefore, while axing the Qantas deal might boost its margins, Woolworths could lose revenue to rivals such as Coles, Aldi and IGA as a result.\nArch rival Coles signed a new deal on Tuesday with Qantas rival Etihad Airways that will allow members of the Coles flybuys loyalty scheme to earn points shopping at its supermarkets and liquor stores, and earlier this year Virgin Australia cut a deal with petrol retailer BP to award members of its Velocity frequent-flyer program.\nIn a message to all of its frequent flyer members on Thursday, Qantas said it was \"working together to ensure how, as a loyal member of Qantas Frequent Flyer and a Woolworths shopper, you will continue to get the best value from the rewards program\".\nFor the past six years, Woolworths loyalty program members have been able to earn one Qantas point for each dollar spent over $30 at its supermarkets and BWS bottle shops, and one point per $2 spent over $30 in store at BIG W. Woolworths has also used special promotions offering hundreds of extra points for spending a certain minimum amount in regular emails to Everyday Rewards members.\nIf the Woolworths-Qantas relationship comes to an end, Qantas frequent-flyer members with branded credit cards from companies, including ANZ, NAB, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Citibank and American Express , will still be able to earn some points shopping at Woolworths if they pay via those credit cards.\nThe status of the Woolworths-offered co-branded Qantas Platinum Credit Card is less clear. However, the future earnings potential of all cards linked to loyalty programs is under a cloud as a result of a Reserve Bank review that could reform payments regulation .\nThere has been industry speculation for a few years that Woolworths was unhappy with the high fees it was paying Qantas for points as part of their deal. Last September, Fairfax Media reported Woolworths was planning to shift the focus away from Qantas frequent-flyer points and towards immediate rewards such as shopping vouchers .", "external_links": ["http://www.qantas.com.au/cardselector/InitialLoadAction.do", "https://www.woolworthsmoney.com.au/credit-cards/qantas-platinum-card.html", "https://www.flybuys.com.au/partners/etihad"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:25:51.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
