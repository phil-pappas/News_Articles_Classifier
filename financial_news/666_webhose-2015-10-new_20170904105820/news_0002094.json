Ben Butler by Matthew Smith The public market adventures of iSelect seemed doomed from the start, so it's almost fitting the company will end up in the cold hands of a buyout fund just two years after its ill-fated ASX debut.\nOn Tuesday morning AFR's Street Talk column named Providence Equity Partners as the private equity suitor for the online comparison website. The deal could value the company at a 23 per cent premium based on its $1.53 share price at the end of trading on Monday.\nBut it was the awkward dumping of 8 per cent of the stock by Spectrum Equity Investors on the day of the hyped float in June 2013 that appeared to set the tone for the company's short life as a listed company, which sent its stock tumbling more than 4 per cent on the day. Spectrum had been expected to hold onto its stake post listing.\nThe company's woes continued two months later when the insurance comparison website attracted the ire of the regulator after it had missed its revenue forecasts. Part of the issue relating to its revenues was the complicated story iSelect took to the public markets.\nDuring the pre-float book build process, questions were raised by the investment community about the model for collecting and predicting future revenue.\nISelect earned money through trailing commissions paid by healthcare funds over periods as long as four to five years; those commission payments would end up with the business only if the individual end customer stayed with that fund.\nIt was those future revenues that had to be discounted, a model that brokers and fundies struggled to get their heads around from day one.\nStill, it was mid-2013, and there was optimism for the companies coming down the IPO pipeline, the first batch of what ended up as a fertile period for ASX listings.\n At the end of the day – and with the fullness of hindsight – the iSelect float was only really a way for early investors to crystallise gains rather than for investors in the public markets to generate returns.\nSpectrum Equity sold its shares at $1.85, a level the share price never found itself close to again. ISelect shares reached a high of $1.80 in August, fortuitously a month and a half before the buyout offer materialised, which was speculated to be in the $2 per share range.\nMi9, the digital joint venture partnership between Channel Nine and US technology giant, Microsoft, also profited from its early ownership in iSelect.\nBefore Mi9 was bought out by Nine Entertainment, the company, headed by CEO Mark Britt, seeded online digital ventures like iSelect. At the time of the float it was speculated Mi9 sold its iSelect stake for $114.7 million, a handsome return on the approximately $40 million it was believed to have invested six years prior.\nIn August Mr Britt was appointed to head the subscription video-on-demand and internet television division of Patrick Grove's Catcha Group, the owner of Asian-centric online platforms iProperty and iCar.\nOpportunistic investors including Ellerston Capital and Paradice Investment Management made the most out of the public market value during the short but eventful iSelect ASX stint.\nBoth funds managers amassed substantial 5 per cent and 8 per cent stakes in the company respectively at a time when the company's stock made all of its public market gains.\nIn its wake iSelect has lost no less than two CEOs, after Matt McCann departed from the company in its first year after listing. On Tuesday morning the company announced Alex Stevens would leave to pursue other opportunities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:01.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
