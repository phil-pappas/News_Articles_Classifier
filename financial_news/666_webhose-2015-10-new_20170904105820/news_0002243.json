It contains six times more vitamin than the orange, six times richer in potassium than banana, and twice as rich in calcium than milk. \nMost of the households in the communities especially the rural settings of the northern ecological zones particularly Upper East Region use the leaves of the trees for the preparation of soup, which is very nutritious, the CEO said. \nThe company as part of its corporate social responsibility had also sunk boreholes for some communities including Kpale in the Nabdam District and Yikine in the Bolgatanga Municipality. \nHe commended the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority (SADA) and Dr Ken Kwame Kwaku, a philanthropist for supporting the company to thrive, \nHe appealed to SADA and other development partners for more support to expand the company to compliment government's efforts at creating more jobs for the youth. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:14:44.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
