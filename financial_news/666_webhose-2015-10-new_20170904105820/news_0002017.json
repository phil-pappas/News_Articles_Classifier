The visit \"shows that England is not giving a damn about human rights,\" said Aisha Nahmmacher, 24, from south London. \nBut they were drowned out by the thousands of supporters who banged drums and held large portraits of Xi as they posed for photographs in front of Buckingham Palace, where Xi and his wife will stay as guests of the Queen. \nCHARM OFFENSIVE \nFor Britain, the four-day state visit is the culmination of a three-year charm offensive to attract investment in infrastructure, nuclear power and the government's planned transformation of northern England. \nOne deal expected to be signed during Xi's visit is a plan for two state-owned Chinese utilities to invest in a 16 billion pound ($25-billion) nuclear power project being built by French utility EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) at Hinkley Point in southwest England. \nBritain has won praise from China for its discretion in dealing with human rights issues by raising them behind the scenes, a policy London says is more effective than hectoring Beijing publicly. \nA visit to China last month by finance minister George Osborne sealed the deal, with influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times praising his \"etiquette\". \nCameron has said he will not duck sensitive issues like the impact of cheap Chinese imports on struggling British steel-makers, however, and main opposition party leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised to raise rights when he meets Xi later on Tuesday. \nXi may express China's hopes that the European Union remains united -- a thorny subject for Cameron, who has pledged to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the European Union before a referendum to be held by the end of 2017. \nBut any such sour notes, including Prince Charles' decision to not attend a state banquet, are unlikely to spoil a visit that has been long in the making. \nBritain was the top destination for Chinese money in 2014, with $5.1 billion in investment, according to law firm Baker & McKenzie. This year, it became the first Western nation to join the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank after Washington had pressed allies not to join. \nIn a pointed commentary before Xi's arrival in Britain, Global Times suggested that critics were jealous. \"Apparently the concept of a 'golden era' between the two countries has made some people uncomfortable,\" it said in an editorial. \n\"This has hurt the twisted dignity of those who still consider the West the centre of the world.\" \n(Additional reporting by Kate Holton in London, Ben Blanchard in Beijing; Editing by Catherine Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:21:21.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
