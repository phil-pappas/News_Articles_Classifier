news ) (GSK), the drugs giant which owns Horlicks, Nicorette and Zovirax. \nSky News can exclusively reveal that Woodford Investment Management wants Britain's biggest pharmaceuticals group to formally explore the separation of its HIV business ViiV, its consumer healthcare division and Stiefel, its dermatology division, from its core medicines and vaccines arm. \nMr Woodford has held private talks about the issue with Sir Philip Hampton, GSK's new chairman, insiders said on Saturday. \nA further meeting between them is understood to have been scheduled to discuss the fund manager's belief that significant shareholder value could be derived from a break-up, while he has also canvassed the views of other leading investors in the company. \nThe news that Mr Woodford, who set up his own business last year after a long stint as a successful stock-picker at Invesco Perpetual, wants to see GSK examine such a radical shake-up will ignite a fierce debate about the company's future. \nThe City has grown frustrated at GSK's lacklustre share price performance, with the stock down about 3% over the last 12 months as investors wait to see whether a pipeline of promising new products will deliver. \nUnder Sir Andrew Witty, its chief executive since 2008, GSK has signalled a shift away from highly priced prescription drugs in favour of vaccines and consumer products. \nThe GSK boss has admitted that this is a contrarian bet in the context of the wider industry but believes it is the best way to ensure a return to predictable long-term growth at a time when there is mounting pressure on drug pricing. \nIn an interview on Friday, he said the US drugs market - the world's largest - faced \"dramatic changes\", with rampant price inflation at an end. \nSir Andrew has largely been content to sit on the sidelines during a deluge of multi-billion pound industry deals, some of which were driven by a desire among US-based companies to switch their tax bases to more favourable jurisdictions. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) did, however, sell brands such as Ribena, and struck an innovative three-way deal with Novartis (LSE: 0QLR.L - news ) which saw GSK buy the Swiss group's vaccines unit, form an enlarged consumer healthcare joint venture, and sell its cancer medicines business for $16bn. \nGSK also went as far as hiring banks to prepare a spin-off of ViiV but abandoned the plan after Sir Philip's appointment. \nAt its most recently quarterly results, Sir Andrew said that a portfolio of 11 new products - including Breo, a respiratory drug, and Triumeq, which is used by HIV sufferers - had generated almost £450m in revenue. \nThe company has set a target for the 11 drugs of £6bn in sales by 2020, alongside other objectives, including achieving mid-to-high single digits growth in earnings per share by the same date. \nSeveral large shareholders remain supportive of Sir Andrew's strategy, and believe he should be given more time to deliver it. \n\"Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) is not the time to look again at the group structure because the benefits of the Novartis transaction are yet to come through,\" said one investor. \nAnother person familiar with the company said that the core drugs and vaccines business was fully integrated into the group, making a break-up more complicated to effect. \nMr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest backers of biotech and other healthcare companies, ploughing a significant proportion of the assets under his stewardship into the sector. \nLast year, he was a vocal opponent of a proposed £67bn takeover bid for AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) by the US drugs giant Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) , arguing that it would have diminished Britain's scientific research base. \nThe precise size of Woodford's holding in GSK is unclear, although it is below the 5% threshold that would require formal disclosure to the London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) . \nIt was reported last week that he had increased his shareholding in the company. \nSpokesmen for GSK, which is due to update investors on its third-quarter performance on Wednesday, and Woodford declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:56:08.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
