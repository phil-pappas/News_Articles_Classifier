But the problem comes at the end of an aircraft life.\n\"Now we have a problem with the -200ER model because the operating base is fragmented with three types. We only have a 12 to 16 aircraft operating base. per engine type.\"\nIn a scenario where the -200ERs come out in large numbers, demand may not support the offer, he says. \"This could lead to a part-out situation in which you don't want an engine programme,\" he says.\n\"Part-out traditionally [finds] value in the engines and when Rolls-Royce controls and dominates the aftermarket, who would you sell the engine?\"\nIBA Group intelligence chief Stuart Hatcher says secondary market values are currently driven by the OEMs under their own terms.\n\"The market is going to be driven that way. There is a lack of freedom that can cause some problems,\" says Hatcher.\nTony Brooks, a senior aviation analyst with Flightglobal's Ascend consultancy, does not see similar situations in general aviation.\n\"In general aviation, the market is vastly controlled by the original engine equipment companies,\" he says.\nHe cites Gulfstream G550/560 products powered by one engine provider. \"At least 80% of the fleet is under Rolls Royce's CorporateCare programmes,\" he says.\nBrooks also points out that there isn't such a strong secondary market for used engines.\nRelated Content EBACE: Used business jet market undergoing \"paradigm shift\" says Rolls-Royce ANALYSIS: Why appraisers downplay the fleet impact of cheap fuel â€‹Appraisers should have different views: Avitas Appraisers cautiously upbeat on freighter values Analysis ANALYSIS: the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:15:13.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
