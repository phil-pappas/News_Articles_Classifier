Drillers had cut a total of 61 rigs over the prior five weeks. \nSince hitting an all-time high of 1,609 during this week a year ago, weekly rig count reductions have averaged 20. \n\"Another fall in the U.S. oil rig count helped support WTI price (but) the focus will be on the release of China's trade data, which will indicate whether low prices have kept import demand high,\" ANZ said bank. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) were trading at $49.79 per barrel at 0008 GMT, up 16 cents from their last settlement. Internationally traded Brent futures (LCOc1) were up 11 cents at $52.76 a barrel. \nOil was also supported by a weaker U.S. dollar, since it makes imports for countries using different currencies cheaper. \nThe U.S. dollar (.DXY) (EUR=) hit three-week lows against the euro as minutes from the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting showed the Fed in no rush to raise interest rates. \nData from China in coming days is likely to point to further weakness in the world's second-largest economy, starting with import and export data to be published on Tuesday. \nSome investors fear the economy is at risk of a hard landing which could jeopardize an increasingly fragile international outlook, though most analysts forecast a slow deceleration, predicting that a raft of earlier support measures will gradually kick in. \n(Editing by Ed Davies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:05:30.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
