It decided not to move in September because of turmoil in global markets sparked by worries about China's economic growth.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stocks index rose 1.8 percent to its highest since Sept. 22. France's CAC index was up more than 2 percent.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to a two-week high and was last up 1.7 percent, while Japan's Nikkei closed up 1.6 percent.\nWall Street had already risen on Friday, and S&P index futures signalled further modest gains later on Monday.\nChinese markets were closed for a holiday.\nThe prospect of lower rates for longer took the wind out of the dollar's sails as U.S. Treasury yields dipped. It fell 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies but remained well above lows struck after Friday's numbers.\nThe euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.1250, although the yen was down 0.1 percent at 120 to the dollar as some analysts suspect the Bank of Japan could unveil further monetary easing measures as early as Wednesday.\nYujiro Goto, currency strategist at Nomura, said the expected delay to a Fed hike had hit the dollar.\n\"At the same time, we expect the other major central banks like the Bank of Japan and the ECB to remain dovish. So the euro's rise above $1.13 could be capped, while dollar/yen is likely to be supported at 120 yen.\"\nTen-year Treasury yields, which fell on Friday after the data, pushed lower still, to 1.98 percent.\nGerman 10-year government bonds, the euro zone benchmark, held steady at 0.52 percent, though yields on higher-risk Italian and Spanish debt fell on the prospect of more bond-buying stimulus from the European Central Bank.\nPortuguese 10-year yields fell 1.3 basis points to 2.30 percent, a five-month low, after the centre-right government of Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho won an election on Sunday that was a test of its tough austerity stance.\nOil prices, which rose 1 percent on Friday after the number of active U.S. oil rigs fell for a fifth consecutive week, made further gains as Russian said it would be willing to discuss the oil market with fellow producers. Crude prices have more than halved since mid-2014.\nBrent was last up 12 cents at $48.25 a barrel.\n\"As Russia requested talks, investors seem to expect a possible reduction in oil output to be agreed during rebalancing procedures, with the global supply surplus being too burdensome,\" said Yoo-jin Kang, commodities analyst at NH Investment & Securities based in Seoul.\nGold largely held on to gains made in its biggest one-day jump in nine years on Friday. It last traded at $1,136.50 an ounce.
