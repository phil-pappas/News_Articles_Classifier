By Iona Bain | Telegraph – 19 hours ago 0.00 \nA landmark ruling and payout could trigger another wave of payment protection insurance claims \nSantander has quietly paid almost £25,000 relating to a PPI complaint it had previously thrown out, potentially paving the way for millions of customers to reopen complaints previously dismissed. \nThe case is thought be the first instance of a bank accepting fresh grounds for a PPI (payment protection insurance) complaint following a landmark legal case a year ag o . \n- PPI deadline looms: should I claim £2,750 now? \n- Brace yourself for the next bombardment of PPI calls and texts \nSantander has denied any link between its change of heart in this case and the ruling but it has declined to explain why it first refused the claim and then offered to settle. \nConsumers, meanwhile, are being urged to check old accounts and cards, especially as the “window” for all PPI claims is likely to close in 30 months’ time. \n= The case in question = \nThe claim against Santander was first made in January this year by a Hampshire claims firm on behalf of a Surrey woman in connection with a Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) store card taken out in 1989. PPI was sold alongside it. \nGE Capital Bank, which ran the Debenhams card at the time and was Britain’s biggest store card provider, was fined £600,000 by the regulator in 2008 for mis-selling PPI at that time by far the largest fine imposed by the City regulator over the scandal. \nHowever, in March, Santander, which bought the GE business in 2009, responded that it was “unable to agree that the PPI policy was mis-sold”. \nThe complaint was resubmitted in July, this time claiming that the commission involved in the sale of the policy had been undisclosed and excessive. \nAt the end of September the customer was astonished to receive a letter from Santander offering £24,207. \n= What has changed? = \nFirst (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), took over the policing of consumer credit last year. That means anyone whose complaint over a credit deal is rejected by their provider has the right to appeal to the Financial Ombudsman Service. \nThen, last November, the Supreme Court ruled that failing to disclose a large commission on a PPI sale created an unfair relationship under the Consumer Credit Act. \nFinally, earlier this month the FCA said it was minded to define a “large” commission as being 50pc of the premium or more. \nThe ruling covers PPI policies attached to personal loans, credit cards and store cards but not mortgages. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is particularly helpful for claims on store cards, which were more likely to be rejected. \nAccording to a Competition Commission report in 2009, the average size of commission on PPI sales between 2002 and 2006 was 67pc, so most historic sales are likely to have been above the FCA’s 50pc threshold for success. \nMike Begg of Beat the Banks, a PPI claims firm, said: “We can also revisit cases where compensation has been paid but reduced by the banks, saying the claimant still would have needed some cover and deducting the cost of that cover from the compensation.” \nIf you have made a successful PPI claim, it cannot be submitted again. If a complaint was rejected by your bank, however, it can be reopened. \nDo-it-yourself claims have just as high a success rate as those handled by claims companies, which typically take a quarter of your compensation. \nThe proposed redress for an “unfair terms” sale would be the commission paid above 50pc, the interest paid by the customer on it, and simple interest at 8pc on both elements. \nAny sign of a “second wave” of PPI claims will come as a blow both to banks and to the wider population, who have been bombarded by millions of PPI-related phone calls and texts. \nSantander said of its revised decision: “We will always take the opportunity to review the case again to ensure we have reached the right outcome. In a small number of cases, this can result in us changing our original decision.” \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:01:33.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
