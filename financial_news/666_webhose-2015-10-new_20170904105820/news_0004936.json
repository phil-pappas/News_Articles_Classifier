Receivable Savvy offers members and visitors proven insight and best practice content designed to help them master their portion of the financial supply chain. In tandem with the launch, Receivable Savvy is publishing its inaugural Receivable Savvy Perceptions Study: Research and analysis of supplier activity in the areas of invoicing, payment and remittance, and credit and collections.\nThe Receivable Savvy platform offers best practice insight authored by Receivable Savvy and other subject matter experts, industry news and events, and an opportunity to stay connected via regular updates. Premium members can access additional information in the Knowledge Center such as proprietary research, best practice information and education modules. Premium members can also use the Peer-to-Peer discussion platform to ask pressing industry questions and receive answers from their peers within other organizations or from subject matter experts.\nThe inaugural Receivable Savvy Perceptions Study features in-depth research and analysis from survey responses taken from finance, accounting and credit management professionals from June through August 2015. Responses were from small, mid-size and Fortune 500 organizations and closely mirrors the demographic segmentation of U.S. businesses based on employee size. The study is available online in the Knowledge Center but a free preview is available to all visitors in the News section .\n“After being in the EIPP (electronic invoice presentment and payment) space for a number of years, I realized there was an opportunity to provide clear, concise research and information to supplier organizations of all sizes, whether small enterprises or Fortune 500 companies,” said Ernie Martin, Receivable Savvy Founder and Managing Director. “We wanted to provide an engaging platform for Finance and AR professionals that was easily accessible, extremely affordable and highly relevant to their day-to-day organizational responsibilities. We are not in the business of telling supplier organizations what they should do. Rather, we want to equip them with information designed to help them make the best decisions for their organizations.”\nIn their efforts to equip supplier organizations with the best possible information, Receivable Savvy proudly partners with a variety of subject matter experts, such as Billtrust, Dade Systems, The Kaplan Group and others.\n“We’ve developed very good relationships with organizations that share our passion for providing actionable content to suppliers in a way that simplifies and streamlines how we deliver it,” said Martin. “At the end of the day, our mission is to provide the best research and best practice content to supplier organizations, regardless of industry or size.”\nAbout Receivable Savvy\nCreated by research and financial supply chain management veterans, Receivable Savvy, Inc. is a leading source of financial supply chain information for Finance, Accounts Receivable, and Credit and Collections professionals.
