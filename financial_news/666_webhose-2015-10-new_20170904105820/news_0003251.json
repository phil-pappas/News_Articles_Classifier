Ben Rushton Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason Gretel Packer is set to become Australia's 50th billionaire after coming to an agreement with her brother James over the family's wealth.\nThe confidential deal, reportedly worth more than $1 billion, would place Ms Packer among Australia's 50 richest people, according to the 2015 BRW Rich List.\nWhile the split of assets will take Mr Packer's fortune down to about $5.1 billion, he will still hold his No. 7 rank on the Rich List.\nThe deal is understood to be structured so that Ms Packer, 49, will receive payments from her brother, having already received a large advance upfront payment, as well as retaining a small residual stake in Mr Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings (CPH) that will be protected from loss.\nMs Packer will join Gina Rinehart, sisters Leonie Baldock and Alexandra Burt of the WA Wright family, Judith Neilson and Angela Bennett as women ranked among Australia's top 50 richest people.\nThe settlement between the Packers comes almost a decade after the death of their father, legendary media mogul Kerry Packer.\nMs Packer is the chairwoman of the Crown Resorts Foundation and was the \"driving force\" behind the establishment of a new $200 million charitable fund set up by the Packers and Crown Resorts in 2014, her brother said.\nThe National Philanthropic Fund will be distributed to Indigenous education, community welfare and arts. Ms Packer is known for her support of arts organisations such as the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and is a trustee of the Art Gallery of NSW as well as the Sydney Theatre Company Foundation.\n James Packer, 48, has reshaped his family's empire during the past 10 years, selling down media assets such as free-to-air broadcaster Nine Network, turning his focus to Crown Resorts, of which CPH owns just over 50 per cent, and other businesses, such as independent Hollywood production house RatPac â€“ a joint venture with producer-filmmaker Brett Ratner.\nMr Packer's most recent high-profile endeavour is the construction of a new $2 billion Crown casino and resort at Sydney's Barangaroo. Crown beat out Sydney incumbent Echo Entertainment, which owns The Star in Pyrmont.\nMr Packer' Crown owns 34 per cent of Nasdaq-listed Melco Crown Entertainment, which has gaming and resort ventures in Macau and the Philippines.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts", "http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-200/2015/"], "published": "2015-10-18T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:04:41.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
