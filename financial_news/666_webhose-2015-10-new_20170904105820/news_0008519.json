A separate meeting between Russian and Saudi officials was being planned for the end of October, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said. \nMoscow had been unwilling in the past to cut its oil output to support prices. Last November, it declined to cooperate with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to defend market share. \nRussian oil output hit a new post-Soviet monthly high of 10.74 million barrels per day in September, despite a drop in global crude prices to 6-1/2-year lows in August. \nDespite Monday's rally, some analysts braced for renewed pressure on oil prices from U.S. government data this week that could show further builds in crude inventories. \nMarket intelligence firm Genscape reported a modest drop about 150,000 barrels on the week for inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub for U.S. crude, traders who saw the data said. \nThat sparked concern among some that there would be builds instead of draws in Cushing when the U.S. Energy Information Administration reports weekly storage data on Wednesday. \nThe EIA said U.S. oil stockpiles in total rose nearly 4 million barrels the week ending Sept. 25. \n\"We still are bearish on oil given the excess in the market, and the time required to clear all the excess crude and oil products supply,\" Abhishek Deshpande, London-based analyst for French bank Natixis, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. \n(Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London and Meeyoung Cho in Seoul; Editing by Dale Hudson, William Hardy and W Simon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:16:10.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
