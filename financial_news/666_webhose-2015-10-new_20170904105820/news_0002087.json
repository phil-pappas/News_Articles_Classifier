Josh Robenstone Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Incoming ANZ Banking Group chief executive Shayne Elliott has pledged to use lessons from Silicon Valley technology pioneers to reshape the bank for the digital era under his tenure.\nMr Elliott, who takes over the bank's hot seat from Mike Smith at the end of the year, will lay out the wisdom he gleaned on a recent fact finding mission to the US tech hub on ANZ's BlueNotes blog this week.\nThe trip was taken by ANZ's board and executive team, and took in visits to tech giants like Facebook, Google, eBay, HP, tech security firm FireEye, Oracle and SAP, as well as the operations of financial services players Lending Club, Wells Fargo and Visa and world renowned research institution MIT.\nTerrifying and exciting Mr Elliott said tech legends like Steve Jobs made their staff focus on a simple over-arching ideal. Getty Images Describing his Silicon Valley experience as both \"terrifying and exciting\", Mr Elliott said it was vital for ANZ to adopt the same culture as leading tech players and top emerging start-ups, if it wanted to benefit from digital advances as opposed to being hurt by them.\n\"It's terrifying because there's a wall of money there and a legion of smart, focused and driven people who, intentionally or not, want a piece of our business. It's exciting because you can see what a little vision, drive and energy can achieve, even without the resources a company like ours has,\" Mr Elliott said.\nHe said he viewed the building of a so-called digital bank as only one facet of the strategy for the new era, with his real challenge being in changing the culture to encourage \"agile people\" within a culture that could recognise new trends and adapt to changing customer needs.\nThis meant following what he learned from the giants like Facebook, as well as start-ups like DemystData or Coinbase, which Mr Elliott said had all succeeded in developing cultures to encourage staff to be inquisitive, question the status quo, welcome creativity and embrace diversity of thought and opinion.\n Steve Jobs' methods He said ANZ would change to reflect this, and also seek to replicate the approach of Apple founder Steve Jobs in ensuring all staff in the company were focused on a simple, easily understood over-arching goal.\n\"Facebook CIO Tim Campos spoke to us at length on our trip in an extremely engaging way about people and culture. He never once mentioned hardcore technology, data centres, the cloud, mobile or big data. He talked about people and culture,\" Mr Elliott said.\n\"All of the successful companies we met in Silicon Valley encapsulated this through a sense of higher purpose, which in some cases was almost evangelical. Every Googler who gave us a presentation began by quoting their purpose \"to organise the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", the same thing happened at Facebook with \"connecting the planet\" ... Steve Job's was to \"put a dent in the universe\".\nMr Elliott's comments follow on from Mr Smith's final annual staff email, which was sent at the start of month spelling out the bank's strategy for the year ahead. Entitled \"priorities to support our digital future\", Mr Smith spoke about the requirement for adaptive and astute leaders, able to galvanise bank staff to respond to a fast-changing banking environment.\nMr Smith said this would involve building consumer and corporate digital solutions to be superior to banking peers, and delivering a group wide data capability to deliver better customer insights.\nIn September ANZ signed on for a new five-year agreement valued at $450 million with IBM , which will provide technology to underpin its sprawling super-regional Asian strategy. It has also led the way locally in the use of robot software systems , which can do the work of employees in fields ranging from payroll administration to helpdesk support and customer service in a fraction of the time.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:31:17.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
