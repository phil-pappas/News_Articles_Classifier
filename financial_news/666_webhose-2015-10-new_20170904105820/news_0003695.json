The company has allocated 200 million ringgit ($47 million) for capital expenditure for the next fiscal year, ending Aug 2016. \nTop Glove aims to grow its global market share to 30 percent in 2020 from 25 percent currently, the company has said previously. \nThe company has benefited from a strong U.S. dollar and weak commodities prices, and posted its highest-ever quarterly net profit during the June-August period. \nNet profit more than doubled to 103.1 million ringgit from 46.3 million ringgit in the same quarter a year earlier, while revenue rose 22.5 percent to 709.4 million ringgit. \n($1 = 4.2400 ringgit)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:12:21.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
