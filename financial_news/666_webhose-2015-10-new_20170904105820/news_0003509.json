Although my parents had worked hard to impress upon me the importance of financial responsibility, I was apparently hell-bent on making mistakes. \n\"I spent most of my twenties being irresponsible with credit cards and was only making minimum payments on my student loans. Then, I took a chance on a new job that didn't pan out and found myself temping irregular, low-paying gigs for almost two years. And then, my husband needed hand surgery, and I had to max out a high-interest credit card I'd almost paid off so we could afford it. \n\"In part due to chronic financial strain, my marriage fell apart. I found steady work at that point, but wasn't making a lot. So now I had a high amount of debt, plus a divorce, and had to find a new place to live. This was especially scary because I owed the city $3,000 in past-due utility bills and couldn't get utilities set up at my own place until I paid that back. \n\"I managed to find a roommate who had the utilities in his name, and I went through credit counseling . I also got a friend to help support me by making sure I checked my bank balance and budget every day. While I'm still in debt, I'm digging myself out from under the hole.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:18:26.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
