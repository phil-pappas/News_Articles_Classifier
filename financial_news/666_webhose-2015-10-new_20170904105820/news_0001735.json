Burberry took the biggest hit of the day after it announced sales slowed in the second quarter as the luxury market became \"increasingly challenging\". While retail sales were up 3% to £774m at the reported level in the six months to 30 September, total sales were almost flat at £1.1bn while wholesale was down 3% and licensing down 18% at the underlying level. \nSmiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) also was knocked on the market after Exane BNP Paribas downgraded it to 'underperform' from 'neutral' and cut the price target to 830p from 1,000p. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) highlighted that organic sales growth has lagged the sector for years, and that the situation regarding legacy liabilities has improved but isn't fully resolved. \nHowever it wasn't all bad news, with a government announcement over pensions policy boosting Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) . The savings and investment group was a shareholder favourite as Baroness Altmann confirmed the government's priorities for pension policy included the continued roll-out of auto-enrolment and the continued implementation of pension freedom, both of which Hargreaves is benefiting from, as results earlier in the week had shown. \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) led the risers after the wider semiconductor sector was lifted on merger talks. Closer to home, Numis Securities reiterated its buy rating with a price target of 1,350p. However, late on Thursday, Liberum slapped a 'sell' recommendation on the stock, saying it was \"highly unlikely to be acquired\". \nHousehold goods giant Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) also had a stand out performance after it posted a jump in revenue in the third quarter. The company said it now expects underlying sales growth for the year to be towards the top end of its target range. \nFTSE 100 - Risers ARM Holdings (ARM) 979.50p 4.98% Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.) 1,394.00p 4.81% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,467.00p 3.87% Unilever (LSE: 0NXN.L - news ) (ULVR) 2,885.00p 3.41% St James's Place (STJ) 863.00p 2.86% FTSE 100 - Fallers Burberry Group (Other OTC: BBRYF - news ) (BRBY) 1,307.00p -7.89% Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 651.00p -3.56% Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 117.70p -1.92% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 961.50p -1.79% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,045.00p -1.26% FTSE 250 - Risers Renishaw (RSW) 2,028.00p 7.30% WH Smith (LSE: SMWH.L - news ) (SMWH) 1,610.00p 4.48% Man Group (LSE: EMG.L - news ) (EMG) 157.80p 4.37% Brown (N.)
