Tanya Lake Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jessica Gardner A start-up that uses drones to make 3D maps for mining and construction companies has raised $1 million from investors including fund Blackbird Ventures and lawyer Michael Gonski, the son of businessman David Gonski.\nSydney-based start-up Propeller Aerobotics, founded by Francis Vierboom​ and Rory San Miguel, has developed a digital platform that allows 3D maps created by a drone that has captured from overhead to be easily shared with big industrial clients.\nThe company was born out of the idea that drones could be a very valuable tool for industry - a faster way for a farmer to check hundreds of hectares of property or a safer way for a telecommunications company to get close up views of the tip of a tower without expensive and dangerous climbing.\nBut how Propeller has evolved in its first year and a bit says a lot about how drones are already increasingly used by industry. The duo initially wanted to build high-powered, fully automated drones that could scan sites and transmit back captured images. But big industrial clients told them they already had that information but it was \"locked up on someone's hard drive,\" San Miguel tells Fairfax Media.\nSo instead they built a digital platform and a business model that covers both big contracts with clients, such as one of the country's largest quarry operators Hanson, as well as providing their platform at a price to independent drone operators who then share the imagery with their own clients.\nDrone operators are charged per hectare of data collected, or gigabyte of data uploaded to the platform, which is accessed by their clients. Vierboom and San Miguel declined to disclose early revenues.\n\"There are are over 280 drone operators [in Australia],\" Vierboom says. \"That's more than doubled since the start of last year when Propeller started out. It's a huge and growing industry.\"\nPropeller is the pair's second go at a drone start-up after both worked with emerging delivery outfit Flirtey. San Miguel, 24, is a mechatronics engineering graduate and Vierboom, 30, escaped from building technology systems for big companies like the NRMA and bank NAB. \"One day I read about drone delivery in the paper, sent an email, and I was start-up co-founder three weeks later,\" he says.\n Exporting technology Flirty has since moved to Silicon Valley. Vierboom says the Valley is great for consumer facing start-ups, but for ventures hoping to tap into industry staying at home has its advantages. \"The real story is technology can become a new export industry for Australia,\" Vierboom says. \"It used to be the case we were good at safety and that meant we can export iron ore. Now we can export safety.\"\nBlackbird Ventures partner Niki Scevak​ says often large companies in Australia are \"lazy\" but in the mining and quarry industry Propeller has been helped by some \"fairly forward-thinking customers\".\nBlackbird also recently participated in a $6 millon capital raising by Townsville-based start-up SafetyCulture, which created a smartphone app that acts as a virtual library of 22,500 safety inspection checklists used by companies all over the world.\n\"[The start-ups are] solving problems for these big large industries,\" he says. \"It's not photos and teenage girls on the phone. This is the messy, heart and soul of Australian industry.\"\nPropeller will use their new cash to hire more developers, to add to the team of seven located at Sydney's Australian Technology Park - the site being eyed for more tech workspaces by software giant Atlassian​.\nBut the hiring objective is already throwing up challenges. The shortage of technology talent means that twice in recent months new hires who have signed contracts have abandoned the start-up at the last minute for better offers at bigger companies. San Miguel says its fair to say they are \"learning on the job\" with hiring. But they are refining their pitch. \"The great part of it is the people you do get in are people who believe in what the company is doing,\" Vierboom says.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+JessicaGardner1", "https://twitter.com/jessigardner"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:10:48.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
