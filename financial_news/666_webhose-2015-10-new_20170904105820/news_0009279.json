In some cases, investors are asked to fund relatively conventional companies of the type that banks have been financing for many years. Others are - how shall we put it? - a little more unusual.One business that definitely falls into the latter category is Chess Boxing Global, which is currently accepting registrations of interest for its forthcoming funding round on equity-based crowdfunding platform Seedrs – it hopes to pick up as much as €500,000 once the pitch goes live.For the uninitiated – most of us in other words – chess boxing is practiced by a small but passionate bunch of competitors keen to pit their brains against each other as well as their brawn.A chess boxing contest consists of up to 11 alternating rounds of chess and boxing. The match begins with a three-minute chess round, which is followed by three minutes of boxing – the contest continues in this fashion, with each competitor given a total of nine minutes to make all their chess moves.As you might guess, there are two main ways for fighters to win. In the ring, boxers win if they score a knock-out; alternatively, they can secure victory by checkmating their opponent. There is also a third, more technical route to a win: if your opponent exceeds their nine-minute chess time limit, you win by default.Chess boxing is the invention of the Dutch performance artist Iepe Rubingh, who may be better known for ending up in a Tokyo jail following a traffic-stopping art installation he once organised in Japan’s capital city. But since Rubingh launched the sport in 2003, it has grown quickly, attracting new competitors – and fans – at a rapid pace. There have now been more than 100 chess boxing events held around the world, with 1,000 or so bouts fought in cities including Berlin, Paris, Moscow, London, Los Angeles and Calcutta.Now Rubingh wants to “take the sport to the next level”, by building a professional chess boxing league, to be run by Chess Boxing Global, which is the sport’s governing body. But to do that, he needs capital to invest – hence the Seedrs funding round.No-one can accuse Rubingh of not putting himself on the line as he seeks to drum up interest in this crowdfunding. He’s offering investors the opportunity to fight him in the ring – win and you’ll get 1 per cent of the company at no charge, but lose and you have to stump up for this stake. Alternatively you can invest of your own volition without having to fight.It’s difficult to assess Chess Boxing Global’s prospects of commercial success, other than to say that Rubingh has probably made a smart decision in eschewing a quest for bank funding in favour of this direct appeal to investors. In practice, it may be one for the sport’s aficionados, rather than a broader investor base. Still, Rubingh himself reckons his venture will turn out to be a knock-out success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:28:51.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
