Tata Consultancy Services, which is due to report its earnings on Tuesday, fell 1.4 percent. \nThe broader Nifty fell 0.56 percent, while the benchmark BSE Sensex declined 0.65 percent. Both indexes had earlier hit their highest since Aug. 21. \n(Reporting by Abhishek Vishnoi and Rafael Nam; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:49:15.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
