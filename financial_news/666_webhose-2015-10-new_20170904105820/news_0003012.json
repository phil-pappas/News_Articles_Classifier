However, the lower cost of gas has boosted the finances of many households and some 42% of shoppers cite this as a reason for being able to spend more. \nInterestingly, more and more consumers are using multiple channels to shop. Physical stores remain the most popular method, used by almost 80% of US consumers, although the numbers are down from last year. The report predicts online shopping will see another surge this holiday season, with 44.7% expected to shop via a mobile device, up from 29.9% last year. \nAlthough online has made shopping more convenient, it has not reduced the amount of time people spend holiday shopping. Conlumino forecasts the average American will spend 12 hours 42 minutes holiday shopping. This includes browsing, comparing prices and gathering ideas, and is up 37 minutes since last year. \n“This holiday will be a reasonable one for the nation’s retailers, but it will fall short of being spectacular – there just isn’t sufficient spending power or consumer confidence for that,” said Conlumino’s CEO, Neil Saunders. “The truth is that many people feel better off because of the lower cost of gas rather than because of underlying improvements in the economy, and that very much leaves spending at the mercy of gas prices. \n“Despite the modest uplift in spend, this holiday season will be one of dramatic change in terms of how and where people do their shopping. With mobile becoming more significant, retailers will need to work harder to ensure they are offering shoppers a seamless multichannel experience. Of course that’s something that incurs costs, which can be an uncomfortable thing to manage at a time when spending is only growing by a conservative amount.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:41:50.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
