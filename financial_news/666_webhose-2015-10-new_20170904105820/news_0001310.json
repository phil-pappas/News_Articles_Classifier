(PRWEB) October 18, 2015\nCubic Global Defense (CGD), a business unit of Cubic Corporation ( NYSE: CUB ), today announced it will demonstrate a range of innovative technologies developed to increase the combat readiness of fighter pilots and sailors at the Seoul International Aerospace & Defense Exhibition (ADEX) 2015 held in Seoul, South Korea from October 20 – 25. The bi-annual Seoul International ADEX 2015 is the largest airshow in South Korea and plays a major role in promoting the region’s rapidly developing aerospace and defense industries.\n“Cubic already has a large footprint in the Asia-Pacific region and delivers training products and solutions to various military and armed forces in the area such as Japan, Singapore and Korea,” said Bill Toti, president of Cubic Global Defense. “The Seoul International ADEX has become a representative aerospace and defense exhibition in the Asia-Pacific region and we look forward to demonstrating our realistic game-based training capabilities for the first time at the event.”\nCubic recently participated in the successful completion of Exercise Ulchi Freedom Guardian (UFG) , the largest distributed, simulation-driven exercise in the world, through our Korea Battle Simulation Center (KBSC) located in Seoul.\nCubic will showcase various air and maritime training solutions at the Seoul International ADEX, including:\nP5 Combat Training System (P5CTS): The P5CTS is Cubic’s latest generation air combat maneuvering instrumentation (ACMI) system for both fourth and fifth generation fighter aircraft. The P5CTS provides fighter pilots and range training officers with the ability to display training missions in real time and during post-mission debrief. The P5CTS is operational at more than 35 locations worldwide and has supported more than one million sorties. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will also be delivered with an embedded version of the P5CTS. Immersive Maritime Operator & Maintainer Courseware: This courseware is Cubic’s demonstration of interactive procedural operations and maintenance training. Set within a virtual and immersive shipboard environment, trainees perform tasks in a realistic multi-user environment. Immersive Maritime Operator & Maintainer Courseware is a cost-effective solution allowing trainees to function within complex shipboard environments at a fraction of the cost. Aircraft Cabin Crew Door Operations: This demonstration features a personalized training avatar that provides commercial airline cabin crew with orientation and operational assessments. Training includes interactive mini-games to evaluate the trainee’s knowledge of key door components, and a four-phased approach to learn how to properly open the main door.\nAttendees of Seoul ADEX 2015 can visit Cubic at the U.S. Pavilion, Hall D, Booth #D95 at the Seoul Airport, Seoul, Korea.
