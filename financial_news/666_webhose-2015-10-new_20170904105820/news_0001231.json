In the '70s commodity boom, gold went from $100/oz to over $800 or an eight-fold increase. Silver on the other hand went from around $1.60/oz to an eye-popping $50/oz. You do the math.\nPrecious metals have been in a funk since late 2011 as global turmoil and tensions have failed to stir the bull, and inflation fears have been replaced with deflation realities.\nIn the past two months, gold and silver have seen new interest from investors with both the metal and the mining issues seeing higher lows and increasing volume to support the moves.\n\nWhile we do believe that history tends to repeat itself--this is because human nature has not changed over the centuries--we don't look for silver prices to soar 30-fold. Right now we prefer gold over silver as buyers have returned to gold sooner, and we tend to favor the first mover.\n\nIn this first chart, above, we can see that the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) peaked in early 2011 and has been under selling pressure ever since. Also note the continuous decline in the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line. Notice also how many times SLV failed to rally above the declining 40-week (200-day) moving average.\n\nIn this shorter-term chart of SLV, above, we can see more detail. Look at the OBV line at the bottom. Improvement started in September. Now compare that with the  SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) chart below.\n\nIn this chart, above, take note how the OBV line on GLD started to turn up in late July, well before the movement on SLV. Silver bulls stay put. We have highlighted two names in recent weeks: Silver Wheaton   ( SLW - Get Report ) and Silver Standard Resources (SSRI).\n\nSLW made a nice base around $12 and has made a strong move over the 50-day moving average. Notice how heavy the volume was at the lows. It's impressive! What does Ray Dalio know?\n\nWe wrote about SSRI just the other day as it was breaking out of a large rising (bullish) triangle.\nOther junior names are on our watch list, and we will recommend them when appropriate.\nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:54:41.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
