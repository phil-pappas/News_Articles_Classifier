It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said global economic growth continues at a \"moderate\" pace, and that passenger traffic and profits for airlines are both strong. \nIt noted that there are pressures in the United States to cut defense spending, which at $7.9 billion in revenues in the quarter was about half the size of the commercial aircraft business. \nBut it said there are increasing opportunities elsewhere in the world to help its defense side continue to grow. During the last quarter, for instance, the Chicago-based company won an order from India for 22 Apache (NYSE: APA - news ) attack helicopters and 15 Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. Japan meanwhile ordered five V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft. \nIn all, Boeing delivered a record 199 new commercial airplanes in the three months to September 30, including 37 Boeing 787s. \nIt won 166 net new orders, and ended the quarter with a backlog of orders worth $426 billion in commercial aircraft. \nOn the defense side, it delivered 48 aircraft and finished with an order backlog worth $59 billion. \n\"By continuing to profitably deliver on our large and diverse backlog, we are driving strong growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow,\" president and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. \n\"Solid (KOSDAQ: 050890.KQ - news ) operating performance across our commercial and defense businesses during the quarter also supported our continued investment in innovation and our people, and our commitment to return cash to shareholders.\" \n- Watching air traffic closely - \nIn a conference call with analysts, Muilenburg stressed the company is confident in the outlook and will continue to keep as a high priority share buybacks and dividends. \n\"Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends,\" he said. \nBut he also pointed to a few clouds over the outlook. For the commercial aviation sector, \"traffic remains a watch item for us,\" he said. \nOrders and discussions with customers continue at a healthy pace but are \"moderating\". \nHe also suggested a challenge at getting production up to levels required by the company's huge order book. \n\"Given the strong market demand, we continue to see pressure on narrow body production rates beyond the announced 52 per month in 2018,\" he said. \n\"However, we remain steadfast in our financial discipline as we assess the market demand for further production rate changes.\" \nThe company already in the last quarter decided to increase the output of the 767, popular as a freight aircraft, to 2.5 per month by 2017. \nFor the 787 Dreamliner, the company is pushing hard to ramp up from 10 a month currently to 12 a month next year. \nMuilenburg also dismissed recent concerns of a bulge in used wide-body aircraft on the market that will pull down the prices of new jets. \nHe said an estimate of a glut from Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL - news ) \"is in the wrong order of magnitude.\" \n\"As I said, traffic growth is sustained. Replacement demand is sustained. Deferrers, cancellations below historic levels,\" he continued. \n\"So values are holding up well in the marketplace.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:16:58.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
