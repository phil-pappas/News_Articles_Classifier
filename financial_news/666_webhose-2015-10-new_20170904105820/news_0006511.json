It could be just sheer luck, or a case of mining in the right shafts at the right time. But production at Blanket is rising, when the industry is in crisis. A trading update for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015 dispatched to shareholders last week, revealed that Blanket could be one of only a few profitable gold operations in Zimbabwe, extracting gold at US$980 per ounce, against a domestic average estimated by the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe at US$1 354 per ounce. The price has since fallen by 11 percent to US$1 165 per ounce on Tuesday last week. In contrast, the rest of domestic producers, who recently warned of looming closures, where losing up to US$265 for every ounce mined. Output at Blanket climbed by 10,5 percent during the review period to 10 927 ounces, from 9 890 ounces during the prior comparative period in 2014. This represented one of the few cases of growth in a market fighting to shake off a slowdown in prices and tough domestic conditions. Blanket, in which Caledonia controls 49 percent shareholding, said it was on track to achieve its 42 000 ounces target for 2015 after improving underground haulage capacity. \"Blanket is a low-cost producer: in H1 of 2015 Blanket's on-mine costs were US$699 per ounce of gold produced and its all-in sustaining cost was US$984 per ounce of gold produced,\" chief executive officer, Steve Curtis, said in the trading update. \"The continued increase in production reflects the improved management control over grade and tonnage. The completion of the tramming loop in June 2015 has increased the underground haulage capacity and allows for an increase in development activity, which is expected to result in further increases in future production,\" Curtis told shareholders. \"We are confident that the revised investment plan, which was announced on November 3, 2014, will result in progressive increases in production from 2016 onwards when we expect to see the first production from below 750 metres - initially from the No. 6 Winze and subsequently from the Central shaft,\" Curtis told shareholders. Zimbabwe's large scale gold mines, battling to overcome a slowdown in prices that have retreated by 20,3 percent year on year, are pushing authorities to act. In a 25-page research sent to Mines and Mining Development Minister, Walter Chidhakwa, about three weeks ago, gold mines called for a review of several taxes targeted at the mining sector, as well as power tariffs. A South African executive last week blamed fund managers for stoking a crisis that is now threatening hundreds of large scale gold mines. \"I blame fund managers,\" Mark Bristow, chief executive officer at the London-listed Randgold Resources said. \"The allocation of capital has been a disaster. They have been allowed to manage a long-term industry on a quarterly basis,\" Bristow told reporters. Bristow said although the gold price had retreated, mining houses had failed to learn from their previous investment mistakes. \"Today, everyone is cutting back on capital expenditure. They tell you how they will reduce costs,\" Bristow said. He said he remained confident about the outlook. \"My prediction is that the gold industry will have to restructure in order to survive. This is an industry that needs to have something done to it,\" he said. He said about US$150 billion was raised in the past 10 years by gold mines. This figure included US$90 billion in equity and US$60 billion in debt. \"Around US$70 billion of the US$90 billion in equity has been impaired,\" he told reporters.
