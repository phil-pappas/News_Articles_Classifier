That hack affected payment data for fewer than 3,500 people, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nThe current hack is considered far more serious. Bloomberg said it was not clear if the two incidents were related. \nThe case comes on the heels of numerous other hacking episodes involving sensitive market information. US prosecutors in August brought charges against a pair of hackers in Ukraine who stole unpublished corporate press releases from online public relations services like Business Wire and sold them to people who traded shares on the information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:49:47.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
