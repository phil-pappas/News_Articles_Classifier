GE's revenues from oil and gas sank 15.9 percent to $3.9 billion. \nEarnings in the year-ago period were boosted by profits from finance operations that are no longer counted. \nGE has announced sales of more than $126 billion in assets as it moves to scale back its finance arm to emphasize industrial operations. \nAnalysts have warned that year-over-year comparisons are difficult at GE because of the major reshuffling of assets. \n\"Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace,\" said GE chief executive Jeff Immelt. \"We are transforming GE into the world's premier Digital Industrial company.\" \nEarnings translated into 29 cents per share, three cents above analyst estimates. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of GE fell 1.5 percent to $27.62 in pre-market trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:23:13.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
