New Delhi is targeting 8 percent over the next two years.\n“For India to meet its true potential, reforms will need to be bolder. Until then, GDP growth is likely to recover more gradually,” Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, wrote in a note.\nDespite the slowdown, India’s economy remains a favourable destination for global investors, although reforms in taxation, land acquisition and labour markets are pending in parliament and political opposition has so far stalled them from coming into force.\nOil prices have slumped over 50 percent since June 2014 and inflation has cooled sharply in India, falling to 4.41 percent in September from double-digit rates just two years ago.\nInflation is likely to accelerate, the poll showed, limiting the RBI’s scope to ease policy as aggressively as it did in 2015, when it cut the repo rate four times.\nEconomists expect inflation to average 4.9 percent to 5.5 percent in each quarter until the end of next year, much lower than the RBI’s January 2016 target of 6 percent. It is also likely to meet Rajan’s 5 percent by March 2017 goal.\n 15, 2015 1:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:26:26.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
