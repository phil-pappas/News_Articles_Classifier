Retail sales slipped last month by a tenth, the biggest monthly fall since 1999.\nGrowth in 2016 will flatline at best after contracting 4 percent this year and some investors expect economic stagnation to last for years.\nBut investors' worst fears - economic collapse and a spate of defaults by companies cut off from bond markets - have not materialised, according to Strigo.\n\"It's difficult to have a bullish view on the Russian economy, we just have to be content with the fact it has performed better than people expected,\" he said. \"It's a high yielding market and as long as things don't go badly wrong you are compensated for risks.\"\nREWARDS\nOthers may share that view - foreign holdings of rouble-denominated government bonds stood at 20 percent by Aug. 1, according to the latest available official data, from a 17.9 percent low in March.\nThose who held their nerve on rouble bonds after last year's rout have been rewarded handsomely, with dollar returns of 12 percent this year, thanks to interest rate cuts. The underlying GBI-EM debt index in contrast, displays double-digit losses.\nDollar bond returns are a sparkling 20 percent and on corporate bonds, where investor fears mostly centered, yield premia versus Treasuries have almost halved since January.\nNot all companies will survive but 70 percent of non-financial companies can repay debt from cash flow, ratings agency Moody's said last week.\nRussia's debt picture, already one of the strongest in the world, has improved further as a result of sanctions; shut out of bond markets, companies have dipped into their coffers to repay or buy back debt.\nHeadline external debt has fallen by $80 billion this year, according to end-September central bank data. Russia also saw net capital inflows in the third quarter, after many quarters of negative flows.\n\"Russia has rallied because it has a fundamental underpinning, with very low debt-GDP. For a default you need to make some very serious assumptions,\" said Salman Ahmed, global fixed income strategist at Lombard Odier.\nNoting $370 billion in hard currency reserves and an improving balance of payments surplus, Ahmed said: \"From a terms of trade point of view or on geopolitics, I'd agree with Putin that the worst is probably over.\"\nOn a fundamentals-based strategy, Ahmed has a 10 percent allocation to Russian bonds, more than double its GBI-EM weight.\nRELIANCE ON CASH HOARD\nEquities too are luring value-focused investors who believe that beaten-down share prices adequately reflect the economy's dim outlook. Shares trade at less than 5 times forward earnings, cheaper even than turbulent markets such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\"These are shockingly low valuations... Russia has negative aspects but in our mind it has one of the best valuation profiles in emerging markets,\" said Michael Loukas at U.S. fund Wavefront Capital, which has raised Russia to overweight versus its share in equity indexes.\nMost of these trades are tactical, however - bonds for instance have probably benefited from allocation away from troubled Brazil. With sanctions remaining in place, investors may shrink from increasing exposure.\nWavefront's Loukas says his Russia holding is smaller than investment models suggest, because geopolitical risks mean there are \"too many balls up in the air\".\nInvestors are also mindful that with oil unlikely to rise much and sanctions in place, Russia is reliant on its cash hoard. Financing next year's budget deficit alone will require taking 2.136 trillion roubles ($34.32 billion) from the Reserve Fund - almost half its current value.\nThe rate at which Moscow is running down the fund is causing concern about funding future deficits - without a rebound in oil or sharp spending cuts, coffers will empty in a couple of years.\nTD Securities' strategist Cristian Maggio says Russia's economy and politics may have overcome the worst of market turmoil but will remain in a twilight zone.\n\"What you see in Brazil is a democratic process and institutions trying to deal with crisis. In Russia there is no driver for improvement, this is an economy that will stagnate for the next few years,\" he added.
