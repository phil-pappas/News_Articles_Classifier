The continued precipitous decline in oil (and now other commodities too) as Wall Street continues to wait for the Fed to raise interest rates (which now looks like December) all contributed to choppy markets this year. \nAs a result of August's stock market selloff, the S&P 500 index had its worst quarterly performance in four years, slumping 6.9% for the three-months ending Sept. 30 and 6.7% for the year, despite Wednesday's market rally.

The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n10. Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. Industry: Energy/Oil & Gas Drilling Market Cap: $2.5 billion Year-to-date return: -52.9% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates DIAMOND OFFSHRE DRILLING INC as a Hold with a ratings score of C-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate DIAMOND OFFSHRE DRILLING INC (DO) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed ? some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including disappointing return on equity, weak operating cash flow and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has exceeded that of the S&P 500 and greatly outperformed compared to the Energy Equipment & Services industry average. The net income increased by 0.8% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $89.71 million to $90.39 million. 43.35% is the gross profit margin for DIAMOND OFFSHRE DRILLING INC which we consider to be strong. It has increased from the same quarter the previous year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 14.25% is above that of the industry average. The debt-to-equity ratio is somewhat low, currently at 0.62, and is less than that of the industry average, implying that there has been a relatively successful effort in the management of debt levels. Despite the fact that DO's debt-to-equity ratio is low, the quick ratio, which is currently 0.61, displays a potential problem in covering short-term cash needs. Current return on equity is lower than its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of weakness within the company. Compared to other companies in the Energy Equipment & Services industry and the overall market, DIAMOND OFFSHRE DRILLING INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $40.28 million or 37.37% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the industry average, the firm's growth is significantly lower.
