Jason South Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jenny Wiggins Reform of Australia's road funding model is \"critical\" to keep Australian cities liveable, Transurban chairman Lindsay Maxsted told the tollroad group's annual general meeting.\nThe current model of using fuel taxes and vehicle registration and licence fees to pay for roads no longer generates enough money to meet spending requirements, Mr Maxsted said .\n\"Revenue from fuel excise is in decline as we move to more fuel-efficient cars,\" he said. \"The system is complex and it is opaque with road users largely unaware of the contribution they make to fund the roads on which they drive.\n\"This means Australians are unlikely to appreciate the inherent inequities of the current system and the growing need for a solution. Reform to the funding model is critical and some difficult decisions will need to be made if we are to protect the liveability and productivity of our cities.\"\nTransurban is trialling alternative forms of road pricing, such as rate per kilometres charges and fixed charges per trip, in a study in Melbourne with 1,200 drivers over the next eight months.\nThe company plans to use the data to engage in the debate over road pricing pricing.\nTransurban said proportional toll revenues rose 18.9 per cent in the September quarter to $446 million, driven by a 16 per cent rise in Sydney toll revenues. Average daily traffic in Sydney rose 10.3 per cent to 622,000 trips.\nAverage daily traffic on Melbourne toll roads increased 2.4 per cent, and was up 10.5 per cent in Brisbane.\n Investors raised questions of Transurban's investment in US tollroads at the AGM, with one investor asking if the investments were \"worth the money.\"\nMr Maxsted acknowledged that investors were yet to see \"tangible results\" from Transurban's US investments but said the company had \"a great portfolio of assets\" and had no plans to divest them.\nThe Australian Shareholders Association (ASA) questioned Transurban's decision to use its auditors, PwC, for consulting work and pay it about $244,000 in additional fees on top of the $2.5 million it was paid for auditing services.\nMr Maxsted said PwC had \"the best expertise\" for the consulting work that was undertaken.\nProxy groups CGI Glass Lewis and ISS as well as the ASA recommended investors vote in favour of all resolutions, including the remuneration report, which was easily passed.\nBut CGI Glass Lewis raised questions in a report to investors over non-executive independent director Rodney Slater, who is up for re-election this year.\nMr Slater, a former US Secretary of Transportation, is a partner at US law firm Squire Patton Boggs and co-head of its transportation, shipping and logistics practice.\nTransurban disclosed in its annual report that it paid Squire Patton Boggs $US150,208 in fiscal 2015 for lobbying-related services.\nMr Slater was re-elected with 1.27 billion votes in favour. But some 82.3 million votes were cast against his re-election.\nTransurban currently has a 7-member board following the resignation of former Orica chief executive Ian Smith, who resigned in August to head off a potential challenge by investors concerned about his business track record.\nThe ASA questioned non-executive director Neil Chatfield's high number of directorships, which include the chairmanships of employment group Seek Limited and fruit and vegetable group Costa, arguing he was \"overstretched.\"\nMr Maxsted said Mr Chatfield was always available to Transurban when needed.\nMr Maxsted said he hoped to announce one or two new non-executive board directors later this year or in the first quarter of next year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennywiggins", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/117166018980952797102", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150904/pdf/43135c0fryp818.pdf", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20151012/pdf/431ztczyrswqg7.pdf", "http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20151012/pdf/43202lbsqcchty.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:05:00.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
