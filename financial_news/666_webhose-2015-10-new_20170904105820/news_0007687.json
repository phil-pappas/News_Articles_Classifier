(\"Tarena\" or the \"Company\") ( TEDU ). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 9980.\nThe investigation concerns whether Tarena and certain of its officers and/or directors have violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nOn October 21, 2015, Seeking Alpha published an article on Tarena reporting, among other issues, that: (1) Tarena has a company-specific problem in collecting on tuition; (2) the inability of Tarena's students to access credit has caused the quality of the Tarena's financing partners to move from established banks to shadow banks; and (3) reviews by Tarena students report deceptive practices and false promises.\nOn this news, shares of Tarena have fallen as much as $1.03, or 10.4%, during intraday trading on October 21, 2015.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Florida, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 70 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members.
