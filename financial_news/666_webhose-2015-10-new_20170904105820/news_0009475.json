The Japan-based investment boutique said the survey was conducted as part of the firm's continuing deliberations on when and by how much to cut its management fees for institutional clients. Charles Worth, Executive Vice-President and Co-Chief Investment Officer at Nippon Capital AM said, \"The blood-letting in the mainland Chinese indices appears to be over for now but it's at times like this that investor risk appetite is tested to its limits. It made sense for us to take a closer look at client sentiment especially when some may have suffered losses with other managers.\" According to the poll, 58% of Nippon Capital AM clients said they felt that stocks would resume their upward trajectory in the year ahead while 37% said that the sustainability of any resumption of the uptrend would almost certainly depend upon how long the emergency measures introduced by the Chinese authorities to halt the selloff remained in place. Clients were asked to identify what they felt were the most likely factors that could drive prices higher; 61% pointed to broad expectations of monetary stimulus from the central bank, 13% cited a slowing in China's economic cooling while 11% optimistically suggested that a resurgence in global demand for Chinese exports would play a significant part.Toshiro Noda, the company's newly-appointed Senior Vice-President said, \"We think that the results of our survey will help us decide on the ways we can adjust our charging structure to more closely reflect the redoubtable confidence with which our clients view the future.\"About Nippon Capital AMNippon Capital Asset Management J-LLC is a 'fee only' financial advisory service.
