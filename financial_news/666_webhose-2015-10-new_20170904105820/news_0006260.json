Jim Rice Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Stockbrokers may face a radical overhaul of their pay structures, as the corporate regulator prepares to investigate whether industry commissions encourage a churn-and-burn trading culture.\nThe government also plans to beef up legal protections for investor money in the wake of the collapse of stockbrokers MF Global and BBY.\n\"The government's legislative amendments to improve protections for client monies are likely to include changes to section 981D of the Corporations Act. The government expects to consult on these amendments prior to the end of this year,\" said Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer.\nThe broking industry secured hard-won \"carve-outs\" from the Future of Financial Advice conflicted remuneration laws in 2013 on the basis that shares are considered product-neutral and advisers are not financially motivated to push certain stocks over others.\nGrid commissions under fire But in a blow for the industry, the government revealed on Tuesday that it had asked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to review those exclusions amid concerns the commission structure encourages brokers to push clients to trade more frequently .\n\"The government endorses ASIC reviewing the effect of current remuneration structures in stockbroking on the quality of consumer outcomes,\" the FSI response said, noting the review would happen after 2016 as ASIC would first conduct a review of pay structures in mortgage broking.\nStockbrokers and advisers typically receive a percentage of the volume of commissions they earn for their firm. In what is known as the \"grid commission structure\", the more volume a broker writes, the more salary they pocket.\n Under a tiered system, firms typically reward individual brokers at higher ­levels if they write more volume.\n'Back off', industry says But Stockbrokers Association of Australia boss Andrew Green said the government should \"back off\".\n\"There is a lot of common sense in paying people this way because it gives brokers an incentive to get orders in... Obviously there is the risk of churning, but that is managed by ASIC's market integrity rules.\"\nThe financial system inquiry warned that the grid structure had the \"potential to create a conflict of interest\" between the adviser and client and noted Australia and the United States were the only jurisdictions using that pay model. The report said in most other financial centres, stockbrokers were paid a salary and discretionary bonus.\nBBY changes As flagged by The Australian Financial Review , the government has also committed to developing long sought-after legislative amendments before the end of 2015 which will better protect client funds held by intermediaries in the wake of collapses such as that of stockbroker BBY .\nFollowing the collapse of MF Global in 2011, foreign governments around the world moved to implement tighter controls over client funds to stop the co-mingling of money.\nIG Markets' Tamas Szabo said while the federal government had dragged its heels on client protections in recent years he was happy the message had now been received.\n\"This will simply see Australia fall in line with the rest of the world and every other G20 country,\" Mr Szabo, who also heads the CFD Forum, said.\nProduct intervention power In other big changes which will impact the industry, ASIC chairman Greg Medcraft will be granted his long sought-after product intervention power to ban or modify investment products from the market by mid-next year – following a consultation with stakeholders.\nHowever, the government rejected a recommendation for the creation of a new Financial Regulator Assessment Board to oversee financial regulators, arguing the existing framework is capable of overseeing their performance.\nThe government has previously announced a capability review of ASIC's performance and plans to move to an industry-funded regulator , following a consultation with stakeholders. The government also said it would delay a decision on whether to allow the regulators to pay more competitive remuneration to poach executives from the private sector, until after the capability review is completed by the end of the year.\nAnd the government said it would remove any regulatory impediments and develop legislation to promote innovative financial product disclosure.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://fsi.gov.au/files/2014/12/FSI_Final_Report_Consolidated20141210.pdf", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:03:39.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
