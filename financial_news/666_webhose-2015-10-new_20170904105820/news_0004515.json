The college has a special part of its website just for veterans where it boasts having \"military representatives who understand the culture and lingo you're used to.\" \nBut the Department of Defense has found that it did not get proper approval to hold events at military bases. It also didn't get permission to use military logos on its \"challenge coins.\" These tokens are traditionally handed out in the military to recognize good work, but The University of Phoenix has its own mock version of the coins. \nThe college is also currently under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission about whether it used deceptive marketing tactics to recruit students. \nThe school has two weeks to make its case. At that time, the ban could become permanent. Its parent company, Apollo Education Group ( APOL ) , disclosed the news in a regulatory filing Friday. It has already discontinued use of its challenge coins. \n\"University representatives had been working closely with Department of Defense leaders and we all expected a different response,\" said University President Tim Slottow in a statement. \nAfter a scathing report from the Center for Investigative Reporting came out earlier this year, Senator Dick Durbin called on the Department of Defense to investigate the college. \nHe said that the University of Phoenix took in $1.2 billion in GI Bill benefits since 2009. \nFor-profit colleges in general have been criticized for preying on veterans and low-income students, promising bright job prospects. But they continue to post high student loan default rates and below-average graduation rates. About 10% of veterans receiving GI Bill grants to help them fund their college education enroll in for-profit schools, according to a study from the Student Veterans of America. \nRelated: Good news for Corinthian's student debtors \nSchools are not allowed to receive more than 90% of revenue from federal aid. But funds from the Department of Defense don't count toward that limit. That gives for-profit schools an incentive to target veterans in order to stay below the threshold. In her run for president, Hillary Clinton has proposed closing that loophole. \nAlthough thousands of veterans use financial aid from the Department of Defense, the University of Phoenix says that money only accounts for 1% of its net revenue. But any financial hit won't be good for the struggling school. It has lost about half of its students over the past five years and closed at least 100 campuses. The college currently has about 206,000 students and expects enrollment to decline to about 150,000 this year. \nAre you a veteran attending the University of Phoenix?
