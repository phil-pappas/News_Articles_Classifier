Jesse Marlow Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates The major banks stand to make an extra $1.25 billion in combined profits if the industry follows Westpac in jacking up mortgage interest rates by 0.2 percentage points independently of the Reserve Bank.\nAny such moves could trigger a political backlash, as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten on Thursday said Westpac was being driven by greed, and urged rival banks not to follow suit.\nMr Shorten on Thursday said Westpac's rate hike this week was \"incredibly disappointing\" and backed Treasurer Scott Morrison's move to challenge the bank's justification for raising rates.\n\"There is no case being made, in my opinion, by Westpac to increase its rates. I think this is just corporate greed,\" Mr Shorten said.\nWestpac has argued its rate hike – the first for owner-occupiers in more than three years – was needed to pass on the costs of tougher regulation, but Mr Morrison said it went beyond this.\nWhile it is by no means certain the other banks will go as far as Westpac did , market analysts expect its rivals, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and ANZ, will ultimately follow its lead to some extent, expanding profit margins in the process.\nCredit Suisse analyst Jarrod Martin estimated Wednesday's rate rise would lift Westpac's annual cash profits by $303 million, or 3.7 per cent, to $8.54 billion in 2016.\nIn a note to clients, Mr Martin said the profits of rival big four banks would rise between 3 per cent and 5 per cent if they were to raise mortgage rates by the same 0.2 of a percentage point, as did Westpac.\n Such a move would deliver the big four a combined profit boost of $1.25 billion, with a $234 million gain for ANZ, $435 million extra for CBA and $277 million for NAB.\nWhether the industry actually did this would be an important test of \"oligopoly pricing discipline\", and the banks could also test political tolerance for changes in home loan interest rates, Mr Martin said.\nNonetheless, he said he believed other banks would near match Westpac's increase for property investors, while \"only partially\" matching the rate hike for owner-occupiers.\nAlready, most of the major banks have increased their interest rates for property investors rates independently of the Reserve Bank this year. CBA, Westpac and NAB also failed to pass on the May cut to official interest rates in full.\nThis dynamic, known as \"repricing\", is likely to next year drive the biggest increase in banks' net interest margins – a key influence on profits – since the mid-1990s, Mr Martin said.\nMeanwhile, industry superannuation funds have written to the banking regulator asking it to make sure banks do not target bank-run superannuation funds in a bid to preserve their returns, as Westpac has targeted its mortgage customers.\nFund trustees must act in members' interests alone, but a letter from Industry Super Australia alleges \"there are indications that bank-owned super funds have previously prioritised the interest of corporate profit ahead of the interests of super funds members\".\nIt urges the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to make sure this is not happening as banks try to maintain their returns.\n\"We respectfully request that APRA urgently satisfy itself and the community that the banks have not, and will not, prioritise their shareholders over members in their superannuation businesses, as they have done in their mortgage business,\" says the letter, signed by chair Peter Collins and chief executive David Whiteley.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@clancyyeates", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/westpac-raises-home-loan-rates-20151013-gk8fmt.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:07:17.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
