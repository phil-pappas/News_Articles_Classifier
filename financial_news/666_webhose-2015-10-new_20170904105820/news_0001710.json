Quintiles also was identified as the most preferred Phase I service provider based on ISR’s survey of biopharmaceutical industry decision-makers across North America, Europe and Asia. “We are honored to be recognized once again as the industry leader in Phase I services and most preferred Phase I service provider in ISR’s 2015 report,” said Mary Westrick, Ph.D., vice president, Early Clinical Development at Quintiles. “I believe that the scientific expertise and clinical experience of Quintiles’ staff, as well as our ability to offer integrated solutions, helps our customers make better decisions during early clinical development.” Survey respondents also identified Quintiles as the “best service provider for differentiation” based on service quality, with particular strengths in data quality, financial strength/stability, and local market/regulatory knowledge. “I believe the ISR report reflects the effectiveness of our approach to proactive quality management as well as the importance of our unwavering commitment to the highest quality standards,” said Westrick. “Our approach combines Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as well as quality audit findings to identify potential risks early and implement mitigation measures before studies even begin.” A pioneer in early clinical development approaches, Quintiles helps the biopharmaceutical industry design and deliver standard safety studies as well as complex, multi-site and patient-focused early clinical trials. Leveraging expertise across its global enterprise, Quintiles delivers accurate data and precise insights that inform strategic go/no-go decisions early. The results of this Phase I study follow Quintiles’ recent recognition in another ISR report that noted the company was once again the industry leader and preferred provider in Phase IV services – a designation it also received for the third consecutive year.
