This Bentonville, AR-based  retail behemoth has been posting disappointing results for the past several quarters due to sluggish U.S. sales. Amid such a scenario, Wal-Mart reportedly announced to cut jobs of around hundreds of employees, including senior and department managers, at its headquarters. Per Wall Street Journal, the job cuts are expected to begin next week.\nThe move comes in the wake of the company’s efforts to reduce expenses and at the same time maintain lower prices for customers. It also looks to boost investment in other areas, including higher wages for store workers. Last month, per Bloomberg, the company slashed workers’ hours at some of its store locations in an effort to check its costs. Wal-Mart told its store managers to cut hours of those workers who were working beyond the allocated time.\nReportedly, Wal-Mart even tried to put pressure on more than 10,000 suppliers worldwide for a 2%-6% reduction in the costs of general Chinese goods such as apparels, shoes, beauty products, and electronics in order to share the savings generated from currency headwinds with its customers with lower prices.\nThe company is looking to increase margins, as it has already pledged to spend $1 billion to raise employees’ wages and give them extra training. We note that Wal-Mart had increased its minimum wage to $9 an hour in April, and expects to increase it to $10 per hour in Feb 2016. Higher labor costs along with the company’s efforts to overhaul its stores and invest in its online operations have weighed on its earnings.\nWal-Mart is thus aggressively investing in its e-commerce business and making efforts to improve customer service.\nEarlier this week, Wal-Mart stated that it is expanding its online grocery service to eight more locations and launching a free pickup service for online grocery orders in select U.S. cities, thus giving tough fight to players in the e-commerce and online grocery businesses like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Target Corp. TGT and Google Inc. Wal-Mart is currently offering the service in five other markets, as part of a test that first began in 2011.(Read: Wal-Mart Expands Online Grocery Service; Debuts Free Pickup).\nComing back to the job cuts, we believe such a strategy is expected to help the company to reduce expenses. However, the company might face criticism for the job cuts and lose some of its best employees to competitors.\nThough we are positive on the company’s long term fundamentals, the current scenario is alarming for its investors.\nWal-Mart carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better ranked retailer is The Kroger Co. KR which holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
