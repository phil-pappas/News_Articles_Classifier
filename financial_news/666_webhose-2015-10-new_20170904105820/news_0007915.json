By Richard Dyson | Telegraph – 3 hours ago 0.00 0.00 \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's now as complicated as anything in the private sector - and the chance of making a costly mistake has never been greater \nIt was supposed to be a core foundation of retirement income: a basic pension paid by the state. Simple (LSE: 0LYN.L - news ) . \nIt has instead become one of the most complex aspects of anyone’s retirement finances, a mind-boggling mess of rules and options, components here and components there, entitlements and waivers, years in and years out, different arrangements for different age groups and again for men and women. \nI’ve seen the world of private pensions change beyond recognition and yes, that too is fraught with complication. \nBut it’s as nothing compared with the Byzantine nightmare that is the state pension. \nThere are a few a very few, I think people who understand in full the intricacies of the state pension. \nIt’s a decades-old Heath Robinson contraption that has been patched, replated and botched countless times with a quick fix here and there, all required by dozens of governments to keep paying out, more or less fairly, to generation after generation. \nThis machine is now creaking its way into an even more complicated era. \nOn Monday the new “Class 3A” state pension top-up scheme is launched. It’s open to anyone who reaches state pension age before April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 6 2016. \nIt involves, in effect, the purchase of a government-backed annuity, whereby you give up a lump sum in exchange for extra pension payments of up to £25 a week, for life. \nHow much you pay depends on your age. The full £25 per week would cost £22,250 for a 65-year-old, for example. \nWhether this is a good idea for you depends, among other factors, on your health and likely lifespan, on your spouse and his or her health and lifespan (there are spouse’s benefits), and on your tax situation. \nThe alternative uses to which you might otherwise put your money are also a consideration. Remember your extra state pension payments might be subject to tax whereas, for instance, returns from investments inside an Isa would not be. \nThis unique top-up scheme is in itself a bit of a botched job: it’s been invented to “help” those who won’t be eligible for the new “flat rate” state pension that comes into effect on April 6 2016. \nThis new scheme a well-intentioned project to simplify the state pension is throwing up an increasing number of new, unthought-of complications and choices. \n- The best way to boost your state pension: should you top it up or defer it? \n- State pension overhaul: you risk paying more for nothing \nThis “Class 3A” top-up is just one. \nThe Government said it expected around 300,000 people to take up the deal. For many, it will be a good use of money. For some, though, it won’t. \nAnd this is the nub of the problem. The state pension is now so complex that advice is becoming necessary. \nAs we reported here last week, there are other circumstances, apart from the “3A” top-ups, in which voluntary contributions to their state pensions are being made by people who will never see a penny’s benefit. \nSuch are the snares that are waiting to be sprung in the state pension jungle. \nInformation is available from official sources, such as the Pensions Advisory Service, but it is in the nature of general guidance it won’t relate to your specific circumstances. \nWhile good financial advisers will have a reasonable working knowledge of state pension provision, it is hardly their main job. Nor would you want to pay professional fees for advice regarding a comparatively small if still vitally important income. \nrichard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:41:31.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
