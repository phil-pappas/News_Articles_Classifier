Origin provided dividend guidance of 20c per share for fiscal 2016 and 2017.\n“These initiatives will lower debt, strengthen the balance sheet and reduce reliance on distributions from Australia Pacific LNG,” Origin chairman Gordon Cairns said in a statement to the ASX.\n“We believe this package of initiatives is prudent in light of current market conditions and strikes a reasonable balance in the best interest of all shareholders.”\nAt current market forward oil prices and exchange rates the company’s net debt to underlying earnings is expected to be “comfortably below” a multiple of four times in fiscal 2017, reducing to three times in subsequent years, he said.\nThe sale of assets will include non-operated upstream interests and direct investments in assets for wind generation, as well as infrastructure assets such as pipelines that requiring tolling arrangements.\nThe company’s shares were placed on a trading halt ahead of the competition of the four-for-seven fully under written renounceable entitlement offer.\nShares will be offered at $4, representing a 34.4 per cent discount to the last closing price yesterday, the company said.\nOrigin reported a loss of $658 million in the 12 months to June 30, against last year's net profit of $530 million as the result was hit by writedowns amid weak commodity prices. The company announced an unchanged final dividend of 25c unfranked, payable on September 28.\n Origin launches $2.5bn share offer", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/origin-energy-launches-25bn-share-offer-and-plans-to-reduce-dividend/story-fni0dcne-1227550369295"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:11:28.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
