In line with this recommendation, the Minister established the Credit Union Restructuring Board – ReBo, on a time-bound basis to oversee and facilitate the restructuring process. \nReBo has made significant progress in achieving its overall objectives. To date, ReBo has assisted 74 individual credit unions in 36 completed restructuring projects. In total, including credit unions that have completed the process, 189 credit unions are engaged with ReBo at varying stages of the restructuring process. This corresponds to over half of the credit union sector. \nFrom this analysis of ReBo’s work, it is clear that ReBo has fulfilled the performance of its duties in so far as it can, given that restructuring proposals are still being submitted by credit unions. Based on its performance to date and projections going forward, ReBo is well positioned to achieve its overall objectives over the coming months. \nHaving considered views from his Department, ReBo and from other stakeholders, the Minister considers it prudent to now announce 31 March 2016 as the final date for acceptance of any further restructuring proposals. This will enable ReBo continue to engage with the sector and complete the performance of its functions within its time-bound mandate. ReBo is available to support any credit union requiring assistance with the application process and such credit unions are advised to make contact with ReBo as soon as possible. \nCommenting on the publication of today’s report, Minister Noonan said: \n“I welcome this Report which provides a comprehensive analysis of ReBo’s work to date and of the credit union movement as a whole. I am pleased that credit unions are engaging with ReBo as a business strategy to achieve the scale necessary to move to a more efficient and effective business model and as a means of strengthening the sector. \nI am also very pleased to reflect on the admirable progress ReBo has achieved to date in its engagement with the sector in facilitating and overseeing the restructuring process. I would like to thank the credit union movement, the ReBo Board and staff of ReBo for their continued efforts in the interests of credit unions in Ireland. I would like to acknowledge the fact that the credit union sector itself has, by and large, funded the majority of restructures to date with minimal recourse to the Credit Union Fund. \nThis Government remains fully committed to supporting the credit union movement in meeting the financial, economic and social needs of communities throughout the country. Credit unions will continue to have a key role to play in providing access to credit and other important services in local communities throughout the country.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:37:03.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
