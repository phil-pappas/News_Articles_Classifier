Chris Pearce Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The prudential regulator has blasted industry super funds for peddling what it describes as fallacies about member returns, fees and new rules requiring more independent directors on boards.\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) member Helen Rowell said she was \"disappointed\" by some of the public commentary about government plans to mandate that a third of super board directors be independent and that super boards have an independent chair.\nShe said claims that independent directors will force unwarranted structural change and lead to underperformance were \"fallacies\".\nShe also moved to settle old scores in the highly politicised battle between union-aligned industry super funds and the retail funds, which are owned by banks and other financial institutions.\n\"On a number of occasions in the last few years I have noted that comparisons of investment performance at fund level is not comparing apples with apples,\" she said.\n\"Across the different industry segments, the median and range of returns for MySuper products is broadly the same, as are the median and range for total fees and costs.\"\n'Ideological attack' Industry Super Australia and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees have been the most vocal opponents of the proposed super governance changes .\n They represent funds that operate on a representative governance model at present. That is, half the board is appointed by unions and the other half by employer groups.\nThey have claimed the Coalition's real agenda is an ideological attack on unions and that the changes will dismantle highly successful governance models that have seen industry funds outperform retail funds.\n\"There is no reason to suggest that adding independent directors should, automatically, change the trustee's business philosophy, strategy or business plans,\" Ms Rowell said.\n\"I have been quite disappointed, however, by some of the commentary on the proposed changes and the assertions being made regarding the consequences that may flow from them.\"\nISA chief executive David Whiteley has accused the Turnbull government of caving to the interests of the banks.\nMs Rowell made the comments as the federal government deepened its reform agenda to include passing laws to open up the default superannuation market to competition.\nThis too is set to rile industry super funds, which are the biggest beneficiaries of the status quo.\nOn Tuesday, as part of its response to the Murray inquiry, the government re-committed to a competitive tender process for the products that can be listed as default funds.\nThat is, funds that receive a workers' super contributions when they do not choose another fund or where their union-negotiated workplace agreements specifies a fund.\nMost of this money, estimated at as much as $9 billion, currently flows to industry funds. Mr Whiteley said banks were desperate to get their hands on those funds.\n\"The real challenge is that the super industry is currently worth $2 trillion and within two decades it will be $7 trillion,\" he said.\n\"Any government will have their hands full in trying to keep commercial vested interests at bay.\n\"We would encourage the government to be more decisive in resisting the lobbying of the banks.\n\"We support a competitive tender process - there's one in place in the Fair Work Commission. It would look deeply ideological to have the same process in a different venue.\"\nThe Financial Services Council, which represents retail funds, wants all super funds with an approved no-frills MySuper product to be able to be listed as a default fund.\nFWC role The government looks unlikely to go that far, instead indicating there will still be a mechanism for selecting the best value default funds. It has asked the Fair Work Commission to develop tender models.\nAs Mr Whiteley noted, in law at present the Fair Work Commission is responsible for choosing default funds. But a legal challenge by the FSC, which accused the Fair Work selection panel of having conflicts of interest, shut the process down at the end of 2014 and the government has not acted to renew it.\n\"About eight million Australians rely on the employer default fund,\" Mr Whiteley said.\n\"There is no threat to industry super funds if you have a competitive system that rewards merit and accommodates consumer behaviour.\n\"But if you design the default system around the business models of the major banks, that will ultimately knock out the industry super funds.\n\"What the banks have been lobbying for is to have no selection process so that they can, in their terms, leverage their business banking relationships to become the employee default fund.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:12:17.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
