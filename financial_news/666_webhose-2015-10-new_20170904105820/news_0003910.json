In July, its former cleaning subcontractor was forced to pay more than $6000 to underpaid cleaners working at Myer stores.\nAdvertisement Just three months later, a cleaner at a store in Melbourne has told the ABC's 7.30 program he is paid a flat rate of $20 per hour.\nThe minimum award rate for cleaners hired on a casual basis is $23 per hour, but they should also receive penalty rates or loading for working late hours, long hours or on weekends.\nCleaners working at Myer also told the ABC they had to pay their own insurance, tax and superannuation.\nSham contracting refers to when an employer disguises an employment relationship as an independent contracting arrangement to avoid paying employee entitlements.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman has opened an investigation into alleged underpayments to workers at Myer's stores.\n\"The Fair Work Ombudsman has for some time held concerns about the workplace practices, including allegations of underpayment of workers, by cleaning contractors engaged by Myer at various sites,\" the Ombudsman said in statement to the ABC.\n In separate statements to the ABC, both Myer and Spotless said they would investigate the claims.\n\"Cleaners for Myer stores are provided by Spotless and we have sought a full and urgent explanation about the matter raised by the ABC,\" Myer's statement said.", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/workplace-investigation-finds-myer-store-cleaners-underpaid-by-thousands-20150729-gin480.html", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-22/myer-accused-of-underpaying-cleaners-through-sham-contracting/6876760"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:10:34.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
