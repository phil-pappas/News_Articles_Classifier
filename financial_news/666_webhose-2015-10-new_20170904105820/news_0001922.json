It would also provide fresh impetus to the prime minister’s efforts to push through measures to make it easier for companies to do business in India.\nA loss could limit the ability and willingness of Mr. Modi—who came to power in 2014 pledging to drive growth in a country that has lagged behind its East Asian neighbors—to move forward with changes sought by investors, such as making land-acquisition rules less strict and loosening the country’s labor laws.\nOpinion polls published last week indicate a close race between Mr. Modi’s right-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party and the backers of Nitish Kumar and his left-of-center Janata Dal (United) party. Mr. Kumar, Bihar’s two-term incumbent chief minister, is widely credited with tackling crime and raising living standards.\nSome surveys showed the BJP ahead, while others gave Mr. Kumar’s alliance an edge.\n“The temperature of the election is rising every day,” said Munna Malakar, a 30-year-old whose family regularly engages in heated discussions over whom to vote for. “It’s like a cricket match between [rival neighbors] India and Pakistan and this one is going down to the wire.”\nShifting caste allegiances, which remain a major factor in Bihar’s polls, have made the outcome difficult to predict.\nResults are due Nov. 8.\nIn a sign of the importance of the polls, which could set the tone for the rest of Mr. Modi’s term in office, the premier is devoting a lot of time to campaigning in Bihar, casting himself as a champion of the poor. In rallies across the state, he is citing his nationwide programs to build toilets for poor households, help needy individuals open bank accounts, and push through new insurance initiatives and low-cost loans for families.\nFearful that a pro-business reputation would alienate voters in Bihar and erode his popularity among rural Indians, Mr. Modi in August effectively abandoned efforts to revamp the country’s cumbersome law governing land acquisition for infrastructure and other development projects. Farmers had protested the move.\nOn Friday, a crowd of tens of thousands gathered in this dusty town chanting, “Modi, Modi.” As the prime minister’s helicopter touched down, young men jostled to scale bamboo-stick barriers for a closer look at their leader.\n“If Bihar progresses, India will progress,” Mr. Modi said in his stump speech, making a pitch to young, aspirational Indians eager to live a middle-class life. “It’s about creating opportunities for the youth.” Mr. Modi said the BJP would focus on bringing jobs to Bihar. “When the youth get employed here, people won’t have to leave their old parents to earn a living,” he said.\nHundreds of thousands of people from Bihar leave the largely agrarian state to look for higher-paying employment in other parts of India and in Persian Gulf countries.\nDheeraj Kumar Pathak, a 21-year-old masters student in chemistry, said he was impressed by Mr. Modi’s efforts to drum up investment on his many overseas visits. “He’s made a place for India on the world map, so perhaps he’ll do the same for Bihar,” Mr. Pathak said.\nWhile pushing their economic agenda, BJP leaders have raised sensitive religious issues on the campaign trail, focusing on efforts to ban the slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred by Hindus. A Muslim man suspected of butchering a cow was killed, allegedly by a Hindu mob, last month in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh.\nA senior BJP politician in Bihar, Sushil Modi, who isn’t related to the prime minister, touted Mr. Modi’s efforts to prevent smuggling of cows to neighboring, Muslim-majority Bangladesh. The Bihar election “is a fight between those who eat beef and those who oppose cow slaughter,” he said.\nUnder pressure to respond to September’s religious violence, Mr. Modi in a speech in Bihar asked Hindus and Muslims to stop fighting each other and combat poverty instead. He didn’t condemn the killing of the Muslim man.\nMr. Kumar accuses the BJP, which has deep roots in Hindu nationalism, of stoking communal tensions to attract Hindu votes. The BJP denies that charge, and it points to the statements of top ministers in Mr. Modi’s cabinet who have deplored the killing.\nA former ally of the BJP, Mr. Kumar broke his alliance with the party more than two years ago when it became clear Mr. Modi would be its prime ministerial candidate, saying Mr. Modi didn’t do enough to stop religious rioting in Gujarat that killed around 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, in 2002. Mr. Modi was chief minister of the state at the time. Mr. Modi has denied any wrongdoing.\nWrite to Niharika Mandhana at niharika.mandhana@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:10:39.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
