The division’s operating margin during the quarter was 10%, down 1.2 points YOY, “reflecting higher R&D and the dilutive impact of higher 787 deliveries partially offset by strong performance on production programs,” Boeing said.\nThe company delivered 199 aircraft in the third quarter, including 126 737s, 37 787 Dreamliners, 27 777s, five 767s and four 747s.\n“By continuing to profitably deliver on our large and diverse backlog, we are driving strong growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow,” Boeing president and CEO Dennis Muilenburg said.\nBased on its current level of higher commercial airplane deliveries, Boeing announced a $500 million increase in its revenue guidance for 2015 to between $95 billion and $97 billion. “Three quarters of solid results and confidence in our continued operating performance enabled us to raise our revenue, earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year,” Muilenburg said.\nBoeing booked 166 net orders for commercial aircraft during the quarter; the company’s backlog now stands at nearly 5,700 aircraft valued at $426 billion.\nOn Aug. 27, Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes division completed the firm design configuration for the 777X aircraft, Boeing’s expansion of its 777-8 and 777-9 family. Additionally, on Sept. 15, the Commercial Airplanes division began final assembly of its first 737 MAX aircraft at Boeing’s Renton, Washington, factory; the company intends to roll out the first completed 737 MAX by the end of the year and will fly it in early 2016.\nBoeing’s companywide third-quarter revenue rose 8.6% YOY to $25.85 billion; company-wide operating profit increased 21.8% YOY to 2.58 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:39:24.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
