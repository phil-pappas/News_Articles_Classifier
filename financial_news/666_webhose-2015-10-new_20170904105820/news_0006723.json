One basis point is equal to one hundredth of a percentage point.\nConversely, yields on shorter maturities rose slightly, because short-term Treasury notes and bills are more sensitive to a potential interest-rate increase by the Federal Reserve. The yield on the two-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, -4.16% edged 0.8 basis point higher over the quarter to 0.645%. The yield has been rising for the last two quarters, gaining nine basis points in total—the largest two-quarter yield gain of the year.\nOn Wednesday, Treasury yields rose on the day, after payroll processor ADP said the U.S. private sector added 200,000 jobs in September, ahead of Friday’s closely watched official jobs report.\nThe ADP report is by some seen as a precursor to Friday’s jobs report. Strong employment data has been one of the focuses of the U.S. central bank as it considers lifting interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.\nOn Wednesday, the ADP number was “just a tad over the 190,000 expectation, so no skew for those who put this into their various NFP models,” said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital Group, in a note.\nStill, Treasury yields moved higher as a risk-on sentiment returned to global markets and investors sold U.S. government bonds, which are considered safe investments, in favor of riskier assets. The 10-year Treasury yield gained 0.9 basis points while the 30-year bond rose 1.9 basis point.\nDespite the slight increase in yields on Wednesday, overall strategists expected yields to decline in the next few days as investors buy bonds to book profits in advance of market-moving data releases.\n“Look for a pullback in yields over the next few days…ahead of NFP,” said Tom di Galoma, head of rates and credit trading at ED & F Man Capital Markets, in a note. “Continue to favor buying dips on 10-year [Treasurys] near 2.2% on a stronger set of data,” di Galoma added.\nMeanwhile in Europe government bonds were essentially flat, as stock markets staged a solid rebound Wednesday but still logged their steepest quarterly decline in four years.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year German bond TMBMKDE-10Y, +1.17% known as the bund, inched 0.6 basis point lower to 0.584%.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:23:50.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
