Financiere Richemont SA in an all-stock transaction. The combined entity has annual revenue of 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and more heft in the market as competition intensifies in Web retailing of luxury goods. Yoox founder Federico Marchetti is the new company’s chief executive officer, while Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, who was set to be executive chairman, quit last month.\nRichemont, which owns about 50 percent of Yoox Net-a-Porter stock, also gained in early trading. The maker of Cartier watches said earlier full-year profit will be boosted by an accounting gain of 610 million euros to 670 million euros from the transaction, based on Friday’s closing share price.\nShares of the Geneva-based luxury-goods maker rose as much as 4 percent.\nRichemont also said it agreed not to sell a 25 percent stake in the new company during three years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:32:37.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
