GOOGL 1.39 % enjoyed a strong third quarter boosted by solid revenue and profit growth. Overall, revenue rose 13% to $18.68 billion compared to the same period last year. And executives called out mobile search revenue, YouTube and programmatic ads as bright spots.\nHere are a few points from the earnings call marketers should note:\nGoogle isn’t sweating mobile anymore\nFor a while, observers were tracking declines in the prices advertisers pay for clicks on Google ads, and attributing that to the overall growth in mobile Internet consumption. The feeling was that advertisers didn’t value mobile ads as much as desktop ones and the fear was that search ads, Google’s bread and butter, weren’t as effective on mobile.\nBut Ruth Porat, chief financial officer at Alphabet Inc. and Google Inc., said mobile search revenue was “up significantly” and was a “catalyst” for the quarter. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, went even further, saying that Google had gotten much better at delivering ads to people at more relevant moments, and that over time, mobile search ads could become “as compelling or even better than desktop.”\nCost-per-click is still an issue, but it’s YouTube’s fault, not mobile’s\nWhile overall paid clicks were up 23% year-over-year, cost-per-click was down 11% overall and down 16% on Google’s own sites. In other words, overall lots more people are clicking on Google ads, but advertisers aren’t paying as much for those clicks. That’s been a pattern for several quarters. That trend “primarily reflects the continued growth in YouTube TrueView,” said Ms. Porat.\nGoogle has said that as more people watch videos on YouTube, the more ads they see on YouTube. And YouTube ads don’t cost as much on average as search ads right now--since many advertisers will pay high prices for search ads that deliver people who are in the market for particular products, for example.\nStill, Google says YouTube has big ad momentum\nMr. Pichai and Ms. Porat talked up YouTube on the earnings call, with Mr. Porat pointing both to TrueView ads--i.e. skippable pre-roll ads-- and Google Preferred , which lets brands buy ads on the top YouTube channels, as both growing significantly.\n“The shift to video is a profound media shift,” said Mr. Pichai. “Advertisers are very, very responsive. We are getting great traction there...[as brands are] moving traditional budgets to YouTube.”\nInterestingly, YouTube Red , the company’s new ad-free subscription service, was not a big topic on the call.\nGoogle is not that worried about ad blocking either\nMr. Pichai said that Google has been tracking the ad blocking issue for a while and the company is generally unfazed. Most consumers understand that advertising pays for Web content and services, he said.\n“Ads today fund almost all of the services people use [on the Internet],” he said. “I think users are ok with the contract...there are areas where the ad experience is getting in the way, and we as an industry need to work on that.”\nThe shift to programmatic ad buying is good for Google\nMr. Pichai said that programmatic ad revenue for the company had nearly doubled in the past year and a half and that 80% of the top 100 advertisers are spending with Google programmatically.\n“This is an area that is on fire for us right now,” he said\nWrite to Mike Shields at mike.shields@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC146_0831go_M_20150831185321.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KC146_0831go_P_20150831185321.jpg", "http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/21/youtube-red/"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:22:20.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
