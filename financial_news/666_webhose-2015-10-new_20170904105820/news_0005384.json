Earlier on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Thomspson had been arrested in Australia. \nJustice Department spokesman Peter Carr referred questions to Australian authorities. Australian authorities had no immediate comment, and Thompson's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. \nLibor, or the London interbank offered rate, is a short-term rate banks charge each other for loans that is calculated based on submissions by a panel of banks. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in financial products globally. \nThe case is the first by the Justice Department to go to trial following investigations by U.S. and European authorities. \nThose investigations resulted in charges against 22 people in the United States and United Kingdom and around $9 billion in regulatory settlements with financial institutions.
