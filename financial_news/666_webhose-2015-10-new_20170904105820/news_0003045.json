Photo: Louise Kennerley\nAsciano aims to have a second freight hub transporting containers by rail to Port Botany within 12 months as it prepares to spend $100 million building a new intermodal terminal in western Sydney.\nThe new 43-hectare hub, in the Sydney suburb of St Marys, could be open before a much-bigger competing freight terminal is opened at Moorebank by logistics group Qube and rival rail group Aurizon in late 2017.\nIt will be Asciano's second intermodal terminal in western Sydney after Chullora, which is closer to Port Botany. The Chullora terminal started transporting containers on rail to the port two months ago.\nAsciano chief executive John Mullen said the St Marys hub was \"ideally located\" for big retailers such as Woolworths, Coles and Bunnings, which have distribution centres nearby.\nAdvertisement \"The issue with both Chullora and Moorebank is that while they are ideal for servicing more of the inner west, most of the distribution centre activity is further north-west,\" Mr Mullen said.\n\"A customer now will be able to run a container to Chullora for local distribution, or take it all the way out to its distribution centre.\"\nAsciano broached the St Marys hub with Brookfield Infrastructure, which is trying to seal an $8.9 billion takeover of the ports and rail group, before proceeding, Mr Mullen said.\n\"We discuss any major investment with them now as a courtesy,\" he said. \"If they had any objection we'd know, they're very supportive of all the ongoing expansion and development that we're engaged in.\"\nThe proposed takeover, which has been recommended by Asciano's board, was \"tracking to timetable\" but was awaiting approvals from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Foreign Investment Review Board, Mr Mullen said.\n\"The job of regulators is to make sure the path is smooth and I'm sure they'll have a number of issues that will need to be addressed,\" Mr Mullen said. \"But I can't see any fundamental reason why those issues will not be able to be addressed.\"\nThe ACCC will disclose on October 15 whether it has any issues with the takeover.\nAsciano needs development approval to build the freight hub at St Marys but already owns the land at the proposed site.\nThe new hub's rail shuttle will have annual capacity of 300,000, 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) annually.\nChullora has annual capacity of 600,000 TEUs, including up to 135,000 TEUs that can run on rail to Port Botany. Chullora is running some 75,000 TEUs annually on rail to Port Botany.\nAt full capacity, moving freight from Port Botany by rail from Chullora could take up to 100,000 truck journeys off roads every year, Mr Mullen said.\nMr Mullen said he hoped the new Turnbull government would make a push on infrastructure development similar to the NSW government's, which is investing heavily in new transport networks to reduce congestion.\n\"If you have inefficient, antiquated costly supply chains, it means for the ordinary person going down to the shops to buy something, it's more expensive and more difficult to get,\" Mr Mullen said. \"So it's in the nation's interest to improve supply chains constantly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:39:58.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
