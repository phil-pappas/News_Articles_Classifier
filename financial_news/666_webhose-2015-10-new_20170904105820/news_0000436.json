It said in its most recent annual report earlier this year that “it remains our present intention to initiate an audit retendering process not later than 2017 (for the 2018 accounts)”. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is understood that the pitch process is now under way, although it is not clear if PwC is repitching for the work. \nRolls-Royce is also with KPMG, and has been since 1990, again having not put out its audit to tender during that time. Centrica, owner of British Gas, has been with PwC since 1997, when the company was formed during its demerger from BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) . \nThe new European Union directive requires that audits be tendered at least every 10 years, and that an incumbent auditor can only be reappointed once. \nThe rules were in response to questions as to whether auditing companies had become too close to their customers in the run-up to the financial crisis, and whether auditors should have pointed out some of the liquidity problems which led to a series of bank collapses. \nOther FTSE firms to have changed auditor ahead of the looming deadline include Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , which switched from PwC to Deloitte after 32 years in May , and HSBC, which confirmed PwC would replace KPMG after 22 years earlier this year. \nA PwC spokesman pointed to the fact it has recently won Aberdeen Asset Management, Hikma and Mondi (LSE: MNDI.L - news ) , and retained easyJet. \nTony Cates, KPMG UK’s head of audit, said: “[Overall] at KPMG we’ve seen our share of the FTSE 100 audit market increase this calendar year, with notable wins including Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , BAT and Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:57:54.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
