Graham Tidy Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby The country's laws aren't keeping up with the apartment boom that will double the number of strata dwellings by 2030, the peak strata industry body says.\nFurther, the state-based approach that creates a different system in each jurisdiction also impedes the development of the growing asset class, Strata Community Australia president Erik Adriaanse said.\nThe reality has hit the City of Melbourne, which ordered owners of apartments in the fire-damaged LaCrosse building in Docklands to cover the cost of making the building compliant with fire laws.\nUnable to make a single joint order that covers all the owners and the body corporate, the city had to chase 400 individual owners as far afield as Malaysia, China and Brunei to inform them of the decision. Further, if an individual owner does not pay up, the city has to chase them individually, rather than take action against the owners' corporation.\n\"The current regulatory system is premised on smaller numbers of apartments or town houses in a single building, and does not allow for a collective approach, which would make this situation easier for all involved,\" City of Melbourne chief executive Ben Rimmer said. \"The legislation has not kept pace with change in building systems and the rapid growth in high rise multi-ownership towers over the past decade.\"\nThe country's 2.6-million strata lots, or dwellings, account for 26 per cent of all housing stock, but that will grow to 50 per cent by 2030, Mr Adriaanse said.\nNSW, for example, is debating legislation to make it easy to renew ageing building stock , but no other states are making similar moves.\n\"We are trying to have the rights of certain decisions taken out of legislation such as pets and smoking, to be the decisions made by owners rather than legislation,\" he said. \"It has to be consistent around the country.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-10-26T14:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:39.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
