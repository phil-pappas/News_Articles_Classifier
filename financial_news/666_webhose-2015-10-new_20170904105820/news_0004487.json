Chris Skelton/Fairfax NZ Share on twitter by Katie Walsh The Rolling Stones were on the money about many things with which lawyers can empathise, including the struggle for job satisfaction, the inability to get what you want out of a brief, and having sympathy for the devil in details.\nBut it's never, ever, \"only\" rock'n'roll, even if we like it .\nJump-starting what would be an otherwise standard Wednesday night dining a-la-desk to finish off that urgent piece of advice, on October 28 some of the nation's biggest law firms will go head-to-head in a battle for rock star glory.\nNorton Rose Fulbright, Clayton Utz, Herbert Smith Freehills, Ashurst and Allens will take to the stage at the Oxford Art Factory in Sydney for the Law Rocks battle. They will be billing in the name of a charity for a change, raising precious funds for the Property Industry Foundation which helps young people at risk including providing homes and jobs .\nSo, will they have the loose moves and constricted pants of Jagger?\nLead singer for Norton Rose band The Thorns (boom tish), senior associate Louise \"Joplin\" Santos, in true rock-star style revealed little on the topic. She wants to keep it as a surprise for concertgoers.\nFellow band members include insurance partner Ray Giblett on guitar and occupational health and safety partner (insurance is a must, but who invites OH&S onto a rock band?) Alena Titterton on keyboards and vocals. Construction and engineering partner Rob Buchanan has the fraught, but still glamorous, role of band manager.\n\"Being part of Law Rocks in Australia gives us an opportunity to unleash our inner rock stars while raising money for a great cause,\" says Santos, who is promising a fantastic night.\n Rock'n'roll all night, discovery every day No doubt, one in which they will rock'n'roll all night , hopefully forgetting the need to run discovery every day (Hearsay hopes at least some will adopt KISS makeup).\nBut will they be able to leave behind their smooth billables (those ones that clients have been hit by, struck by) ? Or forget, just for the night, about our increasing US-inspired desire to sue you, sue me (okay, so Lionel Richie isn't quite rock star, but let's not ruin the fun)?\nClayton Utz's resident rock star, litigation partner Mark Waller, is surprisingly missing from the firm's band. Perhaps he is still recovering from his recent tour to BrisVegas to raise $30,000 grand for an autism charity jamming with his group, The Manilows .\nInstead, major projects lawyer Daniel Bullock takes the lead.\nThe HSF band, Quartzite (you got it, hard as a non-foliated metamorphic rock), may prove tough competitors. They'll have an extra string in the electric guitar, channelling the recent thrill of securing an additional spot over the Brits on the firm's global executive team following a restructure; increasing the Aussie count to six of eleven – that's a majority, folks.\nBarrister Charles \"Rake\" Waterstreet, TV producer of My Kitchen Rules and Big Brother fame Joe Herdman, and Banco Chambers barrister Ruth Higgins will judge.\nThe only disappointment for Hearsay is that our own rock star, cartoonist Rod Clement, is on holidays and cannot memorialise the occasion. Watch this space come late October; there may be more at stake for the competition winner.\nThe Law Rocks event started in London in 2009 and has crept its way to nine cities around the globe since.\nTickets are on sale soon but most are allocated to those firms involved, limiting the access of the public masses who will no doubt rush for front row seats.\nNot only rock'n'roll Of course, if you miss out, you can always head to the Sydney Lawyers Orchestra's Christmas Concert on December 16 instead – because who needs rock stars when you have the class of Corrs Chambers Westgarth partner and conductor Thomas Jones resplendent in tails?\nThe folks at Mills Oakley Lawyers have other ways of shooting for thrills: next Friday, three lawyers – Victoria Graves, Christine Clarke and Carly Mirza-Price – will abseil down a 33-storey tower in Sydney's CBD. They're also undertaking their challenge for a good cause, raising money for the Sir David Martin Foundation, in particular its farm for young people with substance abuse and mental health issues.\nDriving a class action Over at Maurice Blackburn, there is no time for such frivolity and favours: they're busy compiling a class action against don't-look-now-but-we're-not-THAT-eco Volkswagen . If filed, that would be Australia's first in the scandal. The count in the US? Higher than 229 actions filed to date, according to Bloomberg .", "external_links": ["http://www.pif.com.au/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Oj0ls13zTM", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGaBlygm0UY", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91AzUkwiFyo", "https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-06/volkswagen-sued-by-west-virginia-over-clean-diesel-claims-ifer2tox", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_D3VFfhvs4", "http://www.mauriceblackburn.com.au/current-class-actions/volkswagen-class-action-investigation"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:40:17.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
