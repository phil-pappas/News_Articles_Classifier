So is now the time to buy into that 6.7pc dividend yield? \n= Out in the cold = \nThe main attraction with Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) shares has always been their stability and healthy dividend income. But both of those features have come under serious pressure this year. The shares have slumped to a five-year low as the oil price continued to fall and investors balked at the £47bn deal to buy gas rival BG. \nThe questions over the finances at Shell have become such that Ben van Beurden, chief executive, has been forced publicly to defend the dividend payments. He said Shell would “pull out all the stops” to protect the dividend at these lower oil prices. \nThe company has certainly been busy, slashing spending on new projects, selling off petrol stations and halting an expensive drilling programme in the Arctic, off the coast of Alaska. \n= Mini-recovery = \nThe shares have been thrown a lifeline as the oil price has staged a mini-recovery in October. As tensions heat up in and around Syria, the oil price has jumped more than 10pc to about $53 pre barrel. \nInvestors have also been soothed by the $4bn (£2.6bn) in cost cuts that Shell plans to make this year and a 20pc reduction in capital investment. Making the necessary adjustments to cope with the lower oil price should allow Shell to complete the BG deal and pay dividends \nDespite revenue and profits tumbling with these lower oil prices, Shell is still making lots of cash as it is one of the lowest cost European oil majors. The company is expected to earn about $33bn in cash from its core business of selling oil and gas in the current financial year. \nShell is reducing capital spending from $32bn last year to $26.6bn this year, and is also selling assets such as petrol stations and pipelines to raise a further $3bn. However, the cash generated still won’t cover the dividend payments of about $11.6bn this year. \nShell can bridge the gap to keep the dividend payments going and the debt levels will increase this year. The prize is a potential for a rapid increase in gas production from the Brazilian assets owned and developed by BG. \nThe balance sheet looks pretty solid with forecast net debts of $28bn, against shareholders’ equity of around $179bn, estimated for the end of December. \nThe debt levels will increase sharply if the BG deal completes, but the risk looks manageable. \nStepping back from the mini-rally, it is still a bleak picture for the oil industry. The oil price has declined 20pc so far this year and demand is weak. Shell has a strong balance sheet and the 188 cents (123p) dividend looks sustainable for now. We would still be happy to hold on as it commands a strong position. \nThe more adventurous investor could buy BG shares at £10.89. Investors holding BG shares at the time the deal closes will receive £3.83 in cash and 0.4454 Shell B shares for each of their BG shares. So, at a net spend on 706p they could receive their 0.4454 share of the 123p Shell dividend, or a prospective yield of 7.9pc. \nNote (Stockholm: NOTE.ST - news ) : UK investors should buy Shell’s “B” shares, not the “A” class shares, to prevent potential problems with double taxation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:25:45.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
