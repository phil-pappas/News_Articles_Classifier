However, we see support for underlying demand growth, and we view any product-related oversupply as temporary. Global refining margins are off highs, but the details are more positive,\" the report said. \nDue to the low oil prices, investment in the sector in 2016 will likely decline further after sliding this year by more than a fifth, Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said on Monday. \n\"If it comes true, this will be the first time in two decades we will see oil investments declining for two consecutive years and may be an indication for future oil markets,\" he said at the Singapore International Energy Week. \nSwift Worldwide Resources estimates that more than 200,000 jobs in the oil and gas industry have been cut worldwide since prices collapsed last year. \n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Keith Wallis; Editing by Tom Hogue and Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:18:22.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
