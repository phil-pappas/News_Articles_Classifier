View photo\nAs bets on a 2015 Fed rate hike fall, so does the greenback \nThe dollar languished near its weakest level since June as traders continue to reduce bets on an interest-rate increase in the U.S. this year. Asian stock futures were mixed, while American contracts rallied after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. dragged the benchmark lower.\nBets on the Federal Reserve boosting borrowing costs at its October meeting slid to just 4 percent and odds of an increase before the end of the year are now below 30 percent, diminishing the appeal of dollar-denominated assets and bolstering appetite for currencies like the New Zealand dollar. Nasdaq 100 Index futures jumped after Netflix Inc. pared most of its decline in extended trading amid lackluster earnings, while Japanese contracts signaled declines. U.S. oil extended losses below $47 a barrel as gold held gains.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Wal-Mart Tumbles Most in 15 Years After Predicting Profit Slump \n“What you’re seeing in the movement right now is an unwind of the bullish-dollar story,” said Douglas Borthwick, head of foreign-exchange at New York brokerage Chapdelaine & Co. “The Fed has no reason to raise rates when you’re getting the data that we’ve been getting lately.”\nRisk aversion dominated in the U.S. session with a weaker-than-expected increase in retail sales compounding the steepest drop in Wal-Mart stock for more than 27 years. Data earlier on Wednesday showed Chinese producer prices matching their steepest slump since the global financial crisis, fueling anxiety over an economy that was at the epicenter of last quarter’s market gyrations. Growing evidence of slowing global growth is validating the Fed’s decision last month to hold off on raising rates for the first time since 2006.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: Wal-Mart Heirs See $11 Billion Vanish in a Day on Share Fall \nStocks\nAfter the index slipped 0.5 percent Wednesday on the back of Wal-Mart’s post-earnings selloff, futures on the S&P 500 signaled a rebound, rising 0.2 percent to 1,988 by 8:40 a.m. in Tokyo. Wal-Mart slid 10 percent to lead losses in the U.S. gauge after it issued a weak profit outlook. Nasdaq 100 contracts climbed 0.4 percent after Netflix reduced an initial after-market slump of as much as 15 percent to less than 3 percent.\nWith the yen holding on to a three-day advance, futures on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average were being bid down 0.8 percent in the Osaka pre-market, to 17,790. \nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index added 0.2 percent in early trading, while New Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50 Index, the first major equity index to start trading each day in the Asian region, was lower, down 0.1 percent. \nMore from Bloomberg.com: The 19-Hour Flight Is Coming Back \nMeanwhile, futures on Chinese stocks tipped gains, with contracts on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and Hang Seng China Enterprises indexes rising 0.2 percent in recent trading. FTSE China A50 Index futures added 1 percent. The biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking Chinese equities dropped 1.5 percent Wednesday amid the losses in New York. Contracts on the Kospi index in Seoul dropped 0.4 percent. \nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the U.S. currency against 10 major peers, was little changed Thursday after sinking 0.9 percent last session to its lowest closing level since June 30. The yen, which has climbed more than 1 percent so far this week, was steady at 118.83 per dollar, close to its strongest level since Sept. 4. \nThe kiwi added another 0.2 percent to 68 U.S. cents after surging 2.2 percent on Wednesday, its best one-day performance since March. Australia’s dollar was little changed at 73.08 cents following a 0.8 percent jump, with the country to issue data on employment Thursday. \nAsian emerging-market currencies looked set for gains following the dollar’s beating. One-month forward contracts on the Korean won and the Indonesian rupiah climbed at least 0.7 percent with central banks in both countries projected to keep benchmark rates on hold in policy reviews. Non-deliverable forwards on Malaysia’s ringgit gained 1.5 percent after a Bloomberg gauge of developing-nation currencies rose the most in a week on Thursday. \nJapan reports on factory output Thursday and Singapore posts retail sales.\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nBrazil's Next Big Crisis Is Scaring Bankers and Wiping Out Jobs Obama Administration Hits Back at Student Debtors Seeking Relief Citi: The Most Important People in Finance Are Concerned About These Four Things Read Dollar Flails Around 3-Month Low With Asian Stock Futures Mixed on bloomberg.com\nWal-Mart Stores Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:51:09.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
