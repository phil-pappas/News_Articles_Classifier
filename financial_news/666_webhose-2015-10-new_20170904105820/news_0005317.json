PUBLISHED: 17:11, Sun, Oct 25, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:30, Sun, Oct 25, 2015 GETTY Over-60s are forced to take bad deals from lenders \nMany are forced to pay higher rates on mortgages, loans and credit cards or are being turned away altogether. Charlotte Nelson, finance expert at MoneyFacts.co.uk, says lenders are adopting a hard-line policy towards older people. \nShe said yesterday: “Over 65 and looking for finance? Then you are barred!” \nSome lenders are even cracking down on middle-aged borrowers who apply for a mortgage that runs past state retirement age over fears they will be unable to service the debt. This is preventing thousands from remortgaging to cheaper deals. Related articles Britain's Buy-To-Let boom gathers pace \nMortgages \nBanks and building societies are increasingly reluctant to offer mortgage terms that run beyond 65. Nelson says: “With more people working well beyond state retirement age, it seems unfair that older people are being barred from some of the best deals despite having the means to repay the debt.” \nThis is even hitting mortgage seekers in their 40s or 50s. Recently, HSBC was condemned for refusing to grant a £250,000 mortgage to a couple in their 40s because the husband would have been over 65 when the 18-year term finished. GETTY Banks and building societies are increasingly reluctant to offer mortgage terms that run beyond 65 \nThis is a growing problem as people climb on the property ladder later in life or borrow dizzying sums to keep up with soaring prices. \nSimon Tyler, managing director of broker Tyler Mortgage Management, says lenders have tightened up following regulations in the Mortgage Market Review last year. This forces lenders to make sure borrowers can afford their loan if interest rates rise. \nTyler says: “The rules are terribly unclear and have been interpreted in different ways by different lenders.” \nLenders are now reluctant to advance funds if your mortgage term will creep into your retirement years. He adds: “Not that you would know by looking at lenders’ websites or marketing materials, which never mention this fact.” \nNervous lenders are taking a firm stance towards older borrowers in case some fail to pay off their mortgage and subsequently claim it was mis-sold. Tyler says it “beggars belief” why some lenders take such a hard line. \nHe says: “If you can demonstrate that your retirement income from pensions or property is sufficient, it should be some of the safest lending of all because you cannot get sacked in retirement.” Over 65 and looking for finance? Then you are barred Charlotte Nelson, finance expert at MoneyFacts.co.uk \nBarclays, the Post Office, NatWest and RBS may offer loans running up to age 70, depending on your personal circumstances, while Halifax, Nationwide, Santander and Virgin Money may stretch to 75. Applicants must be able to prove that they have enough pension or other investment income to service the debt. \nSome lenders individually underwrite applicants and base a decision on their personal circumstances rather than adopting a “computer says no” attitude. Smaller building societies are often the most flexible, for example, Market Harborough, Mansfield and Earl Shilton will lend to age 80, while Kent Reliance and Stafford Railway lend to 85. \nBuckinghamshire, National Counties, Monmouthshire, Loughborough and others set no maximum age limit. Again, you must demonstrate that you will have the means to service your loan. Tyler advise not giving up if you have been turned away. GETTY The hard-line policy is preventing thousands from remortgaging to cheaper deals \nHe says: “A good mortgage broker can find lenders willing to help older borrowers. We have found solutions for nine out of 10 older people who have come to us.” \nPersonal loans \nMany older people are also being refused a competitive personal loan to buy a car, fund home improvements or consolidate debts. Figures from MoneyFacts show that four out of its six best-buy loans come with age limits. Hitachi Personal Finance, which offers a market-leading rate of 4.40 per cent for a £5,000 loan over three years, will not lend to anybody over 60. \nDavid Black, banking specialist at DJB Research, says older people can find it really difficult to get unsecured loans: “Lenders want to see that they can afford the repayments and so will carefully scrutinise income, expenditure and financial obligations. If you have other debts it will be hard.” \nClydesdale Bank will turn away personal applicants who are over 74 or earn less than £15,000 a year, while Tesco Bank’s applicants must be aged under 75 at the end of the loan term. \nCredit cards \nCredit card issuers do not impose maximum age limits but older borrowers still face difficulties. GETTY Many card issuers demand that applicants earn a minimum income \nAndrew Hagger, personal finance expert at MoneyComms.co.uk, says older people can fall foul of lenders’ automated credit scoring systems. He says: “Those in their 70s struggle as they are seen as a greater risk.” \nMany card issuers demand that applicants earn a minimum income. Barclaycard, for example, demands a regular income of £20,000 a year, far more than most retirees receive. \nHagger says: “Over-50s specialist Saga makes no distinction based on age but requires new card customers to have an annual income of at least £12,000, including the state pension. \n\"Others set limits as low as £10,000.” If you are married and your partner has a card, or income, you could add your name to their account.
