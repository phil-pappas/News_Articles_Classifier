In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.44%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.\n\nWhy a Likely Positive Surprise? \n\nOur proven model shows that General Motors is likely to beat earnings this season because it has the right combination of the two key components.\n\nZacks ESP: Earnings ESP for General Motors is currently pegged at +2.61% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.18, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.15. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  \n\nZacks Rank: General Motors currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.  \n\nGeneral Motors’ Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.\n\nWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings? \n\nGeneral Motors has been gaining new contracts for business expansion. In Jun 2015, the company entered into a partnership agreement with Japanese company, Isuzu Motors Ltd. The deal is helping General Motors to expand its commercial-vehicle offerings with low cab-forward models that are produced by Isuzu, based on the Isuzu N-Series.\n\nGeneral Motors is also focused on investment in innovative technologies and vehicles which should provide sustained growth while maximizing shareholders value. In Mar 2015, General Motors adopted a comprehensive capital allocation strategy, which reflects its strong operating performance and robust financial position. Per this plan, the automaker is returning its available free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet with a cash balance of $20 billion to boost long-term growth. All these strategies are expected to boost the company’s performance in the quarter to be reported.\n\nStocks to Consider \n\nHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:\n\nJohnson Controls Inc. JCI has an Earnings ESP of +1.98% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report fourth-quarter 2015 results on Oct 29.\n\nAmerican Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. AXL has an Earnings ESP of +1.47% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release third-quarter 2015 earnings results on Oct 30.\n\nAutoliv, Inc. ALV has an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release third-quarter 2015 earnings results on Oct 23.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
