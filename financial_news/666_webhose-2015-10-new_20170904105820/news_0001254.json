With less money left to spend, people tend to buy less, which has a knock-on effect on company?s sales figures. \nHe added: \"Any suggestion of a delay regarding a Fed interest rate hike can send stocks surging because it suggests that people will keep buying goods or services at the same rate for the time being.\" \nIn foreign exchange activity, the European single currency slid to $1.1359, from $1.1495 late in New York on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:16:57.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
