Compared to the airline’s MXP347 million take in the 2014 third-quarter, the company more than tripled its profit.\n“During the third quarter Volaris responded to an increase in demand by accelerating its capacity growth,” CEO Enrique Beltranena said. “[Our] ULCC model continues to penetrate the domestic and international markets, resulting in a strong quarter from commercial, operational and financial standpoints.”\nYear-to-date through Sept. 30, Volaris has posted a net profit of MXP1.81 billion, reversing the airline’s 2014 nine-month net loss of MXP98 million.\nVolaris’ total operating revenue for the third-quarter was MXP5.22 billion, up 30.7% year-over-year (YOY) from MXP4 billion reported in 3Q 2014. Volaris’ non-ticket revenue in the third-quarter was up 43.3% YOY to MXP1.06 billion, compared to MXP742 million in the 2014 third-quarter. Total operating expenses were MXP4.14 billion, up 13.9% YOY from MXP3.63 billion in the year-ago quarter. The carrier’s operating income for the quarter was MXP1.08 billion, nearly tripling its 2014 third-quarter result.\nThird-quarter passenger traffic was up 23.6% YOY to 3.23 billion RPMs. Volaris’ third-quarter capacity kept pace, growing 24% YOY during the quarter, to 3.88 billion ASMs. The carrier reported an 83.1% load factor for the quarter, slightly lower (by 0.3 points) than 3Q 2014.\nVolaris booked 3.34 million passengers during the September quarter, up 26.6% YOY. Volaris’ CASM fell 8.1% YOY to MXP106.6 cents, due to lower fuel prices. The company’s fuel costs during the third-quarter fell 10.5% YOY to MXP1.3 billion.\nThus far in 2015, Volaris has taken delivery of four new A320ceos; during the third-quarter, new A320s were delivered on July 27 and Sept. 18. Volaris ended the quarter with a fleet of 55 all-Airbus aircraft (35 A320s, 18 A319s and two A321s ) with an average age of 4.4 years. The company expects to receive its 56 th aircraft by year-end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:18:11.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
