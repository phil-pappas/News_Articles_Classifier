Photo: AP\nFor investors around the world, 2015 is turning into a year to forget. Stocks, commodities and currency funds are all in the red, and even the measly gains in bonds are being wiped out by what little inflation there is in the global economy.\nRounding out its steepest quarterly descent in four years, the MSCI All Country World Index of shares is down 6.6 per cent in 2015 including dividends. The Bloomberg Commodity Index has slumped 16 per cent, while a Parker Global Strategies index of currency funds dropped 1.8 per cent. Fixed income has failed to offer much of a haven: Bank of America's global debt index gained just 1 per cent, less than the 2.5 per cent increase in world consumer prices shown in an International Monetary Fund index.\nAfter three years in a virtuous cycle of rising share prices and unprecedented monetary easing, markets are now sinking as emerging economies from China to Brazil weaken and corporate profits slump. Analysts have cut their global growth estimates for 2015 to 3 per cent from 3.5 per cent at the start of the year, and the turmoil has added pressure on central banks to prolong their stimulus programs, with traders scaling back forecasts for a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by year-end.\n\"There was an element of people believing they had found some sort of holy grail to investing, then this breakdown occurs and it breaks down in a way that's remarkable,\" said Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief US equity strategist. \"What seemed to trigger this all was China. It sent us on a wave of downward fears.\"\nInvestors suffered the brunt of this year's losses in the third quarter, with almost US$11 trillion ($15.7 trillion) erased from stocks worldwide over the past three months.\nMSCI's global equity index sank about 10 per cent in the period, while the Bloomberg commodity index lost 14 per cent in its biggest slump since the global financial crisis seven years ago. The average level of Bank of America's Market Risk index, a measure of price swings in equities, rates, currencies and raw materials, was the most this quarter since the end of 2011. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge of turbulence known as the VIX, reached the highest since 2011 in August.\nChina has been the biggest source of anxiety for investors, after turmoil in the nation's financial markets fuelled concern that the country's worst economic slowdown since 1990 was deepening. The Shanghai Composite Index plunged 29 per cent in the third quarter, the most worldwide, and the yuan weakened 2.4 per cent after authorities devalued the currency in August.\nThat sent a shudder around the world.\nMarkets unravel The worst quarter in seven years for the Bloomberg JP Morgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region's 10 most-active currencies outside of Japan, has pushed it down 5.1 per cent this year to the lowest levels since 2009. A similar measure for Latin American currencies tumbled to a record.\nEven those investors speculating on dollar strength have found trades upended by the yen's 2.2 per cent rally in the third quarter and a revitalised euro.\n\"This is going to go down as one of the worst quarters in a while,\" said Michael Antonelli, an institutional equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. \"It all kicked off from a China slowdown concern and has unravelled piece by piece.\"\nIn the US, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has dropped about 7 per cent since the end of June as companies reported a 1.7 per cent slump in second-quarter earnings and cuts to analyst profit estimates outnumbered increases for 17 straight weeks.\nAnd in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index lost 8 per cent in the September quarter, with the benchmark index falling below 5000 in August for the first time since 2013. The index ended the quarter at 5051.6, but uncertainty about the outlook for investors continues to linger.\nLocal energy stocks plummeted 25.9 per cent over the quarter, materials - which includes mining stocks - 12.7 per cent, and financial stocks 9.1 per cent. Only the industrials and utilities sectors managed gains, of just 2 per cent and 1 per cent respectively.\nCommodity producers are also to blame for a big portion of the reductions globally after Brent crude oil fell below $US50 a barrel on the highest OPEC output in seven years. Copper touched a six-year low, while platinum fell 15 per cent in the quarter. The precious metal, used in devices that curb harmful emissions from cars, bore the brunt of Volkswagen's attempts to rig pollution tests for US diesel engines. Meanwhile Glencore, the commodities group that's become a proxy for the industry's woes, plummeted 69 per cent year-to-date on the London Stock Exchange.\nCredit markets haven't been excluded from the losses. The BofA Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield Index is set for its first annual decline since 2008, with yields approaching the highest since 2012. Government bonds returned just 1.4 per cent in an environment of strong demand for haven assets.\nFed dilemma For all the turbulence, the US economy is still \"pretty solid\" and the Fed should raise interest rates, Howard Marks, the co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Group, said at a conference in Toronto on Tuesday. A rate increase of 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point, won't be \"that big of an event\" after the Fed held borrowing costs near zero on September 17, said Marks, whose firm is the world's biggest manager of distressed debt.\nThe \"phantom rate hike\" this month has only added to market volatility, according to Tony Crescenzi at Pacific Investment Management.\nTraders in the futures market have been pushing back forecasts for the Fed liftoff. They're pricing in a 41 per cent probability the Fed will raise its benchmark rate by a quarter-percentage point by the December 15-16 meeting, down from 60 per cent at the end of August. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan haven't ruled out extending their stimulus programs, while forecasters including HSBC predict China will cut banks' reserve ratios to bolster economic growth.\n\"More and more people will expect the Fed to postpone tightening this year if these very fearful conditions continue,\" said Kei Katayama, a money manager in Tokyo at Daiwa Investments, which oversees $US48.5 billion.\nFor Cristian Maggio, London-based head of emerging-markets research at Toronto Dominion Bank, a slide in developing-nation assets may not be over.\nEmerging-market stocks dropped the most in four years in the third quarter, while local-currency sovereign bonds retreated about 3 per cent. Brazil's real tumbled to a record low in September as the nation's credit rating was cut to junk by Standard & Poor's.\n\"Longer-term, we still see fundamental reasons for weakness,\" said Maggio. \"The selloff looks overdone, and I expect this extreme pessimism to correct somewhat in the near term. But markets will have to believe that the selloff of emerging market currencies has gone too far. Poor sentiment and panic selling can be self-fulfilling.\"\nBloomberg with BusinessDay", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:00:22.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
