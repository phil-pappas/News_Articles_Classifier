Ananthalakshmi\nSINGAPORE, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Copper slipped on Friday on concerns over demand from top consumer China, but the metal was set to snap a two-week decline as investors bet production cuts would support prices.\nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange had eased 0.2 percent to $5,088.50 a tonne by 0255 GMT.\nThe metal had climbed to $5,230 in the previous session, the highest since Sept. 22, but could not hold that ground.\n\"Copper failed to sustain this week's rally after weak manufacturing data raised concerns about global growth,\" ANZ analysts said in a note.\nData on Thursday showed activity in China's vast factory sector shrank again in September as demand softened at home and abroad, fuelling fears that the world's second-largest economy may be cooling more rapidly than expected just a few months ago.\nData from the United States also showed a slowdown in factory growth. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 50.2, the lowest since May 2013.\nTraders are now waiting for the U.S. nonfarm payrolls report later in the session to help gauge the timing of a Federal Reserve rate hike.\nThe absence of China, which is closed for a national holiday, also kept liquidity light in Asian hours.\nFor the week, copper is up 1.3 percent, after posting two straight weeks of declines. Copper prices plunged to six-year lows below $5,000 a tonne in August.\nThe lower metal prices have prompted several companies to cut mine output.\nChile's second-biggest copper mine Collahuasi, owned by London-listed Anglo American Plc and Glencore, said this week it planned to cut output by 30,000 tonnes.\nThat is not a large amount in a market estimated at around 23 million tonnes this year, but it adds to recent announcements about output cuts and reinforces expectations of miners taking out more capacity.\nCopper also came under pressure as a sell-off resumed in mining and trading giant Glencore on Thursday, despite assurances to investors that its debt-cutting plans remain on track.\nBattered by a collapse in global commodity prices over the past year, Glencore's share price has lost some 70 percent this year, nearly half of that on Monday alone.\nAmong other metals, three-month zinc fell 0.2 percent $1,683.50 a tonne, while aluminium ticked up 0.2 percent to $1,569.\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin (Additional reporting by Naveen Thukral; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:44:22.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
