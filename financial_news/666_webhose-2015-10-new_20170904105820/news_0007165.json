Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declined to approve its dry eye drug, lifitegrast, and requested an additional clinical study. \n\"We believe the CRL (Complete Response Letter) was fairly well anticipated by the market, with Shire having been warning of the risk of a delay, pending more clinical data for the last few months. Nonetheless, we still expect underperformance today,\" analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note. \nBarclays rose 0.9 percent, the top FTSE 100 riser, after a report in the Financial Times that the company will accelerate the reduction of its investment bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:54:02.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
