Europe does not want us out of Europe.\" \nHe said those who thought leaving the EU would solve the migrant crisis were wrong. \nAmong those individuals recruited to the cause are Sir Peter Wall , the former chief of the general staff, TV presenter June Sarpong and businesswoman Baroness Brady. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) also has the support of all three living former Prime Ministers: Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. \nThe \"Out\" side continues to be hamstrung by division and rivalries, with two groupings, \"Vote Leave\" and \"Leave.EU\", competing for precedence. \nSpeaking on Sky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) 's Murnaghan programme on Sunday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested Boris Johnson could be persuaded to lead the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. \nWhen asked by Dermot Murnaghan whether Mr Johnson might be a \"feather\" in the \"Out\" campaign cap, he replied: \"We might just get him.\" \nAnd he claimed that around half of Conservative members were in favour of leaving. \nPoll results have varied widely and the indications are public opinion even at this early stage is extremely volatile. \nYouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) has a small lead for \"Brexit\" (40% leave, 38% remain), ICM shows a small lead for staying in (39% leave, 44% remain) and ComRes shows a big lead for the In campaign (36% leave, 55% remain).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:59:53.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
