Aged 27 and 24, they both have degrees that David describes as \"useless\", as neither has managed to find work. David buys everything from their clothes to their food, because they don't claim benefits either. \nHe said: \"They have a big appetite because of their age so they eat a lot. \nOur family has a larger food bill than most. But I've gone past the point of being stressed out. Sooner or later they will find something.\" \nThe elder son has a fine-art degree and has done a lot of volunteering work. He set up business doing gardening but David says he didn't really think it through. He also makes art but David says it's very abstract which means it doesn't sell as well as more popular designs. \nThe younger has a psychology degree and has applied for jobs all over the country. However, he has arthritis and doesn't drive, which has made the search harder. He also has suspected dyspraxia, a co-ordination disorder. \nEach month David transfers £1,300 into a joint account for them, which they can spend on food, petrol birthday presents and clothes - and that sometimes falls short. \nDavid's main financial goal is to ensure he has enough money to live on when he retires. His only debt is the mortgage, which has £80,000 left on it. The house is worth about £300,000. \nHis pensions are his only savings - and he's not sure how much they are worth as he's had trouble getting this information from former employers. He plans to retire aged 65 and he wants himself and Michelle to have enough money to keep them going for the rest of their lives. His worry at the moment is whether his two adult sons might be jeopardising this plan. \n= Alan Higham, founder of pensionschamp.com, says: = \nDavid is going to have to take a significant drop in income in retirement, so I would suggest he should carry on working to state pension age, which will be 67. \nHis IBM pension pays out at age 63 a pension of £13,500 a year in today's terms, but that includes a temporary allowance of £1,400 a year paid only until his 65th birthday. Also, only a part of his pension is guaranteed to increase once in payment, so the real value of that income will decline. \nAt 67, I'd expect him to qualify for the full single-tier pension which is likely to be around £8,000 a year in today's terms if he stays in work until then. His IBM pension at age 67 is likely to be around £11,500 in today's terms. \nThe IBM pension scheme may enhance his pension if he delays taking it until age 67 but we do not know how they will treat him. I have therefore assumed that he will take his pension at 63 and reinvest the money into his personal pension. He could take it earlier and reinvest but I'd worry that the investments might not beat the scheme pension and he would be even more vulnerable to a change in the pension tax relief system [tax breaks on contributions]. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's an option worth looking at in case the terms for early retirement are particularly generous but not one I'd expect to pay huge dividends. I am also assuming he stays with his employer until age 67 and keeps making the same level of pension savings. \nMichelle probably has a sufficient National Insurance (NI) record to receive a state pension of around £6,000 a year or just less. If she returned to work now, then she could increase that to £8,000 - giving them an extra £2,000 a year for life. At age 67, the gross annual household income is likely to consist of: £14,000 from state pensions and £11,500 from company pensions. There will also be income from David's reinvested final salary pension. His current company pension is estimated to grow to £207,000 (in today's terms) with modest growth. \nUnder current rules, David could draw as much as he likes from this pot, so he could sustain a high standard of living for a few years but not indefinitely. I suggest he treats a withdrawal of 3pc each year as a cautious view of the long-term sustainable level, and increase each year with inflation. He may be able to draw more and sustain it but he'll need a bit of luck on his side. Bringing all that together, I would say their net-of-tax household income in retirement will be in the region of £29,000 to £34,000 a year assuming no changes to the tax system. \nAt present, although David has a well-paid job, the various deductions of pension contributions, income tax, NI and mortgage repayments mean household income is around £35,000 a year. He is likely to have to take a drop in living standards but as long as he keeps working to age 67 then it should be manageable. \n= Danny Cox, a financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , said: = \nOnce he has the value of his pension, David will be able to see how much more he needs to save to build the right retirement income level. \nAs a higher-rate taxpayer, David benefits from 40pc tax relief on contributions. There is a strong possibility that higher-rate tax relief will be scrapped, perhaps as soon as April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016, so, if possible, David should make best use of this. \nThe maximum that can be paid into pension and qualify for tax relief is normally £40,000 a year. However, David would only get higher-rate tax relief on a maximum of around £28,000 as you cannot receive more higher-rate relief than higher-rate tax you pay. A contribution of this size is also beyond his budget, but worth understanding the principle. \nThe other step to improve his retirement is to pay off his mortgage. It's not clear whether it is interest-only or repayment, however David should ensure this is paid off before retirement, not least because equity release might provide some form of quasi-income in retirement. \nTurning to outgoings, clearly if he were able to divert the money he is spending keeping his children into savings, he could boost retirement prospects. His income could be improved by around £7,000 a year if he saved that money and invested it, assuming a 5pc return. What's more, tax relief on the £15,600 would reduce the net cost to £9,360 allowing him to start building a cash reserve. A cash Isa is a good home, as interest is tax-free. \nDavid should also consider pension savings in his wife's name, since her pension income in retirement is likely to be much lower than the personal allowance, the amount you can receive before you start to pay tax. Non-earners can still benefit from tax relief of 20pc on contributions up to £3,600 a year before tax. \nTurning to the children, they should be capable of some form of work to help out. David should involve them in his retirement plans and explain that they are having an impact on their parents' future. \nClearly if nothing changes, David and his wife are unlikely to be able to retire on the income they would like. \n= Need a money makeover?
