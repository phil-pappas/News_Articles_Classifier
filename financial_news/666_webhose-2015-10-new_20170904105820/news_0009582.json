The average U.S.-stock fund was no treat in the third quarter.\nSix years into a bull market that restored confidence in stocks, even with many scary reverses, investors got a reminder in the quarter about how fragile the advances can be.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport More in Investing in Funds & ETFs The 4 Things to Do Before Retirement Guide to the New Fund Rules Tough Year for Target-Date Funds ‘529’ Mismatch? Our College Q&A No. 1 fund performer: Polen Growth The average diversified U.S.-stock mutual fund registered a negative 8.2% return for the third quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters Corp. TRI 0.79 % ’s Lipper unit—making the year-to-date decline 5.9%.\nIt was only the second decline in the past 13 quarters for U.S.-stock funds. (See quarter-by-quarter chart with the Winners’ Circle article here. )\nInternational-stock funds did worse, as a group, with a 10.1% decline for the quarter, pushing the year-to-date decline to 4.7%.\nThe culprit for most of the month, of course, was the economic slowdown in China, which has spooked investors about the outlook for global growth. Investors also are waiting for the Federal Reserve to begin raising short-term interest rates from near zero.\nAhead of the expected Fed action, bond funds have idled. Funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt, the most commonly held type, were up 0.5% in the quarter, accounting for virtually all of the gain for 2015.\nENLARGE Investors pulled out a net $50.31 billion from U.S.-stock funds in the quarter, according to fund-flow estimates from the Investment Company Institute, and they withdrew a net $46.18 billion from bond funds.\nWhere did the money go? To foreign stocks and the fund equivalent of “under the mattress”—money-market funds. Investors put a net $30.67 billion into international-stock funds, and shoveled $56.62 billion into money funds in the quarter.\nFinra’s ‘smart’ comments Smart-beta funds are hot. The selling point for these alternative index funds is that they don’t weight stocks on market value like a regular index fund, but on other factors such as earnings or volatility.\nBut the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority warned in an investor alert in September that while there are potential advantages, “Be smart when evaluating smart beta products. Such products are by no means guaranteed to outperform more traditional index products.” Finra said that investors should consider, among other things, a smart-beta investment’s cost, sector exposure and trading liquidity.\nThis quarter’s Investing in Funds & ETFs report has more on smart beta, in our articles about Goldman’s first ETF and what investors should know about smart beta .\nMr. Power is a Wall Street Journal news editor in South Brunswick, N.J.
