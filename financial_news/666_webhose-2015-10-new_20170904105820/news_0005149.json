From there, the idea of ordinary people pooling their money to offer each other small loans spread. Credit unions opened in record numbers during the Great Depression, and credit union membership swelled to historic highs during the recent worldwide recession. \nSo why do people flock to credit unions when other financial institutions falter? \nBecause as not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions exist to solve a very specific problemconnecting ordinary people with good, affordable financial services. Credit unions also are governed by and for the people they serve. So they avoid the risky, speculative practices that regularly sink other financial institutions, thus they've been historically stable and safe. \nThe very first credit union served a small group of urban workers in Germany who were fed up with banks turning them down, and loan sharks taking advantage of them. A financial institution created just for them not only provided them a way to break a vicious cycle of debt. It showed them, for the first time, a path to prosperity. \nThis is why on the third Thursday of every October, credit unions celebrate International Credit Union Day (ICU Day)to highlight what makes them special. Because 165 years after the first credit union opened, too many people still feel like they have nowhere to turn for financial help. A majority of Americans, in fact, are losing sleep over money worries , despite the economy doing better than it has in years. \nWhether people are trying to save more, pay off debt, or take out a small loan, it can feel like no one is on their side. Banks, debt-relief vendors, credit card companiesthey all put profit before people. \nCredit unions, on the other hand, offer the same services as banks and other financial institutions, but always put people first. One reason is they have to, because it's baked into the Federal Credit Union Act that a credit union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative formed \"for the purpose of promoting thrift among its members and creating a source of credit for provident or productive purposes,\" to serve \"individuals of modest means.\" \nBut even beyond the legal definition, all credit unions operate according to a set of cooperative principlessuch as concern for the community and financial educationand those principles are part of their culture. It's what's called \"the credit union difference,\" and at its heart is the credit union philosophy of \"People Helping People,\" which just so happens to be this year's ICU Day theme. \nSo on Oct. 15, wish someone a \"Happy International Credit Union Day,\" and invite them to join a movement that's 200 million people strong worldwide, 165-years-old, and just getting started.
