After consulting with advisers at restructuring firm Begbies Traynor (LSE: BEG.L - news ) , Mr Andrew filed a notice of administration in a court in Leeds on Thursday afternoon. \nHowever, he alleges that overnight Sports Direct, of which Mr Ashley is deputy chairman, filed wind-up proceedings to “gazump” Begbies Traynor’s appointment in favour of doing a pre-pack deal with its own firm of administrators. \nMr Andrew alleges that Sports Direct also removed him from Direct Golf’s as a director, without informing him. \nFurthermore, the former golf professional claims that while he was consulting with his lawyers in Manchester, Sports Direct had changed the locks on Direct Golf’s head offices in Milnsbridge, Huddersfield forcing 180 staff to leave the premises. \nMr Andrew said that Sports Direct’s actions were unfounded as he personally owned the building rather than Direct Golf. \n“We thought that Sports Direct had sent us letters of support but they have done the opposite. The only thing I knew was when I got a phonecall saying there were four burly men at my offices changing our locks. Our staff are so upset and ashen-faced. \n“The police have been called. Personally I feel a bit scared. \n“We are being intimidated as Sports Direct is trying to take control of the company from under our feet.\" \nSports Direct is understood to be hoping to put Direct Golf into a pre-pack administration, according to sources. \n“They have played a game of chess with our business,\" said Mr Andrew. \"I have tried to negotiate with them.” \nMr Andrew added that he had offered to hand Sports Direct a majority stake in the company and £1.8m worth of property assets in return for continued financial support. \nIn February this year, Mr Andrew, who has run Direct Golf for 23 years, was quoted in Retail Week as saying: “The opportunities with Sports Direct group are endless and being close to such a successful retailer fills me with great excitement”. \nSports Direct declined to comment. \nEarlier this week the sportswear giant seized a 19pc stake in Findel (LSE: FDL.L - news ) in a move analysts believe is designed to disrupt the sale of its Kitbag business (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:10:49.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
