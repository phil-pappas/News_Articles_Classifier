Every time I see their eyes light after a transaction – either paying-in or receiving money, I feel an inner sense of satisfaction”, says 29-year-old Seth a graduate of the Accra Polytechnic. \nWith GHS 200 as seed capital, Seth signed on as a Tigo Cash Agent in September 2011, while serving his obligatory national service duty at a private hospital in Accra. \nHe recollects, the early days were very difficult; business was slow and customers didn’t understand how the Tigo Cash platform operated so were not confident of doing large transactions. \n“Trust was a big concern to my customers, it took some effort to educate them on Tigo Cash and the various security measures put in place to ensure a safe and secured transaction. \nOver the years, however, I have developed a relationship with them and this includes my other colleagues who are also petty traders here. I have built credibility and confidence around my business by making prompt payments every time they come in to transfer or receive money”, he explained. \nHe does 200 individual transactions daily and his capital has increased to GHS 45,000; he employs eight others who are bread winners in their respective families and hopes to expand to rural Ghana as a Tigo Cash agent. \nIn this interview, it became apparent that Seth was passionate and committed to his business. “When I started this job, my friends advised me to rather look for a white-collar job, they didn’t think I would be able to make enough money to make ends meet. I persisted and continued to develop a relationship with my customers and now it is paying off”, he revealed. \nIn January 2015, Seth’s handiwork paid off. He was among several others who were acknowledged for their contributions to Tigo Cash. For his prize as one of the top winners, he took home a sleek brand new Hyundai i10 vehicle and five Tigo Cash branded kiosks. \nSeth is a role model in his family and community and an advocate for Tigo Cash. Tigo cash provides employment for over 7,000 Ghanaians across the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:53:41.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
