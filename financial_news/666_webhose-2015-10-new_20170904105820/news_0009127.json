Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) general secretary Katishi Masemola said a settlement of 8.25% was reached on Tuesday evening. \"We are satisfied with this. It is an improvement from what the company was initially offering,\" he said. Fawu demanded a 12.5% wage increase and a profit-sharing scheme for workers. The company was offering 7.5% and other increased benefits. Masemola said workers presented with the offer on Wednesday morning \"overwhelmingly accepted\". \"They will also be given a R500 'sweetener'. This is a victory for us,\" he added. CFG had been engaging with the union in annual wage negotiations since July. About two weeks after the start of the strike, one of the company's buildings was gutted in a blaze. Three people were arrested for arson. Fawu denied any involvement in the incident. Another CFG building was razed last Thursday after being set alight. The union said it \"hoped no members [were] involved\". CFG indicated they would respond in a statement.
