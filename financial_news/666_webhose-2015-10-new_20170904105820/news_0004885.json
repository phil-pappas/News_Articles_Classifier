Overall volumes held up is discounters were included, the company said, but at lower prices. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) meant Weetabix’s total turnover in 2014 was £352m, down 4pc on the previous year. Profit before tax was £109m, down nearly 7pc. \nThe directors of Weetabix said: “2014 was a year of significant upheaval in the UK cereal market. This made life very difficult for us as a business.” \nThe company said the shift in away from the big weekly shop had also “disadvantaged our historical business model”, but that it was pleased with its performance against the challenges. \nWeetabix remained Britain’s most popular cereal brand, with a total market share of 14.5pc, up slightly year-on-year. \nThe company’s other cereals and snacks had a more difficult year. Alpen porridge and Ready Brek both lost market share in what was anyway a “relatively subdued hot cereal segment”, for instance. \nAs well as facing new shopping habits, Weetabix said it was attempting to adjust to shifting demands at breakfast. The company said fewer consumers had time for a “formal breakfast” and that more were looking for on-the-go options. \n“This has not been a focus of the company historically and it has therefore required a change in emphasis in our innovation programmes,” Weetabix said. \nThe company has invested in new breakfast bars and biscuits, but not all have succeeded. It cut back its participation on the breakfast biscuits market after identifying a slowdown and “general over-supply of product”. \nVideo: How Weetabix is made", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:39:08.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
