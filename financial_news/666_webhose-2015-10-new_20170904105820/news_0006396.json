Some analysts say official figures overstate growth and the true rate might be as low as 4 percent.\nCommunist leaders say they will accept growth below their official target of \"about 7 percent\" so long as the economy generates enough new jobs.\n\"We never said we would defend a certain point to the death, but instead let the economy run within a reasonable range,\" said the top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, at a weekend gathering of officials, according to a summary on the Cabinet's website.\nBank of America and other forecasters say they expect the 2016-2020 plan to lower the official growth target to 6.5 percent or less.\nAnalysts also expect the upcoming plan to increase the ruling party's focus on environmental and social goals including raising household incomes and encouraging more use of renewable energy.\nReform advocates say the party needs to move faster on carrying out pledges to give entrepreneurs and market forces a bigger role. That will require cutting back the monopolies and other privileges of state companies that dominate industries from oil to banking to telecoms.\nAn outline for state industry reform issued in September promises to make government companies more efficient by forcing them to face more free-market competition while retaining the party's dominance in the economy.\nBut rather than reducing the party's role, that plan says Beijing will \"strengthen party leadership\" of state companies.\nReform advocates criticized the September plan as inadequate because it fails to address issues including curtailing monopolies and access to low-cost credit, land and other resources.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
