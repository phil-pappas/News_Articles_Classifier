The positive outlook on its Baa3 rating reflects our view that the relatively resilient growth and the policy reform momentum will slowly stabilise inflation, improve the regulatory environment, increase infrastructure investment and lower government debt ratios,\" it said. \nIn the report titled 'Baa-rated Sovereigns: Diverging Resilience to Developing Global Risks', Moody's believes the main external risk facing EMs is the potential for a prolonged risk aversion, prompted by hopes of normalisation of US monetary policy and possibility of a sharper-than-expected China slowdown. \nIt also talks of country-specific challenges exacerbating this external risk. \n\"In contrast, we forecast strong growth in India of around 7-7.5 per cent per year in 2015-16, the highest among the G20 economies, which is supported by lower oil prices that will reinforce gradual growth-enhancing reforms,\" it said. \nMoody's said although India, South Africa and Brazil have weaker fiscal positions than Turkey and Indonesia, these governments are less reliant on foreign currency and non-resident funding (government external debt). \nThe rating agency made a special mention of India's significant monetary tightening in 2013, coupled with some fiscal consolidation, which is \"an example of effective macroeconomic management that restored macroeconomic stability, albeit at the expense of near-term growth\". \n\"However, coupled with structural reforms to address regulatory and infrastructure weaknesses, lower inflation and current account deficit outcomes have set the pace for monetary loosening which commenced in 2015. This active policy response to counter emerging risks contributed to the positive outlook,\" it said. . \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:39:58.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
