AAP And while the government is committed to keeping the tax take as a proportion of the economy capped at the peak 23.6 per cent reached during the Howard years, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann asked the participants for their views on how high the tax-to-GDP ratio should be. Senator Cormann also pointed out that Paul Keating had reduced spending to less than 24 per cent of GDP and the average under John Howard was 24 per cent..\nThere were differing views on the tax and spending ratios, as there were on the need to lift the GST with the ACTU and the Australian Council of Social Services still opposed and groups such as the Business Council of Australia in favour. The Turnbull government is not ruling out a GST increase as it continues the tax white paper process started by Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey.\nIt will take to the election tax increases designed to fund cuts to other taxes, such as personal income tax and company income tax, and stimulate economic growth.\nThe summit sat as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for Australia's medium term growth and warned that growth will slow to an annual rate of 2.8 per cent by the end of the decade.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull depart question time at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 14 September 2015.

The measure had been twice rejected by the Senate and was set to be rejected a a third time.\nMr Abbott overshadowed the summit with his second extensive radio interview this week in which he sought to define and defend his legacy.\nHe criticised the decision to ditch university deregulation as inconsistent with the talk of the need for reform and spending cuts by Mr Turnbull and Scott Morrison.\n\"Given the realities of the situation in the Senate, I can understand it,\" he said.\nBut he defended the policy, saying the higher education reforms were the centrepiece of a \"gutsy\" 2014 budget, which \"was exactly what our country needed from a new, innovative and reforming government\".\nMr Abbott said the university sector should be able to stand on its own two feet. \"The last people that need to be nannied are universities.\"\nMr Abbott had ruled out touching superannuation taxes so he could differentiate the government from Labor, which has announced a policy to trim concessions at the very high end.\nBut they are now firmly back on the table with the summiteers, apart from Liberal think tank the Menzies Research Centre, agreeing they needed to be looked to make sure they helped people save for retirement, not create wealth.\nThe Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia urged caution in going after super taxes.\n\"A discussion around the equity and sustainability of superannuation tax concessions is both welcome and necessary, but it is also crucial that conversations and decision-making take place in the context of accurate information,\" said chief executive Pauline Vamos.\n\"There have been a number of incorrect claims made regarding the cost and distribution of superannuation tax concessions.\n\"In reality, superannuation is boosting incomes and lifestyle standards in retirement at a relatively low cost to government expenditure. When both super tax concessions and availability of the age pension are taken into account, government assistance for retirement income is broadly equitable across the range of incomes in the community.\"\nAustralian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell said there was agreement that the states needed to be brought into the process because so much of the agenda, whether if be the GST, inefficient taxes like stamp duties, or skill and the TAFE sector, was under their control.\n\"Many of the issues we talked about are not about federal government policy at all, they are state issues, and so the state governments need desperately to be part of the buy-in here,\" she said.\nThere was also a strong emphasis on getting more people into work, especially women, older people and the long-term unemployed, and developing closer ties between business and universities.\n\"We know that there are a lot of young people and not-so-young people out there that desperately want a job, and we know there are lots of businesses who would like to employ them,\" she said.\n\"We've got to bring that together and we think we can do that, in fact, we think we can do that inside current budget approaches.\"\nThe meeting was attended by Mr Turnbull and eight of his minsters, three senior public servants and Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens.\nParticipants said afterwards the atmosphere of the meeting was extremely positive and it was as though a cloak had been lifted following the removal of Mr Abbott.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:13:10.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
