Pat Quinn makes a stop at a central Illinois event \nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 10/2/15 1:43 pm EDT - Updated: 10/2/15 1:43 pm EDT \nCHAMPAIGN, Illinois â€” Former Gov. Pat Quinn has made a public appearance in central Illinois, saying he still believes an income tax increase is needed to cover expenses and end the budget stalemate. \nThe (Champaign) News-Gazette ( http://bit.ly/1FLx32Z ) reports the Chicago Democrat spoke Thursday at an event celebrating the opening of the University of Illinois' Center for Wounded Veterans in Higher Education. \nQuinn lost re-election last year. He says he's not running for office. He wants to volunteer and address consumer issues. \nQuinn pushed for an extension of the 2011 temporary income tax increase while in office. It rolled back in January. \nHe says Gov. Bruce Rauner should \"step forward\" and end the stalemate. \nA Rauner spokeswoman says Illinois has already seen what happens when a governor approves a tax hike without other reforms. \nInformation from: The News-Gazette, http://www.news-gazette.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:05.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
