But that's precisely what his team within Morgan Stanley Investment Management's (MSIM) global equities department sets out to do each day: invest in quality companies of the highest order.\nAnd the fund's definition of quality is a lot tougher than most. No Australian company makes the grade, nor does the world's most successful brand, Apple.\nSo what is quality in their book?\n\"We only want to invest in companies which have a very high return on un-levered capital which we believe will remain high over time with secular changes and across cycles,\" says the portfolio manager.\n\"We own no utilities, materials, energy, telecoms and real financials. These guys are cyclical low-return, highly levered, price-takers.\"\nMSIM's Global Quality and Global Franchise funds account half of the $US36 billion ($50 billion) of equity assets under management and are dedicated to investing in companies with \"strong intangible assets\" and with management teams that \"don't stuff things up\".\nConsumer staples This has led the fund to sectors such as consumer staples and consumer discretionary, where brands have invested decades worth of marketing, pharmaceuticals and some industrials, and even media companies.\n The fund will also invest in certain networks businesses where \"everyone uses it because everyone uses it\". But the most important and ubiquitous characteristic of the companies it owns is \"pricing power\".\n\"When times are tough, you've got recurring revenues; your volumes don't disappear but your price is more robust.\"\nThe two largest weights in Australia's market – banks and miners – are the antithesis of quality.\n\"Nestlé grew at 4 per cent and margins increased 10 basis points [during the financial crisis]. Not many banks pulled that off. And its share-count was the same at the end of the year.\"\nAnd miners are no better in his mind.\n\"It's not that the demand for iron ore collapsed [recently]. The amount being consumed has actually gone up. It's just the price has gone down by a factor of three. If you're selling things with pricing power, that doesn't happen to you.\"\nIn seeking quality companies, the fund looks for investments with moderate but steady earnings growth coupled with the ability to maintain or grow trading margins, allowing them to harness the power of compounding.\nPlenty of things to worry about The strategy, Paulson readily acknowledges \"is not complicated\" but it's not easy either, as \"you have to worry about which franchise is under threat or being eroded or if management is stuffing it up\".\nSince inception in 1996, the Global Franchise fund has delivered annual returns of 14.54 per cent against 6.28 per cent for the MSCI World Index – a substantial outperformance by any measure. Its success is more of an indictment of the way the market works, which means it doesn't appreciate the \"quality\" inherent in these businesses.\n\"The market is short-term, relative focused and it's fixated on earnings not cash.\"\nA look inside the fund's portfolio reveals some familiar names. Nestlé is the largest holding, followed by British American Tobacco and Reckitt Benckiser, which produces a range of well-known cleaning products. US media giants Time Warner and Walt Disney are large holdings as is Microsoft, Visa, Mondelez (previously known as Kraft Foods and Cadbury's) and IT services firm Accenture.\nQuality isn't always a popularity contest. Tobacco, Paulson says is an industry with \"wonderful pricing power\" although it does offer a smoke-free version of its portfolio to investors.\nAnother company with quality attributes is credit rating agency Moody's (although the fund does not appear to own it). The rating agencies were key accomplices in causing the financial crisis, but ironically have been one of the key beneficiaries in the aftermath as barriers to entry have increased while a shift from banks to the bond market has resulted in a flow of new rating jobs.\nSurprising omissions There are some surprising omissions. Apple may be one of the great brands, but Paulson says the fund can't get comfortable that the tech giant's some $US50 billion profits are sustainable.\nWhile Apple controls a modest 13 per cent of the smart phone market, its profits represent 2 per cent of the entire MSCI World Index profits, a stat that makes Paulson uneasy.\n\"When was the last time someone bought a laptop just because it had a cool new feature? People used to do that, but laptops are good enough now. Their position should be more robust than Nokia and Motorola, but that's a worry.\"\nInvestors in the fund would be glad to know that despite the ubiquity of German automaker Volkswagen's brand it didn't appear to enter the fund's universe, even before its emissions-cheating scandal emerged.\nVW is a car company, which means \"low volatile margins and massive capital intensity\".\n\"It's an industry with overcapacity because you have national champions. The other problem is: will a car be anything like its current form in 10 years? This is an issue for auto insurance too. I'm not sure they're on the front of innovation.\"\nInnovation a constant threat In fact, innovation is a constant threat to brands and businesses with purchasing power, and the sharemarket premiums of these quality businesses.\n\"Nature abhors a vacuum, business abhors a high margin, so you always have to worry about threats,\" Paulson says.\nOne evident threat is the power of social media in allowing upstarts to challenge the megabrands by reaching consumers directly in a targeted and localised way.\nPaulson says the \"old world\" model of a big brand running a global advertising campaign just doesn't work any more.\n\"Our focus in staples sector is in tech- and social-media-savvy companies, but also those where the back is completely centralised, so the centre is efficient but the front is localised and run by entrepreneurs.\"\nAmong the finest at social media marketing is Nike, the US sportswear manufacturer. And the stock has had a stellar run, suggesting their social media smarts are translating into dollars. But Paulson is paid to worry and his fear around Nike is that the \"ath-leisure\" fashion trend that has propelled its sales may fade.\nAs he told a sales assistant, and fellow shareholder, on the floor of its flagship New York store: \"If we got the point where everyone coming in here was buying stuff to exercise in, then we'd be screwed!\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-26T09:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:02:49.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
