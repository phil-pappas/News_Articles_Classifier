He alleges that managers at PIMCO plotted to drive him out of the company he co-founded in 1971 in a manner that would allow them to divvy his bonus payments among themselves. \nThe dollar amount is large and the headlines huge, but the case has implications for regular employees much smaller incentive-compensation arrangements -- from bonuses to stock awards -- and get fired or resign for another position. \n\"Bill Gross's situation is different because he has resources, but most employees in this situation would find themselves waging war against an entity that is much better equipped,\" said Thomas Greene, a partner specializing in executive compensation at Holland & Knight in Boston. \nGross left PIMCO on Sept. 26, 2014, just days before the end of the third quarter -- one of the four periods each year in which bonuses were paid -- and announced he was going to Janus Capital . Typically, bonuses were larger near the end of the year. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:45:15.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
