It’s common for first time buyers to make sacrifices to buy their first home, so with price rises in recent years outstripping income growth, more are choosing to bypass rising prices by looking further for cheaper areas.\" \nTenants in the south of England tend to move furthest to get onto the housing ladder. This is where the chasm between where people can afford to rent and buy is largest and has widened the most since 2012. \nIn London and the South East house prices have increased 42pc since 2012, while rents have only climbed by 19pc. \nThis is a long-standing London trend as young families seek to establish the family home in locations that can offer all of the amenities they expect; a garden, good schools and a community feel that isn't always easy in inner London,\" says Adam Challis,\" head of residential reseacr at JLL. \"The trend relies on the next generation of young professionals to continue to be able to afford to rent in these inner London locations. Increasingly, they are competing for the same locations and even properties as affordability pressures place limits on where young professionals can live.\" \nAnd fears continue to grow from economic bodies and property agents that many young families and professionals will no longer be able to live and work in London . \nRussell Quirk, founder of online agent eMoov, said: \"This does not bode well for London as whilst it is woefully short of supply of property, an upward tweak to interest rates, another cross rail type travel link (Crossrail 2 for instance) could also dampen demand further. Will we even eventually see London as a place that people work but they don’t live .\" \nAcross the country, renters who bought a home in the last year, did so in locations where the average house price was £35,000 lower than where they were renting. \nFurther north, however, tenants tend to be less constrained by affordability due to cheaper house prices. Tenants buying in the North East, North West and Yorkshire, tend to buy in similarly priced areas to where they are renting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:59:45.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
