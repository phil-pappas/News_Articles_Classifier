But an even bigger problem is systematic looting by these youthful factions. Masquerading as true believers, Islamic State is acting like a criminal syndicate, promoting illicit excavation to monetize the heritage of the region. With no concerted plan of action to protect terrain increasingly pockmarked by holes and trenches where once there were artifacts, an overwhelming sense of powerlessness has set in everywhere—among government officials, archaeologists and members of the public.\nThere is, however, some good news. Earlier this month the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), a professional body representing the leading art museums in North America, issued “Protocols for Safe Havens for Works of Cultural Significance from Countries in Crisis.” The protocols offer museums a framework to provide shelter for works of art at risk owing to “war, terrorism or natural disasters,” a definition that includes Islamic State-looted objects. Owners of works at risk can request safe haven at an AAMD member museum. In turn, museums will not seek permanent title or ownership, but instead act as temporary stewards. Once a conflict-related or natural threat has waned sufficiently in the afflicted area, the works will be returned.\nThe protocols are a major step. They mean that, for the first time, American museums are taking an active role in protecting cultural heritage under threat from Islamic State.\nAlthough international efforts to document and rescue heritage at risk are not new, the advent of the Internet has made them more far-reaching and effective by introducing illustrated, searchable, web-based documentation that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. So while looters have been using the web to market their ill-gotten gains, stewards of cultural heritage have been using it to warn about threats and retrieve lost works.\nBeginning in 2000, the Paris-based International Council of Museums (ICOM) developed web-based Red Lists identifying those categories of archaeological material and ancient art most in jeopardy. The surveys, which are updated regularly, began with African objects and now include heritage at risk in Iraq and Syria.\nThe demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in 2001 was the most dramatic example of a wave of iconoclasm in Afghanistan that left no museum immune from looting. In response, ICOM published a Red List for Afghan cultural heritage in association with the British Museum. Over the next several years, British Customs seized over 2,300 objects smuggled from Afghanistan into Britain. Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum, had these works placed on temporary deposit at his institution. All of the rescued works were returned to Kabul by British authorities between 2009 and 2012.\nAAMD took notice of these developments abroad. Beginning in 2007, members of its Task Force on Archaeological Materials & Ancient Art met with multiple stakeholders, including Italy’s Minister of Culture Francesco Rutelli, the State Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, and officers of the Archaeological Institute of America, the largest representative body of U.S. archaeologists. AAMD’s goal was straightforward—agreeing on the fate of displaced antiquities—but the challenges were formidable. For some archaeologists, any works dislodged from their original “findspot,” or excavated context, are so compromised as to be of marginal value. For others, an effort by museums to offer protection for undocumented artifacts seemed fraught with conflicts of interest among collectors serving on museum boards. For government officials, the lack of alignment among provisions in international treaties and national patrimony statutes offered no clear path. The most comprehensive international effort to date was the 1970 Unesco “Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property,” which nonetheless offered only partial solutions to the problem of looting.\nA two-part compromise was announced by AAMD in June 2008. First, AAMD adopted a “bright line” of 1970, whereby only under exceptional circumstances could museums accept for deposit works lacking compelling evidence that an object had left its nation of modern discovery before that date.\nThe second part of the compromise was to obligate every member museum to absolute transparency when invoking an exception to the 1970 “bright line.” The Indianapolis Museum of Art was tasked in 2008 with building and maintaining an online AAMD Object Registry to document any acquisitions lacking provenance, or ownership history, prior to 1970, along with an explicit justification for each.\nToday, the Object Registry includes a searchable illustrated database of over 900 antiquities, facilitating claims by third parties and direct communication with the relevant museum should any work or works appear likely to pertain to a compromised site, monument, or museum.\nSimilarly, all objects put on deposit in museums under the protocols will be thoroughly documented on the AAMD Object Registry, and the information will be publicly available.\nThe protocols are admittedly only a downstream barrier to the flood of artifacts being shipped out of Syria and Iraq every day. But they are a start.\nMr. Anderson is the former chairman of the Association of Art Museum Directors’ Task Force on Archaeological Materials & Ancient Art.
