At the moment, we find it difficult to obtain loans, which is causing the nosedive of businesses and the inherent impoverishing of operators. \nTo save the situation, he said, \"This industry needs government's intervention too. If the aviation, entertainment and agric. sectors could secure government loans why can't the courier operators. It is certain that we carry the image of the nation. Entertainment is about make believe, but courier is about playing middle role between businesses and that can define the integrity of the country. We deliver confidential items. So, we need funds to retool\". \nOn the e-commerce deliveries, Mrs. Omolara Okuneye-Oyeyemi, ANCO's vice president said, though they are still studying the nitty-gritty of e-commerce operations, it is critical that banks give out loans to courier operators. \nOkuneye-Oyeyemi, said, \"Even as an economy, we have not really taken our time to study the fundamentals of e-commerce. There is need to gain experiences from the economies that have been on it for decades. Same time, our culture towards business is usually different from the outside world. \n\"Secondly, to engage in e-commerce delivery is capital intensive. You must have a large fleet of motorcycles and vehicles on ground, because the deliveries are at beck and calls and must be swiftly delivered. For instance, if the company has many shipments for delivery and maybe you have seven bikes on the go, while they require you pick-up items on the immediate, if you fail, they will ditch you and sign on another operator.
