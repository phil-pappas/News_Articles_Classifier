Photo: Nic Walker\nThe corporate watchdog has raised concerns over debt collection letters that National Australia Bank sent to borrowers who were failing to repay loans, saying the bank may have misled customers over the threats they faced.\nThe letters suggested customers may be visited by debt collectors at their home, or that the banks might take other legal action to get its money back, when in most cases this was actually unlikely or might only occur at a later date, the watchdog said on Monday.\nWhile NAB's processes have since been changed, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said NAB had previously sent debt collection letters under the letterheads, \"Fairhalsen Collections\" and \"Brunswick Collections Services.\"\nNAB had sent letters saying debt collectors might visit customers, but this was unlikely in most cases.\nASIC said this may have given people the impression that bank had outsourced or escalated a debt, whereas in fact these entities were part of NAB. This was only disclosed in the fine print at the bottom of the page, ASIC said.\nAdvertisement As well, ASIC said some of NAB's debt collection letters told borrowers they might face legal action that could leave them bankrupt; that the bank might send out debt collectors; or that the bank might use any legal action necessary to collect the money.\n\"In fact, for the majority of recipients, such action was either unlikely or would only be considered at a later stage in the collection process,\" the regulator said.\nThe bank has since removed references to \"Fairhalsen Collections\" and \"Brunswick Collections Services\" in its letters, and it now only refers to legal action, a visit from debt collectors or bankruptcy if this is likely. ASIC said NAB had cooperated in the matter.\nASIC deputy chair Peter Kell said creditors must not make legal threats such as this if they were not possible, under consideration or intended.\n\"Creditors and collectors are entitled to accurately explain the consequences of non-payment of a debt, but the consequences must not be misrepresented or overstated,\" Mr Kell said in a statement.\nA NAB spokesman said the bank had worked with ASIC to change the letters sent from its debt collection department.\n\"NAB had already begun work to review collections processes when first contacted by ASIC. Letters sent from our NAB business no longer contain any reference to Brunswick Collections Services or Fairhalsen Collections - the two divisions we previously referred to,\" the spokesman said.\n\"It is important that our customers experiencing any trouble that may impact their ability to make repayments, contact NAB as soon as possible so we can help them. It is equally important that customers in these situations are clear about who they need to contact, which our letters now make absolutely clear.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:43:22.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
