Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Misa Han Laura Woods is only 18 but she's already nailed a key advantage of doing business in the so-called collaborative economy â€“ people will do things for free.\nWhen she's not studying for her high school certificate, Woods runs Dalliance, an online fashion magazine. She fell into online publishing almost by accident. While reading and commenting on fashion blogs on Tumblr she met her business partner Jasmine Gill. Together they decided to create their publication, which features fashion photography, interviews with models and stories about online fashion store founders. Woods was 15 at the time.\n\"Obviously my dream is to work in the fashion industry, and it's such a competitive industry. I wanted a way to get into it and give me an edge,\" Woods says.\nHer publishing venture is not a product of massive capital investment. Woods collaborates with photographers, models, fashion brands and modelling agencies, including beach lifestyle brand Amuse Society at no cost to the business. In return they get free exposure.\n\"Pretty much the only cost is the domain name and sending back the clothes that I loan. We work alongside other young people so they give us their services like modelling and photography for free. Photographers are happy to do it for free because they get to be creative and we give them exposure through the magazine,\" she says.\nAfter finishing her high school certificate, she hopes Dalliance will make money through affiliate marketing and exclusive content for subscribers. But money is not her main reason for working on the fashion magazine. Instead, she sees it as a launch pad for her fashion career.\n\"I'm using the magazine to get into the industry. I would love to start a PR agency, I want to start an online store. This is just the starting point,\" Woods says.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:10:08.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
