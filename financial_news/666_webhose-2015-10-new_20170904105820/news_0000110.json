GM 2.98 % has long reigned as the U.S. auto industry’s biggest player. Chief Executive Mary Barra plans to tell Wall Street that her company is the smartest.\nThe 53-year-old executive spent her initial 20 months at the helm steering through a costly safety crisis and responding to investor demands for share buybacks. Still, the company’s stock is sputtering and, at $29.66 Wednesday afternoon, is trading below the 2010 initial public offering price of $33 and 26% lower than the price when Ms. Barra took over.\nRelated GM’s Barra Says Company Focus is Unwavering GM’s Barra on How GM Cultivates Women Employees GM, Navistar Team Up on Medium-Duty Trucks Ms. Barra believes the stock is undervalued, and her aim is to shift focus at an annual investor conference Thursday by laying a set of building blocks ranging from electrification to vehicle autonomy that will prepare GM for the future. For instance, she says the value of GM’s access to data, through the OnStar telematics service and connecting buyers to 4G wireless Internet, isn't yet fully comprehended by those watching the auto maker.\n“There is a lack of understanding of all that we’re doing,” Ms. Barra said in an interview Thursday at the company’s vehicle-proving grounds in metro Detroit. “There is a lack of understanding of the importance of the embedded connectivity (and) the value of the data in the car that we control.”\nGM has spent billions of dollars on creating connected cars, and the results are hitting the market. In the first three days of June, Ms. Barra said, GM sold more cars with 4G wireless Internet access than the rest of the market combined delivered over the first six months of the year. Next year, the Cadillac CTS will become the first vehicle with technology capable of talking to other cars on the road via vehicle-to-vehicle technology.\nStill, auto companies like Uber Technologies, Mobileye MBLY 4.22 % NV and Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA 0.71 % generally trade at far higher multiples relative to revenue. Google Inc. GOOG 2.26 % and Apple Inc., AAPL 1.14 % meanwhile, are seen as potentially disrupting segments of the car-technology race that GM has been active in for decades.\nAnalysts have noted GM’s position both in the current market, where its stable of trucks and SUVs allow it to reap big profits during a U.S. auto boom, and for the future.\n“While we think GM deserves more credit than it receives, it’s not clear that there is much GM can say which will significantly improve investor sentiment over the near term,” Barclays BCS 1.37 % analyst Brian Johnson said in a recent note.\nMs. Barra’s management team continues to streamline the business and look for new opportunities. On Wednesday, for instance, GM announced a truck-development agreement with Navistar International Inc. NAV 1.35 % ; last week, the company’s international chief said he is looking for ways to potentially scale back capacity in Korea, where rising labor costs are clouding the business case.\nBut GM has been shifting the business around for years. What’s new for Ms. Barra is a focus on “expanding our relationship (with customers) beyond the car.” Expect the Detroit company to announce more experiments in the months to come, including ride-sharing ventures in the U.S. and China.\n“Lyft and Uber don’t have information about the vehicle, just about the driver of the vehicle,” GM’s connectivity czar, Phil Abram, said. “They don’t know anything about the operational aspects of the vehicle. They don’t know where it’s at if the driver isn’t in the vehicle.”\nGM launched OnStar two decades ago, and counts seven million people among its paid-user base. Often criticized for being underused, Ms. Barra has charged executives like Mr. Abram to use the data to prepare the company for an era where younger drivers will expect cars to do everything from drive themselves to enable ride sharing.\n“The core features and capability of autonomous driving you can’t do without connectivity,” Mr. Abram said, noting vehicles have to be in a network to gain understanding. “We have as much experience [updating vehicles in real-time] as anyone, because we’ve been doing it for so long.”\nMs. Barra’s futuristic focus comes as more immediate concerns clutter here desk. A big challenge is reviving Cadillac with a $12 billion investment aimed at upgrading the portfolio and boosting its appeal in the U.S. and China, two markets where Audi AG NSU -1.25 % , Daimler AG DDAIY 1.96 % and BMW AG BMW 3.73 % dominate.\nAnother agenda item is gaining a foothold in India , a country where GM has a tiny presence but predicts volumes will balloon through 2025, leading the nation to become the No. 3 car market in the world. GM is investing $5 billion with its Chinese partner to create an emerging-markets car portfolio that better matches Indian tastes.\nMs. Barra says GM’s size and scale will help it. In two meetings with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she’s become convinced the government will push higher safety standards for automobiles. GM can potentially meet those standards faster than smaller players, such as Maruti Suzuki or Tata.\nWrite to Gautham Nagesh at gautham.nagesh@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.14/require.min.js", "http://fonts.wsj.net/HCo_Whitney/font_HCo_Whitney.css"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:54:55.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
