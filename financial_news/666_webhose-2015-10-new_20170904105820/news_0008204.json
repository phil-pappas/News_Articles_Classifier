Both men were Chilean citizens living in Santiago, the lawsuit said.\nThe SEC subsequently obtained a court order freezing $42.8 million of Bilbao's and Somerton's assets.\nLawyers for Bilbao and Hurtado did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Bilbao et al., U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cv-10036.
