The study met its primary endpoint as Cosentyx demonstrated a 20% reduction in the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20) at the end of week 24. The study showed that treatment with Cosentyx resulted in rapid and significant clinical improvements versus placebo.\nMoreover, Cosentyx met all secondary endpoints, including improvements in skin and joint diseases, and joint structural damage progression. It was seen that approximately half of the patients in both Cosentyx-treated dose groups (150-mg and 75-mg) achieved an ACR 20 response as compared to only 17.3% in the placebo arm.\nWe remind investors that Cosentyx (at a dose of 300 mg) was approved in Europe as a first-line systemic treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients in Jan 2015. The drug was also approved in the U.S. as a treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy (light therapy).\nNovartis made regulatory submissions across the world for the indication of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost its growth prospects.\nWe also note that Novartis had undertaken a series of actions to reorganize its portfolio in 2014 in order to focus on its core businesses of pharmaceuticals, eye care and generics. However, Novartis is expected to face headwinds this year in the form of generic competition for some products as well as negative currency movement.\nNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked health care stocks are Abbott Laboratories ABT, AbbVie Inc. ABBV and Novo Nordisk A/S NVO. All three carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
