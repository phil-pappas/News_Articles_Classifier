More Equitable Life compensation deadline looms \nConfusion and disappointment are surfacing as hundreds of thousands of people receive forecasts from the government about what they should expect from the new “flat-rate” state pension , billed as more generous by the previous government. \nFrom April 6 next year, a new state pension of about £155 per week will come into force, replacing the current system, which was widely viewed as complex and unfair to certain groups including women and the self-employed. \nBut in the first five years of the new pension, only around a third of those reaching state pension age are estimated to get the full “flat-rate” pension of £155 per week, worth around £8,000 a year. \nBy 2021, those eligible for the full rate will rise to just over 50 per cent, but it will be more than three decades before the state pension is paid to nine in ten retirement savers. System shake out \nThe chief reason why many won’t get the full state pension is due to how the government has dealt with previous periods of contracting out as the old system converts to the new. \nWhat workers “contracted out” of was the system for an additional state pension — now referred to as the state second pension. \nClaer Barrett and guests discuss how the contracting out of the second state pension has affected your retirement pot \nIts origins date back to the late 1970s, with the introduction of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). Replaced by the state second pension in 2002, it was designed to enable higher earners — typically those on final-salary schemes working for big corporates or within the public sector — to build an additional slice of future pensions income. \nContracting out of this entitled them to pay a lower rate of national insurance contributions — with the idea that they would plough more of their take-home pay into a company or private pension plan instead. \nBy the late 1980s, millions of UK workers had contracted out into riskier personal pensions, as the scheme was expanded. \nThe deal was always that contracted out workers would accept a lower state pension, in return for paying less into the system. But the terms of the “contracted out deduction” from their state pension are set by the government — and they keep changing. Millions affected \nOn average, the government estimates that those who contracted out between 1978 and 1997 will receive £55 a week less than the full new state pension — adding up to nearly £3,000 over the course of a year. \nPart of the deal of contracting out was to expect less from the state — in return for putting less in — but it is still coming as a shock to some to see how this will translate into thousands of pounds less state pension over the course of a typical retirement. The loss is all the more galling if private pension plans taken out as an alternative have failed to bridge the difference. \n“The basic problem is that many people were led to believe that they would get the full new state pension,” said Alan Higham, of PensionsChamp.com, a consumer website. \n“Now lots of people are receiving their statements, and seeing the contracting out deduction and it’s not been communicated how it was calculated — they are confused and disappointed and some feel cheated. \n“Many people didn’t even realise they were contracted out.” Confusion reigns \nWhen contracting out was first offered, the new state pension was decades away. The architects of this policy in the last parliament faced the task of weaving this complicated arrangement into the new system, where contracting out will be abolished. \n“The joy of pension reform would have been a blank sheet of paper , but we didn’t have that,” said Steve Webb, former pensions minister. \nUnder the new system, it was decided that anyone who had contracted out — either by their employer when they saved into a company pension or through a personal pension — would have a one-off deduction in 2016 on their new state pension “starting amount” to account for periods when they paid less into the system. \nBut this approach has been difficult to translate into anything vaguely meaningful for the average citizen who hasn’t got a first class maths degree or detailed knowledge of the pension system. \nState pension forecasts are now arriving on doorsteps with no detailed explanation as to how the deductions have been accounted for. Consequently, people are confused and suspicious. \n“The original concept was that we would get rid of the basic state pension, and have a much simpler, more generous state pension but it hasn’t quite worked out like that,” said Malcolm McLean, senior consultant with Barnett Waddingham, the consultants. \n“A lot of people are getting frustrated about the fact they are not getting what they expected to get.” Numbers don’t add up \nExperts say much of the upset is coming from people who have paid more than the maximum required into the system — but still aren’t getting the full new pension because they were contracted out. \nUnder the new system, people will need 35 qualifying years of national insurance contributions or credits (up from the current rate of 30 years) to receive the new state pension in full. \nBut if you have been “contracted out”, even if you have made more than 35 years of qualifying payments, you will still not qualify for the full rate. \n“Many people are suddenly finding that despite the fact they may have paid 35 qualifying years, their starting point for the new state pension is less than the full rate,” added Mr McLean. \n“This is because of the deductions that have been calculated to represent the rebate or reductions in NI contributions.” \nThose struggling to work out why their “starting rate” for the new pension has been reduced may struggle to find a clear answer. “The Department for Work and Pensions recently produced a fact sheet on the state pension changes but the explanations were horrendous,” Mr McLean added. “Trying to convey the rationale behind this is very difficult to do simply.” \nMr McLean believes the former government should have found a fairer way to deal with complications arising from contracted out workers, but he concedes: “That would have cost more money and obviously the government was restricted by what it could do by the Treasury diktat that the state pension reforms should be cost-neutral.” Winners and losers \nWhat is emerging from the fog generated by massive changes to a complex pension system is the fact that some workers will get a better deal than others — in particular older workers with a long history of contracting out. \nRead more \nThese people — typically older workers in the private sector — may have the opportunity to build more state pension before they retire (see case study). This is the case even if they have more than 35 qualifying years of NI contributions — but only if they have spare years before state pension age — currently 63 for women and 65 for men. \n“Everyone who has pre-2016 contributions will have a 2016 starting amount,” explains Mr Webb. “If this is greater than the new flat rate (around £155 per week) then you can’t add to it. If it’s less than £155 then you can.” \nFor each year following April 2016 until an individual hits state pension age, he or she could continue to build extra state pension through credits or contributions, or voluntary contributions in some cases (see case study). \n“This means that people who were contracted out pre-2016 but still work or contribute post-2016 do well out of this transitional arrangement,” adds Mr Webb. \nBy contrast, experts say the position is very different for older workers who didn’t contract out, and spent the bulk of their career paying into the second-tier state pension instead. These people must continue paying full-rate national insurance, but will no longer earn any additional state pension income when they do so. \nYounger workers who have contracted out fare the least well, observes David Robbins, senior consultant with Towers Watson. \n“The changes to the state pension make it less valuable for nearly all young workers, in order to cut future costs,” said Mr Robbins. \n“That’s understandable. But if they need to save money, it is arguably odd to offer a state pension boost to the long-term contracted out — many of whom are well-pensioned beneficiaries of [final salary] pensions — at the same time.” \nThe government says that those seeing big deductions on their forecasts should not feel like losers. \nThis is because the slice of additional pension they would have got from the state, had they not been contracted out, will be delivered by their workplace, or private, pension instead. When their new state pension is combined with their workplace pension, some will receive more than £155 a week, the government notes. \n“Our pensions reforms are all about creating a system that is fairer for everyone,” says the Department for Work and Pensions. \n“People who have paid less in national insurance contributions will see this reflected in their pension — just as they do under the current system. The new state pension reflects a bold move to create a system that is fairer, simpler and easier to understand.” Call for clarity \nThe same level of surety cannot be equally extended to all workers who have contracted out. The millions incentivised to contract out into riskier defined contribution personal pensions many years ago face no such certainty over their income in retirement, unlike members of final salary schemes, where the employer bears the investment risk for delivering the pension. \nWith anyone aged over 55 eligible to seek a new state pension statement, the government is under growing pressure to improve how it explains the big pension changes. \nBetween September 2014 and August 2015, the DWP issued 364,000 statements for the new state pension and said it had only received 300 complaints — a rate of just 0.08 per cent — adding that none of the complaints were challenging pension estimates. \nMany experts are surprised by these figures, given the level of complaints and concerns raised by savers to them. They say the DWP must make it a priority to ensure that savers know when the fog of complexity lifts, how they will be affected by the rollout of the new pension. Case study: ‘I didn’t know I was contracted out’ \nPaul Martin, 56, was left confused and disappointed after receiving his new state pension forecast recently. \n“I didn’t even know I was contracted out, as no one had ever explained this to me,” he says. “So I was surprised to see that £56 per week had been deducted from my pension, for being contracted out.” Paul Martin \nMr Martin, an ex-police officer, says the statement did not show how the deduction had been worked out. “You had to take it at face value,” he says. \nAfter some investigation, he confirmed that he had been contracted out during his career. However, his next concern was to find out whether he could still build his state pension, but this was a frustrating task. \n“Initially I went to the government website, but there was too much information and I couldn’t find what I wanted,” he says. \nMr Martin, who is currently working overseas, says that had he not sought the help of an expert, he wouldn’t have found out there was potential to continue building his pension through voluntary national insurance contributions. \n“I consider myself reasonably financially astute, but it was a bit of a lottery to get the right information,” he says. “If you weren’t proactive about seeking information, you could end up in a situation where your pension was a third less than you were anticipating.” \nMr Martin strongly believes the UK government should urge everyone to get a state pension forecast. \n“I naively assumed I was going to get the flat-rate pension. But it is a misnomer to call it a flat-rate pension for everyone because that is just not the case. \n“If you were depending on the state pension primarily for your retirement income, you could be headed for a nasty shock. \n“The government needs to make clear that there is potential for people to make up shortfalls in their forecast state pension and how to do it.” How to iron out the wrinkles \n● Not sure if you’ve been contracted out? Find out by calling HM Revenue & Customs on 0300 200 3507. You will need your national insurance number on hand. \n● If you’re over 55, you can obtain a statement of the amount of statepension you are expected to receive by going to: gov.uk/state-pension-statement \n● For older workers who want to increase their contributions, if you’re still under state pension age — and have a starting amount for the new pension which is less than the full “single-tier” amount, of about £155 in 2016, you will be able to carry on building your state pension until you reach the full rate. \nFor example, a 62-year-old man has a starting pension of about £118, due to being contracted out for long periods. As he is under state pension age (currently 65 for men) he will have the chance to build up extra state pension, either through national insurance contributions through paid work, or credits. Each qualifying year added to an NI record will add about £4.40 extra per week, in today’s money, to his state pension. \n● There is also an option to plug gaps in an NI record through voluntary contributions. A one-off payment of about £730 will buy an extra £225 a year to the state pension of a 60-year-old woman. The Class 3 contributions offer is also open to the self employed. However, not everyone who has been contracted out will actually benefit from making voluntary contributions.
