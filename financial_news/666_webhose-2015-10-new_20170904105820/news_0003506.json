US ambassador to Kenya Robert Godec has said the funding, through USAID, is intended to help communities in these areas build resilience. Speaking on Tuesday when he opened two livestock markets in Isiolo and Marsabit counties, Mr Godec said the funds will enable beneficiaries engage in livestock-related economic activities as well as improving livestock trade. Mr Godec was accompanied by Isiolo Governor Godana Doyo, his Marsabit counterpart Ukur Yattani and Livestock Principal Secretary Prof Fred Segor in the opening of Oldonyiro and Merille livestock markets. The market construction was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the Resilience and Economic Growth in the Arid Lands-Accelerated Growth (Regal-AG). Mr Godec said USAID would continue to work with counties and communities that are out to reduce poverty through livestock farming and trade in livestock produce. 11 COUNTIES FUNDED The US ambassador added that 11 counties have been funded by the US development agency to put up modern livestock markets. In addition to the complete Oldonyiro market, the USAID is also constructing another major market in Isiolo Town and other four smaller markets in Duse, Kipsing, Eskot and Merti. The markets are set to spur economic growth, generate revenue and improve the lives of pastoralists who rely on livestock for their income. Governor Doyo said Sh110 million has been set aside by his county government to construct the Ngarendare bridge connecting Isiolo and Oldonyiro towns to ease transportation. \"Roads leading to the market will also be upgraded,\" the governor pledged. SUPPORT LIVESTOCK FARMERS He called upon other development partners to support other markets for the benefit of livestock keepers. Governor Yattani on his part said his county government would exploit opportunities presented by livestock activities in the area and go beyond the local market so as to maximize farmers' profits. Mr Yattani said Marsabit County had started constructing a modern international abattoir only 20km from Marsabit Town through which standards would be checked to comply with the international market. The Livestock PS revealed that more than 70 per cent of the country's livestock is located in the arid and semi-arid areas. Prof Segor noted that the national government has put in place measures to address challenges of livestock marketing in the country.
