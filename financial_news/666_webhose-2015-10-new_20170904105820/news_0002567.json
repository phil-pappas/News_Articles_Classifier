More Olive oil exports boost Tunisian economy \nIn its latest regional economic outlook for the Middle East, north Africa and Central Asia, published on Wednesday, the IMF forecast that the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council will see gross domestic product growth slow from 3.25 per cent this year to 2.75 per cent next year. \nCouncil members’ average fiscal deficits are expected to reach 13 per cent of GDP this year, with the region’s largest economy, Saudi Arabia , facing a deficit of 21.6 per cent in 2015 and 19.4 per cent in 2016. \nAll regional oil exporters, having lost $360bn over the past year in export revenues, will have to deal with a cumulative fiscal deficit of more than $1tn over the next five years. \n“Oil exporters will need to adjust their spending and revenue policies to secure fiscal sustainability,” the fund said. \n“Yes, they have financial buffers, but addressing these issues is a matter of time urgency,” Masood Ahmed, the IMF’s regional director, said at a press conference in Dubai. “Difficult choices have to be made in ways to cut back on spending or to raise other forms of revenue, such as taxes.” \nThe IMF expects the oil price to average $52 a barrel in 2015, down from $110 a barrel in the first half of 2014, gradually increasing to $63 a barrel by the end of the decade. “Considerable uncertainty surrounds these figures,” it added, with risks to global growth “tilted to the downside”. \nNon-oil growth in the GCC is expected to remain at 4 per cent in 2015 and 2016 — a reduction of 1.75 per cent on last year as fiscal adjustment starts, especially in Saudi Arabia and the UAE . FT series \nFurther reading \nIf oil prices are $10 below the IMF’s baseline figure, it said, GCC growth would slow by 0.25 to 0.5 per cent in 2016 and deepen further to 0.5 to 0.75 per cent in 2017-18. \nRisks to growth are being aggravated by regional wars, with the potential for persistent conflict in Iraq, Libya and Yemen threatening to “impart negative spillovers to neighbouring countries”. \nThe IMF warned that sustained conflicts could have an “impact on region-wide confidence, further dimming growth prospects”. Any larger-than-expected slowdown in China would also put further pressure on oil prices. \nMost countries’ fiscal measures are unlikely to achieve balanced budgets in the medium term, the fund warned. All regional exporters — apart from Kuwait , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — are on course to run out of financial reserves within five years, it noted, adding that GCC states need to rebuild surpluses to deal with future oil shocks. \nBut it expected states across the wider region to continue to raise debt levels to slow the rate of reserve depletion. \nSaudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Iraq and Yemen have issued debt to cover the fiscal shortfall, with debt issuance expected to cover 22 per cent of GCC deficit-financing needs this year. \nTo balance their budgets, Middle Eastern countries would have to reduce spending by 12-13 per cent of GDP over the year, the IMF said. \nTo date, consolidation measures such as tax increases and spending cuts have only exceeded 1 per cent of non-oil GDP in Algeria, Kuwait, Iraq, Qatar and the UAE. \nOther exporters, including Saudi Arabia, have engaged in net fiscal stimulus this year, with Saudi Arabia fuelling this with state handouts during its political transition to a new king. \nThe IMF welcomed GCC plans for a regional value-added-tax framework, which it said could raise roughly 1-2 per cent of GDP in revenues. Mr Ahmed urged the six-member group to move from “study to implementation”. \nCurbing spending on wages and security-related expenditures — while politically difficult — could save more than 3 per cent of GDP if they were brought back to pre-boom levels, the IMF said. Boosting investment efficiency could also reduce costs by another 2 per cent of GDP. \nRisk, even in the war-torn region, is also opportunity \nRead more \nThe GCC is set to respond to its fiscal problems by cutting public investment substantially, mainly by deferring new projects. Other spending cuts in the medium term will probably force governments to hire fewer public servants, the IMF added. \nExcluding the UAE, the GCC is expected to hire 2m nationals by 2020, but on current trends the ranks of the unemployed will swell by 500,000, adding to the 1m already out of work, the fund warned. \nGCC unemployment will rise from 12.75 per cent to 16 per cent , it said. \nThe oil-dependent private sector in the Gulf has yet to develop to the point where it can take on the burden of job creation, the IMF noted, calling for incentives to move nationals into the non-oil private sector and to improve skills. \nNow, the key is to find ways to encourage the private sector as a motor to provide more jobs,” said Mr Ahmed.
