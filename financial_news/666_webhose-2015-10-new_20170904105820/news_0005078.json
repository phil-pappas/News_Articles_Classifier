( FCN ), the global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations protect and enhance their enterprise value, today announced that Gartner has given the Company the highest product score for its Ringtail® e-discovery software in the Legal Review Use Case in Gartner’s ‘Critical Capabilities for E-Discovery’ report (Jie Zhang, Garth Landers, October 6, 2015). Twenty e-discovery software providers were evaluated in the inaugural report, and a complimentary copy is available at the FTI Technology site . \nAccording to the report, “Legal review is viewed as the core part of e-discovery and can be the most costly; it is not measured by technology spend, rather by legal cost (labor of legal professionals and services). Intuitive user interface and ease of use for legal users are important for the review capability. Predictive coding is typically an embedded feature of review technology.” \n“On behalf of the global FTI Technology team, we are pleased to receive the highest product score for legal review software in Gartner’s new ‘Critical Capabilities for E-Discovery’ report,” said Seth Rierson , Senior Managing Director and Global Segment Leader of FTI Technology . “Like Gartner, we view ease of use and innovative features as the keys to reducing legal review costs. We’re proud of our software development team’s demonstrated innovation and advancements in these areas and how Ringtail is helping users reduce the total cost of review.” \nThe Ringtail e-discovery platform supports law firms and corporate legal teams of all sizes that are tasked with managing the complexity and scope of today’s global e-discovery. A full-featured platform, Ringtail software processes and culls data, provides a broad range of tools for quick data review and coding and gives users a comprehensive set of redaction and production tools. Ringtail also features patented visual analytics, concept clustering, predictive coding and advanced workflows. Ringtail is available on-premises, on-demand or in a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) deployment model.
