Nicholas Rider Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Treasurer Scott Morrison will be the main beneficiary of a $1.6 billion windfall from the Reserve Bank of Australia after it generated more than $6 billion in profit from the falling Australian dollar.\nThe payment from the central bank to Treasury's coffers - which was made on September 3, a day after the Reserve Bank's accounts were finalised - is the biggest to government in 13 years, except for Wayne Swan's 2009 draw-down of $5.2 billion.\nDetermined by both Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens and former Treasurer Joe Hockey, the payment is almost equivalent to what the bank delivered Canberra over the previous five years.\nA collapsing Australian dollar, which tumbled from US94¢ to US77¢ in 2014-15 helped deliver $6.1 billion in valuation gains on the bank's $157 billion balance sheet, much of which is in foreign currencies.\nOfficials at the bank directly sold $2.6 billion in foreign currencies, which they said was part of the \"normal course\" of managing the foreign currency portfolio. This is mostly due to regular rebalancing of its offshore portfolio and is not a form of currency market intervention, which hasn't occurred since the 2008 crisis.\nNet profit for the 2014-15 financial year was $6.9 billion, down from $9.4 billion a year earlier, according to the Reserve Bank's annual report published on Thursday.\nFrom that amount, the central bank's so-called \"distributable profit\" was $3.5 billion, of which $1.57 billion has been placed into its reserve fund, which is essentially its capital and a buffer against sudden swings in the value of its portfolio, as well as for covering fraud or operational risks.\nFund in healthy shape\n The fund, which now stands at $12.7 billion, the second-highest amount in 14 years, was subject to controversy in 2012, when Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens clashed with the then Labor government for not allowing it to be restocked after it was depleted in 2010/11 to less than $3 billion - a level the central bank regarded as unsafe.\nLabor was at the time attempting to deliver on its failed promise to produce a surplus early in the decade. The fund had earlier been reduced following the record 2010 dividend payout and Mr Stevens was keen to see it rebuilt gradually.\nFormer Treasurer Joe Hockey added to the row when in one of his earliest decisions after coming to office in September 2013 he had the Commonwealth borrow $8.8 billion to grant the Reserve Bank in order to restock the reserve fund.\nAt the time, Mr Hockey was concerned that any sudden surge in the Australian dollar could generate major losses for the central bank and effectively wipe-out its capital. Thursday's annual report noted that a 10 per cent appreciation in the Australian dollar would today produce a mark-to-market loss of $4.9 billion.\nHowever, Mr Hockey's 2013 payment continues to be a significant reason the underlying budget position has not improved substantially under the Coalition's first two years in office. Labor also accused Mr Hockey of using the payment to worsen the 2013-14 budget and flatter subsequent budgets when the dividend stream rebounded.\n\"As I said at the time, the original initiative by the Abbott-Turnbull Government to give an $8.8 billion grant to the RBA was designed to pad out the 2013-14 budget deficit and to reap the dividends in following financial years,\" said shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen.\n\"We're seeing that continue to play out here.\"\nThe annual report also revealed that Mr Stevens' pay was unchanged in 2014/15 at $1.01 million, including a salary of $862,256. Deputy governor Phil Lowe took home $755,980.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:02:18.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
