Instead of slashing red tape and expensive, job-destroying rules on business, the Government keeps adding new ones. The avalanche of costs could once be blamed on Lib Dems and their singular lack of free-market understanding; but even though the Tories are now governing alone, they continue to pass rules of a sort that would have made Vince Cable jump up and down with joy. \nImposing costs on business might be seen to be fine if the regulations actually achieved their stated goals - but time and again, the rules are flawed and will end up backfiring, hurting rather than helping the vulnerable groups they are seeking to help. What should count is what works in the real world, not what sounds good. \nTake the rule stipulating that every company with more than 250 employees will be forced to publish any gap between the average pay of male staff and female staff , as well as related provisions on bonus payments. The aim, of course, is quite rightly to combat discrimination and expose bad firms. Yet while the new rules are well-intentioned, they won’t achieve what all sensible people want: a colour and gender-blind society where performance is the only factor that determines individuals’ pay and success. Instead, these new reporting requirements will ensure that innocent companies are regularly and unfairly singled out for opprobrium, while actually making it significantly harder to spot genuine rogues. \nThe best way to highlight the unintended consequences of the new rule is to consider a few hypothetical examples. Company A is a leisure industry leader; 80pc of its shop-floor workforce is made up of women, many of whom are attracted to the firm because of its scrupulous adherence to equal opportunities practices. All are paid exactly the same wage. Let us assume that its executives are split 50-50 between women and men and paid identically. Until now, this company would have been held in high esteem. \nUnder the new rules, however, the firm will be forced to state that it pays, on average, its female staff less than its male staff. The reason? Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) though employees who perform the same job are paid exactly the same, the fact that the shop-floor staff are more likely to be women and thus that a higher proportion of male employees are executives means that the average female salary will be lower than the average male salary. Lies, damn lies and statistics. Many other companies - including retailers that employ more women than men on the shop floor - will also be hammered unfairly as a result of these ill-thought-out regulations. \nOr consider company B. Worried that it has previously been missing out on female talent, it is trying to increase the proportion of its staff that are women, and has recently recruited a large number of young female graduates. But because these are less experienced and have yet to pass their professional exams, let us assume that they are paid less than older cohorts of employees, who have already qualified and are more likely (for historic reasons) to be male. The result: a company that is behaving the way the Government wants will be penalised. \nA competitor company that isn’t reaching out to new female graduates would actually end up with better average statistics. The good guys will be punished; the bad guys will have the last laugh. Once again a case of lies, damn lies and statistics. \nNo average number can account sensibly for any of these or many other scenarios; forcing firms to publish this kind of data reduces, rather than increases, our ability to understand what is going on. The proposed new rules should be ditched - and instead, we should look at the voluntary initiative by some big companies to operate an anonymised early-round recruitment process as a much more sensible way forward. There is an important caveat here, too, however: any attempt at making this sort of practice compulsory would turn recruitment into a minefield, prevent the right staff from being hired, cripple headhunting and discourage many smaller firms from expanding. \nThe impact of the latest pay disclosure rule pales in comparison with that of the other big new piece of regulation: the massive increase in the minimum wage . Even those economists who don’t believe that lowish minimum wages kill jobs agree that very high minimum wages are bad for employment. Employees generate a certain amount of value added per hour; any attempt at forcing employers to pay staff more than they are worth to them will end in tears and job losses. Above a certain (hard to define) minimum wage threshold, everybody agrees that the only question is how many people won’t find work for every extra £1 added to the minimum wage. In extremis, at £15 an hour, the employment effect would be catastrophic, even in a world of rising productivity. \nIt’s not just disclosure or the minimum wage: the new apprenticeships levy looks as if it will turn into a major new tax on business. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is expected to be levied on payrolls, which means that the tab will be picked up by other employees in the form of reduced pay rises over time. On the margins, however, it will also discourage recruitment. A trained workforce is a good thing; a heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all tax is never the right answer to any question. Some retailers may actually secretly welcome the plastic bag tax: becauses nobody can hand out free bags anymore, all retailers end up cutting their costs. But it is nevertheless another major Tory intervention in the economy. \nWherever one looks, one sees additional red tape, rules and assaults on the free market. It’s a great shame, for none of these initiatives will work as intended. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:59:43.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
