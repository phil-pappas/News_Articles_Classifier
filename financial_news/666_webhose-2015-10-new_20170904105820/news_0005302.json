The response has been enthusiastic and the emails will be sent from the next week,” a senior I-T official said.\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes, the apex policy-making body of the tax department, had recently asked the department to “initiate the concept of using email for corresponding with taxpayers and sending through emails the questionnaire, notice etc at the time of scrutiny proceedings and getting responses from them.”\n“This would eliminate the necessity of visiting the Income Tax offices by the taxpayers, particularly in smaller cases, involving limited issues and where taxpayer is able to provide details required by the Assessing Officer (AO) without necessitating his physical presence,” the order in this regard had said.\nCBDT Chairperson Anita Kapur, in a recent interview to PTI, had said that the “first-of-it’s kind initiative” is aimed at making life easy for taxpayers.\n“We have been thinking how can we make life easier for taxpayers especially for those who are in the middle and the slightly higher tax bracket. So, now we are thinking of allowing that when a notice is issued in an assessment or scrutiny case, the taxpayer can send the department an e-response,” she had said.\nThe official added these ‘pilot’ project scrutiny assessments will be completed in the stipulated time frame and a record-sheet of one-to-one communications will be sent to the CBDT by the end of this year so that it can be implemented on a nation-wide basis from 2016-17 financial year.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 2:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:18:46.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
