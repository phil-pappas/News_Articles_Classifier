Being prime minister requires you to make some tough decisions ... and reality will bite over the next few months leading up to the budget,\" Mr Clare told Sky News on Sunday. \nHe suggested the next area of bi-partisanship - after the two major parties struck a deal on the China free trade agreement - could be tackling over-generous superannuation tax concessions. \nMr Abbott had ruled out any changes to super tax concessions in either this term or the next term of government. \nAssistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said under Mr Turnbull there was more \"robust discussion\" in the new-look cabinet. \nWhen it came to the government's tax white paper process, everything was on the table, she said. \n\"It's a little bit ridiculous ... to start cutting things out and taking things off the table,\" she told ABC television. \n\"You have to look at all of the options when you're coming up with a package.\" \nNegative gearing also had to be looked at within the whole tax system, Ms O'Dwyer said. \nWhile many believed only the wealthy take advantage of negative gearing, she said average income earners including nurses, policemen and women also benefited. \nMr Clare said everyone at the recent economic summit involving business, unions and community leaders agreed super tax concessions was an area that should be reformed. \n\"Malcolm Turnbull has almost said it himself ... that has got to be the next area we can work together,\" he said. \nIndependent senator Nick Xenophon agreed, saying if the government was clamping down on welfare, the question should be asked why it wasn't also clamping down on superannuation and negative gearing. \nHe noted that former treasurer Joe Hockey in his valedictory speech last week said there was a need to look at both issues. \n\"To ignore the big end of town while having a go at those on welfare doesn't seem to be a level playing field,\" Senator Xenophon told reporters in Adelaide. \nAsked about Mr Hockey's comments, Ms O'Dwyer said: \"He has a view on this, many Australians have a view on this and we will consider and weigh these matters very carefully.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Soaring IndiGo seeks investors in battle for India's skies AFP \nWaiting for a flight at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi airport, law student Shweta Toppo explains why she mostly flies â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:01:50.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
