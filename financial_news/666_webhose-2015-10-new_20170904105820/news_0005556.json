However, the Teachers Service Commission has remained firm that it will not pay teachers who were on strike in September as they did not work for 33 days. \"We have appealed against the requirement to pay September salaries primarily because no services were offered for 33 days and. The law allows us not to pay if services were not rendered,\" the commission says In a statement yesterday, chief executive Nancy Macharia said that the commission had by yesterday uploaded on their website payslips and teachers would get money in their bank accounts starting Monday. BANK ACCOUNTS \"The financial institutions will process the salaries and credit to individual teachers' bank accounts,\" said Ms Macharia. Kenya Secondary Schools Heads Association chairman John Awiti said many teachers had suffered this month. Those who had loans, he added, have been penalised by banks for failing to pay this month. Ms Macharia clarified that the teachers who worked in September, but had not received their pay would be paid once their details submitted by the commission's county director of education are verified. Last month, the teachers' employer released salaries for only 42,973 teachers, mainly principals, their deputies and heads of department, who were in schools during the strike. Over 245,000 teachers did not receive their September salaries, but some complained they worked but were not paid. Teachers in public schools had been on strike since September 2. Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teacher and Kenya National Union of Teachers suspended the strike for 90 days after Justice Nelson Abuodha of the Labour Court asked them to discuss with the Labour Cabinet Secretary how the 50-60 per cent basic pay rise should be implemented.
