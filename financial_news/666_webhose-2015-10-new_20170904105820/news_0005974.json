She’ll provide valuable services such as office coverage, closing coverage, and general office assistance with structuring files and procedures. Her unique perspective, being able to look at an office from the outside, having knowledge of the inner workings of an office, will be really beneficial to help offices become more scalable.\n“Erica is extremely professional; detail oriented; organized and takes compliance very seriously, and in today’s market with the regulatory climate, it’s going to be incredibly helpful to have another set of eyes in the field helping us to stay in compliance.” says Jadah Hill, Regional Director for Title Alliance. “This new role will take all of her years of experience and her unique skillset and allow her to use them to help take many of our offices to the next level.”\n“Each day will be a new adventure for me,” says Werner. “It will be refreshing to experience different offices and to help them in their quests to grow. I’m very much looking forward to this new challenge.” When asked about leaving First Land, Werner says, “I’m so grateful for my time at First Land Transfer. I learned many things and took the office further than we could have dreamed when we opened the doors. I’m really looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, and this new role will allow me to do just that.”\nTitle Alliance, Ltd, an ESOP Company is located in Media, PA and has been creating RESPA compliant title joint ventures since 1983 with lenders, mortgage bankers, realtors, builders and credit unions.
