Without any apparent sense of irony, a meeting this week of the Parliamentary Labour Party was officially described as “warm and friendly”, which for those listening in on the angry exchanges, audible from outside the room, was the very reverse of what was only too obviously going on inside. \nThe occasion was another about-turn from Labour’s shadow chancellor , John McDonnell, on whether the Opposition would go along with the Government’s new fiscal rule, which requires a Budget surplus by 2019/20 and in subsequent years when the economy is in “normal times”. \nIn the space of less than a month, McDonnell seems to have gone full circle. Having through gritted teeth said he’s no deficit denier, and indicated Labour would vote in favour of the proposal, he’s back to where he started, unbound by any fiscal rule that makes any kind of sense. There is now no collective Shadow cabinet responsibility in our Party, no clarity on economic policy and no credible leadership. @BBCr4today — Mike Gapes (@MikeGapes) October 13, 2015 John McDonnell admits he changed his mind \nOn this form, the same fate awaits Opposition policy on an independent Bank of England, which the shadow chancellor was once very much against. He has since promised a review of the Bank’s remit. It can only be a matter of time before he changes his view again. Labour’s approach to the economy has descended into an on-the-hoof shambles. \nThe two corner stones on which New Labour built its economic credibility – a rules-based fiscal policy and an independent Bank of England – are being demolished before our eyes, like an ISIL assault on the temples of Palmyra. Had the Opposition’s propensity for shooting itself in the foot not become such a familiar sight, the about-turn would be almost unbelievable. \nNone of this is to argue that the Government is getting it exactly right on matters fiscal. As law, the new rule – which MPs are due to vote on today – is little more than a faintly ridiculous piece of politicking, for there is no purpose to law without sanctions, and this one appears to have none beyond the extra capacity for embarrassment if it is broken. \nAs a fiscal rule, it may also be overly ambitious . Over the past six decades, budget deficits have been the norm in the UK, rather than a recession induced exception. In those 60 years, the budget has been in surplus on only eight occasions, the last time in 2001/2, just before Labour once more took the lid off public spending. \nThe Chancellor, George Osborne, cannot be faulted for wanting to address one of the perennial curses of the UK economy, and fundamentally change the rules of the game, but is he being entirely realistic in his ambition? \nThe new rule defines “abnormal”, allowing the government to run a deficit, as growth of less than 1pc. This may sound like a reasonable definition, but as Gemma Tetlow of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out, it is in fact well below the UK’s trend rate of growth. \nTo meet this rule – and run a budget surplus in all other circumstances – therefore requires a degree of budgetary discipline such as not seen on these shores for a very long time. It is not at all clear what the long-term macro-economic consequences of such a shift might be, particularly if in a prolonged period of subdued, but above 1pc, growth. \n• Jeremy Warner: Somewhere over the rainbow ... a budget surplus \nThere might indeed be times when the government would want to borrow to spend even when growth exceeds 1pc; for instance to avoid permanent damage to the economy during what may be a temporary period of weakness, or for spending on future generations – education in particular – but also on long-term infrastructure which would otherwise struggle to raise private finance. \nThe broader, macro-economic criticism is that public and private debt are only two halves of the same coin. Push down on one, and, if you expect any growth in the economy at all, it will merely rise up in the other. According to long-term Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts, falling public sector debt is likely to be mirrored by rising household debt. \nThe Chancellor argues that high public debt both makes the economy vulnerable to shocks and squeezes out spending through debt interest payments. Unfortunately, the same is true of high household and corporate debt. So it is not clear that cutting back on public debt lifts the economy’s capacity to withstand shocks. \nThe new rule also suffers from a cliff-edge effect, which forbids deficit spending when growth is at 1.01 per cent, but allows it when growth is at 0.99pc. The apparently arbitrary nature of the distinction speaks volumes about the underlying problem with all fiscal rules – they have to be tough enough to lend fiscal credibility, but sufficiently flexible to respond to shocks and prolonged economic downdrafts. \nThe fiscal rules introduced by Gordon Brown ultimately proved so pliable as to allow a veritable coach and horses to be driven through them. By the end, they meant virtually nothing, allowing the government to run a persistent deficit despite the longest period of uninterrupted growth in the modern age. The UK Government debt total is now... Public sector net debt \nNor has the incumbent Osborne been entirely averse to a little Brown-like manipulation, bringing forward tax revenues and asset sales. \nMore positively, however, he has set up the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which has become an indispensable force in keeping the Government fiscally honest. Until the OBR, the Treasury’s forecasts were based on the Chancellor’s judgements, which were invariably too optimistic and prone to political distortion. \nBy giving this role to the OBR, the danger of politically-motivated forecasting is removed, which in turn underpins the credibility of the fiscal framework. \nPrediction is difficult, especially when it’s about the future, according to the faux wisdom of Yogi Berra, the American baseball player. But actually, the OBR’s forecasting record over the past five years hasn’t been that bad, with output last year “just” 2.25 per cent lower than the OBR said it would be back in 2010 when it was formed. \nIn the OBR’s judgment, this shortfall is almost entirely accounted for by external shocks – the eurozone crisis and the oil price spike – rather than under-estimating the negative impact of the Coalition’s fiscal consolidation plans. Yet one thing is for sure: McDonnell will never be convinced of it. Whether it be the rich or the debt markets, for him there will always be a magic money tree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:30:36.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
