THE then judged these research-intensive universities across the following areas: More Headlines Teaching: the learning environment, which includes a university's reputation, staff-to-student ratio, doctorate-to-bachelor's, and institutional income Research: a university's research reputation, research income, and research productivity Citations: the number of times a university's published work is cited by scholars globally International outlook: a university's international-to-domestic-student ratio, international-to-domestic-staff ratio, and international collaboration Industry income: a university's ability to help with innovations, inventions and consultancy \nThe data showed that universities in the United States have begun to lose their dominance in the world rankings. While almost a fifth of the 800 institutions are located in the U.S., the numbers are decreasing each year. In part, this may be due to \"improved coverage of research not published in English and a better geographical spread of responses to our academic reputation survey,\" according to Phil Baty, THE rankings editor. \nOf the top 25 universities, the United States is well represented by 17 institutions from across the country.
