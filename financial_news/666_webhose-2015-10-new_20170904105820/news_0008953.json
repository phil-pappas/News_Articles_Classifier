In time for this year’s open enrollment, Connect for Health has expanded Kyla to the Subsidy Eligibility System so that the avatar can answer questions, help people determine if they are eligible for subsidies, and walk them through the enrollment process.\n“We have seen that the addition of CodeBaby’s interactive coach greatly improves the experience people have on the site,” said Marcia Benshoof, chief strategy and sales officer for Connect for Health Colorado. “By expanding Kyla to other sections of the website we are able to add significantly to our customer support without adding to the work of our customer service representatives.”\nSimilarly, Access Health CT is using their virtual coach, Tina , to further educate consumers on their choices. After a year of using Tina as part of the exchange, Access Health CT found that their customers are more educated and are looking for a deeper level of information and knowledge as they enroll for plans. As such, Access Health CT has increased the knowledge base for Tina so that she can respond and answer more in depth questions and better guide people to the right location on the site.\n“After a year of using Tina, we found that our members knew more about the way the exchanged worked and the types of questions they needed to ask than the years before we implemented the avatar,” said Jim Wadleigh, Jr., CEO, Access Health CT. “Going into the 2016 open enrollment period we want to further empower the people shopping on our site to dig deeper and ask questions in real-time. The expansion of Tina will enable these types of on the spot queries and will continue to make our customer’s experiences with Access Health CT that much better.”\n“Open Enrollment can be a stressful time for both the consumer and the health insurance exchanges and we want to help alleviate the pressure on both sides,” said Dennis McGuire, chief executive officer, CodeBaby. “The value of using Intelligent Virtual Assistants goes beyond reducing call center costs to significantly improving lives by helping people re-enroll into last year’s plan or guiding them into new and/or better plans based on last year’s utilization. A virtual coach can do this at the exact time the person needs it – on-demand, 24/7/365 in that persons native language.”\nAbout CodeBaby\nCodeBaby is a global digital engagement and intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) technology provider.
