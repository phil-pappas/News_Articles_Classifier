Claude Littner's debut and everything you need to know By Gerard O'Donovan | Telegraph – 10 minutes ago 0.00 \nEverything you need to know about the new series of The Apprentice on BBC One \n= What time and when does The Apprentice start on TV and how can I watch it? = \nThe 11th series of The Apprentice starts tonight, Wednesday, October 14 on BBC One at 9pm! \nThe second episode airs tomorrow at the same time. \n= The Apprentice around the world = \nEver wondered who the other \"Lord Sugars\" are in other countries' versions of The Apprentice? Yes, we all know what's become of his US counterpart Donald Trump , but Italy, Asia and Brazil's hosts are no less silly... read more \n= What programmes will The Apprentice compete against in the ratings? = \nAs the other broadcasters will not be showing any major ratings-getters in the 9pm slot, it's likely that The Apprentice will speed off with the audience share tonight. On ITV there will be Alexander Armstrong in the Land of the Midnight Sun , a new three-part series in which the comedian and Pointless presenter goes on a 8,000-mile journey halfway around the Arctic Circle deep in mid-winter. So though it is one for viewers looking for a more intelligent alternative to tonight's business battles, it is unlikely to pull in Apprentice-level ratings. \nChannel 4, meanwhile, will be showing an episode of Grand Designs and Channel 5 is sticking to its common TV topics of debt and bailiffs with Can't Pay? We'll Take It Away . BBC Two, on the other hand, will be showing the third part of The Face of Britain by Simon Schama . At least there's something for everyone across the five big channels tonight. \n= The candidates will be in mixed teams for the first time = \nLord Sugar is quite literally \"mixing it up\" this year as he's announced that the teams will be mixed gender for the first time. And apparently one - as yet unnamed - candidate has already started grumbling because he believes that men are better at selling. The bigger question is, will Lord Sugar be able to remember which team is which without there being easy identifiers like Men's Team (NYSE: TISI - news ) and Women's Team? \n= Lord Sugar on The One Show: 'I've got the easy job' = \nLord Sugar has appeared on The One Show sofa and spilled the beans about the new series... not really. He said remarkably little, though he did confess that, compared to assistants Karren Brady and Claude Littner, he has the easy job as he doesn't have to follow the candidates around London. \nHe also urged people not to compare Littner to his predecessor Nick Hewer, saying: \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's unfair... they're different characters.\" \n• Meet the candidates here \n= And what about the house? = \nThis year's house is on John Street in Bloomsbury, central London. If you fancy renting it once the series has ended, it will set you back £17,000 a month. A snip! Take a look inside here. \n= A calamari crisis awaits = \nThe candidates' first task is to buy fish at Billingsgate fish market. The aim - to turn it into two products that they can sell on to hungry Londoners. One team targets affluent city workers whilst the other takes on tourists in Camden. But who will take to it like a duck to water and who will flounder? \n= What's new for the Apprentice 2015? = \nIt's scarier than before as Nick Hewer has yielded his role as Lord Sugar’s sidekick to the terrifying Claude Littner of the turn-you-to-jelly interview technique. Hewer is not giving up on business, though. In an interview with the Telegraph, he explained he was an ambassador of Bark, a start-up that matches local tradespeople with consumers. Elsewhere, in another triumph for grumpiness, Jack Dee replaces Dara O Briain on The Apprentice: You’re Fired, which follows on BBC Two at 10pm. Baroness Karren Brady remains Lord Sugar's other advisor. \n= Apprentice All-Stars? = \nLast year's winner Mark Wright has claimed that former victors of the BBC business series are in talks to take part in an All-Star edition of the show. There have been 10 winners of The Apprentice so far so it's a feasible idea. \n\"I shouldn't say this, but there is talk of all of the winners going back and having a best Apprentice of all the people that have won, because there's now going to be 11 there [after this series],\" he told Digital Spy . \n• The Apprentice: where are they now \n= So what can we expect from Littner? = \nSpeaking exclusively to the Telegraph, Littner said: “Of course, some of the candidates exaggerate their previous experience or claim to be tremendous in sales when they have zero ability, but they get found out, and quite rightly so.” Which should make for some pretty entertaining boardroom put-downs. He also said: “There’s something very rewarding about spotting potential and watching the talented rise to the top.” You see, he's just a big softie. Sort of. \n= What can we expect? = \nThis year 18 candidates are hoping to convince Lord Sugar to go into business with them. The usual mix’um gather’um of walking hairstyles, bloated egos and rank incompetents, they are a rum lot even by this show’s low standards. “I’m the Swiss Army Knife of business skills,” claims one before being skewered by a barbed Lord Sugar putdown. “I’m disgustingly ambitious 'ordinary’ and ‘mediocre’ are curse words to me,” says another. \nAmong the tasks they have to prove themselves on in coming weeks will be creating an ad campaign for shampoo, selling pet products and starting a DIY company plus a venture into the property business. But to start with this week it’s the basics: buying fish at Billingsgate, and flogging snacks to hungry City workers at lunchtime. That’s if they can agree on when lunchtime is, exactly… \n= What does Lord Sugar say? = \n“It sometimes gets a bit underestimated because this is an incredible opportunity. A new company will be formed and £250,000 thousand pounds will be injected, no strings attached. The bottom line is, this process works. I’ve invested one million pounds in all four winners and all four of those people are doing fantastically well and I’m expecting the winner of this particular process to carry on that trend. Two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand pounds it’s an acorn which we want grown into a great oak tree.” \n= What happened last year? = \nThe 10th series pulled in an average of 7.4 million viewers each week, and Mark Wright became Lord Sugar’s new business partner. Highlights included James Hill’s uninspiring sing-a-long with customers on the coach tours task, Felipe Alviar-Baquero purchasing a paper skeleton instead of a real on the discount buying task and Littner dismissing Solomon Akhtar’s business plan before he could even talk through it during the interviews episode. \n= Were there any breakout stars? = \nIn recent years, candidates have had a shorter shelf-life post Apprentice, but James Hill did recently win Celebrity Big Brother . Rumours persist that he has made a play for Towie's Jessica Wright. \n• The 16 daftest Apprentice candidates \n= How rich is Lord Sugar? = \nCurrent estimates put Sir Alan's wealth at £1.4bn, making him a billionaire for the first time and ranking him 101st among the UK’s mega-rich in the Sunday Times Rich List 2015 . \nHis personal fortune is higher than the Queen's but lower than Richard Branson's. \nSo how did he make his fortune?
