Only a day earlier, Shah played down Khattar's remarks on beef at a media interaction saying the CM had apologised for his utterances. Sources said the PM was worried that his development agenda could be hijacked by polarising issues such as beef and the Dadri lynching in Bihar in the three phases of elections.\nThat is why the party chief not only conveyed the PM's displeasure but warned all of them not to make any controversial statement. They were told that instead of turning focus on the state government --- for instance on the UP government for Dadri --- for its failure to maintain law & order, these leaders through their utterances had turned the attention on the BJP itself.\nEmerging from a talk-down session with Amit Shah, Muzzafarnagar MLA Sangeet Som and Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan appeared somewhat sobered down but refused to acknowledge that they had been given a dressing down. They cited a \"pre-fixed\" party agenda for their meeting. Even close aides of Haryana CM rejected the suggestion that Khattar had got an earful from Shah. They said Khattar had been \"summoned \" as part of a photo-op with the Bihar polls in mind.\n\"The contest in the next 3 phases in Bihar are going to be close. That is why these leaders who made the utterances quite a while ago are being pulled up now,\" said a source.\nAs for the Haryana CM, who is supposed to be close to Modi, an aide said, \"If the party has to pull up our CM, it could have been done over the phone. Because the party wanted to send a message to Bihar that is why everyone was summoned here.\"\nHe said, \"Khattar saab is far too simple. The problem with him is he is still a Sangh pracharak at heart -- he is more comfortable giving a lecture than getting down to administration. That is why he gets into troubles.\"\nMeanwhile, the RSS came to the aid of the government by completely distancing the Sangh from Panch janya, its mouthpiece, which carried an article justifying killing those who slaughter cows. \"Panchjanya or Organiser are not RSS mouthpieces. We have clarified this earlier,\" said Manmohan Vaidya, RSS spokesman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:30:14.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
