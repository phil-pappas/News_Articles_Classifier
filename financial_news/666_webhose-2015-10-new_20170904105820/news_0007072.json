Brendan Esposito by Brian Robins Two of the largest Cooper Basin plays, Drillsearch and Beach Energy, will merge to create a $1 billion-plus listed entity that will be 20 per cent owned by billionaire Kerry Stokes.\nMr Stokes' Seven Group Holdings has a near 20 per cent shareholding in the two companies and will emerge with the same-sized holding in the merged entity.\nThe merger follows an unsuccessful play this week for troubled Australian producer Santos along with the earlier unwelcome bid by Woodside Petroleum for PNG producer Oil Search .\nThe merger is via a scheme of arrangement, which will make it difficult for other parties to block the merger, although Beach has agreed to pay a break fee of $3.8 million to Drillsearch if the deal is broken off.\nDrillsearch shareholders will receive 1.25 shares in Beach for every share held, which values Drillsearch at about $380 million. This is a premium of 27 per cent to Drillsearch's last traded price.\nThe merger will create a combined entity with production of 12.1 million barrels of oil equivalent.\nThis month, Citi analysts raised their recommendation on Beach to a \"buy\", pointing to the company's stated ambition of pursuing acquisitions to emerge as an ASX-50 company.\n\"Low oil prices are forcing asset sales as companies focus on fixing balance sheets,\" Citi told clients. \"Beach Energy's Cooper JV partners Origin Energy and Santos are known sellers of the asset, and this is but one of many asset sales targeted globally.\n \"Beach has stated that it is seeking growth in its core Cooper Basin through organic and inorganic opportunities. Therefore we think Beach is in prime position for any Cooper JV sales, as the only JV party with pre-emption rights with the desire for external growth, as well as other opportunities in Australia.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/oil-search-rejects-woodsides-116b-bid-20150913-gjlqqa.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/santos-rejects-688-a-share-takeover-proosal-from-scepter-20151021-gkfby0.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:02:26.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
