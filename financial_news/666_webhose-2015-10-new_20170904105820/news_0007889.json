And she handled all of the topics with professional care and a personal touch.\nYip, 59, died early Sunday of brain cancer at her partner’s home near Galveston. A private memorial service will be near Houston. Memorial services in Dallas are pending.\nMaria Abad, Yip’s partner of nearly 20 years, said Yip “lived for her work.”\n“She loved what she did, educating everyone about personal finance,” she said.\nAbad met Yip in Houston in 1995 while Yip was working as a business reporter for the Houston Chronicle .\n“I read her before I ever met her. That’s how I got started trying to learn how to save money,” Abad said. “That’s the only section I would pull out of the paper. ... It was just so easy to read and made a complicated subject understandable for the regular folks.”\nMike Wilson, editor of The News , said: “Pam was a fine reporter who wrote about personal finance with the authority of an expert and the reassuring voice of a good friend. Our readers will miss her terribly, and so will we.”\nDennis Fulton, who recently retired as business editor of The News , praised Yip’s commitment to journalism.\n“I’ve never worked with a reporter who cared more about her beat, her sources and her audience,” he said. “Readers often wrote to her for financial advice, and she answered each one with great care. The empathy she showed was unparalleled.”\nYip understood the importance of the economic concerns she wrote about, many of which she dealt with first-hand. She wrote about managing health care, protecting the elderly from fraud and confronting end-of-life issues.\n“Pam was a people person,” said her co-worker Maria Halkias. “She cared about issues that everyday folk deal with and approached her beat like a watchdog. She had strong opinions about whatever was going on and could come up with some zinger analysis.”\nIn 2004, Yip shared her personal story of caring for her 79-year-old father, who was terminally ill with lung cancer in California. Her front-page article revealed the psychological, financial and legal issues she faced.\nBorn in Hong Kong, Yip was 2 when she emigrated from communist China to California with her parents. The family lived in San Francisco for five years before moving to Sacramento, where Yip grew up.\nIn 1979, she earned a bachelor’s degree in journalism with a concentration in economics from California State University-Sacramento. Later, she received a personal financial planning certificate from the University of Houston.\nYip worked for United Press International, USA Today and the Houston Chronicle before she joined The News as a business columnist in 1999. Her previous work included covering the 1997 handover of Hong Kong by Great Britain to China.\nShe had been a member of the Society of American Business Editors and Writers’ board of governors since 2007. In 2010, Yip was part of a reporting team that won a SABEW award for a series of articles about the high cost of health care. She served as co-chair of the society’s 48th annual national conference in Dallas in 2011.\nYip “helped promote the highest standards of business journalism and made lasting friendships with SABEW members,” said Kathleen Graham, executive director of SABEW. “She was always ready to offer a kind word or volunteer her time.”\nGraham said Yip’s contributions to the profession and the organization will be recognized with the President’s Award, presented by SABEW President and Bloomberg News editor Joanna Ossinger on Friday at the SABEW fall conference in New York.\nPeter Johnson, assistant business editor at The News and Yip’s editor, said she was “a good reporter and an even better person.”\n“She really loved helping people, and I think that’s what made her such a good personal finance reporter,” he said. He noted that Yip’s death came the same day The News conducted its annual financial planning hotline for readers, a service she started about 15 years ago.\nOn Sunday, Thomas E. Murphy, a close friend of Yip’s and a member of the Financial Planning Association, was busy answering calls and live chat queries from the public as part of the annual hotline.\nYip and Murphy met through the hotline, which enlisted FPA members to offer pro bono financial advice to callers.\nMurphy said that Yip was always pushing to find new ways to explain financial concepts to her readers and that she “felt very compelled to help people understand personal finance.”\nThe Financial Planning Association of Dallas-Fort Worth is honoring Yip by donating the proceeds from its annual honors dinner Thursday in her memory. The money will go to the Pamela Yip Scholarship Fund for CPA students. Memorials may made to the Pamela Yip Fund, FPA DFW, P.O. Box 261750, Plano, Texas 75026.\nStaff writers Julie Fancher, Danielle Grobmeier and Deborah Fleck contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:35:25.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
