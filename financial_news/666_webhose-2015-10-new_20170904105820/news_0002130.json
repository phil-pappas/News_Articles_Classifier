Sky's deal then gives it a year of exclusive broadcast and on-demand rights. \nBritain's biggest pay-TV operator has for many years maintained a monopoly of such ‘first run’ pay-TV rights sold by the major Hollywood studios (Other OTC: HYWS - news ) . \nWhen Netflix entered the UK market in 2012 it said that if it was unable to wrestle at least one of the studios from Sky’s grip it would launch a competition complaint. The streaming service has not since won a first run film deal in the UK but has not complained. \nIn a Telegraph interview last year, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said the company had been happy with growth driven by exclusive drama series and had not needed to turn to regulators. \nThe rivalry between Sky and BT is meanwhile not as fierce for film rights as it is for sport. \nThe pair signed a wholesale agreement two years ago that means BT TV customers can subscribe to Sky Movies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:54:44.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
