(STR/AFP/Getty Images) \nChina's central bank has stepped in yet again to try and bolster the country's flagging economy, cutting its benchmark interest rate for the sixth time in less than a year. The easing comes just days after new data showed the Chinese economy was growing at its slowest pace since the GFC. Sheryle Bagwell explains. \nShould we be worried or cheered by this easing from the People's Bank of China? \nProbably a bit of both. Global equity investors are certainly cheering—the news helped push the S&P 500 index in New York up 1.1 per cent on Friday night, which actually put it back into the black for the year after a huge sell-off in August. \nThose advocating lower rates say that if the RBA allows home loan rates to drift up it could act as a drag on household and consumer spending just as we come into Christmas. \nThe US has become increasingly concerned about the slowdown in China—it’s a big reason why the US Federal Reserve has delayed raising interest rates despite a recovery in the domestic economy. \nSo more stimulus is seen by investors as good news, particularly as it came just a day after the European Central Bank signalled it would embark on more quantitative easing this year to boost the European economy, which has also been hit by the Chinese slowdown. \nOn the other hand, commodity markets seemed to be worried that China could be signalling that its economy might be slowing at a faster pace than the data is telling us. Commodities such as iron ore and oil fell on the easing. \nOfficial data last week said the Chinese economy grew at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, just below the government's own target. \nNo one believed that the economy grew by that much in the September quarter, however, and you might conclude that the People's Bank of China doesn’t either since it’s still cutting interest rates. \nThe rate cut also comes ahead of a major plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party this week, where the leadership will thrash out its next five-year economic plan, and maybe downgrade growth even further. \nYou might wonder how more cheap money can fix China's long-term structural problems—such as overcapacity in the manufacturing sector and a debt overload among many state-owned enterprises—but it’s about all that central banks can do at the moment. \nWill China's action put pressure on the RBA to also cut rates? \nIt may do that. Or it may give the RBA some breathing space and allow it to stand on the sidelines a bit longer. \nThere are certainly plenty of reasons for the RBA to cut the official rate next month from 2 per cent to 1.75 per cent: China is slowing, our economy is underperforming and now it looks like housing construction— which has helped rebalance the economy—is peaking. \nAdd to that the decision by all four big banks to raise their variable mortgage rates and the case is building for a rate cut next month. \nThe banks raised their rates to help recoup some of the estimated $20 billion new rules forcing them to hold more capital as a buffer against the next financial shock will cost. \nSome economists say the RBA should now step in to counteract this tightening by cutting the cash rate next month. If the banks passed on that rate cut, interest rates would be back to where they were at the start of the month. \nThose advocating lower rates say that if the RBA allows home loan rates to drift up it could act as a drag on household and consumer spending just as we come into Christmas. For the RBA, though, a key issue will be inflation. \nThe latest September quarter inflation data is due out Wednesday. Inflation is still expected to fall within the RBA's comfort zone of 2 to 3 per cent. But if prices are found to have accelerated at an uncomfortable pace—and the falling dollar is making imported goods more expensive—then the RBA will be reluctant to cut rates again in November. \nAt the moment, market pricing on a rate cut next month is 50/50. \nThe Australian dollar has been drifting up—how might this affect the decision? \nProbably not at this stage. The Australian dollar went up about two cents this month, mostly as the US Federal Reserve began to get cold feet about raising US interest rates this year. \nIt was expected to do it in September but didn't. The Fed meets again this week and again no move is expected; the US economy has pulled back from its strong growth spurt in the first half of this year. \nInitial readings of US GDP for the September quarter are out Wednesday and they are forecast to show growth slowing from 3.9 per cent in the June quarter to 1.7 per cent in the three months to the end of September. \nSlower trade is the primary reason, with the Chinese slowdown a major driver. But given these headwinds we may not see rates rise in the US for a little while yet. \nMarket pricing in US interest rate futures suggests a hike in March 2016. This is taking the wind out of the US dollar's sails, causing our currency to strengthen a little. \nCurrently the dollar is hovering around 72 US cents. The RBA will be mindful of that, though the dollar is still 16 cents lower than a year ago, and below the 75 cent level the RBA has previously said is fair value. \nRN Breakfast is the show informed Australians wake up to.
