It's common practice to run professional enterprise-class security systems. \n\"Clearly TalkTalk have failed their customers by not using proper systems.\" \nThe breach is the third in a series of cyber attacks that have affected TalkTalk customers. \nIn August, the firm revealed its mobile sales site was hit by a \"sophisticated and co-ordinated cyber attack\" in which personal data was accessed. \nIn February, customers were warned about scammers who managed to steal thousands of account numbers and names from TalkTalk's computers. \n:: Action Fraud - the UK's national fraud and internet crime reporting centre - can be contacted on 0300 123 2050.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:10:02.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
