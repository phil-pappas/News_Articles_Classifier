Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's office is likely to be smaller than Tony Abbott's because some adviser positions will be shifted to ministers.\nThe restructure is part of Mr Turnbull's pledge to give ministers more autonomy than they had under the tight control of Mr Mr Abbott's chief of staff, Peta Credlin.\nMore than expected of Mr Abbott's staff have stayed in the government despite a rocky transition. In his first week Mr Turnbull had restricted access to the Prime Minister's diary , briefings and the \"blue room\".\n\"The thing about John Howard in his second incarnation was he understood the importance of extensive consultation and team building with colleagues, that's very important and we need to knit the group together by having a cabinet and a ministry which reflects all sides of the party,\" Senator Arthur Sinodinos told the ABC after the changeover.\nLibertarian senator David Leyonhjelm said he was shocked he had been able to meet eight ministers in their first sitting week in their new roles, something he said would have been unthinkable under Mr Abbott.\nHe said he had met Kelly O'Dwyer, Simon Birmingham, Scott Morrison, George Brandis, Stuart Robert and Mal Brough – who upset the crossbench by flagging changes to how senators are elected in his first week. Senator Leyonhjelm said it was a 'brain fart' and they have since made up.\n'Be nice to the crossbench' \"It's really very nice. Clearly, someone has said be nice to the crossbench,\" Mr Leyonhjelm said.\n He said many of the ministers he met did not have certain legislation to lobby him on, and instead just wanted to build a relationship.\nSenator Leyonhjelm's office said they had been rebuffed by Nationals leader and Infrastructure Minister, Warren Truss (who was close to Mr Abbott) had not \"got the memo\" and had so far refused to meet them, which they said was \"extraordinary\".\nSenator Leyonhjelm, like other crossbenchers did not have Mr Abbott's phone number, and only met him three times.\nNow the Senator said he had been communicating with Mr Turnbull on Wickr and Telegram – an app created by Pavel Durov, the \"Mark Zuckerberg of Russia\".\nMr Turnbull came into power promising a return to the Howard-era. A former adviser to the Treasurer, Peter Costello; Vincent Woolcock; and media adviser to Prime Minister John Howard, Tony O'Leary; are expected to keep working a few days a week for the foreseeable future.\nWhile some appointments are being finalised, Department of Communications secretary Drew Clarke is acting as Mr Turnbull's chief of staff,\nNew advisers In terms of advisers, Howard-era adviser Tony Parkinson is the Prime Minister's political and communications adviser, while Warren Mundine's former colleague at Indigenous group Generation One, Kerry Pinkstone, will advise on social policy.\nIn the weeks following the dramatic spill, director of transition Tony Nutt oversaw a process where all Coalition staff could apply to work in ministers' offices. Sources say this is almost complete, with most ministers appointing advisers. Sally Cray will be Mr Turnbull's principal private secretary.\nLeadership change plotters Arthur Sinodinos and Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, James McGrath, a former adviser to London Mayor Boris Johnson, meet Mr Turnbull regularly and have been conducting some of his communications with crossbenchers.\nMost media and administration staff who were initially acting in their roles, have now been appointed.\nOne source said the office would like to stay out of the spotlight. \"What we learned from [the] Abbott era is to not make the staff the story,\" the source said..", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.arthursinodinos.com.au/news/interviews/2015-september-21-702-abc-sydney-mornings/", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-16T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:59:12.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
