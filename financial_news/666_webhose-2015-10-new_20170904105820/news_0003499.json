As Europe's largest creditor, Berlin does not want its taxpayers in the firing line of another wave of bank defaults as seen in 2010. \nDeposits of less than €100,000 will still be protected under the new regime. \nBut fragility in Greece's four biggest banks - which will need recapitalising to the tune of €25bn - has already raised the prospect of the new rules being flouted as soon as they come into force . \n• Battered Greek banks to flout Brussels new 'bail-in' rules \nVanessa Mock, a spokeswoman for the Commission, said some of the six governments cited the complexity of the directive as a reason for its delayed implementation. \n\"Given that others were able to transpose on time or shortly after the deadline, we feel it’s now high time that we get this moving, which is why we are now referring these countries to court,\" said Ms Mock. \nThe threat of Brussels' legal action is another blow to the Netherlands and Luxembourg, who were told their \"sweetheart\" corporate tax deals are also illegal under EU treaties . \nThe EU's competition regulator ordered both governments to claw back €20m-€30m from Starbucks (Swiss: SBUX.SW - news ) and Fiat (Hanover: FIA1.HA - news ) in unpaid taxes earlier this week. \nJean Claude Juncker - prime minister of Luxembourg for two decades - now heads up the Commission, which is the EU's executive arm and guardian of its treaties. \n• EU rules Starbucks 'sweetheart' tax deals are illegal state subsidies (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:55:42.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
