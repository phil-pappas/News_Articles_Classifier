I know most of us would say that the trading platform should be user friendly and speedy. This is of course a highly desirable factor by one and all but besides this, there are many other things that one must always see. Online broker, the term in itself, means that the broker will be online and will interact through online means which have to be really efficient. There are no two thoughts about it. But there are certain other important things like research reports and portfolio analysis etc., which differentiates one online broker from the other. For example, online investors want information or resources so that they could manage their money properly. They need to know how their asset allocation is changing as one investment advances. They want to know how they are doing this year in comparison to the broad market. And therefore, many online share trading stock brokers in India now let you pick and choose among an array of educational resources that include Web tools, downloadable software, online videos and even one-on-one consultations with advisers for qualiÔ¨Åed customers. The concept of free trading is also becoming quite common with some of the top online brokers. Exchange-traded fund providers are partnering with online brokers to offer free trading of their funds. However, investors have to be really sure in this case first. Brokers offer free trading on only a limited number of funds, have different account requirements and may charge fees for frequent or short-term trading. And also, options are different from most investments. They are more complicated than stocks and hence, education is crucial. So, brokers who provide options, also need to educate their customers on it. Now, let us move away from the desktop or laptop investors and see the growth of mobile investors who prefer to trade through their mobile Internet applications. So, when we talk about online brokers in India, there are few who have started offering mobile trading option as well. Smartphones and tablets can provide access on the go to real time quotes and news, streaming charts, stock research reports and technical analysis. The best mobile platforms are so capable that most of investors nowadays prefer to trade on them even when they are sitting at their personal computers.
