My mortgage payments at that time were £1,004 a month. \nIn order to reduce them and the mortgage balance I made a one-off overpayment of £20,000. This wasn’t the simple task it should have been. Eve Savage, Kent \nThere were stumbling blocks in getting this transaction going. Then making the £20,000 payment proved fraught. Your bank, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , passed you from pillar to post during numerous calls. \nYou were by now setting up a small gardening business. This level of hassle in the busy summer months was not what you needed. \nWhen the part repayment did seem at last to have been processed, monthly repayments were confirmed at £582. You told the bank you wanted to make monthly overpayments of £115, which is within the limits allowed to avoid an early repayment charge. Then you learnt that the interest rate had changed. The bank wrote that “the part redemption of £20,000 has been cancelled, resulting in an increase to the mortgage balance”. You were told your monthly payments would now be £1,057. \nYou persistently contacted the bank to try to sort all this out. \n• Why won't Barclays let us move our mortgage? \nThen you received a notice saying that the agreed payment arrangement had been cancelled at your request. You had asked for nothing of the kind. \nFurther to my involvement, Barclays asserted that it had put everything right and was paying you £650, which incorporated overpaid interest and £100 for goodwill. But these latest figures did not add up. \nI asked Barclays to look over this another time. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) now realised that it had not refunded a £449 early repayment fee that had been unfairly charged. This explained the discrepancy in the figures. \nThe bank seems pretty hopeless to me. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:51:24.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
