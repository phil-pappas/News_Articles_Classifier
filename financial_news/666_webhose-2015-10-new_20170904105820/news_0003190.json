The Company's board should be commended for responding to the material shareholder concerns expressed at last year's AGM.\n \"Furthermore, we note that the Company has also adequately aligned executive remuneration and company performance in the past year.\"\nISS said the Newcrest board had made enough changes to win back shareholder support.\n\"There has been concerted effort by the Company to address shareholder concerns by making improved disclosure and presenting clear metrics which align the company's financial performance with executive and shareholder outcomes. Accordingly, a board spill at this time is unlikely to be in shareholder's interest given the work undertaken by the company,\" said ISS in a note to clients.\nDespite the proxy advisors' support for the remuneration report, the pay package awarded to Mr Biswas continues to raise eyebrows.\nMr Biswas earned $5.65 million in the year ended June 30, including superannuation benefits and performance bonuses.\nAbout $2.25 million of that was guaranteed base salary, with Mr Biswas having one of the most generous base salaries in the mining industry.\nDespite changes by Newcrest to ensure a greater amount of Mr Biswas's pay is \"at risk\" and his incentives are aligned with shareholder interests, ISS said the size of his package continues to be of concern.\n\"It is still not without concern that the quantum of total remuneration for the CEO remains substantial, if not considered by some shareholders as excessive,\" said ISS in the note.\nMr Biswas's fate is no doubt helped by the company's improved performance, which has been partly reflected by the 40 per cent share price rise in the past month.\nBloomberg lists contrarian fund manager Allan Gray as the fourth-biggest shareholder in Newcrest, and chief investment officer Simon Mawhinney said Allan Gray intended to support this year's remuneration report.\nBut Mr Mawhinney added he did not believe a spill of the board would be as disruptive as the proxy advisors had suggested, and he said a spill motion should proceed if shareholders give the gold miner a second strike.\nColonial First State Global Asset Management is another major holder of Newcrest shares, and its resources fund manager Todd Warren said last week that inflated pay packets were continuing to be an issue across the mining industry generally.\nWhen asked if recent executive pay cuts at several big miners, including BHP Billiton, had eased shareholder concerns about excessive remuneration in the resources sector, Mr Warren said the debate was continuing to rage.\n\"Has the broader issue been fixed across the industry? That is a tough question, I think there continue to be issues, and the standard response is always that 'our pay is in line with our peers', which is a little bit trite,\" he said, when asked about the industry generally.\n\"It is obviously company specific but we have voted against some corporate pay packages where we felt the overall remuneration packages rewarded to executives were excessive, and we will continue to do so.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/pgker"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:10:19.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
