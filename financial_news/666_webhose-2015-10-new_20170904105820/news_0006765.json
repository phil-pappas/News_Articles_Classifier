The summit is taking place at the Hilton Back Bay Hotel in Boston and is an absolute must for those who work in the finance industry!\nThe role of the Controller is evolving dramatically, as many senior finance roles are. As such, they are working more and more with the CFO and other departments in the analysis and formulation of solutions to more strategic issues. They are also integrating with operational areas across the organization to supply financial and non-financial data, as well as providing users who work in these areas with the tools to enable self-service access to informational sources.\nThe Controller Summit aims to explore the evolving role of the controller and how they can deliver robust financial and corporate control. Gathering 100+ leading finance professionals to participate in keynote presentations, in-depth panel session and Q&As, will delve deep into today’s hot topics and challenges.\nWe have recruited high-calibre speakers from global organizations to give you an insight into their experiences, whether successes or failures, and the methods that have streamlined their accounting processes. Hear from Controllers from the likes of Nokia, Hershey, Ocean Spray, Clarks, Pfizer & many others\n'This summit will see Controllers from some of the world's most prestigious organizations share insights about the most pressing challenges they face, and how they are confronting them,' said Emma Taylor, Global Events Director. 'Delegates will have the opportunity to get involved with interactive discussions, and take new ideas back to their own companies.'\nTopics will cover key themes from the changing role of the Controller, to partnering with the CFO, to accounting transformation. The Financial Controller at The Economist will be discussing ‘Improving Internal Control and Streamlining Processes Through Shared Services,’ while integrating operations responsibilities within Controller/finance roles will be uncovered by Russian Standard.\nDue to high demand, passes are now very limited.
