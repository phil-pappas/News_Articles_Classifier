Photo: Louise Kennerley\nThe lengthy process of strata reform in NSW is nearing completion with the introduction into Parliament of the Strata Schemes Development Bill 2015 that will give effect to several significant changes.\nAmong the important changes are those that relate to the collective sale or redevelopment of freehold strata schemes.\nThe reform aims are said to be to deliver urban renewal and boost housing supply in the places that people want to live through the termination of an existing strata scheme and the redevelopment of the building.\nProbably, the most contentious aspect is the requirement that only 75 per cent of owners need to agree to such a process instead of the present 100 per cent agreement. However, as things stand, there seems to be uncertainty as to whether the 25 per cent who do not agree would – or indeed could – be properly compensated in all circumstances.\nAdvertisement Importantly, it is not clear how housing supply will be boosted unless consideration is given to planning controls, such as floor space ratios. Historically, floor space ratios applying to older-style flats have tended to reflect the size of the existing buildings on the basis little change is expected.\nThe state government may need to make provision for increases in floor space ratios in areas deemed to be appropriate in order to provide the necessary incentives for the broader aims of parts of the legislation to be achieved.\nHowever, if incentives are to be provided, how will the value of those incentives be reflected in the compensation paid to owners who do not wish to participate in the collective sale and renewal process? Present indications are that market value will be paid but will the method of valuation resolve the age-old problem of what compensation should be paid to those unwillingly losing the homes in which they have lived for many years?\nThe government needs to resolve these critical uncertainties as the bill makes its way through the parliamentary process and answer these questions now before it is too late for equitable outcomes to be ensured for reluctant disposed owners in circumstances where development incentives are put in place.\nHarvey Sanders is an urban planner, a consultant with Design Collaborative, Planning and Development Consultants, and an adjunct associate professor of Urban and Regional Planning in the Facility of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:42:26.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
