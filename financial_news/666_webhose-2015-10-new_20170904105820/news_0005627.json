Another good way to beat inflation is to invest regularly so that you earn as the markets rise. But the best way to ensure that you have both the things in hand - a life insurance and a good investment in the market - will be opting for a good Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP). Yes, ULIP not only covers your life risk but also invests your savings in good shares at regular intervals. The best feature of such a policy is that it ensures your money is invested without you having to bother about it. While there are various benefits associated with the policy such as cost-efficiency, flexible investment (aggressive, debt, balance), tax-friendly, life cover,investment and protection longer period etc. another good option that the policy offers is fund switching. Fund switching are options given to policyholders of ULIPs to move their investments from one fund to another, within one plan. You can transfer units fully or partially between fund options like equity, debt and mixed combination.Typically, ULIPs offer pure equity, debt and balanced fund options for their customers. Mostly, each ULIP can invest in a minimum of 4-5 funds. And, the policyholder is allowed to choose the funds where his or her money will be invested depending on his or her personal preferences. The good point about fund switching is that most ULIPs do not charge for the initial 6-7 switches, however, if still wish to switch your funds more than these attempts then they may charge some amount for it. To lure customers and stay in the stiff market competition some companies have eliminated this cap on free switches altogether in policies launched after September 1, 2010, enabling policyholders to make as many switches as they wish during a policy year.BenefitsFund switching is one of the best feature in ULIP because it allows you to move out of loss making funds and channelize your wealth in other funds where you can see the money grow. However, at the end it's all about learn & earn method. Policyholders should track the performance of their Ulips and switch when necessary, as the premiums that you pay are reasonably high and losing money after that will not serve the purpose. You can track your schemes' performance in ULIP, with the help of the net asset value which is declared periodically. Even at the time of investing, you get all details (fees and expenses deducted) or the break-up of the premium and the total amount invested.Switch Time Technically, there is no such method for investors to time the markets. But anticipating the ups or downs will help you curb your losses. Switch funds if you are not happy with a fund's performance or foresee a dip in the market. It is advisable during volatile markets, switch your funds to safer (debt) options and optimize opportunities. You can transfer a large portion of your investment to debt funds, and switch these back into equity once the market picks up again.However, it is not that easy that you just get up one fine morning see the market dip and plan to switch your funds. You need to switch it in a phased manner. Insurance companies allow three switches over six months in an attempt to leverage different stages in the market cycle. Therefore, develop a systematic method, analyze markets, understand the forecasts and then plan to switch funds. A golden principle, \"Nearer to your goal, switch to a debt fund to reduce risk and protect your capital.\" For switching you will need to fill a fund switch form or write to the insurer giving clear written instructions to transfer funds. You need to mention exact details of amount to be transferred, your plan type and existing funds along with the new fund ratio opted for. If you ever feel there is slightest of doubt in your minds, consult financial experts and then instruct the fund manager for switching. Your risk appetite, age, goals and dependents are the other factors to consider before switching in ULIP funds.[Source: http://www.articles.mastercraftindia.com/Article-Site/switching-gears-accelerated-income-ulips] About the Author I am sandeep working with insurance comapny as insurance adviser owing good knowledge of various policies such as Retirement pension plan, ULIP , term insurance and so on.
