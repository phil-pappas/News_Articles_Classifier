However, education in India, at least the commonly perceived 'quality education' as imparted by acclaimed and influential educational institutions, is decidedly costly and not easily available to everyone- especially those who deserve it based on merit alone. Thus, education loans are vitally important. A barebones explanation for an education loan is thus, 'funds offered by financial institutions to meritorious and/or deserving students so that the latter can pursue their basic/higher education, in India or abroad'. Almost all banks in India offer education loans, and the demand for it has remained stable with the Indian student community.Why Choose Education Loan?The question should ideally be, why choose an education loan over a personal loan, or the money accumulated in your savings account? The versatility and advantages of education loans are listed below-Education is Expensive-It's a matter of instant availability. A comprehensive education loan frees you from the task of accumulating sufficient money to fund your son/daughter's higher education. And, with inflation and shifting prices, can you ever be 100% certain? A good education is expensive and the expenses aren't changing in a predictable curve. A good education loan scales accordingly and helps you be safe from unexpected surprises.Specialised Help-The expenses incurred through a standard study course are many, caution deposits, library fees, building deposits, laboratory fees, etc. With a comprehensive education loan, individual facets of the course can be better addressed without the risk of running out of money.
