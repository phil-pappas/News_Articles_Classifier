Photo: AP\nGeneral Electric rose to a seven-year high amid better-than-estimated quarterly profits, leading an advance in US stocks as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index posted its longest weekly winning streak since May.\nEquities stretched further above an area where a series of prior rebounds from a summer selloff had stalled. The leadership today shifted, however, to health-care and consumer shares, rather than this month's stalwarts - energy, raw-materials and industrials - as those groups lagged amid a rising dollar. GE rallied 3.4 per cent to its highest since September 2008.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 74.22 points, or 0.43 per cent, to 17,215.97, the S&P 500 gained 9.25 points, or 0.46 per cent, to 2033.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.59 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 4886.69.\nFor the week, the Dow rose 0.8 per cent, also registering a third week of gains, while the S&P 500 was up 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq gained 1.2 per cent.\n\"Investors are keying in on earnings season, which will really get rolling next week,\" said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust, which oversees $US2 billion. \"It's been a good week and month to date, which has the S&P back close to even for the year. The numbers are better than how it feels. Other issues, such as China, have quieted down.\"\nThe focus on quarterly results is intensifying, with earnings at S&P 500 members projected to have fallen 6.7 per cent in the last quarter. Energy and materials companies will see the steepest drop, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley, International Business Machines, Boeing and Microsoft are among 118 companies in the index scheduled to report next week.\n\"We're in a window right now of roughly between 2000 and 2050 (for the S&P) that is fairly important for the market. That's the point at which the market broke down in August. If we can hold above 2000, that would be good thing,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\nAlso, he said, \"we're in the better part of the year from a seasonal perspective. Certainty with the selloff that we've had in the third quarter, it sets up for potentially a good fourth quarter.\"\nGE shares rose 3.4 per cent to $US29.98, hitting their highest level in seven years, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. The stock was among the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and Dow.\nTwitter rose 4.8 per cent to $US31.15 after Bloomberg reported that former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer owns a 4 per cent stake in the company.\nStocks are rebounding from their worst quarter in four years, while investor sentiment oscillates between concern at the ripple effects of China's slowdown, and optimism that the Federal Reserve will delay increasing interest rates until policy makers are satisfied that overseas turbulence won't derail US growth.\nTraders now don't see better-than-even odds of borrowing costs rising until March next year. The probability of an increase this year is 34 per cent, down from 39 per cent a week ago, after weaker-than-expected data in both the US and China pushed out expectations for a rate boost.\nReports today were mixed, with US factory output falling in September for a second month as high inventories and lukewarm demand from overseas customers kept American producers bogged down. A separate report showed consumer sentiment climbed more than forecast in October as lower-income Americans projected wage gains will accelerate and falling energy prices helped stretch paychecks.\nWith Reuters ï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:15:02.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
