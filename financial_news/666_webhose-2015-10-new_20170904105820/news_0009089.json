Then sums of £10.50 and £9.24 were taken from my bank account under two separate direct debits. The second amount was a mystery to me. I called Talkmobile and it disclosed that the latter sum related to a number that has absolutely nothing to do with me. I was told this would be sorted out but now the company is threatening me with legal action and other severe measures if I fail to pay £11 against the mystery mobile number. How can I have an account without my prior consent or knowledge? ME, Essex Despite sending it many emails and letters over the intervening months, things remained unresolved. After I approached Carphone Warehouse, which was then dealing with such queries, a spokesman said: “We are sorry to hear about the difficulties which Mrs E experienced when she updated her existing contract with Talkmobile. Following an investigation we can confirm that the unwanted account has been set to cancel within 30 days and all overdue payments have been removed. “As a gesture of goodwill the customer has been offered £30.” None of this was done. • 'Vodafone billed me for phone I do not own' The running of Talkmobile’s customer service base had meanwhile been transferred from Carphone Warehouse to Vodafone, Talkmobile’s parent company. It seems that, during the transition, Carphone Warehouse had thought that Vodafone was dealing with this but had still taken it upon itself to issue me with the statement Quote: d. I now went to Vodafone which revealed that, when you contacted Talkmobile originally about the account you already had, a second one had been opened mistakenly. This incurred a £9.24 charge, which was taken automatically from your account by direct debit. The company has now refunded this sum and paid £75 for goodwill. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:37:54.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
