TSB has already been carved out of Lloyds Banking Group, while Williams & Glyns is in the process of being spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland. \nA number of industry experts said the watchdog had not gone far enough. \nJayne-Anne Gadhia, chief executive at Virgin Money , a challenger bank, said: “It is a small step forward but not transformational. I’m pleased that there is some progress but disappointed that it is so limited.” \nThe British Chambers of Commerce said the CMA’s proposals were “unlikely to be game-changing”, adding that many businesses “will be disappointed with the results”. \nRichard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: “The CMA inquiry has to bring about better banking, but these proposals don’t go far enough. \n“The CMA’s own evidence is that consumers are disengaged from the banking market, so better information and nudges to switch will not be enough.” \nNonetheless, Alasdair Smith, chairman of retail banking investigation at the CMA, warned that the proposed measures would have a “far-reaching impact” on how banks operate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:38:12.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
