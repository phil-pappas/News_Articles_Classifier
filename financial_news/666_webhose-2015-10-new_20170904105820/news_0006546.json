Photo: Eddie Jim\nThe man who brought Topshop to Australia is betting a 100-year-old Italian sneaker is going to be this summer's must-have footwear.\nHilton Seskin​ is testing the appetite for Italian-made Superga​ sneakers with a pop-up shop in the original Australian Topshop store in Chapel Street, Melbourne.\nThe in-store sneaker boutique is the first phase of a national roll-out of Superga stores over the next three years, including a flagship store in either Sydney or Melbourne and then at least two other stand-alone outlets.\nMr Seskin founded the Rebel Sport chain before seizing on the Australian franchise for Topshop after he watched the invasion of international fashion juggernauts such as Zara and H&M crimp sales at his Glue Store retail chain.\nAdvertisement Topshop is owned through the Next Athleisure group, a partnership between Mr Seskin and Next Capital private equity group and Myer, which took a 25 per cent stake in Austradia, the Australian franchisee of the British high street fashion brand, in September.\nMr Seskin predicted Topshop's sales could hit $300 million in the next few years after Myer committed to roll out 20 Topshop and 20 Topman concessions across the department store network.\nNext Athleisure sales , including Glue Store, Topshop and wholesaler Trend Imports, doubled in the past two years to about $200 million.\nTrend Imports group general manager Helder Borges​ secured the distribution rights for the Italian footwear brand about a year ago.\nAustralian shoppers have taken to the brand – one of the only sneaker collections in the world with a strong female skew – and kept Trend on its toes just to keep up with demand.\nMr Borges believes as many as 2000 Superga pairs could walk out the door in the first year after the launch of the pop-up in Topshop Chapel Street and there are plans for up to eight smaller pop-ups in other high-trading Topshop stores.\nSneakers have made a big resurgence across both women's and men's fashion and as the market matures, so has the design, becoming increasingly personalised as consumers chase individuality\nThe magic of Superga, Next Athleisure says, is its reach across the entire fashion sector, from luxury to mass market, as illustrated by its collaborations with brands from Disney to Roberto Cavalli.\n\"It makes the brand so unique and when you look at the success of Topshop, it's all about bringing out things that are on trend,\" Mr Seskin said.\nNext Athleisure will be hoping the Superga buzz will bring customers into Topshop amid fierce competition for fashion dollars.\nMalcolm Turnbull's ascension to the top political job appears to have steadied consumer sentiment.\nHowever, Mr Seskin said the challenge, as always, was to keep ahead of the competition.\n\"There is money to be spent; if you have a good restaurant in Australia, it's always full. It's about how good your offer is in comparison to someone else,\" Mr Seskin said.\n\"There's no recession for someone doing a great job . . . and sneakers are as hot as it's ever going to be.\"\nTo mark the Australian launch, Superga has joined with a high-profile Australian designer to develop a limited edition sneaker and there are plans for another big-name collaboration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:58:19.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
