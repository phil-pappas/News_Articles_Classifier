Louise kennerley Share on twitter by Perry Williams Two years on from being the very public face of live sports betting, Tom Waterhouse is relishing a step back from the spotlight.\nThe 33-year-old became a member of Channel Nine's rugby league commentary team in early 2013, spruiking live odds as part of his relentless bid to build the Tomwaterhouse.com wagering brand into an online betting force.\nThe promotional blitz worked – at least from a business perspective – with the bookmaker doubling the number of punters to 200,000 in a little over a year.\nBut the backlash over the live promotion of betting on primetime television was brutal: a reprimand from the Gillard government and some of the public led Waterhouse to apologise and eventually cull his appearances.\n\"Standing up on live TV doesn't really float my boat,\" Waterhouse admits in an interview with Fairfax Media at his Sydney office. \"But in two years Tomwaterhouse.com went from 1000 customers to 200,000 customers which was a massive journey. But it was that ride of building the brand that was the excitement of it – not going on TV. That's nerve-wracking stuff, that's a nightmare.\"\nWhile he clearly regrets the public fallout, his timing from a marketing perspective could barely have been better. British wagering giant William Hill was scouring the market to build up its presence in Australia after splashing $660 million on Sportingbet and its subsidiary, Centrebet.\nThe fast-growing Tom Waterhouse brand was an obvious target. And with a rumoured marketing spend of $25 million a year, Waterhouse's beaming face was hard to miss.\nWilliam Hill pounced with a $40-million deal to buy Tomwaterhouse.com Hill in August 2013. A year later Waterhouse was named chief executive of William Hill Australia, where he described his ascension as a \"dream come true\".\n And then silence. For the last 12 months, Waterhouse has largely disappeared from public view.\nIt's been a deliberate strategy by the British owners of William Hill: the gradual phasing out of Tom Waterhouse the brand so Tom Waterhouse the chief executive can roll his sleeves up and challenge industry leaders Sportsbet and Tabcorp at the top of the corporate bookmaking ladder.\nIt hasn't been an easy task. William Hill's latest results for Australia showed the amount wagered with it by customers had fallen in Australian currency terms by 23 per cent to $1.02 billion for the six months to June 30 while operating profit was flat at just $19.2 million.\nWaterhouse admits it has taken some adjustment to steer the brand in the right direction.\n\"This is obviously a far bigger ship,\" he says. \"Tomwaterhouse.com was like a speed boat and you could move very quickly but with William Hill we have had to step back, reset the business and now we are focused on growth.\"\nA big part of its mixed fortunes has been the huge influx of competition into the Australian wagering market in the last few years spurred by the easing of government regulations in the last decade surrounding cross border betting.\nWilliam Hill has lagged the growth rates of its Irish rival, Paddy Power's Sportsbet, and Tabcorp's online operations while also facing pressure from Tatts Group's Ubet, fellow British rival Ladbrokes and the James Packer-backed CrownBet which is aggressively pitching for market share.\nBut Waterhouse is confident William Hill Australia will give its rivals a run for their money partly due to the size and clout of its parent company.\n\"I think scale globally is very important in regulated markets and I think William Hill made their intentions known because they bought in at scale. It's a massive advantage because you can take the hits in terms of short term pain to deliver good for the long term,\" he argues.\n\"Entrants which have tried to enter the market organically have seen significant losses and you've seen other players who have been here a while that can't keep up with the IT product, and the marketing and tactical offers you need to be on top of.\"\nWilliam Hill Australia has embarked on a big drive this year to hire dozens of digital experts which allow the wagering firm to develop its own quickfire app content including the controversial 'in-play' betting service.\nHe points to the different tech teams dotted around the company's CBD office, many of whom have only been hired in the last few weeks.\nIn addition to his own company, Waterhouse has faced the task of integrating Sportingbet and Centrebet into the William Hill strategy. While both were well known brands, they were pitched at different ends of the market.\nSportingbet had a large share of the 'high roller' market in horse racing – repeat punters who might wager up to $1000 a bet over the phone – while Centrebet focused on luring younger gamblers to the sports world via the fast growing digital world.\nWaterhouse, who built his career as Australia's biggest on-track bookmaker, had personally witnessed horse racing attendances dwindle as technology made internet betting a more attractive proposition.\nThat realisation led to the creation of Tomwaterhouse.com in 2010. The trend also convinced William Hill's British owners that its Australian arm should aim to tap the fast growing internet and smartphone app markets for growth.\n\"The best online marketeers in business are online bookmakers,\" says Waterhouse. \"In the last two months we've changed completely how we're operating as a business. Our competitors have apps, but they do not have the ability to move at our pace.\"\nWith a staff of over 300 in Sydney and Darwin, Waterhouse says William Hill can now bring new betting products to market in just two weeks compared with up to nine months for some of its rivals.\n\"Customers are increasingly thinking one company is giving me something new every nine months whereas with William Hill I'm getting a more exciting product all the time. And I think that's a winning proposition.\"\nWaterhouse is staking a big bet on punters signing up for 'in-play' betting where a bet can be lodged on a smartphone app during the live play of sports - despite the practise potentially the federal government's Interactive Gambling Act.\nIn Australia, punters can bet on the outcome of an event after it has begun, but only via the phone or in person. Such in-play betting is outlawed on online platforms, including smartphones.\nHowever, William Hill claims that so long as punters keep their smart phone microphone on it still adheres to the rule that live bets during sporting events are made by phone only.\nDespite his confidence, many in the industry suggest it will be a slow road to success for William Hill particularly given the rampant growth of Paddy Power's Sportsbet in the Australian market and Tabcorp's strong retail and online presence.\nBut Waterhouse said he will be there personally to see the job through and is as excited about the challenge now as he was when he first started his own online brand five years ago.\n\"You've got operators here in Australia that have been around 50 plus years. These are land based operators that have got the highest brand awareness in the market,\" says Waterhouse. \"But can our growth rate go faster than any of the other scale operators? Yeah I'm pretty confident we can do that. Can we get higher retention rates, better acquisition, net promoter, satisfaction scores than the others? Yes I think we can.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-10-05T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:05:12.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
