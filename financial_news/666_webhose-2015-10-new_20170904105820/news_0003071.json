The other woman's body was found inside a suitcase on the balcony of the apartment, authorities have said.\nThe grisly murders of the two women, described by Hong Kong media as prostitutes, shocked the city, which has a low homicide rate. After being charged for the double murder, Jutting was found fit to plea following a psychiatric assessment at the end of 2014.
