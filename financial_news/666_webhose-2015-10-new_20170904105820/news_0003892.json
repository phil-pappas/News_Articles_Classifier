Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is already facing the risk of a strike as workers have rejected its tentative labor deal by an overwhelming majority of 65%. Fiat was chosen as the “lead bargaining company” by the UAW (United Auto Workers).\nFiat has the lowest hourly wages among the big three automakers. Moreover, the company has almost 45% of its workers under “tier-2,” which typically offers less pay and fewer benefits than other tiers. These two issues have long been a point of contention between Fiat and labor unions.\n\nOther automakers Considering the tough stance taken by the UAW in its negotiations with Fiat, Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) appear to have a bumpy ride ahead as they proceed further into negotiations with the UAW. Together, General Motors and Delphi Automotive (DLPH) form ~3% of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY).\nRecord earnings Ford’s North American operations posted pretax profits of ~$2.6 billion in 2Q15. This is the highest ever profit posted by Ford in North America. General Motors’s (GM) North American operations also posted a record adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.8 billion in 2Q15 at a margin of 10.5%. With record earnings and a largely positive outlook, Ford and General Motors could face tough negotiators across the table.\nThis is unlike labor negotiations in the steel industry, where plummeting profits and a bleak outlook leave little elbow room for labor unions.\nAnother issue automakers have been facing is the spate of recalls over the last year. We’ll discuss this in detail in the next part of the series.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - US Auto Sales Boom in September, but Stocks Continue to Fall Part 2 - Can Auto Sales Continue Their Upward Trajectory?
