Now comes the first payment on your student loan. \nMost student loans have six-month grace periods that are ending for May and June grads, with those first payments usually due in October or November. Finding out the exact date--and the amount of the payment--is on the borrower. Student loan servicers, who are being paid by the Department of Education (ED), can't be counted on to give their customers a heads-up. Borrowers have to contact servicers to ensure that they have accurate information on when and where payments have to be made. \nThey should also pick a payment plan at ED’s website through the student loan estimator to determine the lowest interest rate for which they qualify. Those who don’t will be put into the ten-year plan, which comes with fixed monthly payments. Lower monthly payment plans are available but those loans are more expensive as the time it takes to pay them off is extended.
