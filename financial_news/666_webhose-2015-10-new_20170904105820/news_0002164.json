Thai owner SSI has gone into liquidation, threatening 1,700 job losses at the plant and thousands more in the supply chain. \nThe Official Receiver, Ken Beasley, said: “SSI was placed into liquidation with substantial debts and had no funds available to purchase the coal needed to keep the coking ovens operational. \n“There is no realistic prospect of a buyer being found and the priority now is to close the ovens down safely. I cannot continue to draw on taxpayers funds to keep the ovens operational when there is no realistic prospect that a buyer will be found. I am continuing my liquidation of the company, including talking with interested parties about purchasing the company’s other assets.” \nThe Government is holding a summit on Friday to discuss the crisis in the steel industry. \nBusiness Minister Anna Soubry said: “I had hoped that a commercial buyer for the coke ovens could be found but unfortunately this has not happened. This news is very, very disappointing and my thoughts are with the workers and their families. \n“The government will continue to focus on making sure we do whatever we can to help people. Our package of up to £80m will help with retraining and enable local firms to grow and create jobs.” \nGareth Stace, director of trade body UK Steel, said: “This decision makes the possibility of rescue more remote. But it reinforces the importance of this week’s summit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:26:10.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
