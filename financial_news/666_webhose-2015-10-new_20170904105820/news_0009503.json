Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Trade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim nations sealed a major regional trade and investment accord spanning 40 per cent of the global economy that will open up new markets for Australian businesses and farmers.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was finalised on Monday morning in Atlanta following six days of fraught negotiations led by the United States.\nAustralian dairy farmers will be able to sell more butter and cheese to the United States and Japan, while sugar farmers scored more modest access rights to the protected US market.\nThe TPP will improve on Japanese tariff and quota cuts for local beef and other farm gate produce secured by the Abbott government in the free trade deal with Tokyo last year.\nThe TPP is Mr Robb's fourth and biggest trade deal, adding to pacts with Japan, China and South Korea .\nThe accord will set sweeping new rules for trade, investment, intellectual property, labour, data storage, state-owned enterprises and the environment across Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam.\nIt is the largest trade deal since the Uruguay Round in the 1994 set up the World Trade Organisation.\nA standoff between Australia and the US over intellectual property protections for biologic medicines held up a final multilateral deal for days, before the US on Sunday backed away from its demand for at least eight years of data exclusivity.\n A political deal was reached allowing Australia to retain its five years of data exclusivity for the results of clinical trials of cutting-edge biologic drugs, without forcing Canberra to adjust any laws or regulations.\nThe talks were nearly the final opportunity to seal the TPP ahead of expected rising anti-trade rhetoric in the lead up to next year's US presidential election and Canada's election on October 19. Talks broke down without conclusion in Hawaii in July and the Atlanta meeting was billed as a crucial event.\nâ€‹The TPP is a key part of the Obama administration's \"rebalance\" to Asia, to take advantage of the 3 billion middle class consumers expected to emerge in next 15 years, and to help offset China's rising influence in the region.\nIn the final hours before the deal was announced, New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser was locked in discussions with US Trade Representative Mike Froman about dairy quotas.\nMore to come", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:11:30.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
