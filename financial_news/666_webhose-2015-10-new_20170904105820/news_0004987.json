Sergey Guneyev Share on twitter by Tony Walker In a post death-cult era of a realist Australian foreign policy a new Prime Minister and his Foreign Minister have received an early lesson in realpolitik.\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin's brutal gambit of deploying Russian special forces and ground support aircraft, backed by drones and helicopter gunships represents an astonishing affront to a muddle-through Western strategy in Syria.\nIn what could be described as a diabolical version of the Russian Game Trap, Putin has slammed his pieces onto a Syrian chessboard in such a way the US and its allies have been left scrambling for a defence against Moscow's ruthless intervention to prop up a client.\nMalcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop would be wise to consider next moves judiciously since America and its allies have now been confronted with a very different scenario from that which prevailed a week or so ago.\nThen, the US and fellow members of the anti-Islamic State coalition could preserve the myth they were bent on \"degrading, destroying and ultimately defeating\" IS when in fact what we were talking about was a containment strategy which lacked definition.\nUS President Barack Obama was, more than likely, willing to run down the clock on Syria, doing enough to try to prevent it causing the region's further de-stabilisation without committing American forces to combat.\nObama's critics sometimes forget he was elected on an anti-war platform. His mission was to end American involvement on the ground in the Middle East, not to perpetuate it.\nThe US president's main goal has always been to achieve a nuclear agreement with Iran that limits the possibility of the US having to go to war with the Islamic Republic. That considerable achievement is in sight.\n Now, however, the US and its allies, including the moderate Arab states like Saudi Arabia, are facing an extraordinarily complex – completely unwanted – set of circumstances that will demand a response, and relatively quickly.\nScrambling to formulate a response The White House was scrambling late this week to formulate a rejoinder to the Putin gambit, but as the week came to an end it was not clear US policymakers were close to a reasonable response to a series of Russian moves American intelligence should have foreseen.\nAmerican policy and, therefore, Australia's set too much store by the assumption it was only a matter of time before Syria's mass murdering dictator Bashar al-Assad fell. That possibility has been forestalled by Russia's intervention, and a further deployment of Iranian forces.\n\"Russia's deployment in Syria underscores the reality that the periodic hopeful reports that the Assad regime may finally be crumbling are likely to be mistaken again,\" says Philip Gordon, until April coordinator in the Obama White House on the Middle East.\n\"Russia, let alone Iran, is not going to allow the regime to fall unless and until they believe that whatever replaces it will not threaten their core interests.\"\nThat's the point. Assad's lenders of last resort – Russia and Iran with the support of the Iranian proxy regime in Baghdad – now have too much invested in Syria to let go without their investments being redeemed.\nWhatever happens next in Syria, Washington cannot disregard Russian and Iranian interests even if the US and its allies would prefer to ignore completely Moscow's and Tehran's interventions.\nThe best outcome The best outcome would be a brokered diplomatic solution in which Assad was shoved aside in favour of an acceptable alternative, but that possibility seems more remote now than it did a week or so ago.\nAt the United Nations this week Foreign Minister Julie Bishop canvassed the possibility of Assad leading a \"national unity\" government as part of a Syrian settlement. She spoke prematurely before the US made it clear it would not accept Assad's continuation in power.\nRetaining the Syrian dictator at the head of a \"national unity\" government would be like asking Pol Pot to head such a government in Cambodia after having brutalised tens of thousands of Cambodians.\nAssad's place is before a war crimes tribunal in The Hague on trial for torturing, maiming, gassing, and killing tens of thousands of his fellow Syrians.\nNot to mention his contribution to what is arguably the greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II.\nIn this latest \"post death cult\" period, the appropriate response in Canberra is to hasten slowly, and eschew a military role that would deepen our engagement beyond the current level of air strikes.\nArguments will be made for increased military involvement from the \"do something\" school. They should be set aside.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@tonywalker1"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:11:33.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
