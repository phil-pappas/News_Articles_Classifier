Adding to the financial strain, they also pay among the highest average weekly rents at £92.60. \nThe city, in West Yorkshire, also suffers from crowded primary schools, and just 44pc of pupils achieved five GCSEs at A-C grades, said uSwitch. \nHowever, residents benefit from costs of essentials such as energy, food and council tax, as well as cheaper house prices, with the average cost of a terraced house at £91,000, according to Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) . \n= Top 10 places to live = *Edinburgh *Solihull *Hertfordshire *Northumberland *South Lanarkshire *Berkshire *Darlington *North Lanarkshire *York *Inverclyde, East Renfrewshire & Renfrewshire Scotland as a whole performed particularly well, with Lanarkshire, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire among the top 10. \nThe report assessed 138 local areas taking into account 26 factors to provide a complete picture of the quality of life in each region. \nThese included average salaries, disposable household income and the cost of essential goods such as fuel, food and energy bills, as well as lifestyle factors such as working hours, life expectancy and hours of sunshine. \nThe researchers found that one in four people in west London work more than 45 hours a week, compared to 15pc in the Orkney Islands. \nHowever west Londoners are paid the most, compensating for the long hours. Average full-time salaries in the area are £35,464. And with an average annual gross disposable household income of £39,602, west Londoners are more than three times better off than households in Leicester and Nottingham, where average disposable incomes in each of the cities are just above £11,700. \nWomen in Buckinghamshire live the longest, as do men in Surrey while Glaswegians have the shortest life expectancy. \nGlasgow has long had a higher deprivation level than other large cities in the UK. The Scottish city has a life expectancy of 73.4 for men and 78.7 for women, according to official figures published separately this month. This compares to a UK-wide average of 79.1 for men and 82.4 for women. \nNottingham pays the most in council tax at £1,676 a year, despite having the second lowest disposable income in the UK. Belfast pays the lowest rate of council tax at £819 a year. \nEnergy bills are highest in Northern Ireland and lowest in Scotland, said uSwitch. \n= The 10 'worst' places to live = *Bradford *Kingston Upon Hull *North of Northern Ireland *Eilean Siar (Western Isles) *West & South of Northern Ireland *Blackpool *Devon *Central Valleys *East of Northern Ireland *South Teesside", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:48:45.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
