Hulu competes with another OTT (over-the-top) operator, Netflix (NFLX), that is rapidly expanding into international markets including Europe and Asia.\nIn September this year, Hulu started offering an ad-free option plan for its users priced at $11.99 per month. Currently, Hulu’s free service is ad-supported, while its $7.99 per month service provides content with fewer ads.\n\nThe above chart indicates the ad-free subscription price for Hulu and the subscription prices for Netflix and Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Instant Video service. While Amazon’s Prime Instant Video service is the cheapest at $8 per month, Netflix is still more popular. Hulu is trying to catch up with Netflix in this regard.\nWhy Hulu won’t expand internationally One of the reasons Hulu has lagged behind Netflix is its lack of original content. Lack of original content could also be the reason that Hulu may be hesitant to expand internationally. It would not be able to gain subscribers rapidly abroad if its content was not popular among users.\nHowever, Hulu is also acquiring original content and acquiring exclusive SVOD (subscription video-on-demand) rights. Earlier this year, it acquired exclusive SVOD rights to a variety of programming from Turner Broadcasting (TWX).\nAnother reason that Hulu is not looking at international markets could be a pricing issue. Hulu entered Japan a few years back, but it had to sell off the Japanese service, as it was priced too highly in the Japanese market.\nYou can gain a diversified exposure to Comcast by investing in the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (QQQ), which holds 2.6% of the stock.\nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Comcast Launches Web Video on Its X1 Platform Part 2 - Facebook Is Testing Out a New Video Channel Part 3 - Baidu’s iQIYI Partners with Lions Gate Entertainment in China Professional Services Hulu Netflix", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:58:05.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
