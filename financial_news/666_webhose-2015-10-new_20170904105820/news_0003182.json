Review after review features complaints about fake estimates, jacked up final prices (and your goods are held hostage on the truck until you pay up) and broken furniture. In a recent column in the New York Times , consumer advisor the Haggler wrote of one moving company: “The firm is unmoored from the physical world, so it is hard to tell who owns it or where it is. It offers lowball bids and takes payments online, handing the labor and trucking part of jobs to incompetent subcontractors. It seems to exist in the ether.” There is no point in learning the company’s name, because the name changes. It has no street address. And it leaves behind a trail of damaged furnishings and ripped off consumers. But it is not alone. It sometimes seems there are more cooked movers and than honest ones. But move we sometimes must . Into a newly bought apartment in the same city perhaps, or maybe it is crosscountry to take a new job. Note: probably the safest moves are company paid for their employees and new hires when it is the company - generally a large corporation - that has a standing relationship with a moving company, usually a national brand. Relax. That move probably will go well. It’s the ones we arrange ourselves - after Internet research, maybe checking with Better Business Bureaus - that too often turn into messes. Understand this: sites that feature crowdsourced reviews of movers are worth skimming, but scuttlebutt that is whispered in the moving business is that some of the worst movers are among the best at peppering review sites with bogus positives. So read critically and don’t take review sites as definitive . Absorb what was said there: do not trust crowdsourced review sites for movers. Many are said to be gamed by determinedly bad movers who believe we will be swayed by the glowing reports they file about themselves. Just don’t be. It’s not hopeless however. There are steps that experts said produce solid results for consumers. Start by checking if a mover is licensed by searching the U.S. Department of Transportation database , urged Manuela Irwin of MyMovingReviews.com. That will show interstate movers. For local moves, within state boundaries, check appropriate state and local agencies. In New York, for instance, it is the Department of Transportation . Understand: some slippery movers have been known to hijack a legitimate mover’s license number. Doublecheck that the names and addresses of moving companies match the records at the licensing bureaus. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:34:24.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
