It was originally planned to be $1.6 billion but was oversubscribed.\nTrafigura has indicated its 2015 financial year performance, which runs to the end of September, has been strong, boosted by increased storage and trading opportunities in oil following the near halving in prices since last year.\nRead More Bank of England keeps rates at 0.5% as doves grow louder\n\"We have an open line of communication with the Bank of England and other regulatory authorities and we're always happy to discuss any aspect of our funding or business models,\" Trafigura said.\n\"We have extremely strong access to bank liquidity.\"\nBankers said that while commodity houses that have a greater reliance on mining and producing the products they trade would have a larger exposure to underlying prices, there is no evidence even so-called \"asset heavy\" traders are in real financial distress.\nGlencore, which made more money from mining than trading following its takeover of Xstrata before the commodity crash, has seen its shares fall almost 60 per cent so far this year and 75 per cent since it first listed at 530p in 2011.\nIts shares hit an all-time low of 67p a share on September 28 but have since rallied by 85 per cent to trade at 122p on Thursday, helped partly by a stabilisation in copper prices.\nAsian commodity trader Noble Group , which is battling allegations of aggressive accounting as well as lower commodity prices, has fallen 65 per cent in 2015.", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2da47ee8-6dd1-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html#axzz3nqGqjaLl", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/868ab0d2-6d6c-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html#axzz3nqGqjaLl", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/93d17212-6ddf-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html#axzz3nqGqjaLl"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:48:30.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
