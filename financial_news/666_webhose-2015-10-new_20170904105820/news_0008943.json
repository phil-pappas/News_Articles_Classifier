Kinross takes such allegations very seriously and action was immediately taken in accordance with Kinross' Whistleblower Policy. External legal counsel was immediately retained to conduct an objective internal investigation into the allegations. \nIn March and December 2014, and July 2015, Kinross received subpoenas from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") seeking information and documents on substantially the same subjects as had previously been raised. In December 2014, Kinross received similar requests for information from the United States Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\"). \nKinross is fully cooperating with the SEC and DOJ and continues to diligently pursue its own internal investigation, which, over the course of the past 25 months, has not identified issues that Kinross believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or business operations. Our internal investigation is ongoing, and additional issues or facts could become known as the investigation continues. \nIt is important to note that the SEC subpoenas expressly state that: \"This investigation is confidential and nonpublic and should not be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violation has occurred, nor as a reflection upon any person, entity or security.\" \nKinross is committed to operating in accordance with the highest ethical standards and conducting business in an honest and transparent manner that is in compliance with the law. Kinross has a longstanding culture of ethical conduct and accountability consistent with its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related anti-corruption compliance program. \nAs this is an ongoing regulatory matter, Kinross will not be commenting further at this time. \nAbout Kinross Gold Corporation \nKinross is a Canadian-based senior gold mining company with mines and projects in the United States, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Mauritania, and Russia. Kinross maintains listings on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX: K.TO ) and the New York Stock Exchange ( KGC ) . \nCautionary statement on forward-looking information \nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained or incorporated by reference in this news release, including any information as to the future performance of Kinross, constitute \"forward looking statements \" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including the provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario) and the provisions for \"safe harbour\" under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.
