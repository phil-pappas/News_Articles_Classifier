Having sold sterling ahead of inflation which was predictably low, they bought the pound on labour data which has tended to provide more optimism. \n\"The jobs numbers this morning were better than expected and that helped the pound cover all of yesterday's losses,\" analysts from Citi said in an update for U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . clients. \nNotably, after consumer prices fell last month, pay growth in the three months to August was also a touch slower than expected, and rates markets actually pushed back pricing for a first rise in Bank of England interest rates further into next year. \nYet sterling's rise was stellar. By 1630 GMT, it had gained \n1.3 percent on the day to $1.5447, its biggest daily rise since May and taking it to the highest in almost a month. Against the euro, sterling rose 0.8 percent to 74.08 pence . It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) had touched an eight-month trough of 74.93 pence per euro on Tuesday after the inflation numbers. \n\"Real incomes are going up. which is good for domestic activity, so we think May will probably be when (the Bank of England) starts raising interest rates,\" said ING currency strategist Chris Turner. \nHe said he believed BoE Governor Mark Carney's position that a serious debate will start on tightening around the end of the year. A number of other analysts say the same, yet there is little evidence that investors as a whole agree: credit markets don't price in a rise until the end of next year. \nSome analysts said sterling would continue to be supported by SABMiller's merger with Anheuser-Busch InBev -- which is worth 69 billion pounds in cash and will take time to pulse through the market. \nBut others said sterling was unlikely to strengthen much against the dollar, even if it might against the euro. \n\"Rather than advancing higher or attempting to recover momentum against the dollar, it looks far more likely that sterling will continue drifting towards $1.51, with this being the level where traders found confidence throughout previous weeks that this might be a 'bottom' for the pair,\" wrote FXTM analyst Jameel Ahmad.
