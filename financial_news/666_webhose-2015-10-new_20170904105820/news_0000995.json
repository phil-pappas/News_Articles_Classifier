New emoji were introduced in the first OS X 10.11.1 beta. Subsequent betas have not included any other outward-facing changes. \nIt is unknown what the first update to OS X El Capitan will bring aside from updated emoji, but as a minor .1 update, it’s likely to focus primarly on bug fixes and performance improvements for issues encountered following the operating system’s official release. According to Apple’s beta release notes, OS X 10.11.1 offers stability, compatibility, and security improvements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:17:52.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
