The bank offered $40 million in a foreign exchange auction, state news agency MENA reported, but the bank has not yet announced the results of the auction. Commercial banks are now selling the dollar for 8.03 Egyptian pounds. Banks are allowed to trade the dollar at 10 piasters higher or lower than the auction price, while exchange shops can add another 5 piasters. Meanwhile, the dollar has jumped to 8.40 Egyptian pounds at the black market which has resurfaced despite measures taken earlier this year to crackdown on it, an official at a currency exchange shop told MENA.

In July, the bank also depreciated the Egyptian pound twice, allowing it to dip by 20 piasters, falling from 7.53 to its previous price of 7.73 against the dollar. On January 18, Egypt allowed the pound to weaken in front of the U.S. dollar for the first time in six months. Egypt said the step was taken to eliminate the unofficial currency market, known as the black market. In a second blow to the parallel market, the central bank capped on February 5 the amount of dollars that can be deposited in banks. The central bank holds three foreign exchange auctions every week.
