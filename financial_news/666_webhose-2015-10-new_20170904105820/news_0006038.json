Monrovia, named after the fifth President of the United States, James Monroe, is an old undeveloped city that has been stagnant for several decades, primarily due to years of war, bad governance and misrule. Some Of The major roads in the city and other parts of the country are terribly broken while others might take some time to be rehabilitated apparently due to lack of money to finance most of them. It is presumed that the underdevelopment of Liberia is due - in part - to bad roads across the country. And as much as government is making some strives to tackle some of them, it is uncertain whether the issues of bad roads will be addressed before the tenure of the government expires in 2017. Interestingly, What Is so weird about these roads is that some have either been rebuilt or rehabilitated twice or more. For each time they are rebuilt, especially those in the city and its environs, after a year or two, they became to fissure and depreciate, apparently due to poor engineering by contractors or lack of maintenance. Along these lines, it would be naïve and inappropriate to cast blame on contractors, because as they say, the amount of money paid justifies the quality of road built. What We Do not know is whether the due diligence exercises done by government and other partners actually fetch out the best candidate. We know several roads in Monrovia and local communities have been poorly built for which the Liberian government is now considering rebuilding and/or paving some of them again. Amid these concerns, the Liberian government, through the Ministry of Public Works has announced the pavement of Bardnesville Road during this dry season. Speaking Thursday on Truth FM Radio, Public Works Minister Gyude Moore said money is allotted in the 2015/16 budget for the pavement of Bardnesville to Caldwell Road. The People Of Bardnesville have over the years experienced bad road, as a result, government has decided to find permanent solution to their road problem by paving it. Minister Moore also said other roads would be worked on during this dry season including Duport Road, Clara Town, streets in Sinkor, Logan Town, Gabriel Tucker to St. Paul Bridge route, Marshall Road, among others. He said the Ministry of Public Works submitted US$100 million in the 2015/16 budget to rehabilitate major roads across Liberia but only US$23 million was approved. Minister Moore believes the US$23 million is woefully inadequate. With This In mind, we are not certain whether the conditions of the Bardnesville road and other community roads would be addressed. Hence, we may see some of our roads reconditioned, but remember that the quality of road is determined by the cash you pay. We Strongly Believe that in the absence of quality roads, our development agenda will regress because of the lack of roads connectivity and the shoddy approach we attach to matters of importance in the country. Therefore, government must place premium on the kind of structures or roads we intend to build in these contemporary times. The kind of structures build will determine whether they will exist for less than five years or last for several decades. By building roads and other structures that last for more than fifty years, our country will not have to spend money every other time when our roads are not properly built. It Is Important for the Liberian government to set standards for the construction of roads in the country or else, we will continue to experience sub-standard road projects.
