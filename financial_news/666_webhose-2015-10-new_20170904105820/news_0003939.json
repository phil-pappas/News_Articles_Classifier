It expects to deploy excess cash in buying back its own shares from the open market over the next two years. The company also announced the retirement of the $8.6 billion worth of authorization remaining on its $15 billion existing share buyback plan.\nWalmart has repurchased shares worth more than $15 billion over fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2015. This year, it has bought back shares worth $1.7 billion year-to-date.\n\nDividends Walmart is a dividend aristocrat, one of the few companies in the S&P 500 Index that has raised dividends for a period of at least 25 consecutive years. Walmart has hiked its dividend per share (or DPS) for 42 consecutive years. It’s projecting a dividend per share of $1.96 in fiscal 2016, up 2.1% from the $1.92 per share paid out last year.\nFellow dividend aristocrat Target (TGT) is aiming at a dividend payout ratio of 40%, with a 5%–10% increase in annual dividends through fiscal 2020.\nWalmart currently has a dividend yield of 3.3% compared to the following peers as of October 16, 2015:\nTarget (TGT) – 2.8% Costco (COST) – 4.3% Kroger (KR) – 1% Walmart and Target make up ~2.1% of the portfolio holdings in the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY) and 1.4% of the holdings in the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD).\nImplications The announced dividend and share buybacks are likely to provide some appeasement to Walmart shareholders in the face of anticipated headwinds over the next few years. But the fundamentals of what’s behind the value return plan are more troublesome.\nThe declines in EPS (earnings per share) projected for fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2019 include the impact of the buybacks. This understates the actual decline in earnings from Walmart’s operations. It may also imply that Walmart is anticipating a period of moderating earnings growth.\nFor more updates and analysis, please visit our Consumer Discretionary and Retail page.\nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Walmart Stock Suffers as the Company Slashes Earnings Outlook Part 2 - Can Walmart Achieve Its Three-Year Revenue Growth Target?
