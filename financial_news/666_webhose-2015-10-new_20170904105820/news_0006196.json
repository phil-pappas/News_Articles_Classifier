Revenues were down 6.4 percent at $23.54 billion. \nJPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, said earnings in the corporate and investment bank segment fell 12.9 percent. This closely watched business saw lower revenues in fixed-income trading, partly offset by higher revenues for equity market trading. \nChief financial officer Marianne Lake said there was \"reasonably broad-based market turbulence\" in the third quarter due to worries about the slowing Chinese economy and uncertainty about when the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. \nThe volatility also resulted in lower earnings in asset management. Client assets under management fell one percent to $2.3 trillion, the result of \"clients moving money out of market-sensitive categories,\" Lake said. \nOn the positive side, JPMorgan scored a four percent gain in consumer and community banking, thanks in part to stronger mortgage banking earnings and increased auto and credit card loans. \nTotal (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) loans rose 8.9 percent to $809.5 billion. \nResults were boosted by $2.2 billion in tax benefits, including a gain of $1.9 billion from resolving tax audits. \nLake said the tax benefit was related to the financial crisis, but declined to elaborate. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) said the large boost would not likely be repeated in future quarters. \nJPMorgan cut non-interest expenses. Headcount is down about 6,700 from last year at 235,680. \n\"We had decent results this quarter,\" said chief executive Jamie Dimon in a statement. \n\"We saw the impact of a challenging global environment and continued low rates reflected in the wholesale businesses' results, while the consumer businesses benefited from favorable trends and credit quality.\" \nEarnings for JPMorgan translated into $1.32 per share, five cents below analyst expectations. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of JPMorgan fell 1.4 percent to $60.71 in after-hours trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:02:17.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
