Between May 2014 and August 2015, 5,853 outward foreign remittances amount to Rs 3,500 crore, mainly for the purpose of 'advance remittances for import' was recorded.\n\nIn a communication to the stock exchanges, the bank said, funds were through 38 current accounts to various overseas parties numbering to 400, mainly based in Hong Kong and one in UAE.\n\"The branch did not adhere of EMA guidelines,\" the bank said adding that the matter to its notice in mid July following which the bank ordered an internal investigation. The bank had mailed cash transaction reports (CTR) of 33 accounts to Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Subsequently, the matter was reported to the central bank also.\n\"Of the total amount involved, only about 10 per cent has been by way of cash deposits with our branches and the rest 90 per cent have been received by real time gross settlement (RTGS) / national electronic fund transfer (NEFT) from various banks numbering over 30,\" the bank said.\nWhile the central bank has ruled out any systemic implications and sees the incident as a one off, but is likely to quiz several others banks from which money was transferred. A Bank of Baroda official said the funds were transferred from public sector, private sector as well as foreign banks.\nCentral banking sources indicate, that the incident may prompt the banking regulator to tighten anti-money laundering norms. The banking regulator has been talking in public forum voicing concern over banks meeting compliances. RBI practices a zero tolerance on violation of anti money laundering or know your customer norms.\n\"Similar problem is also observed in meeting the KYC/AML rigor in the banks. Not only is there a general lack of sensitivity about KYC/AML compliance needs, the adherence to laid down norms at the field level is often sidestepped on account of lack of skill sets, time or performance pressure,\" RBI deputy governor SS Mundra said at an event earlier this month.\n\"My sense is that a centralized, technology supported surveillance system would perhaps serve better for ensuring compliance to KYC/AML norms,\" Mundra added.\nThe bank clarified that there is no financial loss to the bank, though its shares dipped 5.5 per cent to close at Rs 176.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange while the broader indices ended 0.65 per cent down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:33:42.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
