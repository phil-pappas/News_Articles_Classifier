Others have simply asked: “Should I ditch it?” \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the dust has settled, it is time for a detailed, unemotional number-crunch to find out. \nSantander 123* was the saviour of the Santander brand. Five years ago, with the banking crisis still smelling fresh and just after the difficult integration of Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley, Santander was left staring up at the backsides of all other banks in my customer services poll. A frightening 62pc of customers rated it “poor”. \nYet by August 2015, the success of its highly innovative 123 account at drawing in new customers who didn’t remember the bad old days meant it was near the top, with 81pc now rating it “great”. An impressive turn around. \nOnly time will tell whether increasing the fee from £2 a month to £5 a month (so £60 a year) on the product that resurrected its reputation is brave or stupid. \nThe initial response certainly favours the latter, as my twitter feed, since I mentioned the news, demonstrates… \nA chunk of the anger stems from the fact people heard the news first in the media rather than being contacted by the bank. To be fair to Santander, that is just the result of good journalism by this paper , which got a scoop and published it: there is still a quarter of a year to go before the change actually happens . \n= The twin benefits of Santander 123 = \nThe 123 bank account is primarily targeted at those in credit. If you are regularly overdrawn it’s never been a competitive deal and the fee increase makes it even less so. Its two big draws are: \n1. Cashback on bills. If you set up direct debits to pay bills on this account, it pays cashback each month of 1pc on water, council tax and Santander mortgage payments (up to £10 a month on mortgage payments); 2pc on energy bills and 3pc on phone, broadband, mobile and TV. \nOf course this is only a boon if you are the bill payer, and use this account to pay them. There’s very little out there which compares. The closest is Barclays’ Blue Reward scheme, but Santander is far more wide-ranging. \n2. High (LSE: 0O9Y.L - news ) interest on up to £20,000 savings. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) pays 3pc interest if you have £3,000 to £20,000 in the account. While some other bank accounts pay up to 5pc, they do it on far smaller sums , the next highest being £5,000; so in total Santander can pay a lot more interest. \nIt is worth noting that both you and your partner can open one each and have a joint account between you, therefore sheltering £60,000 as a couple. To get these benefits you need to pay in £500 a month, so if you’ve a salary of over £6,000 you can just pay that in there, or arrange for money to come in from other non-Santander accounts. You also need to have two direct debits set up. \n= Is it still a winner after the fee increase? = \nThere are a number of ways to look at this, but the easiest one is that as the account is an outright winner on savings interest alone. If the cashback covers the fee, it is still worth it. \nWhile I could do lots of calculations, the best assessment is to ask existing users what they earn in practice. So after the news hit, I asked my site users to respond to a poll, and more than 2,200 did. The results are shown in the graph. How much cashback do you earn per year from Santander 123? \nAs you can see, cashback covers the cost of the fee for roughly 88pc of people currently, and will still do so for the vast majority (69pc) under the higher fee. Many earn far more, with the median average amount being likely near £150. So for most people the cashback alone covers the fee. \nYet if we now assume for some reason you made no cashback, is Santander 123 still worth it just for the savings interest? \nFor basic-rate taxpayers, Santander is a clear winner once you have £10,000 in, even after the fee. In fact, the cut-off point is £8,550 compared to Club Lloyds, the account paying high interest on the next largest amount ( unless you’re prepared and capable of playing by opening multiple accounts, as explained here ). \nFor higher-rate taxpayers the Virgin Money’s easy access cash Isa does just beat Santander on interest alone, but to get £20,000 in it would need two years of Isa allocation. \nAnd do note, from April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016 all basic-rate taxpayers will be able to earn £1,000 tax-free interest (higher-rate £500), which will increase the actual earnings Santander pays most people and will mean it stamps all over cash ISAs for higher-rate taxpayers. \n= So who should keep the account? = \nFew people who chose this account will either be earning interest without cashback or vice-versa: if you do, the sums above are pretty clear. \nYet most people get a combination of the two. If so, as a very rough rule of thumb, it is still a winner if you have more than £5,000 of savings (£10,000 if a higher-rate taxpayer) and earn some cashback, even if it is not quite enough to cover the £60 annual fee. \nSo while it is always frustrating when banks put their fees up, for most who chose it for the right reasons in the first place, Santander is still head and shoulders above anything else out there. \nIf you are annoyed at the rise, the best thing to do is gnash your teeth, growl a little and weep for the wonders of the low fee that was, but be careful not to bite off your nose to spite your face by leaving to punish it. \nHowever, if you have smaller savings and do not make much cashback, there are better options elsewhere. TSB* pays 5pc on the first £2,000 which is a strong performer at that level. \nAlternatively you could just grab the cash from an account that gives you a switching bonus. \nCurrently Clydesdale bank* gives switchers £150 plus 2pc AER interest on up to £3,000. \nGo via my site or MoneySupermarket. First (Shanghai: 603806.SS - news ) Direct* , which is number one-rated for customer service, gives new switchers £150* (£125 if you go direct), plus it has a linked 6pc regular savings account you can put up to £300 a month into, and a £250 zero per cent overdraft. Halifax* gives £125 to new switchers until 18 October then pays you £5 a month every month you’re in credit, regardless of the amount. \n= What about the Santander 123 credit card? = \nThe cuts here are severe and mean it will no longer trouble the best-buy tables. The fee will increase from £24 a year to £36 for new and existing cardholders in January. But the real issue is what it’s doing to the cashback for new cardholders. \nUnless you got a card before 16 September, the amount you can earn will be capped at £3/month on each of its three cashback categories; the 1% supermarket cashback, 2% department stores cashback and 3% petrol/diesel and trains cashback, which got so many commuters to sign up, (this one is currently capped at £9 per month). With a fee of £36 a year, this means the most you can earn is £72 a year, equivalent to £6 per month. \nThis is paltry compared to the American Express Platinum Everyday* card, which gives 5% cashback on all spending in the first three months (max £100) then tiered rates of up to 1.25% afterwards though it is less universally accepted (full alternatives in www.mse.me/TopCashbackCards). \nOf course, its only worth going for cashback if you repay the card IN FULL every month and never withdraw cash, to avoid the 12.7% representative APR (before the fee). \nYet this isn’t the only non-Amex credit card to cut its rewards, it’s one of a spate including Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) , Capital One (Dusseldorf: 8CA.DU - news ) and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . This is on the back of the EU limiting interchange fees - the amount businesses are charged when cards are used, used previously to subsidise card costs. For now Amex has escaped this cap on its own branded cards. \nMartin Lewis is a broadcaster and creator of MoneySavingExpert.com.
