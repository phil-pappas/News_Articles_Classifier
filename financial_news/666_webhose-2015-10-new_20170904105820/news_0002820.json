Since ownership of inventory does not hold by the said companies they can not offer ‘sale’ or ‘Discounts’ in totality on their online portals but they are doing so which also establishes that they are not marketplace and as such openly flouting FDI policy.”\nThe body also said it has complained to the Commerce Ministry to take action against these companies.\n“In a complaint sent today to Secretary, Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce, the CAIT has demanded that not only these companies be restricted to conduct such sales but necessary action should be taken against them for violation of FDI policy,” it added.\nCAIT said it has also sent a copy of their complaint to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman calling for their immediate intervention and directing the concerned officials to take immediate action.\nAt present, 100 per cent foreign direct investment is allowed in business to business (B2B) in e-commerce but FDI is not allowed in B2C e-commerce.\n 11, 2015 8:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:21:45.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
