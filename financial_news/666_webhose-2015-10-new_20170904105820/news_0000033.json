(NASDAQ, TASE: ALLT), a leading global provider of intelligent broadband solutions that empower communication service providers to optimize and monetize   improve their digital lifestyle, announced today the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition and its portfolio of pre-integrated services. Together, they comprise a complete Allot Virtual Network Function (VNF) solution underpinning the company's network functions virtualization (NFV) strategy aimed at easing service deployment and accelerating time-to-revenue for service providers. To that end, a Tolly Performance Report published today verified that a single instance of an Allot Security VNF delivered performance on the brink of 200Gbps while inspecting traffic at wire speed and performing URL filtering. \nCommunication service providers and cloud networks are embracing NFV as the new architecture for service delivery and operation. However, a number of challenges such as interoperability, service management and system integration have inhibited adoption potential. Allot is now helping its customers benefit from the NFV architecture and tackle these challenges by delivering a comprehensive VNF including pre-integrated services purposely designed for quick and seamless deployment in large-scale virtualized networks. Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition \nIntroduced to the market eight years ago, the Allot Service Gateway is a platform for the delivery and integration of data network services – ranging from visibility, control and security to customer engagement and monetization. Allot Service Gateway – Virtual Edition plays the same role in NFV environments, providing a virtualized framework for seamless integration and interoperability of VNFs. Pre-Integrated Virtualized Services View photo . \nThe Allot Service Gateway Virtual Edition's underlying framework provides service enablement capabilities including application awareness, big data collection and mediation, multi-tenancy, anomaly detection, network integration and control plane integration. The services operating in conjunction with the framework fall into the following three categories: customer visibility, customer experience and customer protection. Each virtualized service is a standalone VNF which includes the respective services and the underlying framework with all aforementioned capabilities. \n\"The Allot Service Gateway is all about best-of-breed service agility and efficiency from day one, providing service providers effective monetization opportunities,\" said Jay Klein, CTO, Allot Communications. \"Adapting the proven and popular capabilities of Allot's Service Gateway in a new framework with pre-integrated virtualized services prearranged as a VNF, allows service providers to enjoy a smooth deployment, free their networks of physical hardware constraints and quickly achieve the cost and efficiency benefits promised by NFV.\" Allot Continues NFV Innovation and Validation \nToday, Allot also announces that Tolly has certified the performance of an Allot Security VNF operating at 200 Gbps using Allot Service Gateway Virtual Edition. Tolly tested a single instance of an Allot virtualized security service together with the virtualized service framework to certify the solution's throughput and performance while running on COTS hardware. The hardware used was HP DL 380 Gen9 server outfitted with two Intel Xeon E5 v3processors and the hypervisor used was KVM. The tests included processing high volume traffic by the Allot VNF while performing layer 4-7 inspection and URL filtering. The results validate the product's ability to create a virtualized service framework that supports virtualized services that are pre-integrated for seamless deployment in NFV environments. \nAllot's track record of NFV innovation started in early 2013, with the deployment of a virtualized parental control service in a tier-1 mobile operator . Earlier this year, Allot also announced its participation in the HP OpenNFV Partner Program , offering Allot's Virtual Traffic Detection Function and a host of pre-integrated services that run seamlessly on the HP OpenNFV platform. To date, Allot and HP have verified interoperability of Allot's security services, with more to come. Allot is also a member of the Intel® Network Builders program , which is a focused development ecosystem focused on accelerating the adoption of NFV and SDN-based solutions in telco networks. Solution Showcase \nAllot will be speaking and showcasing its NFV & SDN solutions at the Layer 123 SDN & OpenFlow World Congress including a demonstration of pre-integrated customer experience and customer protection services. More details about the event: Layer 123 SDN & OpenFlow World Congress October 13-16, 2015 – Swissôtel Düsseldorf, Germany, Allot booth #25.
