Photo: Andrew Meares\nIt's hard to fault the timing of my old mate Paddy Manning. Here he was, quietly penning the final chapter of his unauthorised biography about Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull when Turnbull suddenly became Australia's latest PM.\nHow flukey is that? His book, How a Shy and Modest Bloke Reluctantly Became Prime Minister – just kidding, it's really titled Born to Rule – has some interesting insights into the country's fourth PM in four years.\nOne is Turnbull's penchant for a deal. When Turnbull set up shop as a merchant banker at Whitlam Turnbull he advised what is now called Fairfax Media, the proprietor of this venerable publication.\nEgged on by his mother, Lady Mary Fairfax, young Warwick Fairfax had launched his ill-fated $2 billion takeover bid for the 140-year-old namesake John Fairfax Holdings in August 1987.\nAdvertisement Family aside – and we are quoting prolifically from Manning's book, with his permission, for the remainder of this column – Warwick's bid was also \"commercial insanity\"; a sure sign being that West Australian entrepreneur Laurie Connell, founder of the Rothwells merchant bank, was to be paid the largest takeover advice fee ever negotiated anywhere in the world, a staggering $100 million.\nFrom the second the sharemarket opened on Black Tuesday, Rothwells was in dire straits. Connell needed money fast and, while trying to organise an emergency bailout for his bank, tried to assign the enormous Fairfax success fee to somebody else, at a discount, before he'd even earned it.\nVarious parties refused until a friend phoned Nick Whitlam, then on business in New Zealand. Whitlam then called Turnbull – he later wrote that, \"as was always the case, if you wanted Malcolm to become involved in something, it became his idea\". Turnbull ran hard with the deal, negotiating first with the State Bank, then with Sir Peter Abeles, but it fell through. Connell wound up making his own arrangement with Alan Bond, assigning him the fee for $68 million. It didn't matter: Whitlam Turnbull had earned its first $1 million fee.\nEventually, that led to another opportunity, Whitlam Turnbull would assist to refinance the First National loan right away. Thanks to Whitlam's banking connections it was able to arrange a $500 million loan with Citibank that would take out nervous junior lenders and tide Fairfax over until its major facility with ANZ fell due at the end of June. It bought crucial time for Warwick, who later admitted in court that if the facility had not been arranged, Fairfax \"would in all probability have gone under\".\n\"Until that point, Warwick had been in Laurie Connell's thrall. Now he realised what a real corporate adviser could deliver.\n\"[Whitlam Turnbull] prepared a number of detailed scenarios about what the company should do and the level of detail and, as I perceived it, the professionalism far exceeded any that I had received from the Rothwells team.\"\nA condition of the refinancing mandate was that Whitlam Turnbull would be appointed to advise on any asset sales by Fairfax. As Connell was consumed by the doomed effort to keep Rothwells afloat, Whitlam Turnbull quickly became Warwick's key adviser. As Whitlam wrote later, it was \"the deal that set us up\".\nThough Warwick's bid was in trouble, and the clock was ticking until debts fell due on June 30, Fairfax still had very desirable assets and there was plenty of interest locally and abroad.\nTurnbull quickly tidied the sale of Fairfax magazines to Packer, sold off Macquarie Radio, and went about garnering interest in David Syme, publisher of The Age and BRW .\nMost keen was Robert Maxwell, publisher of London's left-leaning Daily Mirror tabloid, who had offered $1 billion for a grab-bag of Fairfax assets, including Syme – effectively double what local investors were prepared to pay for The Age .\nSoon Maxwell raised his bid to $850 million in exchange for a few extra assets being thrown in.\nBut Fairfax took another road. More debt would allow Fairfax to cling to all its assets, including The Age .\nBut in April 1988, Turnbull was still convinced that the sale of Syme was the only way to stop ANZ taking control of Fairfax on June 30, and he pleaded with Warwick in the strongest possible terms to accept the Maxwell bid: \"I can only assume that you are contemplating some solution for your debt problem which involves the dealing of some equity at the John Fairfax Ltd level and which, for reasons I don't understand, you don't want us to be involved in. But please understand that if the banks exercise their security you may be faced with a situation where the equity in Fairfax currently held by you and your mother will be imperilled. Do you understand how grave the risks are?\"\nWarwick wrote back: \"When I decided to do this takeover, I knew all the risks and I assumed them. It was entirely my decision and I acted on my own judgment. I take full responsibility for that decision. I am not financially illiterate: I understand the situation and will deal with it in my own way.\"\nWarwick's way, of course, led straight to disaster – within two years, Fairfax crashed into receivership, saddled with a burden of debt it could not service. When it came time to pick over the Fairfax carcass, Turnbull would be among the vultures.\nWhitlam Turnbull's total fee take from Fairfax in 1987–88 was a whopping $7.6 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:40:59.348+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
