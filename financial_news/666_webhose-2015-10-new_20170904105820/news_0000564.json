We would like to become the first choice publisher for whistleblowers.” \nThe firm is also in talks with Ian Foxley, the defence executive who went public when he had concerns over a defence contract in Saudi Arabia. \nMr Moore said he wants to try to offer a different model of publishing, arguing that traditional publishing companies take an unfairly large share of the profits from successful authors, which they use to cover the costs of books which do not sell well. \nThe emergence of successful online publishing also inspired him to seek an alternative way to get his book to market. \n“I also watched the way 50 Shades of Grey which, by the way, I have not read went from being self-published to being a best-seller,” he said. \nMr Moore intends to fund his publishing house’s work on books through pre-sales and crowdfunding efforts, as well as taking a smaller slice of sales revenues. He said this will be closer to 25pc of sales, rather than the approximately 90pc which is more typical in the industry. \nHe wants his book and the others that he plans to publish to kick off a campaign to change attitudes towards money and greed. \n“The purpose of the book is to start a movement, we call it the New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) Wilberforce Movement [named for anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce] to free us all from the modern day slavery of greed, and from the damage it does to others, ourselves and to the planet,” he said. \n“It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a 20 year project… restoring ethics and integrity to society. Our dysfunctional relationship with the material world is something that we need to deal with.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:14:45.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
