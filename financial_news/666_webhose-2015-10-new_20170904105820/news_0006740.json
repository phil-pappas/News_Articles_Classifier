Several companies have announced the loss of export contracts due to the resulting lack of financing.\nSome conservative Republicans and political groups have targeted the bank as an example of \"corporate welfare\" for large, wealthy companies although supporters point out it also supports small businesses.\nThe move to force a House vote reviving the Export-Import Bank's charter is unusual. \"This is what happens when one chairman refuses to acknowledge the desires of two-thirds of the House and Senate,\" Republican Representative Mike Simpson said.
