What are his options? \nI am a retired police officer in receipt of a final salary pension worth over £45,000 a year. \nI will be returning to full-time employment again and was contemplating putting £100 per month into a fund to increase my pension. What is the best way to do this? GD, via email \nAs you are returning to work, you may be automatically enrolled into, or have the option to join, your employer’s workplace pension. You would benefit from an employer pension contribution. In the majority of cases this employer's contribution would make this the best pension scheme for you to join. \nIn terms of a private pension, the three main options are a stakeholder pension, a personal pension and a self invested personal pension (Sipp). \nThe best choice depends largely on how long you plan to invest before starting to draw your income and how much investment choice you are looking for. A low-cost Sipp suits most private pension investors, as it provides the greatest choice and, with the right selection, can be much cheaper than stakeholder pension or personal pension alternatives. \nDanny Cox, of advice firm Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , said with a £100 a month contribution a Sipp which charges on a percentage-points basis, rather than a fixed fee, is likely to be the most cost effective. \nYou should also check your entitlement to the state pension and whether there is the option to top this up, if you do not have a full entitlement or will reach state pension age before 6 April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016. The state pension has the advantage that it is indexed-linked, meaning it rises with inflation, and has a built in widow’s pension if you die first. \n'This pension loophole saved me £176,000' \nTop 11 questions people ask about pensions \nBut it is also important to think carefully about the tax implications of your investments. \nIf your aim is to increase your after-tax income, paying into a pension in your name may not necessarily be the best way to do this. \nAs a higher rate taxpayer, you should receive higher rate relief on your contributions. A £100 pension contribution only costs you £80 thanks to basic rate tax relief, plus a further £20 can be reclaimed via self-assessment. But when you draw your pension, after allowing for 25pc of the fund being tax-free, you will pay 40pc tax on the resulting income. \nDepending on the tax status of your spouse, you might achieve a higher income after tax by investing the same £100 into a pension in your spouse’s name. This works particularly well where the spouse is a non-taxpayer, or will be a non-taxpayer in the future. \nThe following simple illustrative example from Hargreaves Lansdown shows a £100 contribution being paid into a pension and then immediately and completely cashed in. \nHigher rate taxpayer Basic rate taxpayer Non-taxpayer Contribution £80 £80 £80 Plus basic rate tax relief £20 £20 £20 Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) pension pot £100 £100 £100 Higher rate relief £20 Benefits taken \nTax-free cash 25pc of £100 £25 £25 £25 Resulting taxable income £75 £75 £75 Income tax £30 £15 Net (LSE: 0LN0.L - news ) income £45 £60 £75 Plus tax relief reclaimed £40 £20 £20 Total returned from £100 contribution £110 £105 £120 An alternative to a pension would be to invest the same £100 into a stocks and shares Isa. This would not benefit from tax relief but will provide tax-free growth and dividends. \nHave a question for our experts?
