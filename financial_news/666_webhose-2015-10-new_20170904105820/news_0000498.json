Offering loans at a discount boosts investor yields and can also eat into underwriting fees and create losses for banks.\nA spokeswoman for New York-based Fullbeauty didnâ€™t immediately comment. Representatives for JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:28:36.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
