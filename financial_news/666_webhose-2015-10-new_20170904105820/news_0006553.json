Now Google’s answer, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) , is here, CMO Today reports. AMP purports to “make the World Wide Web great again,” Google’s head of news products Richard Gingras said. The details remain relatively scarce, but one distinguishing factor is that publishers using AMP will be able to use whatever tools they wish to sell advertising. And while content will load on pages before advertising, other details around targeting and tracking still need to be worked out.\nPAGE TURN : The New York Times NYT 1.70 % celebrated one million digital subscribers recently, but now the newspaper company is setting up a daunting challenge for the future: doubling its digital revenue to $800 million by 2020, CMO Today reports. Executive Editor Dean Baquet and Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson sent a companywide memo outlining the paper’s growth plans, which will focus on subscriber growth as opposed to chasing page views for ad dollars—an apparent dig at other media competitors. Messrs. Baquet and Thompson recognized that doubling digital revenue would also mean growing “engaged digital readers.” As it stands, about 12% of digital readers generate 90% of the Times’ digital revenue.\nIN PRINT : Speaking of newspapers, USA Today owner Gannett has agreed to acquire Journal Media Group JMG 5.46 % , which owns newspapers like the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, reports The Wall Street Journal. The deal values Journal Media, which had a market value of $192 million, at $280 million. The acquisition may be the start of the consolidation wave that some newspaper industry observers had been expecting, as companies gobble up papers that have been ditched and spun off from other big media companies and declined in value. Journal Media, for instance, was created out of a deal combining newspapers from E.W. Scripps SSP 6.12 % and Journal Communications.\nGAME ON : The eSports field is about to get a little more competitive. CMO Today reports that Endemol Beyond is introducing a new Web video brand called Smasher , which will house various Web series focused on videogames and competitive gaming. With YouTube’s new gaming platform and Amazon’s acquisition of Twitch in mind, Endemol Beyond thinks that marketers are starting to realize just how many people are watching other people play videogames. “Brands that are traditional in their approach will find this foreign,” said Vivi Zigler, president of digital, brand and audience development at Endemol Shine. “We don’t mind that at all. But this isn’t 12-year-old boys [watching this content]. This is fairly mainstream now, especially with men.”\nElsewhere SABMiller rejected a takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev [ WSJ ]\nFanDuel and DraftKings have barred employees from playing daily fantasy contests for money [ WSJ ]\nAmazon is still exploring whether to create a live online TV service with a major media company [ Bloomberg ]\nVimeo is rolling out a series of original content projects [ CMO Today ]\nHuffington Post editorial staff plans to unionize [ New York Times ]\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter was handed a 90-day ban [ WSJ ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @digitalshields , @VranicaWSJ , @JackMarshall , @nftadena , @perlberg , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox: http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/business/media/huffington-post-workers-plan-to-unionize.html?ref=media&_r=0", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-07/amazon-said-to-weigh-creating-a-live-online-television-service", "https://twitter.com/nftadena", "https://twitter.com/VranicaWSJ", "https://twitter.com/asharma", "https://twitter.com/JackMarshall", "https://twitter.com/wsjCMO", "https://twitter.com/srabil", "https://twitter.com/digitalshields", "https://twitter.com/perlberg"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:42:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
