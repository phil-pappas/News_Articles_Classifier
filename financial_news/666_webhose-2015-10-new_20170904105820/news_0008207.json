Photo: Brendan Esposito\nGlobal buyout firms, including KKR & Co and TPG Capital, have made preliminary approaches to Woolworths to express interest in its Big W discount store chain, people with knowledge of the matter said.\nThe private-equity firms have held early talks with Woolworths, as the retailer reviews its operations after its chief executive officer announced retirement plans in June, according to the people. The Big W chain could be valued at about $1.5 billion, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.\nDiscussions may not begin in earnest until a replacement for chief executive Grant O'Brien comes on board, and there's no certainty that Woolworths will be willing to part with the business, the people said.\nWoolworths, which also owns Australia's largest supermarket chain, in June cut its full-year profit forecast and said O'Brien would retire after less than four years at the helm. The Sydney-based company named Gordon Cairns as its new chairman August 28 as it unveiled its first drop in sales from its food and liquor stores since 2005.\nAdvertisement Big W, which competes with Wesfarmers's Kmart and Target outlets, operates 184 stores and accounted for 6.8 per cent of Woolworths's sales in the year through June. The discount chain's operating income for the year fell 25 per cent to $114.2 million.\nRepresentatives for Woolworths, KKR and TPG declined to comment.\nThe Woolworths supermarket business has been struggling against competition from Wesfarmers-owned Coles, which has matched or outperformed its larger rival in same-store sales growth for 22 consecutive quarters. It also faces a threat from German discounter Aldi and is trying to turn around the loss-making Masters home improvement chain, which it jointly owns with US-based Lowe's.\nKKR in 2006 led a group of buyout firms that offered $US18 billion for Coles Group. The offer, which was trumped by a higher bid from Wesfarmers, is still the biggest private-equity deal ever proposed in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:04:47.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
