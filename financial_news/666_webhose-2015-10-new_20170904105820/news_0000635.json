While the stocks collectively under-performed the MSCI World index by -1.7% during in the third quarter, the Credit Suisse's Global Focus List has outperformed the broader index by 2.5% in 2015. \nDuring the third quarter, stocks that stood out with positive performance - despite market volatility - included Southwest Airlines , having gained 15% for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Other global outperformers included Canada's Loblaw Cos. and Mexico's FEMSA . Underperforming stocks on Credit Suisse's global list included Marathon Oil Corp. and Devon Energy 6 Mid-Cap Health Care Stocks to Buy \nHere are the 17 U.S.-based companies on Credit Suisse's \"Global Focus List.\" The stocks are paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows -- and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n1. Affiliated Managers Group Inc. Industry: Financial Services/Asset Management & Custody Banks Year-to-date return: -16.7% \nCredit Suisse Rating/Price Target: Outperform/$253 Credit Suisse Said: We continue to look for 3-5 deals over the next 12 months. AMG announced a new Wealth affiliate in 2Q (bringing Wealth AuM to ~35B), and its deal pipeline remains robust, skewed towards Alternative Managers (currently ~35% of earnings). Additionally, we expect buybacks to provide support in the event of slower deal execution. Sell side estimates currently embed zero deals, limited buybacks. \nDiverse Manager Base coupled with resilient institutional flows have offset weakness in the retail channel (U.S. driven). Despite weaker industry flows, AMG posted OG of 2.6% (ann.) in 2Q vs. peer average of 0%. \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP as a Buy with a ratings score of B-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP (AMG) a BUY. This is driven by some important positives, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, notable return on equity, impressive record of earnings per share growth, compelling growth in net income and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: AMG's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 3.0%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 1.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. In comparison to the other companies in the Capital Markets industry and the overall market, AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP's return on equity significantly exceeds that of the industry average and is above that of the S&P 500. AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP has improved earnings per share by 32.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP increased its bottom line by earning $7.99 versus $6.49 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($12.77 versus $7.99). The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Capital Markets industry. The net income increased by 30.0% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $99.00 million to $128.70 million. Net operating cash flow has slightly increased to $351.40 million or 7.06% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow of 7.06%, AFFILIATED MANAGERS GRP is still growing at a significantly lower rate than the industry average of 107.32%.
