As the first major advisor custodian to open up its advisor platform to third-party software firms, TD Ameritrade has now integrated their Veo Open Access platform with more than 90 innovative technology firms. Those firms that maximize the use of TD Ameritrade’s Veo Open Access platform are awarded the Veo Integrated Awards.\nRoughly 500 independent RIAs who use TD Ameritrade’s Institutional services were surveyed to select the winner of the Advisor Satisfaction award.
