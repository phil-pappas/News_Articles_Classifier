Investors can now be guided through the online creation of their personal financial plan in a safe, objective, and unbiased environment via a private invitation only available from an advisor, firm, employer, or association. Upon completion of the myMoneyGuide Lab®, investors can request professional advice from the advisor or firm who invited them. All Labs are delivered by CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ certificants employed by myMoneyGuide. The \"Lab,\" aptly named due to its patent-pending interactive nature and live support, enables an individual to interact with both the software and a live support team to build a meaningful plan in real time and ask questions of software experts who can help them input their information appropriately. After receiving an invitation, invitees may select from hundreds of Labs available at times convenient to them, including nights and weekends. Example offerings include labs for those approaching retirement, those already retired, small business owners and even for those with a \"really good sense of humor.\" What makes these different from any other existing solution is that the attendees are guided through the process, educated on relevant topics, empowered with knowledge specific to their situation, and then provided a meaningful plan that they are encouraged to have reviewed, optimized and implemented by a professional financial advisor.\nOnce they've completed the Lab, the system identifies areas the attendee should discuss with their advisor such as their specific concerns, expectations, goals, health care costs, Social Security strategy election, risk tolerance, asset allocation, retirement age optimization, insurance and estate planning issues. The role of the advisor is enhanced – not replaced – by the process, and they benefit from being able to reach out to clients and prospects countrywide.\n\"Our absolute belief is that everyone needs and deserves a quality financial plan,\" says Kevin Knull, President of PIEtech, Inc. \"Until now, that was impossible, as the means of delivering a large number of high-quality plans just didn't exist. We make an important distinction between just any plan and a quality plan, as many financial plans don't include specific details such as the cost of health care, a Social Security election strategy, and the identification of the specific goals unique to each individual or couple.\"\n\"As the industry exerts additional pressure to drive fees lower and commoditizes asset management, the focus continues to shift toward quality advice and financial planning. We believe myMoneyGuide will accelerate the adoption of financial planning throughout the industry.\" Knull added, \"The real race among firms and advisors will be to see who can deliver a financial plan to a particular investor first – because we know the first one to offer and implement a financial plan wins the client relationship. Investors win because they can create a confidential plan in 90 minutes or less from their couch. And for associations, employers, and 401(k) plan sponsors, myMoneyGuide represents the future of a true financial wellness program for their stakeholders.\"\nAbout PIEtech, INC.\nPIEtech, INC., is the innovative creator of MoneyGuidePro®, the industry’s leading financial planning software.
