Jessica Shapiro by Jonathan Shapiro Sarah Thompson An independent research firm raised concerns about Slater & Gordon's accounts in a private report commissioned by one of the law firm's largest shareholders, global funds management giant Fidelity.\nThe New York based CFRA which specialises in forensic accounting and legal research told Fidelity on July 11th that it was concerned that Slaters & Gordon's revenue growth was not sustainable because of \"elevated work in progress and accelerated acquisitions\", and that acquired work in progress may have served to boost its cash receipts from customers.\nThe detailed report was published just days after Slater & Gordon shocked the market by confirming reports in The Australian Financial Review of a regulatory probe , at the same time it revealed an untimely accounting error.\nIt also came less than two weeks after Fidelity emerged as one of the biggest buyers of plunging Slater & Gordon shares before turning seller in the days that followed.\nThe report drawn from the 2014 financials painstakingly detailed concerns about a rise in work in progress – an accounting measure to book revenues for legal work on cases that had yet to be completed – that could be a sign of more aggressive estimates regarding project progress fees and the probability of success.\nThe report, which is circulating among the local funds management community, also pointed out that revenue growth had benefited significantly from acquisitions while acquired work in progress could potentially have been used to elevate acquisition revenues. CFRA estimated Slater & Gordon's organic growth to have been 5.3 per cent in 2014, 6.3 per cent in 2013 and 1.8 per cent in 2012. A recent Slater & Gordon presentation had those numbers at 35 per cent, 6 per cent and negative 2 per cent while its seven year compounded annual organic growth rate was presented as 13.8 per cent.\n'Acquired WIP' had also increased over time from 67 per cent to 80 per cent of the consideration of new acquisitions. This had the impact of boosting cash flows from operations by between 10 and 15 per cent in the following years as the revenue is collected while rising accounts payables may have also boosted cash flows through delayed payments, the report said.\nCFRA is an independent provider of forensic accounting and legal research, according to its website and was founded more than 20 years ago, and was previously owned by index provider MSCI. It says its clients are investment firms, insurance companies and regulators.\n The report's author is an accounting expert and PhD Zhen Deng who worked at UBS Investment Bank's global valuation and accounting team before joining CFRA in 2007. The firm did not respond to e-mailed questions at the time of publication.\nA Fidelity spokesman said the firm \"commissions a lot of reports as part of its research process but we won't comment on specific details - that is proprietary information.\"\nA Slater & Gordon spokeswoman declined to provide comment on the report and said that the company had addresssed the issues of WIP and organic growth in its full year 2015 results announcement, after the report's publication date. The full year results presentation showed organic growth grew at 13.8 per cent.\n\"The 2014 and 2015 accounts have been reviewed and signed off by the auditors as announced to the market in our statement dated 29 September,\" the spokeswoman said. .\nSlater & Gordon became the first law firm in the world to list in 2007 and has experienced an astronomical rise in value as it embarked on an aggressive acquisition strategy, rewarding investors with a share price surged more than 300 per cent from January 2013 to April 2015.\nBut following Slater & Gordon's controversial $1.3 billion acquisition of the Professional Services Division of London-listed Quindell, analysts, short sellers and the Australian Securities and Investment Commission began to ask questions about its accounting policies.\nOn June 30th, Slater & Gordon confirmed that it was the subject of an ASIC review whilst revealing it had found an error that overstated cash receipts and payments by around $90 million over a three year period , triggering a harrowing share price plunge that tested the faith of investors.\nCFRA said in its report that the error while not affecting the net amount of cash flow, did raise questions about the \"reliability of its accounts.\"\nJust prior to Slaters' shock admission Fidelity had upped its stake in the company above the 5 per cent substantial threshold.\nBut by the end of July the fund has reduced its stake to below the threshold. One Fidelity Fund, The Asian Values Fund, cut its position which portfolio manager Nitin Bajaj said was in \"the interest of prudence\".\nBajaj said in the fund's August report that even though \"most of the information that led to the stock decline has not been substantiated by facts\" he was \"conscious that it has led to extreme speculation\".\n\"As a result, the position was reduced to mitigate the unfavourable impact from the news flow related to these events.\"\nIt is not clear whether the report contributed to any selling of Slater & Gordon stock. Investment firms buy and sell shares for several reasons and to manage overall portfolio positions.\nSlater & Gordon has since published unaudited accounts, which required several amendments when the audited results were published on September 30.\nWhile short interest in Slater & Gordon has continued to rise to make it the second most shorted stock on the ASX, some investors have eyed a potential bargain in the view that the value of the business is worth more than its current market value, even after taking into account its issues. .\nSlater & Gordon shares traded on Wednesday at $2.81, 6 per cent lower for the month of October and down 50 per cent since the beginning of 2015.\nWhile Slater & Gordon is seeking to convince investors it has no further accounting issues, others have highlighted concerns relating to the $1.3 billion UK acquisition which was partly funded by a $890 million equity raising.\nQuindell is itself the subject of a probe by UK regulators and recently audited accounts showed the division acquired by Slater & Gordon had suffered losses of around $70 million in the five months prior to the change of ownership.\nSeveral portfolio managers are understood to have recently returned from the UK on a fact-finding mission hosted by broker CLSA.\nMeanwhile ASIC is now entering its 16th week of a painstakingly detailed review, which existing shareholders are hoping will be wrapped up shortly.\nWhen asked about the status of the review into Slater & Gordon ASIC head Greg Medcraft said he couldn't comment other than to say its \"ongoing\".", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/slater--gordon-confirms-asic-probe-accounting-error-20150628-gi06sb.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:06:24.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
