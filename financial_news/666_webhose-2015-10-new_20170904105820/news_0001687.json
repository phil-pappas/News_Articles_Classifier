Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Hats off to Slater and Gordon.\nAndrew Grech 's listed law firm has organised a day trip to their newly acquired UK assets ( which were bought off regulatory favourite, Quindell, in interesting circumstances ).\nSlater's investor relations manager Melinda George herself wrote to tell us about the \"invitation only\" trip.\nNot really. A few invitees let us know about the 8am to 6pm adventure to Slater's recently acquired sites in Blackpool, Liverpool and Manchester.\nThe invited have to pay their own way to schlep around the dreary business parks of northern England in autumn. It sounds horrible.\nBut then we checked the date: Friday, October 30, the day before the Rugby World Cup at Twickenham.\nUseful timing for visiting Antipodean analysts and fund managers in hunt of a work related travel tax deduction. Well played.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:06:44.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
