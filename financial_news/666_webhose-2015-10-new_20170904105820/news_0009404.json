Photo: AAP\nIt's the biggest trade deal in history, but consumers are unlikely to get much love out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. For those few of you who might have been waiting until after the deal to buy a new car or TV in the hopes prices will drop, you've probably wasted your time.\nWhile it may be weeks before the detail is known, economists said the impact on prices for consumer goods is likely to be minimal for a long time – if there is any discernable impact at all.\nAMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said the main benefit trade agreements offered to consumers came through tariff reductions, but tariffs were already so low that it was hard to see them falling much further.\n\"There won't be much on that front,\" Dr Oliver said. \"As tariffs come down it is sort of a gradual process. We won't suddenly see cheap cars or cheap TVs overnight.\"\nAdvertisement Besides, Dr Oliver said, we already have trade agreements recently negotiated with the countries that give us most of our manufactured goods like cars (from Japan) and household appliances (from China).\nEconomist Saul Eslake said the debate surrounding such agreements was often framed incorrectly as countries giving concessions to one another in exchange for access to one another's markets.\n\"To reduce tariffs and quotas – we describe that as a concession,\" Mr Eslake said. \"But the price of these things is invariably paid by one's own consumers.\"\nConsumers demonstrated little national loyalty when buying manufactured goods such as cars or appliances, and the supposed benefit of having barriers to other countries actually tended to harm domestic economies, he said.\n\"It is, in reality, a case of countries saying to each other 'if you stop dropping things on your own foot, we will stop dropping things on our foot'.\"\nThe most controversial reported area in the agreement that could have a direct impact on consumers was likely to be the debate over intellectual property on medicines, a point of focus in the most recent negotiations, Mr Eslake said.\nAustralia and other countries objected to the US position that would have allowed pharmaceutical companies to keep particular medicines secret for 12 years. It would have meant generic versions of those drugs would not have been available during that time.\nThe agreement reportedly allows the protection to last only five to eight years. The detail about the time frame is still unknown, and could be in what Mr Eslake called \"square brackets\" – areas that need final agreement before the deal is done.\nConsumer affairs watchdog organisation CHOICE demanded that the details of the deal be made available \"as soon as possible\", and called for a full cost-benefit analysis of the agreement to be conducted by the Productivity Commission.\nThe call was echoed by Mr Eslake.\n\"I wish that before agreements are irrevocably entered into, there was a process by which they were scrutinised, for example by the Productivity Commission,\" he said. \"I wish we had that. We don't, but we should.\"\nCHOICE has led a campaign for access to the agreement amid a range of concerns , including that the deal could result in more expensive medicine and weaker food-labelling laws, and expose Australia to lawsuits by international companies.\n\"The TPP has been described as a transformational, modern agreement that will deliver huge benefits for the citizens of nations involved,\" CHOICE's campaigns manager Erin Turner said. \"These claims have been made with no independent assessment and no cost-benefit analysis of the agreement for Australia.\n\"This agreement has the potential to impact every aspect of the Australian economy. It's too big to ignore the fine print which is why we need a full and transparent assessment of its impact before signature.\"\nDr Oliver said there may be a simple reason the gains for consumers from the deal had not been made public.\n\"Maybe it's because the gains aren't that great,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=270103a13e38b9f6643b82a8e&id=4e14ee5799&e=7a701aece9", "http://www.theage.com.au/business/the-economy/tpp-deal-pacific-countries-agree-to-historic-trade-pact-20151005-gk1vq2.html", "https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/consumer-rights-and-advice/your-rights/articles/where-are-consumer-interests-in-international-treaties-like-tpp"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:02:59.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
