This revolutionary technology delivers a unified trading platform across Smartphone, Tablet and Desktop YouTube Video \nTradesmarter WOW Platform LONDON, ENGLAND, October 20,   The innovative binary options technology provider TradeSmarter is pleased to announce the official release of their advanced WOW trading platform. This revolutionary responsive and adaptive single URL trading platform can be used across Smartphone, Tablet and Desktop. TradeSmarter claims that WOW will eliminate the key mobile funnel obstacles and allow the marketers to take advantage of today's' mobile traffic opportunity. This unified trading platform is also expected to significantly enhance the trader experience by providing an identical appearance and functionality across all devices. The different technology, functionality and appearance of trading platforms across devices have been a major limitation of the binary options industry. This inadequacy prevents marketers from running end to end mobile traffic funnels and reduces their conversion rate significantly. Moreover, the traders had no other alternative but to get acquainted with a different trading platform on each device. After a twelve-month long research and development project, TradeSmarter has come up with a solution to this problem through their new WOW platform. WOW Trading Platform facilitates a comprehensive end to end mobile conversion funnel from lead, through deposit all the way to \"auto login\" and actual trading on the same device. As a result, the marketers will be able to better utilize the mobile traffic opportunity and significantly increase their conversion rate. Furthermore, the WOW platform provides an identical appearance and functionality across the traders' mobile and desktop devices, which significantly enhances the traders' satisfaction and increasing its life time value. Talking about the company's new, innovative trading technology, the CEO of TradeSmarter Yoni Avital stated, \"The single URL platform concept will create an attractive CPA model across channels that brokers would prefer, and will eliminate the need for different business models for each of the channels.\" To find out more about Tradesmarter responsive platform, please visit http://www.tradesmarter.com/ About TradeSmarter: TradeSmarter Holdings is a privately held company established in 2008 by international professionals from the financial and Internet industries.
