It devalued the currency last November and later pegged the exchange rate in another de facto devaluation.\nIt instead resorted to rationing dollar supply by restricting access to hard currency for import of certain items, frustrating businesses.\nVice president Yemi Osibanjo has said Africa's biggest economy will keep the currency restrictions for now to preserve the country's foreign reserves but will eventually relax them.\nOn the parallel market, the naira closed flat at 224 to the dollar on Monday. The bank has been selling dollars twice a week to the parallel market since July, traders said, citing that the regulator is keen to narrow the spreads in both markets.
