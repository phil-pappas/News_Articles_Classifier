AP by Robert Johnson and Roland Czerniawski Expectations for the second reading of the second-quarter US GDP report were exceptionally high at 3.3 per cent inflation-adjusted GDP growth, but the US Bureau of Economic Analysis still managed to surprise everyone with a reading of 3.7 per cent growth.\nThe news was good enough to convince us that the US has a serious chance of growing more than our 2 to 2.5 per cent growth rate for all of 2015, exceeding Fed expectations of 2 per cent or less. However, inflation remained incredibly low, with sub-1 per cent year-over-year inflation growth. Even throwing out food and energy, inflation remained just above half the Fed's target of 2 per cent.\nTo be sure, part of the strong increase in the second quarter was because of the abysmal first quarter, when the economy grew just 0.6 per cent. Still, averaging the first and second quarters together, growth in the first half was over 2 per cent, not bad for all the world drama.\nEarlier this year, when China announced it was devaluing its currency modestly after a multi-year run, many investors correctly reasoned that China's economy must be slowing. Recent statistics have confirmed this, including the Caixin Purchasing Manager Index. So, there can really be no more denying that something is amiss with China's economy.\nThe August composite index fell from 47.8 to 47.1. That would represent the lowest reading in almost six-and-a-half years. Any reading below 50 demonstrates that more firms are reporting slowing than are showing growth.\nChina's growth has been moderating for some time. While the Chinese government has so far remained steadfast in its forecasts of 7 per cent GDP growth for 2015, this has always appeared to be a stretch. Something in the 6 per cent range for 2015 and dropping to the 3 to 5 per cent range over the next five to 10 years seems a more likely scenario.\nWhat does it mean for the US? The direct answer is, relatively not much. Exports of all goods and services that the US ships to China amounted to 0.9 per cent of US GDP for all of calendar 2014, with two-thirds of that being goods and one-third services. While there could be some shrinkage in what the US sells to China, it is hardly big enough to move the economic needle.\nPerhaps more affected will be multinational corporations that sell a lot to China, but ship those products from outside the US. Those firms did particularly well just after the recession ended, even as US GDP growth remained anaemic. We may now be seeing the reverse of that, where multinational earnings are hurt by weak overseas demand as the US economy continues to chug along. US commodity producers, especially the energy industry, are also suffering. However, commodity-oriented corporations suffering from lower growth and lower prices are likely to offset gains from increased consumer spending power.\n China's slower growth will continue to help reduce commodity prices. Energy, timber, copper and even paper prices have generally been soft this year and may become even weaker. That could help bring down the price of all new construction, which would be welcome news for home-builders and new homebuyers. It may even help tip the balance towards more homebuilding rather than the purchase of an existing home. A stronger housing market combined with a 10 per cent decline in commodity prices overall would help the US consumer more than slowing US exports to China would hurt.\nRobert Johnson is Morningstar director of economic analysis.
