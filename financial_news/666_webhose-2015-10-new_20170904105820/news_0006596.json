The hacked data includes names, addresses, Social Security numbers, birth dates and other forms of identification, such as a passport, driver’s license and military identification numbers. \n“We take privacy very seriously, and we understand that this news is both stressful and frustrating,” said Craig Boundy, CEO of Experian North America, in the press release. “That is why we’re taking steps to provide protection and support to those affected by this incident and will continue to coordinate with law enforcement during its investigation.” \n“Obviously I am incredibly angry about this data breach, and we will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,” said T-Mobile CEO John Legere in a separate statement . “But right now my top concern and first focus is assisting any and all consumers affected … I do want to assure our customers that neither T-Mobile’s systems nor network were part of this intrusion, and this did not involve any payment card numbers or bank account information.” \nOn Friday morning following the data breach announcement, Experian (EXPN) stock was down 5 percent while T-Mobile (TMUS) stock was down 3 percent, reports Investor’s Business Daily. Experian Has Been Hacked Before \nExperian is one of the three major credit reporting bureaus — along with Equifax and TransUnion — but that doesn’t mean consumer information is always 100 percent safe on its servers. Many recent data breaches — such as the Ashley Madison, Target and Sony breaches — were highly publicized, but many people might not be aware of Experian’s past hacks. \nIn 2013, Bloomberg reported that hackers illegally accessed Experian, Equifax and TransUnion users’ information. Bloomberg also reported on one incident that occurred at a Texas financial institution after its Experian password was stolen. In one weekend, the credit reports of more than 800 people who had never even done business with the bank were hacked. \nAnother data “leak” occurred sometime before the 2013 Target data breach, when Experian unknowingly sold personal information of millions of Americans to a scam artist in Vietnam who then sold the data to identity thieves across the world, reports CNN Money . \nThe recent Experian data breach further reinstates how important it is for consumers to always monitor their credit reports and keep an eye on their financial transactions. \nRelated: 7 Most Devastating Data Breaches of 2014 How to Protect Yourself From the Experian, T-Mobile Data Breach \nIf you think your personal information was hacked in the T-Mobile data breach, it’s important to take action immediately. There are a number of identity theft protection services — both free and fee-based — that can help you monitor your financial accounts, credit reports and other personal data. Some of these include Identity Guard, IdentityForce and LifeLock. Experian recommends enrolling in free credit monitoring through its ProtectMyID service, which offers two years of credit monitoring and identity resolution. \nYou might also want to lock, freeze or flag your credit reports. A credit freeze or lock limits access to your credit report, making it much more challenging for the hacker to open accounts with your information. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advises contacting the credit reporting companies — in this case, Experian — if you want to put a freeze on your credit report. Note, however, that fees commonly range from $5 to $10. \nFlags or fraud alerts notify creditors that you might have been a victim of identity theft, forcing them to take extra steps to verify the legitimacy of your request. If you’re concerned your identity might be at risk in the Experian data breach but you aren’t a victim yet, the FTC suggests an initial fraud alert. For 90 days, an initial fraud alert will protect your credit from unverified access. \nEven if you don’t believe you were impacted by the Experian and T-Mobile hack, use this as a wake-up call to start monitoring your credit accounts more regularly. You can get a free annual credit report every 12 months from Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. To get your free credit report, visit AnnualCreditReport.com. Use this valuable resource to catch warning signs of identity theft early, before thieves have time to do lasting damage. \nShare This Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:07:31.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
