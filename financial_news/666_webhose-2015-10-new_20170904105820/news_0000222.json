He inherits a very different bank than the one predecessor Mike Smith joined eight years ago. ANZ Elliott inherits a very different bank than the one Smith joined eight years ago and faces enormous challenges carrying his predecessor's super regional strategy forward.\nHe has a different personal style to the outspoken Smith. In a brief investor call, Elliott and Gonski hinted the strategy will not change dramatically under new management, although that kind of sentiment is usually par for the course while the existing chief executive is still sitting in the room.\n'Not looking for revolution' He has signalled a focus on disciplined approach towards capital management and an emphasis on technology.\n \"We are not looking for a revolution, I do not believe we have a burning platform. We are here for the long term, we have a good base and we need to evolve from it,\" Gonski says.\nGonski says the process was not brought forward. Smith last month scoffed at speculation there had been a falling out between the two over the bank's $3 billion capital raising.\nGonski revealed he had asked Smith to stick around for another two years when he became the bank's chairman and the succession process had been on the board's agenda for the last 15 months. Smith will officially handover to Elliott in three months.\nA lot changed on Smith's watch. The former HSBC Asia boss joined just before the Lehman collapse eight years ago and the global financial crisis.\nHis \"super regional\" strategy, which saw the bank expand significantly into Asia, has given the bank a growth platform the other majors do not have but has also not delivered the financial results originally expected.\nSmith's Australia plans Elliott notes the world has changed a lot since that strategy was implemented.\nThe departure of banking veteran Phil Chronican from ANZ's senior ranks triggered a management reshuffle in February, which was the precursor for the chief executive change.\nElliott's appointment means three out of the big four bank chiefs are New Zealanders. New Zealand has long been a training ground for Australian banking bosses, including National Australia Bank's Andrew Thorburn and his predecessor, Cameron Clyne.\nSmith told the Australian Financial Review in September last year he hoped to stay in the job for another two to three years before potentially moving into a bilateral role promoting Australia's relationship with Asia.\nThe globe-trotting Smith plans to settle down in Australia rather than return to a global banking role.\nmichael.smith@fairfax.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:10:24.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
