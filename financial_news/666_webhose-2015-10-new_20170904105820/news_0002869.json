Now   battle between banks is about offering \"free\" money on spending from current accounts. \nThe latest bank to offer cashback is NatWest. Its new Cashback Reward account, launched this week, offers 3pc cashback on household outgoings, including council tax, electricity, gas and even phone and television bills. \nAccount holders must pay a charge of £3 per month or £36 per year. NatWest say that after accounting for the annual fee, the average customer will earn £90 a year. \n= Verdict = \nThere's no doubt it's an attractive deal, but it depends on how much you spend, and also whether you have savings. \nWe explain more on that below. First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , let's crunch the numbers. \nIf a customer held the Natwest-RBS Cashback Reward account and spent £1,400 a year on council tax, £400 a year on water and £1,100 on gas and electricity as well as £1,000 on broadband, TV and phone bills, they would earn a straight 3pc of £114. Minus the fee, they’re left with £78. The overdraft interest is high at 19.89pc plus £6 a month, which would cancel out any benefits if used. \n• Our five favourite cashback reward current accounts • What is the Personal Savings Allowance? \nThe rival 123 account from Santander* pays 1pc on water and council tax, 2pc on gas and electricity and 3pc on phone, broadband and TV packages. \nBased on the above figures, customers could expect to earn £46 after the annual fee. \nHowever, this account also pays 3pc on balances between £3,000 and £20,000, which generates a maximum interest of £592 after tax. \nOther options include the Halifax Reward Current* account that pays a £125 switching incentive, as well as £5 a month loyalty payment if customers can pay in £750 and set up two direct debits. This could pay customers £185 per year, although a £5 a day overdraft fee could quickly cancel this out. \nFor customers who want to earn a high rate of interest, TSB’s Current Plus* current account pays 5pc on balances up to £2,000, plus 5pc cashback on the first £100 spent each month on a contactless debit card. \nRachel Springall of Moneyfacts, which analyses financial products, said these kind of accounts are great payers, so long as account holders make sure they keep on top of their bills. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) suggested organised customers open up a cashback account alongside their main current account to take advantage of the rewards. \nHowever, in the current competitive climate, she also advised customers to keep an eye out for banks offering attractive switching incentives. \nShe said: “Banks can up their account fees at anytime, so long as they notify their customers, so if existing customers are no longer happy with their deal, they should look to using the Switcher Guarantee Service and move to a more competitive account in as quick as seven days.” \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:47:28.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
