The undergraduate program provides correctional and criminal justice industry professionals with an advanced understanding of how justice systems and social services intersect, allowing them to expand their skillsets to help address mental health, rehabilitation and recidivism issues that affect U.S. communities. \nDriven by a rising national concern over public safety, and with the rate of mental illness among people incarcerated in our nation’s prisons and jails significantly higher than that of the non-incarcerated population, 1 there is a heightened need for professionals who understand the systematic realities for offenders, both during incarceration and after their release. \n“There are critical roles in today’s society for correctional program support services,” said Dr. Stephen Sharp, academic dean for University of Phoenix College of Social Sciences. “Across the country, well-trained professionals have opportunities to help break the cycle for offenders who struggle with reintegrating into their communities and relapse into criminal behavior.” \nThe Bachelor of Science in Correctional Program Support Services provides individuals who work in a myriad of positions in the correctional and criminal justice systems to fulfill functions in a broad range of institutional and community correctional domains by using a multidisciplinary approach of psychology, human services, behavioral and criminal justice theories. Students will be trained to serve in positions such as case managers, program directors and program managers, which are designed to assist with the societal reintegration of offenders. The program will equip students with foundational skills to address correctional field trends such as prison overcrowding, gangs, and mental health and substance abuse issues that impact correctional facilities and court-mandated programs. \n“By preparing individuals for a variety of support roles in the correctional industry, we can help both our students and society by filling an area of significant need,” said Dr. Constance St. Germain, executive dean of University of Phoenix College of Social Sciences. “The Bachelor of Science in Correctional Program Support Services was designed in collaboration with University of Phoenix College of Security and Criminal Justice as well as corrections industry subject matter experts, all of whom reflected the real-world needs of professionals in the field.” \nThe Bachelor of Science in Correctional Program Support Services is an educational degree program that provides a foundation or knowledge in the field of correctional program support services. This program does not prepare students for any type of professional certification or licensure as a correctional officer, social worker or counselor. \nFor more information about each of these programs, including on-time completion rates, the median debt incurred by students who completed the program and other important information, please visit phoenix.edu/programs/gainful-employment . \nAbout University of Phoenix College of Social Sciences \nUniversity of Phoenix College of Social Sciences offers programs in human services, psychology and counseling.
