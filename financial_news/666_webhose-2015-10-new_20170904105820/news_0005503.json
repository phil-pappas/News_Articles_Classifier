CFSC has long been a supporter of Saving tiny Hearts Society (StHS), a charity organization that funds research for CHD. Congenital Heart Disease, or \"Congenital Heart Defect,\" happens when a baby is born with a problem in the heart's structure, such as a small hole in the heart or a leaky heart valve. CHD can cause a variety of health issues in infants and children including shortness of breath, bluish skin, low weight gain, lung infections, and inability to exercise. \"Congenital heart defects vastly affect the quality of life of many infants, children, and families,\" said Saving tiny Hearts Society Director, and CFSC's own, Steven Harfield. \"It's an undeniably worthwhile cause--helping find answers and relief for innocent kids.\" According to SavingtinyHearts.org, StHS uses seed funding to bridge the gap between CHD research and millions of dollars of external funding from sources such as the National Institute of Health (NIH). The overall objective of StHS is to prolong, improve, and save the lives of children born with Congenital Heart Disease. \"Community Financial has been involved with Saving tiny Hearts for some time now,\" said Harfield. \"I am honored to be part of a company that shows strong support for such a great cause.\" One of the most efficient non-profit organizations in the United States, Saving tiny Hearts Society maintains an operating overhead of under 10% of total revenue. To date, StHS has raised and granted over $1.5 million and funded eighteen research projects. The organization accepts contributions in the form of volunteering, hosting events, and donating funds.
