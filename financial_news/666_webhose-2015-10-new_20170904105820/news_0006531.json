The company wants light regulation for the gas pipeline sector. Photo: Ryan Stuart\nAPA Group chief executive Mick McCormack is appealing for \"light\" industry regulation, advising that \"interference\" in the market could harm confidence in the natural gas transportation business and reduce flexibility.\nIn an address to be made at the annual shareholders' meeting on Thursday, Mr McCormack refers to the recent \"unprecedented\" levels of public and policy discussions and reviews of the gas market. Responding to the inquiries \"consumes a material amount of APA's financial and management resources\", he says in an advance copy of his speech.\n\"Whilst transparent discussion of the issues facing the industry can be beneficial, succession of reviews and inquiries should not be allowed to adversely affect business confidence,\" Mr McCormack says.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has started an investigation into the competitiveness of the wholesale gas market, including the pipeline sector, in which APA is the dominant player. This month, APA was foiled in its ability to make an unconditional bid for EnergyAustralia's Iona gas storage plant in Victoria after the ACCC raised concerns.\nAdvertisement \"In the last decade, Australia has been well served by the relatively light level of regulation and market interference in transmission pipelines,\" Mr McCormack says.\n\"It was this environment that has enabled the development of the East Coast Grid that promotes basin-on-basin competition and provides gas producers and users with flexibility and optionality in their energy management.\"\n$19b portfolio of energy infrastructure APA owns a $19 billion portfolio of energy infrastructure, including pipelines on the east and west coasts as well as in the Northern Territory. Last financial year, it made its biggest ever acquisition - the gas pipeline that forms part of BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG venture - for about $6 billion. It is also one of four parties bidding to build a pipeline that will link the NT into the east coast grid.\nChairman Len Bleasel notes in his address for the AGM that the acquisition of the pipeline, now renamed the Wallumbilla Gladstone pipeline, strategically expands APA's east coast grid to service the export LNG market in Gladstone. The acquisition was supported by a $1.8 billion equity raising and $4.9 billion of debt securities sold into the international debt capital markets.\nMr Bleasel says: \"The debt issuance not only enabled APA to finance the acquisition, but also has further strengthened the balance sheet of APA, giving it a more diverse debt portfolio with a longer maturity and from which future growth opportunities can be financed cost effectively.\"\nHe said that after a refinancing following the end of the 2015 financial year, APA's debt-to debt plus equity ratio was 63.4 per cent, while available cash and undrawn debt was about $1.3 billion.\nMr Bleasel says the board is confident APA is \"well placed\" to deliver further growth, pointing to expectations for \"strong growth\" in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation this financial year of between $1.275 billion and $1.31 billion. The figure includes a contribution from the new Wallumbilla Gladstone pipeline of about $470 million.\nDividends will be at least equal to the 38 cents a security paid in 2014-15, Mr Bleasel says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:19:27.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
