Dave Tacon by Angus Grigg It's China's national day and on the outskirts of Shanghai a group of senior citizens are wearing yellow cardboard crowns and singing happy birthday to their country.\nThere's cake and green tea on offer, as an elderly gentleman donates a jade-embossed Mahjong set to his new community.\nThe only thing breaking the cultural stereotype, among the sea of Chinese flags and quick-fire mandarin being spoken, are pictures of kangaroos and koalas.\nIn addition a raven-haired woman is attempting to speak Chinese with a distinctly Australian accent, before reverting to English and welcoming residents to their new home come late December.\nThe ASX listed, Aveo Group, has a 30 per cent stake in the joint-venture company which owns the village and will operate the facility when it opens at the end of the year. Dave Tacon \"Our community is getting bigger every day,\" says Julie Jackson, the general manager of Aveo China.\nThe community she refers to is the awkwardly translated \"Tide & Health Campus\", Shanghai's newest and arguably its most sophisticated retirement village.\nThe presence of Jackson and Australia's most famous marsupials is no marketing gimmick, as this 1.5 billion yuan ($326 million) development is very much an Australian concept.\nThe ASX listed, Aveo Group, has a 30 per cent stake in the joint-venture company which owns the village and will operate the facility when it opens at the end of the year.\nA prosepctive buyer of a retirement village package is shown a model of TIide Health-land Campus by a salesman. Dave Tacon Aveo is among a host of Australian companies looking to profit from the rapidly ageing population in China, where a staggering 440 million people are forecast to be aged over 60 by the middle of this century.\nAnd while this giant elderly population will place huge burdens on the government and broader society, it is also being seen as one of the biggest opportunities for foreign companies in China since the construction boom ended nearly three years ago.\nSuch is the optimism around the sector, business leaders now talk about China's health and aged care market the way they once did about iron ore and urbanisation.\nIt's being labelled China's grey boom and for Australian companies there are opportunities in hospitals, aged-care facilities, vitamins, medical equipment and for the architectural firms required to build the new facilities.\n\"The rhetoric of a decade ago is being replaced by the action of today,\" says Chris Straw, the managing director of architectural firm Thomson Adsett, which expects to shortly have seven projects under way in the country's health and ageing sector.\nFor Aveo's Jackson it's the combination of demographics, discretionary spending and accumulated household savings which makes China such an attractive proposition.\n\"These are the indicators that have historically driven senior housing as an industry in other countries,\" she says.\nThe great irony of this latest China boom is that few believed it would ever materialise.\nAs the established western powers contemplated the rise of China a decade ago, its rapidly ageing population was considered a major liability, rather than an opportunity to profit.\nIndeed, it was Australia's former prime minister John Howard who often proclaimed \"China will get old before it gets rich\".\nHoward was right about China getting old, but in the years since he left power it has become sufficiently rich to start paying for western standard medical and aged care.\nBut while China may now have the money to pay for such services it does not have the expertise, as ageing and to a lesser extent health, were largely ignored in the rush to build roads, rail lines and apartments over the last decade.\nAnd so China needs help and has turned to Australian expertise for guidance on how best to deal with its ageing population. In August, the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing described Australia as the \"model\" which China should follow on aged-care.\n\"China's senior care sector has developed rapidly in recent years but products and services are in short supply,\" it said.\nThe endorsement came after a concerted campaign by successive federal governments to sell Australia's aged-care offerings to China.\nBureaucrats from the federal Department of Health and their counterparts in Social Services have hosted no less than five Chinese government delegations since the middle of last year with a further visit planned in November.\nAnd this traffic between Beijing and Canberra does not include the many Chinese government delegations which have called on state health departments, including the top Communist Party official from Shandong Province, Jiang Yikang, who visited last month.\nIt was no accident he spent part of his day in Sydney at an aged-care home and in Adelaide inspected the state's Medical Research Institute, known affectionately as the cheese grater due to its futuristic design.\nThe intense interest in health and ageing from Chinese government officials is due to the sheer scale of the demographic challenge.\nChina's National Bureau of Statistic forecasts the population aged over 60 will double over the next 35 years from 220 million today. That will be roughly 30 per cent of the population.\n\"This will impose a severe challenge to the country's economic structure, medical system and social services,\" the Ministry of Commerce said.\nThe response to this challenge has been rapid and even generated a mini-building boom.\nAs the broader construction market slowed rapidly over the first eight months of the year, investment in social infrastructure, which includes aged-care facilities and hospitals, rose by 57 per cent to $15 billion.\nThis rush is part of government efforts to increase the number of senior care beds from 4.9 million in 2013 to 9 million by the end of this year.\n\"Health and aged-care demand is exploding in China,\" says Straw from architectural firm Thomson Adsett.\n\"And that demand in not going away.\"\nStraw should know as his Brisbane-based firm is the world's second largest when it comes to designing senior care facilities.\nIt is currently working on an aged-care centre in Beijing and dementia facility in Shanghai. But it expects to be awarded at least five more jobs across China over the coming weeks.\nThe largest, according to Straw, is a 7000 person integrated retirement village in Wuhan, the central Chinese city which hugs the Yangtze River.\n\"It's far more than bricks and mortar,\" he says. \"It's about smart solutions and design more than anything.\"\nAmong those also hoping to capitalise on this aged-care building boom is Melbourne-based Sapphire Care.\n\"We have been looking at China for some time because the numbers are just so compelling,\" says chairman Tony Battle, a former Credit Lyonnais banker turned aged-care entrepreneur.Sapphire, an unlisted public company, signed a heads of agreement with Chinese property developer Hsing Chong last week to see how aged-care facilities could be incorporated into its future projects.\n\"We are looking at how we might work together to develop an aged-care model suitable for China,\" says Battle.\n\"We are at the start of what will be a very long and detailed process.\"\nMacquarie Capital is also playing in the space having made an $US11 million ($14.3 million) investment in a high-end senior care facility in the city of Hangzhou, outside Shanghai.\nIt has teamed up with American outfit, China Senior Care, which is set to open its first facility later this year or early in 2016. Once the model is bedded down it will look at other opportunities across the country.\n\"We are really at the beginning of the industry [in China],\" say Mark Spitalnik the founder of China Senior Care.\n\"The ageing population and the introduction of the One Child Policy in 1979 means there are more and more seniors with less and less people to look after them.\"\nRamsay Health Care has similar ambitions in China, albeit on a far larger scale. It is close to completing a deal announced in May to take a 25 per cent equity stake in five hospitals in the western city of Chengdu for close to $US70 million.\n\"China has a large and ageing population with a burgeoning middle class and more recently, has developed a positive outlook on healthcare reforms,\" says managing director Christopher Rex when announcing the deal.\nThis positive outlook on health reform, which has allowed foreign and private operators into the space, has been accompanied by a large cultural shift in attitudes towards aged-care facilities or \"assisted living\" as they are now known.\nWhile it was once considered unthinkable for parents to live away from their children there is no other option for many due to the one child policy.\nIf the traditional structure was maintained then one couple could potentially be looking after four elders, as well as working and raising their own children.\nFor Wan Juan it was not a case of being unable to look after her mother in Wuhan, rather that the 89-year-old wanted to be near friends.\n\"My mother wanted to go there [the aged-care facility] because lots of her friends, who were also teachers, had moved in,\" she says via phone.\n\"She's having a good time, reading the newspaper and playing Mahjong.\"\nBut the retired teacher is one of the few across China to have secured a government subsided place, which costs her just $550 a month for a room which is shared with a friend.\n\"There's now a very long waiting list,\" says Wan.\nSuch waiting lists have given the likes of Aveo the confidence to invest in its Shanghai development.\nWhen completed, it will dwarf anything in Australia with 2500 residents and more than 600 staff spread across 76 low-rise buildings.\nAnd while it is based on Australian best practice, it is an aged-care centre with Chinese characteristics and pitched very much at the city's wealthy.\nSituated on 10 hectares the development has its own hotel, concierges, three indoor swimming pools, a golf simulator, a restaurant strip and even a lawn bowling green.\n\"There is nothing like this in Australia,\" says Jackson.\nThat is reflected in the price.\nThe upfront cost, while cheaper than high-end offerings in Australia, is still expensive for a development which is an hour outside Shanghai in a former industrial area.\nA studio apartment sells for 1.1 million yuan ($240,000) plus an annual service fee of 72,000 yuan ($15,000).\nFor the largest three bedroom apartment the price is 2.4 million yuan ($520,000) plus the service fee.\n\"There's no doubt it's a high end offering but the quality of service and staff reflects this,\" says Jackson.\nShe says 60 per cent of the apartments have been sold and has begun tentatively thinking about future developments.\n\"If I was thinking like a Chinese person I would say we could have 10 facilities over the next five years. If I was thinking like an Australian then one more,\" says Jackson.\n\"We certainly want to duplicate the model, but we have to be successful here first.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:06:50.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
