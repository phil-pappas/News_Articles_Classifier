Customers are coming back \nOne of Tesco's biggest problems has been the loss of market share it has suffered to other supermarkets, including discounters Aldi and Lidl. \nLast week's results suggest Tesco is starting to win back some of this lost business. The number of transactions in UK stores rose by 1.5% during the first half, while the volume of items sold rose by 1.4%. \nAlthough like-for-like sales fell by 1.1% in the UK, this reflects the impact of lower prices, not falling sales. \nTesco is winning back some of its lost market share. \n2. A long-term view \n'Drastic' Dave Lewis, Tesco's chief executive, appears to be taking a long-term and sustainable approach to turning around the business. \nTesco has made public a set of improved and simplified payment terms for suppliers. Promotional pricing has been reduced and prices of staple items reduced. Changes to shelf-edge labels -- a common source of price confusion for customers -- have been reduced by 21%. \nOn a business level, product ranges have been reviewed and simplified. A total of 53 loss-making stores have been closed, and the firm has agreed to sell its Korean business for £4.24bn. This will reduce Tesco's net debt by £4.2bn. It's also decided to keep hold of its Dunnhumby marketing business rather than sell it too cheaply. \nAll of these changes should improve customer appeal and improve Tesco's reputation, which took a battering as a result of the profit misstatement scandal. Mr Lewis appears to be targeting a long-term win, rather than scraping the barrel for a short-term profit boost. \nDespite this long-term approach, Tesco is still making money and reported an operating profit of £354m. This was backed by net cash generation from retail operations of £779m and retail free cash flow of £281m. That's not bad in the circumstances. \n3. Banking a profit \nYou could argue that banking is not a core activity for a supermarket. Yet the latest results from Tesco Bank suggests that this combination is working very well. \nTesco Bank contributed £86m, or 24%, of the group's operating profit during the first half of the year. \nBetter still, the bank's operating margin was a generous 18%. Although this was down from 20.5% last year, this is mainly due to a regulatory change in credit card income. \nLending to customers rose and the bank's net interest margin was 4.2%. That's roughly double most of the big high street banks. \nMy view is that Tesco Bank appears to be generally competitive and a successful add-on to Tesco's retail business. \nStill some concerns \nDespite my positive view on Tesco, I do have some concerns. \nNet debt is £8.6bn and total indebtedness, including pension liability and lease commitments, is £21.9bn. The sale of the Korean business will reduce this by £4.2bn, but a rights issue to raise fresh cash remains a possibility. \nSignificantly, whereas Mr Lewis has ruled out further asset sales, he has not ruled out a possible rights issue. \nI believe Tesco's turnaround will be successful, but it's going to be a long haul. \nIf you're looking for buying opportunities with more immediate profit potential, I'd suggest taking a look at \" 7 Simple Steps For Seeking Serious Wealth \" . \nThis report contains details of a simple 7-step investment strategy that could turbo-charge your portfolio returns in as little as 20 minutes per month. \nIt's completely FREE and carries no obligation . \nThere's really nothing to lose. \nTo receive your personal copy of this essential report today, click here now . \nRoland Head owns shares of Tesco.
