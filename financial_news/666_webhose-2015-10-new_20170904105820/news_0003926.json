For years, countless among us sat enthralled while Anthony Bourdain traipsed the globe showcasing and sampling the world's culinary offerings for the Travel Channel. From Vietnam to Hong Kong and beyond, A nthony Bourdain: No Reservations was a hit for good reason. It tapped into the desires of foodies, jet-setters and armchair travelers alike by offering up unique experiences, exotic and colorful destinations and meals fit for a king or queen. The droolfest continues with Bourdain's latest show - CNN's Parts Unknown - focused on uncovering lesser known places, their cultures and cuisine. Once again, Bourdain has tapped into a massive demographic and popular obsession. According to Euromonitor, while Americans who travel internationally spend most of their money on accommodations, their second biggest category of expenditure is food. But what if you can't afford to jet around the globe in pursuit of your latest over-the-top culinary adventure? Or what if you don't have a television network footing the bill? Not to worry, there are unique food-related travel opportunities right here in the United States. These are not hyped up gourmet restaurants presenting their latest mind boggling or artfully elaborate creations, but rather experiences that combine an entertaining or unique tourist destination with a notable, or truly localized food experience. With that criteria in mind, here's a look at five places in the United States where you can have a food adventure, or two, of your own. Oyster Excursions, Mirbeau Inn & Spa at The Pinehills, Plymouth, Massachusetts As the boat progresses, there's sandbar and ocean as far as the eye can see. And then something else appears amid this classic New England sea and sand tableau - blue and white checkered table cloths fluttering in the breeze on high-top tables, waiters, people cooking over an open fire and an acoustic guitar player. Welcome to Chef Stephen Coe's most recent creation - oyster education and dinner in the most unlikely of settings - on a remote sand bar that's a stone's throw from some of Plymouth's oyster flats. Coe, who has been working with local farmers and fisherman since the inception of his career and counts beekeeping and oyster foraging among his favorite hobbies, has incorporated his love for sourcing his own ingredients into a unique food experience. This past summer, for the first time, he teamed up with Plymouth Rock Oyster Growers to create oyster dinner excursions that include a boat ride to local oyster flats where guests are immersed in the process of oyster growing, and then dinner on a nearby sand bar (perfectly timed with low tide of course). The experience includes freshly grilled Plymouth Bay oysters (cooked right on the spot), wine, and s'mores over an open fire. \"When the boat pulls up, you hear people freaking out, because all of sudden, you start seeing this setting from the boat and people are like, 'What is this?'\" explains Coe of guests' first glimpse of his sand bar dining room. \"And then we tell them to take off their shoes, jump in the water and we approach them serving champagne.\" The champagne is followed later by grilled oysters, raw oysters, slow cooked lobster and even bacon wrapped tenderloin. Sounds like a pretty fabulous way to end a summer day right? The first season of Coe's sand bar oyster bonanzas were a sellout hit. Which means a second season, this coming summer, is already in the works. (The dinners are held every other week during the summer.) \"We sold out every one of them,\" Coe says. \"We have a 20 person limit because there's a lot of work that goes into making it happen - prepping, and packing and doing all of that in reverse before the tide comes back in. The people who get on the list for one of these dinners are very happy.\" The experience is $150 per person. Those interested in participating this coming summer should contact Mirbeau Inn. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:39:38.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
