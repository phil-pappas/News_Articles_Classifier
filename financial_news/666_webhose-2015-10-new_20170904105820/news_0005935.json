This practice saw the provision of client quotes from prices derived from these systems, which consequently incorporated a small spread on each trade as a fee. \nOrca SMT was designed in an attempt to mitigate pricing errors and inefficiencies, which effectively automates the entirety of the process, through a FiX connection to liquidity sources. Orca hopes the resulting process will rely on a more stable and accurately prices utility for clients given the transparency in margin capture that FX sales personnel are adding as they quote their clients. \nAccording to Daniel Osborne, Chief Executive Office (CEO) of Orca SMT in a recent statement on the beta launch, “I am happy to announce that Orca SMT has completed its initial testing and is currently in a beta phase with several banks.” \n“By providing salespeople with real-time client intelligence, Orca SMT enables them to price more accurately and ultimately win more deals. Combining this functionality with management visibility and connectivity to deal capture and risk management systems, we foresee significant service level improvements in voice traded FX,” he added.
