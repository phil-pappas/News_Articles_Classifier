Of this amount, È»1.6 billion will be expended on external interest while GHÈ»7.7 billion will be for domestic interest payments. \nBut with the Eurobond's impact on the country's public debt, the Senior Communications Officer hinted the Washington-based lender will review the country's debt management strategy in coming months. \n\"The debt management strategy is something that is continuously reviewed to address emerging risks and less favorable market environment is something that will need to be factored-in going forward,\" he added. \nEurobond journeyDespite announcing that it would borrow US$1.5 billion from the international market, a statement issued by the Finance Ministry last week showed government has reduced that amount, having accepted an offer for $1 billion. \nThe release issued by the Finance Ministry said the bond is a soft amortising bond, meaning that it will mature in years 2028, 2029 and 2030 with principal repayment in three installments of $333 million in years 2028 and 2029, and $334 million in 2030. \nExplaining why government watered-down its initial target, Finance Minister Seth Terkper explained that the approval passed by parliament granted government the leeway to raise up to $1.5 billion, subject to market conditions. \nEssentially, according to the Finance Minister the figure is not absolute - and is subject to market conditions. \nUnlike the previous bonds, which had 10-year maturity periods, the latest has a 15-year maturity period - making Ghana the first country apart from South Africa in sub-Saharan Africa to issue a bond of such nature.
