The Philadelphia 100® has been the hallmark of entrepreneurial achievement in the region since 1988. The project, which is run by the Wharton Small Business Development Center, The Entrepreneurs' Forum of Greater Philadelphia and the Philadelphia Business Journal, identifies and honors the 100 fastest growing, privately held entrepreneurial companies in the Greater Philadelphia Region.\nIn addition to making multiple appearances on the list, Pentec Health earned the added distinction of being inducted into the Philadelphia 100® Hall of Fame. In 2004, the Philadelphia 100® Hall of Fame was created as a way of honoring those winners who repeatedly made the list. The criteria for this honor is any company that makes the Philadelphia 100® list of fastest growing, privately held companies five times or more. Pentec will be inducted into the Company Hall of Fame at the organization’s annual award dinner on October 15th.\nNot coincidentally, Pentec Health Chairman, CEO and President Joseph Cosgrove will be inducted into the Philadelphia 100® CEO Hall of Fame at the same event; bestowing a dual distinction on Pentec Health – company Hall of Fame and CEO Hall of Fame.\nMr. Cosgrove attributed much of his success and that of the company to his Pentec colleagues. “Pentec has been recognized as an industry leader on multiple occasions due to the dedicated, engaged and focused efforts of each and every employee – a real team effort of which I am exceedingly proud.”\nAbout Philadelphia 100®\nThe Philadelphia 100® has been the hallmark of entrepreneurial achievement in the Philadelphia region since it was founded in 1998.
