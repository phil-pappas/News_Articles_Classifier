We see strong nationwide demand for a multipurpose, cross-bank mobile wallet,\" Akhtar added. \nMobile wallet users can fund or 'top-up' their accounts in several ways - ATM machine; credit or debit cards; cash-in at certain locations; and direct debit service or funds transfer system. \nAccording to Cap Gemini's World Payments Report 2014, mobile payments from 2011-2015 are expected to grow more than 60 percent to 47 billion transactions. \nTrriple, a startup born in the UAE, is a next generation, digital payments service provider.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:28:47.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
