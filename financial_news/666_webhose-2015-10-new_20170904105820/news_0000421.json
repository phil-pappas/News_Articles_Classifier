Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro American hedge fund star Lee Ainslee says the Federal Reserve must share much of the blame for recent market volatility and its hesitancy to raise rates is allowing future risks to build in the global financial system.\nAinslee, the founder of $US10 billion hedge fund Maverick Capital said he was \"mildly surprised and very disappointed\" the Federal Reserve failed to raise interest rates in September .\n\"It's hard to defend zero interest rates with 1.5 to 2 per cent GDP growth,\" he told an audience at the Annual Citi Australian Investment Conference on Wednesday.\nAn inability to raise rates had led the market to question \"the stability of Fed policy\".\n\"The longer this continues the bigger the eventual problem is going to be. And recent volatility is in part driven by the Fed, and most investors were shocked and mildly disappointed.\"\nMaverick formed in 1993 manages around $US10 billion. Mr Ainslee is a \"tiger cub\" an elite group of hedge fund managers that worked under Julian Robertson's famed hedge fund Tiger Management before setting up their own fund.\nIn a presentation at Citi's annual investment conference, Mr Ainslee told investors that conditions were becoming more favourable for hedge funds as volatility increased while dispersion among stocks, which measures the difference in price moves of the best and worst stocks, was rising.\nThis favours stock pickers that buy and sell short shares based on research. A measure of dispersion against correlation was at its highest point since the mid-1990s when many long/short hedge funds including Maverick were set up.\n \"We all thought we were geniuses but there were clearly other factors at work,\" he said.\nBut Mr Ainslee is looking like a genius of late. In a period where many high flying hedge funds such as Pershing Square and Third Point have nursed large losses, Maverick has posted positive returns.\n\"We recognised that we had unusually high ownership of stocks that were heavily owned by hedge funds. Stocks with high beta, stocks momentum and growth; all factors that do perform with stressed market conditions.\"\nIn stress testing, Maverick realised its April positioning meant it would have been hit as hard as the market in a sell-off which, coupled with some risk alerts flashing red, led the fund to adjust its portfolio.\nCrowded trades But Mr Ainslee said it discovered that it was in many crowded trades along with other hedge funds that were likely to get belted in a deleveraging phase.\n\"[Hedge funds] were overly exposed and the valuations of those stocks was reaching peak levels so we took a step back and made some pretty dramatic changes to the portfolio.\"\nMr Ainslee said that the fund's proprietary economic data showed that Europe's economy had staged a recovery while the US had stalled. China however was in the midst of a sharp downturn .\n\"We have a cautious view and the thesis is China is worse than people recognise,\" but had a neutral portfolio positioning as much of the bear-case for China was reflected in market pricing.\nMr Ainslee said while he was \"scared to death'\" about liquidity in the bond market and while there were concerns in equity markets too, the fund's positions were modest.\nHe said the fund is embracing electronic market markers that allowed the fund to trade anonymously.\nMaverick was \"tied into 53 different electronic pipes\" which Mr Ainslee said made it easier to move large volumes of stocks than before.\nWhen asked about whether the fund had long or short positions in Australia, he said the abundance of superannuation capital directed to the sharemarket meant most stocks were too expensive.\n\"That it leads to valuations that do not compete well on a global basis. So we can look at very similar businesses but because they're based in Europe or the US I can buy it at that much more of an attractive price,\" he said.\n\"But I don't think there's some bubble that's going to burst so on the short side we've not done anything too compelling [to short].\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:06:13.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
