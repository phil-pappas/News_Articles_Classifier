I got a call yesterday, and this is what happened: The live caller asked me how I was feeling. My answer went along these lines: \"Terrible. My dentist said that I needed two root canals. My arthritis is killing my left knee, but the right one seems to be a little better than yesterday. I left my refrigerator open during the night, and I lost a ton of food. I couldn't go to the store to replace it because the car has a flat tire. My clothes washer sprang a leak somewhere and it overflowed all over the laundry room and the basement below it.\" Near the end, the caller sighed and hung up. I had the biggest laugh I've had in months. Try it!\nWHAT HARRY SAYS: Sounds like fun, but it won't stop the calls. To do that, contact the Federal Trade Commission at donotcall.gov. Once your registration is on record for 31 days, you are protected. Report anyone violating the registration by filing a complaint at the same website. It has worked well for me. Be wary of scammers who call and ask you to register immediately by giving personal info as well as your phone number.\nEmail Harry Gross at harrygrossDN@gmail.com , or write to him at Daily News, 801 Market St., Philadelphia, PA 19107. Harry urges all his readers to give blood. Contact the American Red Cross at 1-800-Red Cross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:56:59.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
