It hopes to use its size to take advantage of a shortage of such housing in Britain when the average age of the population is rising.\nChairman John White said that around 3.5 million Britons are interested in buying a retirement property, but only 128,000 properties had been built as of April 2014.\n\"McCarthy & Stone is in a unique position to address the unprecedented market opportunity we see before us,\" he said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe company is expecting to raise 70 million pounds from new investors through an IPO which is likely to take place in November. Existing shareholders will also sell shares to ensure that at least 25 percent of the shares will be actively traded.\nOne source familiar with the sale plan said the company hopes to have a valuation in excess of 1 billion pounds.\nThe company was previously listed in London for 22 years until 2006, when it was bought by a consortium of private investors including Alchemy Partners, Goldman Sachs and TPG for 1.1 billion pounds.\nSALE TALKS FIZZLE\nChief Executive Clive Fenton said it decided to launch an initial public offering (IPO) after talks over an outright sale came to nothing.\n\"We've been approached by a number of interested parties over the past year. The talks didn't develop. Our view is the place for this company is on the London Stock Exchange,\" Fenton told reporters.\nSky News reported in September that private equity firm Bridgepoint was in talks to buy the business in a deal valuing it at more than 850 million.\nBritish payments processor Worldpay joined the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday in an initial public offering valuing the company at 4.8 billion pounds ($7.4 billion), the biggest flotation in what had been a lacklustre year for listings in Britain.\nMcCarthy & Stone made a pretax profit of 88.4 million pounds in the year to Aug. 2015, on revenue of 486 million.\nIt was the first British developer to offer owner-occupied retirement housing in 1977 and has since sold around 50,000 homes in more than 1,000 developments across Britain.\nDeutsche Bank is acting as sponsor, joint global co-ordinator and joint-bookrunner for the IPO. Goldman Sachs is acting as joint global co-ordinator and bookrunner.
