Meanwhile, Le Peigne, which manages money on behalf of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault and his family, is halving its stake in Betfair by selling 4.6m shares that are valued at nearly £155m. \nThe sales by Betfair’s two biggest investors come in the wake of its deal to combine with Irish bookmaker Paddy Power to create what will be one of the world’s biggest online gambling companies . \nThe merger has sent Betfair shares rocketing and the stock closed at a record £33.67 this evening, an all-time high that the two shareholders are capitalising on with the sale. \nBut despite the share price record, Mr Wray said he had not actively sought to reduce his holding. \n\"I was not looking to sell,\" the Betfair co-founder told the Telegraph. \nMr Wray described the tie-up with Paddy Power as \"very exciting\" and said he was cutting his stake because Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) approached him last week and informed him it had a UK institutional investor that was \"keen\" to buy Betfair stock. That has given the co-founder an opportunity to diversify his investments. \n\"It’s really portfolio management for me, most of my net worth is tied up in Betfair,\" he added. \nMr Wray, who previously worked in derivatives at JPMorgan, founded Betfair in 1999 with former professional gambler Andrew Black. He held about 11.6m shares in the betting exchange immediately following its flotation in October 2010 but has since trimmed the stake to 8.9m, or approximately 9.5pc of the company. \nFollowing this latest disposal, Mr Wray and his family will be left with about 6.1m shares and they have agreed not to sell any more stock for 90 days. \nLe Peigne was also an investor in Betfair before its stock market float five years ago and will hold just under 4m shares after the sale, which are also subject to a 90-day lock-up agreement. Mr Arnault, France's richest man, is the chairman and chief executive of LVMH, the group behind the Givenchy and Louis Vuitton brands. \nBarclays is handling the transaction and Rothschild is advising the two investors (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:47:38.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
