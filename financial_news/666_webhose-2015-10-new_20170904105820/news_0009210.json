Tens of thousands of batteries are often shipped on a single plane. \nFAA tests show even a small number of overheating batteries will emit gases that can cause explosions and fires that can't be prevented by current aircraft fire suppression systems. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:09:03.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
