Most analysts had estimated a rise to a pace of 5.39 million units. \nLawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, highlighted incentives such as a slight moderation in home prices in some markets and mortgage rates holding near historic lows below four percent. \n\"September home sales bounced back solidly after slowing in August and are now at their second highest pace since February 2007,\" he said. \n\"While current price growth around six percent is still roughly double the pace of wages, affordability has slightly improved since the spring and is helping to keep demand at a strong and sustained pace.\" \nThe median price for all previously owned housing types in September was $221,900, a gain of 6.1 percent from a year ago. In August the price was $228,500. \nInventory tightened further in September, falling 2.6 percent to 2.21 million homes for sale. At the current sales pace, inventory stood at a 4.8-month supply, down from 5.1 months in August, NAR said. \nUS house prices rose 0.3 percent in August, following a 0.5 percent rise in July, the Federal Housing Finance Agency reported Thursday. Year-over-year house prices were up 5.5 percent. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) analyst Blerina Uruci said that continued labor market improvements, including rising employment and a modest gain in wage growth, should bolster housing demand. \n\"As a result, we expect the housing market to continue recovering at a moderate pace,\" Uruci said. \nThe Federal Reserve has pointed to improvement in the housing market as an engine for growth in the economy as it moves toward raising its key interest rate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:29:27.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
