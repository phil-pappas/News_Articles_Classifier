Bloomberg Share on twitter by John McDuling Corporate Australia can be a strange place sometimes. Consider two things that happened this week.\nTreasury Wine Estates, the company behind the Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Rosemount labels, acquired the US-centred wine business of global beverage giant Diageo for $754 million .\nDespite the fact that Treasury, or at least its corporate predecessor (it was spun out of Fosters Group in 2011), has encountered lots of problems in the US in years gone by, investors toasted the deal. Treasury shares look poised to end the week a touch away from record highs .\nThe company has \"made a logical and value-accretive acquisition\" wrote Citi analyst Craig Woolford in a note on Friday. \"Treasury Wines has bought well.\" Or as UBS analyst Craig Stafford put it. \"Acquiring Diageo Wine makes sense.\"\nContrast this with the experience of Insurance Australia Group, the company perhaps best known for the NRMA brand. IAG this week abandoned plans to expand into China after analysts and shareholders basically freaked out.\nEarlier this year, IAG raised $500 million in fresh capital from billionaire Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway, and had planned to invest it in China.\nBut after IAG lost money on its first foray into that booming economy, investors got nervous. They would prefer that the company return money to them in dividends. It looks as if they will get their way. \"This is a positive development,\" wrote Deutsche Bank's Kieren Chidgey of the volte face on China. \"[W]e believe a capital return is now likely at some point in FY16.\"\nPerhaps it's too simplistic to say this is firm evidence that the Australian investment community is cool with expansion into the US and cool on expansion in China (and Asia more broadly). Insurance and wine are vastly different industries, after all (and China is a huge export market for Treasury).\n But it's still worth pondering .\nBecause for all the talk about how well placed Australia is to benefit from the Asian century and the rise of China's middle class, local investors get nervous any time our companies try to expand there. Take ANZ Banking Group's much-questioned strategy to generate 25 per cent of its profits from the region by 2017. Or SEEK, which has practically had to beg investors for patience with its expansion into China and other emerging markets.\nSure, Australian companies don't have a great track record operating overseas, including in the US where the likes of QBE Insurance and National Australia Bank have destroyed millions in value.\nBut we have also reached the point where the biggest Australian companies have, broadly speaking, reached the limits of their potential on domestic shores. And we are entering an era where rapid advances in technology are rendering many local advantages obsolete. As I have previously put it, the future of business is global, not local.\nSo if Aussie investors want their companies to keep growing (and ultimately, their beloved dividends to keep flowing over the long term) they are going to have to accept that they need to expand offshore. Relatively close by, in the same time zone, and growing rapidly, China, and Asia more broadly, would seem a good place to start.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/uber-and-netflix-are-showing-australia-that-the-future-of-business-is-global-not-local-20150907-gjhbym.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/myopic-views-keeping-us-out-of-asia-20151015-gkaiw2.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/iag-kills-china-expansion-strategy-20151014-gk9glf.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/longterm-thinking-seek-takes-aim-at-investor-obsession-with-next-profit-result-20150819-gj2rug.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/treasury-wine-estates-follows-abc-rule-of-anything-but-chardonnay-20151014-gk9eyy.html", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-10-16T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:07:39.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
