So, either you should be well versed with insurance policies or should make sure that you go through the fine print of the policy document in detail. To further help you choose a suitable car insurance policy, read through a few points that we've compiled together and might be of some help: What all does a vehicle insurance cover? Amongst the auto insurance policies offered, there are broadly two basic types: one that covers third party damage to property and other that offers comprehensive plan that also covers own damage along with liability of third party. So, while the former covers only accidental death and injury to the third party, the later covers theft or damage caused due to unknown and unforeseen dangers as well. Therefore, while taking the policy, you choose what all your vehicle insurance covers.What affects the premium of vehicle insurance?This is ascertained by the insurance company underwriting the risk, which impacts the premium calculation. Some of them being as follows:- Risks related to vehicles: In this the fuel type, cubic capacities, the make and other specifications related to vehicle are taken into account. Also, age of the vehicle is another parameter in the same category, so at the time of renewal if the insured Declared Value (IDV) determines the premium that you pay. Where, IDV is calculated by the age of the vehicle at the time of the renewal and the depreciation on the same. And for vehicles with less than five years old, depreciation is applied basis the number of years the vehicle is used, which is applied to the ex-showroom price to calculate their IDV. And for vehicle that is older than five years, the market value is taken to be the IDV of the car.- Risks related to location: So here, location of registration determines the premium calculation. The premium of areas that have more population, has high record of thefts, falls under urban area, is near highways, etc. get the premium soaring.- Previous claims made: If you've previously also claimed your vehicle insurance, the premium can go up.- Claims related to drivers: Who all drive the car and their details on age and profession in case of multiple drivers can also impact the premium.- Nil-depreciation: This allows complete claim for everything that goes in your car including the plastic and rubber used. Generally an insurance company will only pay half the value of these parts, which in case of a claim can be completely be taken care by them and knocked off from your repair bill. Nil-depreciation is however bound to increase your premium, but is considered useful.- Personnel Cover: A comprehensive cover would include personal accident for the owner as well. However, if one has to pay little additional fee to get the additional users who drive the car to be covered under the policy, it would be beneficial.
