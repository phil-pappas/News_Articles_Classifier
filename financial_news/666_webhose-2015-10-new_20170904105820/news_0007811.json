Nobody benefits from rigging tests. \n“I have worked for VW for over 15 years, I understand the structures, the reporting lines, the different pressures and the corporate goals. My opinion is that senior management are very precise, honest and direct people. I don’t think I can say that person is dishonest or that person is honest.” \nMPs also quizzed the executive about suggestions that VW’s 2016 Beetle, Golf, Jetta and Passat (LSE: 0NF6.L - news ) models contain suspect software intended to reduce emissions that is different from the previously admitted defeat devices. Committee chairman Huw Irranca-Davies asked if this signalled the “problem goes deeper than the odd rogue software programmer” and whether there were more admissions to come from VW. \nMr Willis hit back, saying “it is absolutely not the case that it goes wider” and revealing that the latest devices were part of the process to get cars certified for sale in the US. \nThe newly revealed software heats up cars' catalytic convertors to make them more efficient. Regulators have yet to rule if it is designed specifically to beat tests but all such devices have to be revealed to authorities if cars are to receive the certification required for them to go on sale in the US. \nMr Willis added that VW has 45,000 staff working in technical development and that to try to say exactly who knew what would be “getting dragged into speculation”. \nMr Willis added that an external investigation by law firm Jones Day should report by the end of the year and the company would share the findings when it gets them. \n“VW’s future depends on transparency,” he said. \nClaims that the scandal will reduce the value of affected cars may be wrong, according to the VW executive. \n“In the US in other cases safety-related issues that killed people and not mentioning names once the fix was made, there was no effect on residual values,” Mr Willis said. \nHe added that it was “premature” to talk about compensation but when pushed by the chairman whether “VW would make good if customers have lost out”, Mr Willis replied: “We will sit down with owners if it gets to that point.” \n= Communication = \nCommunications between the company and the 1.2m UK motorists affected by the scandal also came under MPs’ scrutiny. The VW boss agreed this could have been better, after MP John McNally referred to “letters woefully short on detail with no mention of redress”. \n“I agree the level of information to customers needs to be faster and to improve,” he said. “Once I knew which cars were affected I started the process of how we would communicate. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the most important thing I can do is… overcommunicate. Our responsibility is to make sure people know.” \nBoth Mr Willis and Mike Hawes, chief executive of industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, came under fire over emissions tests on vehicles. \nMPs said the industry was happy to adhere to tests that auto-makers knew were unrealistic, but both men said car companies were meeting the required standards and investing billions in green technology. \nHowever, Mr Willis said that it was “no secret” there was a gap between emissions in real-world driving and lab tests, and that he would be happy to face tougher standards. \nThe news came as German transport regulator KBA ordered a mandatory recall of 2.4m Volkswagen diesel vehicles, having rejected the idea of a \"voluntary repair\" proposed by the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:46:58.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
