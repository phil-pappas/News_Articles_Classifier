It will also help our UK petrochemical assets to have ongoing access to competitive energy,\" INEOS Chairman Jim Ratcliffe said in a statement. \nIneos announced plans last year to make a $1 billion investment in British shale gas exploration with an ambition to become the country's biggest shale gas player. \nA LetterOne spokesman confirmed the sale. \n\"DEA will now use the proceeds from the sale to invest in its core growth areas in Europe and North Africa,\" he said. \nNeither company gave financial details of the sale. \nThe sale process attracted interest from several buyers, including private equity funds which have built up resources over the past year for acquisitions in the sector, banking sources have said. \nThe initial offers submitted in July fell far short of LetterOne's target price of up to $1.2 billion, with the highest offers coming in at around $750 million, several sources close to the process have said. \n(This story corrects day in first paragraph to Sunday from Saturday) \n(Reporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by David Clarke)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:14:51.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
