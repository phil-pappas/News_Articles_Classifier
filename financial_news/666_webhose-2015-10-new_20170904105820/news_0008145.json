Jonathan Barrett Former Rabobank money market trader Paul Thompson has spent the weekend in a Perth jail cell after being arrested over allegations he was part of a global Libor-rigging scandal.\nMr Thompson, known widely as \"Thomo\", is the first Australian to have been arrested and charged with allegedly manipulating the lending rates that underpin the world's financial system . The United States Department of Justice is seeking to have him extradited.\nThe former head of Rabobank's money market and derivatives trading for south-east Asia is in Hakea Prison, south of Perth city, where those remanded in custody are kept while they wait to appear in court.\nA spokesman for the Thompson family said he would apply for bail.\nOutside Paul Thompson's home in Dalkeith. \"The family will seek bail for Paul as there is no need for him to be in prison while they address the extradition process,\" the spokesman said. \"Paul is a devoted family man who poses no risk at all to the community.\"\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, is the benchmark used to set the rate on trillions of dollars of bonds, home loans and other interest-rate products around the world. Under a previous system – now overhauled – the rate was set based on an average of submissions by a panel of 16 banks.\nBig fines for banks Banks would submit rates they could theoretically borrow at in the market, rather than actual prices, opening the way for false pricing. Some banks and traders collaborated to shift Libor to a \"fix\" which would make them money on derivatives linked to the rate.\n Banks have been hit with billions of dollars of fines.\nMr Thompson, who was born in Fremantle and has his family home in the upmarket Perth suburb of Dalkeith, worked in Rabobank's Singapore office from 2006 to 2011. He has been indicted by a grand jury in the US over allegations he conspired to manipulate the rate, which led to his arrest by Australian Federal Police officers on Thursday.\nOther traders are already on trial in New York for similar alleged offences. The criminal charges carry possible jail terms of up to 30 years.\nThe family spokesman said Mr Thompson had never worked in the United States, nor did he work for a US company, and did not have any direct connections to America.\n\"The family had hoped that, as this case evolved, Paul could have an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations in either Australia or the UK,\" the spokesman said.\n\"In either of those countries he would have good access to the necessary evidence, witnesses, financial and emotional support to defend himself properly. This would be in the same way that some of the UK citizens involved in this investigation have had the opportunity to defend themselves at home.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:41:27.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
