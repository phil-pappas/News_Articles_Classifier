Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Unwilling vendors in strata bodies could lose out under proposed new laws in NSW designed to allow for greater renewal of housing stock, a strata-law expert warns.\nLaws introduced last week to the NSW Parliament permit strata apartment blocks to be demolished if just 75 per cent of owners approve of their sale, but weaknesses in the way owners share in the profit from those developments mean dissenting lot owners can be short-changed, lawyer David Bannerman said.\n\"If this law comes in, you've effectively created a major distinction between strata title value and Torrens title values,\" Mr Bannerman said. \"There's presently no distinction between the two.\"\nTorrens title refers to ownership of a dwelling and the land it is on, while under strata title ownership is limited to the dwelling itself.\nThe new laws, the first of their type in Australia, will be debated in the chamber over the next two weeks. They could end the stalemate that prevents many buildings in need of redevelopment going ahead, based on the opposition of as few as one resident, and would pave the way for faster rejuvenation of much-needed housing stock in NSW. But if they are perceived to weaken individual owners' rights too much, they could struggle to win support.\nUnder the rules, any proposed development must prove to the state's Land and Environment Court – equivalent in stature to the Supreme Court – that it had financing for the development. But where, for example, a four-level development had been rezoned for a 10-level development, a developer didn't have to show financing for the full 10-level building, but could show it for a smaller scheme, like an eight-level development, Mr Bannerman said.\nWith that approved, the developer could pay out vendors on the estimated profit that would come from the eight-level scheme and then submit a new application to extend that to a more lucrative 10-level development, Mr Bannerman said.\nThe state was on top of that risk, said the Minister for Innovation and Better Regulation, Victor Dominello.\n \"We are going to have in there a provision,\" Mr Dominello told The Australian Financial Review . \"The value of the property must be on highest and best use.\"\nHe also said any failure by proponents to be transparent and honest would come back to bite them legally.\n\"We will make sure proponents are aware of their continuous obligation of full and fair disclosure.\"\nHowever, Mr Bannerman said the term \"highest and best use\" wasn't defined and would vary between strata owners. A person planning to stay in a redeveloped building that gave them better facilities would, for example, see the matter differently from an owner who wanted to sell out and wanted the best financial return.\nHe also said Mr Dominello's promise of transparency was not supported in the legislation.\n\"The minister makes a number of motherhood statements about continuous disclosure and honesty which are not provided for.\"\nMr Bannerman also said the proposed laws do not make adequate provision for the loss of goodwill that could occur when a lot owner with a long-term lease with a tenant such as a cafe required the tenant to vacate. As a result, the lot owner could be sued for loss of goodwill by the tenant.\nMr Dominello said the court would have broad discretion to consider all the financial implications of a proposal and would only permit it if convinced it was equitable.\nTenants could make claims, but it wouldn't be possible to do so realistically at the time of the application, Mr Bannerman responded. It could take years for the tenant's loss to be become quantifiable.\".", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-10-19T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:06:20.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
