Parker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will leave the Company in November to serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Springleaf Holdings, Inc. ( NYSE: LEAF ). John A. Thain, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Scott has been an important member of the CIT senior leadership team and has played a central role in the financial restructuring of CIT. He led our efforts to improve our liability structure as we successfully eliminated or refinanced approximately $31 billion of high-cost debt and was instrumental in our efforts to return approximately $1.7 billion to investors. In addition, he worked with the team to improve our commercial franchises, as well as oversaw the exits of our non-strategic portfolios over the past five years. On behalf of our Board of Directors, shareholders and employees I thank Scott for his dedication and commitment to CIT and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.” Parker joined CIT in July 2010 and has served as the Company’s Principal Financial Officer overseeing all financial operations including the Accounting, Planning, Tax, Treasury and Investor Relations departments.
