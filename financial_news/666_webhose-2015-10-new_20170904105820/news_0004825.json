Branch chairperson of the South African Students Congress on campus, Jacob Tau, told African Eye News Service that the Mbombela students were supporting the general protest against fees, but also drafted their own memorandum to raise problems specific to them. \"[We] drafted our own issues which directly affect us, especially issues of residency. Less than 10% of our students here are in residence, whereas the Higher Education Act says it should be at least 50%,\" he said. He was also critical of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). \"The NSFAS does not help us, it only benefits a few students, which is not what the Constitution and the Freedom Charter say,\" said Tau. He said if the TUT campus did not address the students' concerns; particularly the issue of residency, the students would shut it down. Student Neo Mohlala said she arrived to find the gates had been locked and had to return home. \"We stayed outside for a while and were told to return home. Some started singing struggle songs. As students, we like what is happening because fees are too expensive. Our parents are struggling,\" said Mohlala. Dr Annemarie Breytenbach, the acting campus director at TUT Mbombela, confirmed that all campuses including Mbombela have been closed. \"Yes, the campus has been closed until further notice. This includes the others,\" she said. Tshwane University of Technology spokesperson Willa de Ruyter could not be found for comment as her cellphone was off.
