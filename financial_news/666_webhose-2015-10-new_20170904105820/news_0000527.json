We will closely monitor the risk of tensions in Europe and revived military intervention in Syria.\" Against that backdrop, they highlighted the need to also monitor the risk of revived military intervention in the Middle Eastern country. \nIn economic terms, the fiscal impact and that on labour markets was expected to be \"small\". \nAt the European Union-level it would result in extra fiscal spending of €6bn in 2015 and another €23bn in 2016, while boosting the Eurozone's labour force by 900,000 people by the end of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:31:55.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
