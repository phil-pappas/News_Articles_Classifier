Envato was selected by almost every venture capitalist as being a likely unicorn. Pat Scala One of Australia's best known tech investors, Daniel Petre of Airtree Ventures, says Australia is going to see an increase in the number of unicorns, thanks to a healthy start-up ecosystem.\n\"While it is harder here than the US, it is not necessarily that much harder; the key is being able to accurately focus on the problem you are solving for a customer, wherever they are,\" he says.\nLocal tech investors from major firms including Blackbird Ventures, Square Peg Capital, Right Click Capital and Blue Chilli were also asked which start-ups they believed were most likely to become unicorns.\nWith understandable bias towards some companies in which the firms had invested inevitable, a select number of companies were mentioned time and time again.\n Envato Blackbird Ventures managing partner Niki Scevak believes Envato, which operates an online marketplace for creatives, has what it takes. \"With Envato, it [started with] the global ambition of being the best in the world and so it did not restrict itself to the local market,\" he says.\nThe business has reached over $50 million in revenue without external investment. It also has a user community of 5.5 million people.\n\"Increased ambition increases the markets a business can sell to ... Venture capital is a messy business where most will fail, so for those that succeed it matters that they succeed wildly.\"\nThe Canva team, lead by Melanie Perkins (centre). The business is tipped by investors to be a $1 billion company. Louie Douvis Canva Despite only having been around since 2012, online design platform Canva has become something of a tech scene darling. It recently raised $US6 million ($8.5 million) from a handful of the country's best-known investors .\nIts tool to make graphic design simple has grown rapidly, to have influence at home and in the key market of the United States, Alan Jones of BlueChilli says.\n\"Canva addresses a very valuable problem. It's a uniquely accessible solution that addresses millions of customers. It's like Microsoft Publisher or Adobe Indesign, but for the rest of us.\"\nDave Griener and Ben Richardson from Campaign Monitor. Nic Walker The business has 5 million users, including Fortune 500 companies such as Yelp and Hubspot, operates in 179 countries, and has raised more than $12 million.\nJones said businesses with unicorn potential needed global customer bases. \"It's very hard to build a business that's worth $1 billion in a marketplace with 25 million people,\" he says.\nCampaign Monitor Email marketing business Campaign Monitor is perhaps closest to a $1 billion valuation, after raising $US250 million from New York's Insight Venture Partners last year .\nIt was the first money the business had raised from investors and it resulted in the company's founders, David Greiner and Ben Richardson, earning their spot on the BRW Rich List with an estimated wealth of $500 million.\nThe business has more than 120,000 clients, including BuzzFeed, Coca-Cola, RipCurl and Airbnb.\nJones said all highly successful tech companies had aligned cultural values from the leadership team to the employee.\n\"You don't just see 25 per cent productivity; there's a real dedication, long hours and sacrifice [from the team].\"\nAconex The only listed tech company mentioned by multiple venture capitalists was Aconex. After listing on the Australian Securities Exchange at $1.90 late last year , the construction industry software provider is now trading above $4.10 and has a market capitalisation of $685.3 million.\nIt has customers in 70 countries and has delivered over $800 billion in projects.\nRight Click Capital partner Benjamin Chong said to get to the unicorn size Australian companies could not just focus on home markets.\n\"My view is that Australian founders should think about international markets from the get go; they can certainly start with Australian customers close to home, and use that learning to expand overseas,\" he said.\nThis point was echoed by Pollenizer chief start-up scientist Phil Morle, who said a product risked developing \"domestic dependencies,\" if it failed to look internationally.\n\"Quickly testing that the model can work in at least two markets is a pragmatic way to get a start-up at the start of the road to being a unicorn.\"\nRokt â€‹Headed by former Jetstar chief executive Bruce Buchanan, digital marketing company ROKT is another with global reach and a strong team of employees and financial backers.\nSquare Peg Capital and SEEK co-founder Paul Bassat tipped the business as one to reach the $1 billion milestone.\n\"They're getting strong traction in the US and have partners such as eBay and Ticketek. They're solving big important problems in a differentiated way,\" he said.\n\"First and foremost with them it's about people, outstanding people who not just have really strong intellects, but they're really passionate, resilient and they know what they don't know and can bring in a great team and management capability.\"\nAnd investor Bassat is not the only one to have faith in the business. ROKT is also backed by Lachlan Murdoch and Carsales.com chief executive Greg Roebuck.\nOther potential stars Other local tech businesses experts tipped to reach unicorn status included app maker Halfbrick, e-commerce platform BigCommerce and Hipages Group which runs a website connecting individuals with trades people.\nInvoice2Go, RedBubble, TokenOne and SpaceConnect also scored mentions.\nPetre and his Airtree Ventures co-founder Craig Blair believe Australian government support and policies have now been reformed sufficiently to allow the start-up community to thrive.\n\"There are a number of scaled VC funds now who can fund seed to series A rounds and there are hundreds of millions of dollars available for start-ups. And there will be more series B/C funds raised in the next few years,\" Blair said.\n\"We don't need more government support for financing. Funds will flow if the returns are there. Investing in engineering, science and maths graduates, celebrating our tech success stories and making government data available is what's needed.\"\nSquare Peg Capital's Paul Bassat picked ROKT as a potential unicorn.
