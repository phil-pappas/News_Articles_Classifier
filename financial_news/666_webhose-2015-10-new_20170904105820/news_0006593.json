There were 9158 apartments approved in August across Australia, only just behind the 9562 house approvals,' Mr Johnson said.\nAn office building at 175 Castlereagh Street in Sydney is on the market and likely to attract interest as a future residential opportunity.\nThe site, which is close to Town Hall Station and two doors from ANZ Bank's new headquarters, has the potential for the development of about 200 residential apartments and 100 hotel rooms.\nThe location lends itself to a 50-level tower, with views east over Hyde Park and Sydney Harbour.\nThe Castlereagh Street building, which is owned by Centuria Property Funds, will be brought to market by Colliers International's national director, capital markets, Vince Kernahan.\n\"Its existing uses (office and retail) are experiencing strong and growing demand and its potential uses (residential and hotel) are in greatest demand, as can be seen by the number of recent nearby sales surrounding Hyde Park,\" Mr Kernahan said.\nCharter Keck Cramer research shows there are 2162 apartments under construction or being marketed across central Sydney, which includes the CBD, Barangaroo and Pyrmont-Ultimo, with fewer than 50 of these apartments still available.\nOver the last two years, there has been more than 90 per cent market absorption for new apartments across the central city.\nCharter Keck Cramer's strategic research principal, Toby Adams, who is based in Sydney, said while trophy projects in the central city such as the Greenland Centre and Anadara at Barangaroo might capture headlines, the bulk of the apartment development action was in the middle-ring hotspots such as Parramatta, Epping and Wentworth Point.\nThe firm uses its own database as well as development approval figures, the Cordell Project construction research and local council data, among other sources.\n\"Our national apartment database shows that 57 per cent of new supply scheduled over the coming two to three years will come from the middle region, compared with just 6 per cent from the central city,\" Mr Adams said.\n\"This is a vastly different supply picture to that seen in Melbourne where 42 per cent (or about 24,000 apartments) of active supply is occurring in the central city region.\"\nMr Adams said site scarcity was the key reason cited for the lack of apartment projects in central Sydney and this was driving the conversion trend for non-residential buildings and the innovative mix within individual developments.\n\"A prime example . . . is the proposed residential redevelopment of the Gold Fields House office building at Circular Quay by Chinese developer Dalian Wanda. Purchased in January 2015 for $415 million from Blackstone, the Dalian Wanda scheme contemplates the demolition of the existing office building and is expected to yield 184 apartments in addition to hotel and retail components,\" Mr Adams said.\nThe joint selling agent to the transaction, JLL's Ben Hunter, said most inquiries for the older-style office asset were from buyers intending to redevelop for residential purposes.\n\"Any available Sydney CBD office stock which is B-Grade or inferior is attracting interest primarily from purchasers intending to unlock underlying residential potential,\" Mr Hunter said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:25:21.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
