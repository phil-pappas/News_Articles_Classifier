(AP) -- Mattel says its profit fell by one-third as sales of Barbie and other toys mainly marketed to girls declined and the strong U.S. dollar continued to pressure its revenue.\nThe company said its revenue sank 11 percent from last year, with most of the drop coming from the strength of the dollar relative to other currencies. The strong dollar makes its products more expensive in other countries and also reduces revenue from overseas when it's changed back into dollars. Mattel said Barbie sales slumped outside the U.S., dropping 14 percent worldwide compared to a year ago, while sales of its \"Other Girls\" brands, which include Monster High and Disney Classics, fell 29 percent.\nFisher-Price sales fell 6 percent and American Girl sales dropped 3 percent. Sales of Matchbox and Hot Wheels, the \"Wheels\" division, rose 6 percent.\nShares of Mattel Inc. lost 82 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $21.71 in aftermarket trading.\nThe company said its net income shrank to $223.8 million, or 66 cents per share. The El Segundo, California, company said it earned 71 cents per share if one-time costs are excluded. Its revenue fell to $1.79 billion from $2.02 billion.\nAnalysts expected net income of 79 cents per share and $1.89 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.\nShares of Mattel have fallen 27 percent in 2015, closing at $22.53 Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:02:11.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
