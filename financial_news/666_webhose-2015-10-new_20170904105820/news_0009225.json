Final decision on the matter is likely to come in a month’s time,” the source said.\nAt present, the regulations for for expansion, priority sector lending, shareholding pattern are different for private and foreign banks.\nCurrently, 74 per cent FDI is permitted in private sector banking, of which up to 49 per cent is allowed under the automatic route and beyond that through the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).\nHowever, portfolio investments in the banking sector can go up to 49 per cent.\nThe proposal to hike the FDI limit would help the existing private sector banks, payments banks and small finance banks tap overseas markets to enhance their capital base. RBI has recently given in-principle approval to 11 entities to set up payments banks and to 10 entities for small banks.\nForeign direct investment into the country grew 31 per cent to USD 9.50 billion during April-June this fiscal.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 7:54 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:45:11.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
