Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Exclusive\nUpmarket stationery chain Kikki.K is considering raising capital from new and existing investors as the 15-year old retailer embarks on an ambitious global expansion strategy.\nKikki.K, which started selling Swedish-designed stationery in Melbourne in 2001, will open its first two stores in Britain before Christmas and is looking for potential sites in the United States and Europe.\nFounder Kristina Karlsson and co-founder and partner Paul Lacy have ruled out an initial public offer and have spurned takeover offers, but are speaking to minority shareholders and venture-capital firms here and abroad about raising new capital to fund overseas growth.\n\"We have some terrific investors we've partnered with over the years, we're working with that group, and we'll probably raise a bit more capital at some point,\" Mr Lacy said.\n\"We have also had some approaches from people in San Francisco, Boston, the UK, Hong Kong and Australia; we are sorting through that to find who would be great for us to partner with on this next step,\" Mr Lacy said.\n\"The idea is to work with people we have a great cultural match with and who understand the brand very well. We want to work with the world's best.\"\nSwedish-born Kristina \"Kikki\" Karlsson came up with the idea for a Swedish-inspired stationery chain 15 years ago when she struggled to find functional yet stylish products for her home office.\n Store numbers have doubled in the past five years and annual sales are estimated to have reached almost $60 million in 2015, although the company refuses to discuss its finances. Kikki.K now has about 80 stores in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore, and sells online to customers in 137 countries.\nThe couple retain control of the company but have raised capital from well-heeled investors, including Boost Juice founder Janine Allis, the Myer family, former ecorp chief executive, now Westpac director, Alison Deans, former Jurlique managing director Sam McKay, who is Kikki.K's chairman, and KordaMentha's investment and advisory arm 333 Capital.\nMs Karlsson said opening stores in London, New York, Stockholm and Paris was \"part of our vision from day one. We know Swedish design worldwide is very popular and people are embracing it.\nThe company, which has more than 500,000 followers on social media and communicates directly with 1 million customers, is using online traffic and social media feedback to determine where to open its first British, US and European stores.\n\"There's been 170,000 people in the UK in the last 12 months who have bought online or interacted with us via our website,\" said Mr Lacy, who was a senior marketing executive at Rip Curl before bowing to pressure from Kristina to sell his house to fund the retailer's early growth.\n\"Twelve months ago our warehouse was getting absolutely bombed with online orders from around the world. It took a while to work out what was going on,\" he said.\n\"We discovered there was this undercurrent of sharing on social media, where people who were stationery addicts like Kristina would order from us and film themselves on YouTube unboxing the Kikki.K products – 50,000 people have uploaded videos in the last 12 months,\" he said.\n​\"So it's exciting to bring the brand to people who would love the opportunity to be in a physical store.\"\nKikki.K hired award-winning British-based retail design agency Dalziel & Pow to design a new-concept store that is twice the size of Kikki.K's typical boutiques, and will be the template for flagship stores here and overseas.\nThe first Kikki.K Studio opened at Chadstone shopping centre in Melbourne on Saturday. It features floor-to-ceiling digital displays, bespoke fittings, a range of homewares from Ms Karlsson's favourite Scandinavian designers, and a large wooden worktable where customers can get creative,\nThe retailer is opening two stores in London's Covent Garden before Christmas – a flagship studio and a pop-up store – and is looking for suitable sites in New York.\nFerrier Hodgson retail partner James Stewart said overseas expansion made sense for Kikki.K, particularly in light of the success of Solomon Lew's Smiggle chain , which has opened more than 24 stores in Britain and plans to open 40 in that country and 10 in Asia each year for the next few years.\n​\"Going to the UK could be a good move because they have that Nordic aesthetic, that's definitely worth exploring for them,\" Mr Stewart said.\n\"If you look at what Smiggle is doing, Covent Garden is a good location for Kikki.K if they have a store with reasonable exposure that's in a good location for them.\"\n\"Dalziel & Pow are world renowned so they've gone top shelf, but that means you'll want stores to perform well to justify the investment.\"\nKikki.K's overseas expansion will require considerable capital at a time when the home office and stationery market in Australia is becoming increasingly competitive.\nWesfarmers' category killer Officeworks has launched a range of colourful and stylish home-office products, Japanese clothing and homewares retailer Muji, known for its minimalist style, is opening as many as six stores in Australia, and Cotton On Group's Typo is expanding.\nMs Karlsson and Mr Lacy have no immediate plans for an IPO and have rejected approaches from acquisitive private equity investors such as LVMH's L Capital, which owns Australian brands Seafolly, Jones the Grocer, RM Williams and 2XU.\n\"Kristina wants to keep doing what we love and in a way where we can execute it beautifully and control it well, so [an IPO or sale] is not something we're thinking about,\" Mr Lacy said.\n\"There's real beauty in founders driving businesses with passion and we're in that sweet spot.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:05:25.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
