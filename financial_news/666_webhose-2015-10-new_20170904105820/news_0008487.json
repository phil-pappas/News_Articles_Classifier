Another 206,000 bpd came from the United States and Canada.\nTotal foreign crude imports into the province from outside North America vary from month-to month, according to the data, but range around the 100,000 bpd mark.\nOther countries that have exported to Quebec so far this year include Norway, Russia, Angola and the United Kingdom.\n\"Once Line 9B is operational, the refinery will replace more-expensive crude with less-expensive crude,\" said Valero spokesman Bill Day.\nA recent Valero investor presentation showed the refinery currently takes around 80 percent North American crude, with the rest imported from overseas.\nSuncor did not specify how much overseas crude it processes but spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said some of the Brent-linked crude comes from Suncor's own offshore Atlantic Canada projects.\nAnalysts said Line 9's ability to deliver crude to Montreal will be a further blow to the struggling crude-by-rail industry.\nSuncor has capability to receive 40,000 bpd by rail, while Valero has capacity to take 60,000 bpd, although the actual volumes vary depending on economics.\n\"Some of those railed barrels will be displaced by piped barrels because of cheaper transportation costs,\" said ITG Investment analyst Judith Dwarkin.\nDwarkin said Valero also imports barrels from the Gulf Coast, shipping them north on foreign-flagged vessels to Montreal, and those flows will likely be disrupted too.
