Quickly installed, it reduces the clutter on web pages, speeds up performance and spares users from some of the click-bait that many find hard to stomach.\n“When people are even willing to pay to stop adverts, it gives you an idea of how fed up they are,” said Hicham Berrada, head of France de Teads, a video advertising firm.\nWhile the Chinese government trawls websites for politically sensitive content, they remain littered with pop-up advertising, forcing millions to buy apps such as “360 Mobilephone Guard”.\nIn Hong Kong, mobile ad-blockers “Purify Blocker” and “Crystal” recently entered the top 30 paid-for iPhone apps.\nA study by Adobe and PageFair in August said the losses for websites that rely on advertising could be huge — totalling an estimated $21.8 billion (19.3 billion euros) this year and rising to $41 billion in 2016.\nBut few mourn the loss of nuisance publicities, with Hong Kong tech site Unwire.hk recently promoting the blocking apps even though the magazine itself relies on advertising revenue.\n“As an employee of Unwire, writing this tutorial does not do good to the boss’s livelihood, but I also understand some people do not have unlimited data plans and it’s a pain to be receiving data-consuming ad banners,” said reviewer Tim Yan.\n 11, 2015 4:04 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:04:27.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
