Advertising Analysis / Photo: Bloomberg \nYesterday it was revealed by Playtech that the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) was opposing their planned acquisition of AvaTrade . Adding another update, Playtech has announced today that they are going to challenge the CBI’s decision. \nThe CBI’s involvement comes as AvaTrade’s EU based financial license is issued through the CBI. In this regard, AvaTrade is one of the few forex retail brokers to have a CBI license, with most brokers whose founders who are based out of the EU elect to set up their operations in Cyprus or the UK. \nFor its part, like many brokers AvaTrade had initially headquartered its dealing operation within Cyprus. However, operating in the country without regulation, Ava’s license request from CySEC was rejected in 2008. This ultimately caused them to scramble to find another EU financial regulator to accommodate their brokerage activities, with the CBI granting them a license at the last minute. For Ava, known as AvaFX as the time, the CBI’s license was viewed as a lifesaver as a regulator in an important EU country they were marketing to was close to kicking them out. \nWith this backstory, while Playtech hasn’t revealed the CBI’s reservations to the deal, there are several issues that could be at play. Most notably is the belief that a gaming company is acquiring a broker. However, if this is the case, then Playtech would seemingly have legal grounds to push the acquisition forward. Playtech Regulation \nAlong with Plus500, AvaTrade was expected to be rolled up within Playtech’s new financial services division that was created when they purchased Markets.com . That division contains financial licenses from several jurisdiction including the EU from CySEC. In addition, as stated within their financial updates, Playtech has also received a financial license from the UK’s FCA for an entity created last year. Finance Magnates has learned that the trading name of this business is Epsilon Finance. As such, despite potential licensing concerns from the CBI, Playtech should have the available regulatory framework already in place to absorb AvaTrade. \nHowever, beyond any licensing concerns, the CBI could be stalling the deal due to further due diligence of AvaTrade’s business. As mentioned above, Ava arrived to Ireland with legacy regulation issues. Therefore, before the CBI provides their stamp of approval to the deal, they could be requiring that any loose strings such as pending customer complaints or accounting records are finalized. \nOverall, with the exception of an accounting problem which yields findings of a customer asset shortfall, Playtech’s existing regulation they have put in place should be enough to overcome challenges from the CBI.
