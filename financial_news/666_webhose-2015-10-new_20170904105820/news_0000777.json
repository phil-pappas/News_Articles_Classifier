First up? New York and Philadelphia by the end of 2016.Currently, Society of Grownups has a single location in the Brookline neighborhood of Boston. There, several times each week, certified financial planners from the staff conduct classes about money. Upcoming topics include career choice, spending plans and saving for retirement (subtitle: \"Whatever That Is.\") A few times a month they host supper clubs with themes like couples and money, and clients, which the company calls \"grownups,\" can come by for one-on-one meetings with planners. Classes typically cost $30, supper clubs $40 and advice sessions $20 or $90 depending on the length of the meeting.“At MassMutual, one of our top priorities is innovating to meet the needs of this next generation of adults. They are facing considerable financial challenges like historic student debt and soaring housing prices, yet they are hugely underserved by the financial services industry,” said Gareth Ross, a senior vice president at MassMutual in a statement on the latest investment. “The traditional financial services model is broken, which is why we needed to make a bold move to disrupt the market.”The 164 year-old life insurance company originally invested $10 million to start the Society of Grownups, which operates as an independent subsidiary. Right now Society of Grownups' only revenue stream is events but it currently testing corporate and university partnerships. Down the road they also expects to collect licensing fees by recommending financial products to clients through an online exchange. Could this lead to conflicts of interest? Sure, but the company says it will always offer multiple options, swears it will not favor MassMutual products over others and plans to give a portion of the fee back to clients to offset the cost.Since the recession countless startups have appeared with the goal of helping young people with their money. It turned out to be smart business for many: The Millennial generation is huge — 75.4 million strong according to the Census Bureau -- and they have years of accumulation and money woes ahead. More recently established financial firms have joined in buying up the startups, building their own platforms or forming partnerships. Nearly all of these efforts have been technology based, in many cases not even requiring a human to interact with the end client. This makes the Society of Grownups unique but also significantly more costly per client served. They've found success so far, but whether it can scale is an open question.The year-old pilot location looks like a trendy coffee shop. Society ads featuring black and white photos of 20-somethings could easily be mistaken for a clothing brand's and the @ societygrownups Instagram feed could belong to your coolest friend. The concept is something out of a financially-conscious hipster's daydreams but turns out it might be just crazy enough to work. So far they've hosted 1,000 grownups at 111 supper clubs and classes, about a quarter of which have sold out. They've also held 119 networking and community events and 350 planning sessions. A few thousand more people have signed up online.Society of Grownups CEO Nondini Naqui views the demand as a sign that young people want and need to talk about money. By facilitating conversations with financial experts and among Millennials themselves, Naqui hopes to break down the taboo around finances and help grownups through a time in their lives when a lot is changing.“If there is one thing I have learned through this past year it is that all grownups think the other grownups have it figured out,\" she said in an interview. \"When we talk to people in their 20s, they say: all those people in their 30s? They know exactly what they are doing. When we talk to people in theirs 30s, they say: all the people who are married know what they are doing. When you talk to people who are married they say: when you have a kid you definitely know what you are doing. Here’s the real deal — everybody is trying to figure things out.” Related From Forbes: [gallery2012]", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/societyofgrownups/", "https://content.societyofgrownups.com/content/uploads/2015/01/SoG_outside.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:17:51.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
