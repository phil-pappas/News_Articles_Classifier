But he contended that's \"not enough\" for a pause. \"The Fed hasn't completely missed the window. I think end of this year is likely; certainly not October.\"\nEarlier this month, the Labor Department reported nonfarm job creation of a lower than expected 142,000 positions for September. The unemployment rate last month held steady at 5.1 percent, matching forecasts.\nJob growth in August and July was revised lower.\nFed likely to raise rates this year: Professor\nMartin Feldstein, Harvard University professor, shares his thoughts on why the Federal Reserve could move to increase interest rates in 2015.\nContinued weakness in the labor picture could certainly keep the Fed on hold, said Harvard professor Martin Feldstein. But he agreed with Ebner that the Fed would likely act in December.\n\"I think they're going to do it this year,\" said Feldstein, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan. \"You've got the leadership of the Fed all saying that they expect it to happen this year.\"\nFed Chair Janet Yellen and the dovish members of the central bank would like to see the unemployment rate come down further, he said. \"[But] there's no reason why that couldn't happen if they start normalizing.\"\nAny rate hike would only be \"moving from super, super easy to just a little less easy,\" he said on \"Squawk Box.\"\nEven stubbornly low inflation should not hold policymakers back, Feldstein said.\n\"If you look at the core number, it's 1.4 percent. That'll keep coming up with tighter markets,\" he said. Core inflation excludes the beaten down energy sector. The Fed's target is 2 percent.\nMorning Squawk:\nCNBC's before the bell news roundup Sign up to get Morning Squawk each weekday\nJob Industry Advertising/Marketing Automotive Communications/PR Construction/Manufacturing Education Finance/Banking/Insurance Legal Media/Entertainment Medical/Health Care Mining/Oil/Gas/Utilities Gov't/Non-Profit Real Estate Retail Technology/IT Transportation/Shipping Travel/Hospitality Other Submit Please enter a valid email address To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy .", "external_links": ["http://nbcuni.com/privacy/", "http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:41:59.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
