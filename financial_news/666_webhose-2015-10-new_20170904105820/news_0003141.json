( DPM.TO )( DPM-WTA.TO ) (\"DPM\" or \"the Company\") announced its mine and smelter production results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and confirmed the timing of the release of third quarter operating and financial results, together with the related conference call and webcast. \nOn a consolidated basis, ore milled, gold, copper, zinc and silver production and complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb in the first nine months of 2015 were in line with the 2015 guidance, which is unchanged from guidance originally provided on February 12, 2015. \nProduction Highlights \nThird quarter mine and metals production at the Chelopech and Kapan mines and complex concentrate smelted at the Tsumeb smelter are provided below. Chelopech Metals contained in copper and zinc concentrates produced Gold ('000s ounces) Complex Concentrate smelted ('000s tonnes) - Payable gold in pyrite concentrate sold ('000s ounces) 12.0 33 - 36 (1) As disclosed in Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. \nChelopech copper production in the third quarter met expectations. Current copper grades and recoveries are expected to remain unchanged in the fourth quarter. Gold production in the quarter benefited from higher grades and recoveries in both copper and pyrite concentrates. Gold recovery to pyrite concentrate continued to benefit from optimization of the pyrite flotation circuit. Gold and copper production at Chelopech is expected to finish the year in line with guidance. \nAt Kapan, gold production increased by 10% over the second quarter due to improved grades resulting in gold production that meets 2015 guidance. With continued focus on improving standards, these improved gold grades are expected to continue and support annual production that meets guidance for the year. \nAt Tsumeb, smelting rates were in line with 2015 guidance, however an additional Ausmelt shutdown was initiated in September, resulting in reduced quarterly concentrate treatment and annual production that is expected to be in the lower end of its production guidance. Following a 22 day outage, in which the refractory lining was replaced, the smelter was restarted on October 4 th . The current Ausmelt lining is expected to run though to June 2016 with a single outage planned for mid-year 2016 which is intended to introduce additional operational controls in order to extend the life of the refractory lining beyond 12 months. \nThe hot commissioning of the acid plant was completed in August 2015, as planned. Acid plant ramp up and production during the quarter was in line with expectations, with a total of 19,287 tonnes of sulphuric acid produced in the quarter and the commencement of commercial operations effective October 1, 2015. \nThe Krumovgrad approval process continues to advance, albeit at a slower pace than planned. Although the Executive Forestry Agency provided preliminary approval to re-classify the project area as industrial land in late July, the Krumovgrad Municipality has not yet issued the draft Detailed Development Plan (\"DDP\"), which is the next step in the approval process. The Company anticipates the draft DDP will be issued in the fourth quarter of 2015, and is now targeting the second quarter of 2016 for receipt of the construction permit, followed by commencement of construction in the second half of 2016. \nThe Company's third quarter 2015 operating and financial results are expected to be released after market close on November 4, 2015. The press release, MD&A and consolidated financial statements will be posted on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com . \nThe Company will hold a call and webcast to discuss its Third Quarter results on Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 9:00 am EST. The call will be hosted by Rick Howes, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will be joined by Hume Kyle, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, together with other members of the executive management team. The call will be accessible via a live webcast and by telephone.
