GM said revenues would have been $2.3 billion higher if exchange rates had remained constant.\nIn the quarter, GM recorded $1.5 billion in costs related to a settlement of a U.S. Justice Department investigation into a mishandled ignition switch recall. Including the charges, net income totaled $1.36 billion, or 84 cents a share, versus $1.47 billion, or 81 cents a share.\nGM said the $3.1 billion operating profit and 8 percent profit margins in the quarter, which are both adjusted before interest and taxes, were records for any quarter.\nChief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the company has not altered expectations for diesel vehicle demand due to Volkswagen AG's emissions scandal.\nThe rise in per-share net income reflected GM's continuing share buyback program. The company said it has spent $2.9 billion through Oct. 19 in repurchases, putting it more than halfway to its previously announced $5 billion repurchase plan projected to be completed in 2016.\nStevens said the company, in negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, will not agree to labor costs that will threaten its 10 percent North America margins.\n(Reporting by Bernie Woodall and Joseph White; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)\nCompany Earnings GM profit margins North America", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:27:58.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
