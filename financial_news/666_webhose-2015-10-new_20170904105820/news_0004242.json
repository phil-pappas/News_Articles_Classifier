It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) cited fears of future sanctions against Russia which could put operations at the fields in danger and thus jeopardise Britain's energy security. \nThe United States and the European Union have imposed a series of sanctions on Russian companies, politicians and allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in an attempt to persuade the Kremlin (LSE: 0Q8D.L - news ) to change course in Ukraine. \nHowever neither Fridman nor LetterOne were ever subject to sanctions and the billionaire is not seen as particularly close to the Kremlin. \nL1 agreed to sell the UK fields this month to energy group Ineos, saying it would invest the funds into other core assets in Europe and North Africa. \nHowever, the reassurances from Britain's ministries of trade and investment as well as the department of energy are important for L1 which has chosen to be headquartered in Great Britain and is looking to expand further in energy and telecoms. \nRussian oligarchs from Roman Abramovich to Alisher Usmanov have brought in billions of dollars into Great Britain with most investments flowing into luxury properties or football clubs rather than industrial activities.
