Naphtha prices were also up 2% or 5 cents per gallon (/gal). Prices of olefins, a group of hydrocarbon compounds which are the building blocks to many petrochemical products used to produce everyday goods, tend to track naphtha prices since naphtha is the most widely used feedstock in petrochemical cracker processes worldwide. This past month, however, olefins prices tumbled as much as 24%, which is on par with the degree of the price decline in naphtha during the past two months. \nPetrochemicals are used to make plastic, rubber, nylon and other consumer products and are utilized in manufacturing, construction, pharmaceuticals, aviation, electronics and nearly every commercial industry. \nOLEFINS As a group, olefins prices were sharply lower last month. Propylene, which can be made at both the refinery and the cracker, slipped 24% to $559 per metric ton (/mt) in September, down $180 from August. Ethylene, which is primarily produced at crackers, fell 13% to $761/mt in September, down $114 from August. \nPolyethylene and polypropylene, plastics manufactured from ethylene and propylene respectively, were both lower in September. Global polyethylene prices fell 5% to $1,239/mt, while polypropylene prices fell 7% to $1,143/mt. \nAROMATICS Prices of aromatics – a group of scented hydrocarbons with benzene rings used to make a variety of petrochemicals – were also lower last month. Benzene posted the largest drop, falling 12% to $586/mt in September, down $80 from August. Toluene prices fell 4% in September to $609/mt, down $28 from August. Paraxylene, the final aromatic included in the PGPI, was down 3% in September to $765/mt, down $20 from August. \nPetrochemical prices moved in line with global equity markets in September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% while The London Stock Exchange Index (FTSE) fell 5%. The NIKKEI 225 was down 8%. \nThe PGPI reflects a compilation of the daily price assessments of physical spot market ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, paraxylene, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene as published by Platts and is weighted by the three regions of Asia, Europe and the United States. Used as a price reference, a gauge of sector activity, and a measure of comparison for determining the profitability of selling a barrel of crude oil intact or refining it into products, the PGPI was first published by Platts in August 2007. \nPublished daily in a real-time news service Platts Petrochemical Alert and other Platts publications, the PGPI is anchored by Platts' robust and long-established price assessment methodology and the firm's 100-year history of energy price reporting. \nPlatts petrochemicals experts are available for media interviews.
