It came as Russia stepped up its use of cruise missiles against Islamic State military in Syria.\n\"This exercise demonstrates the commitment of the United States to the defense of Europe through our Aegis ships and our shore station in Romania, as well as the professional performance of our allied sailors,\" said Admiral Mark Ferguson, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa.\nFerguson said the test carried out by the Maritime Theater Missile Defense Forum showed the group's ability to \"safely conduct effective coalition sea-based defense against simultaneous anti-ship and ballistic missile threats.\"\nRiki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the test showed that other countries' navies could track and relay targeting and firing information about potential missile threats to U.S. Navy ships.\nThat means the U.S. Navy can reduce the number of ships it needs for missile defense missions in the Mediterranean, instead using allied ships to help relay missile threat tracking and targeting information, he said.\n\"This is great timing because it demonstrates our capability to track and intercept the kind of missiles that are being fired in and against Syria,\" he said.\n\"It proves that sensors from another country's ship can be used to give the Navy early warning of potential threats, and those ships can be used to protect American ships,\" he said.\nU.S. Navy ships need protective escorts because they cannot protect themselves when they are carrying out missile defense missions, he said.\nEarlier this month, U.S. officials said four Russian cruise missiles fired at Syria from the Caspian Sea had crashed in Iran, while Russia insisted they had reached their targets in Syria.
