She proposed replacing him with a ‘high caliber’ individual.\n“Never again can the LIBOR desk be the place where a junior gets put to see if they are going to make the grade,\" Angela Knight, the then CEO, wrote in one 2008 e-mail. Instead Ewan stayed on for another four years.\nThe e-mail was one of several questioning the aptitude of Ewan shown to jurors by lawyers defending six brokers accused of helping former trader Tom Hayes rig the London interbank offered rate. The six men, from ICAP Plc, RP Martin Holdings Ltd. and Tullett Prebon Plc, are accused of conspiracy to defraud and will present their defense later in the trial.\nDefense lawyers argue that the BBA’s poor policing of Libor contributed to widespread problems with the benchmark.\nThe BBA oversaw Libor from the mid-1980s until it was stripped of responsibility for setting the rate in 2013, defense lawyers said. During the financial crisis Ewan was in charge of producing a report on reforming Libor following allegations of abuse, but colleagues worried that he found it hard to deal with senior bankers and regulators.\nRather than replace him, his bosses chose to monitor him more closely.\nEwan was called to testify Thursday. Dressed in a pinstripe suit and sporting mutton-chop sideburns, he frequently paused for long periods before answering the prosecutor’s questions. He is expected to face cross-examination later today or Friday.\nOn Wednesday, one of his bosses was asked for her impressions of her former colleague.\n“Was it the position that as at 2008 Mr. Ewan was becoming significantly out of his depth?” one of the defense lawyers asked Sally Scutt, who was then second in command at the BBA.\n“I think that was the view that Mrs. Knight and I held at the time, yes,” Scutt replied.\nHayes, who worked at Citigroup Inc. and UBS Group AG, was the first person convicted of charges related to the rate. He is appealing both his conviction and a 14-year-prison sentence issued by the judge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:50:44.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
