Pat Scala Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is on the hunt for a new brooch.\nShe wants one with an eagle to wear on Saturday, along with her fashionable blue and gold tartan West Coast Eagles scarf, when she heads to the MCG for the AFL grand final.\nHer beloved West Coast Eagles are the surprise packet of this year's AFL season and will face off against Hawthorn, which go in to the match firm favourites.\nIf the Hawks win it will be their third consecutive premiership. They would be just the fifth club in history to achieve the milestone.\n\"I'm picking the Eagles to win by 32 points and for [midfielder] Matt Priddis to win the Norm Smith Medal,\" Ms Bishop said.\nShe's even found support from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who has tipped the Eagles to win by 8 points.\n\"He's supporting them for cabinet solidarity,\" Ms Bishop joked, adding she was walking around with bags of Eagles scarves and would happily offer one for the PM to wear on Saturday.\nMs Bishop isn't the only West Australian to arrive in Melbourne for the clash.\n The surge in demand for flights between Perth and Melbourne pushed return airfares to about $2800. Some Eagles fans flew to Canberra before driving to Melbourne while others made bus trips across the Nullarbor.\nIt is not the only sporting migration taking place this weekend.\nThe first ever clash between two Queensland rugby league teams - the Brisbane Broncos and the North Queensland Cowboys - will see thousands of fans cross the border for Sunday night's grand final at ANZ Stadium in Sydney.\nThe Broncos are favourites. Hawthorn are not only favourites with bookmakers but are being tipped to win by EY's analytics team.\nThe prediction, deducted using 4 million bits of data spanning 15 years of AFL home and away games, was rather awkward for Perth-based EY managing partner Michael Anghie, who commissioned the research.\n\"The bit that I'm not happy about is the data predicts the Hawks to win by 23 points!\" Mr Anghie said.\nBillionaire and Seven Group chairman Kerry Stokes, who was involved in establishing the Eagles in 1986, will barrack for West Coast. AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan recently gave Mr Stokes the football from the first AFL final played in Perth, which just happened to be a game between West Coast and Hawthorn in 1991.\nWesfarmers chief executive Richard Goyder, who is an AFL commissioner, said he would be an impartial onlooker (let's face it, he supports the Fremantle Dockers).\nLess impartial will be raging Eagles fans - rich lister Nigel Satterley, WA governor Malcolm McCusker, Macquarie WA chairman Mark Barnaba, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and West Australian Premier Colin Barnett.\n\"West Australians are here [in Melbourne] in numbers and I sense nervousness from the Hawthorn fans,\" said Mr Barnett, who is tipping the Eagles to win by three goals.\nOpposition Leader and Collingwood supporter Bill Shorten is also going.\nPerhaps the most conflicted AFL fan this weekend will be Fortescue Metals Group chief executive Nev Power, who has supported the Hawks for 20 years but began barracking for the Eagles when he moved to Perth several years ago.\nMr Power has made a commitment to ditch Hawthorn entirely and become a \"fully fledged Eagle\" if they win Saturday's grand final.\n\"It will be sweet sorrow whichever way it goes,\" Mr Power said.\nRich lister Dale Alcock has given his grand final tickets to his executive assistant Kylie Creswick. Mr Alcock, a tragic Fremantle Docker's fan, said he'd prefer to do the gardening.\nFlight Centre co-founder and rich lister Geoff Harris's support for Hawthorn is unwavering. But winning, he said, would be tough.\n\"I think it's 50:50,\" Mr Harris said.\n\"We [Hawthorn] are a really good team but they [Eagles have some great players.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:57:52.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
