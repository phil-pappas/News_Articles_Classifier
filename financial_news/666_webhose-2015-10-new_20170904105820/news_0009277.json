Nostrum withdrew its proposed offer, previously announced on September 23, to acquire the entire issued share capital of Tethys after Tethys' largest shareholder, Pope Asset Management, informed Nostrum that it did not support the deal. \nOn August 10, Tethys Petroleum revealed that a separate $47.7 million financing deal with AGR Energy, which the company's management previously said represented \"a transformational deal for Tethys\", had fallen through. Following the breakdown of talks with AGR, Tethys received interest from Nostrum Oil & Gas, despite rejecting Nostrum's original takeover approach in mid-July .
