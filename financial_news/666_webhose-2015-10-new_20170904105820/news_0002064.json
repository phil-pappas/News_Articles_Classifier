A Reuters poll of 50 economists put expected growth at 6.8 percent year on year, which would be the slowest since the financial crisis in 2009. \nChina's growth in the first half of 2015, at 7 percent, was already the slowest since that time. Policymakers had previously forecast growth of \"around 7 percent\" for 2015. \nMost official and private estimates show that the Chinese labour market as a whole is outperforming the steep slowdown in industry, largely due to continuing strength in the service sector. \nBut some analysts have expressed concern that the sharp drop in industrial profits over the past year indicates deeper weakness in income growth and wages next year, which could weaken overall growth further. Industrial profits fell 8.8 percent year on year in August, the steepest drop since China's statistics agency began publishing such data in 2011. \nThe premier cited the emergence of new industries including the Internet sector, the continued need for high infrastructure investment in western regions, and ongoing urbanization as additional reasons for optimism on China's future growth trajectory. \nNonetheless, Li also highlighted the need for further market-oriented reforms and a reduced government role in the economy in order to fully grasp new economic opportunities and maintain growth. \n(Reporting by Nathaniel Taplin; Editing by Ed Davies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:16:28.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
