The price action was exaggerated, so you should expect the stock to move lower now. \n\nThe chart below shows the whole story, with numerous reversal signals highlighted. \n\n\n\nResistance was set at $32.25 since early June and has stayed under that level until early October. On earnings day, the stock's price gapped higher, following the indicated breakout. At the same time, a volume spike was accompanied by the relative strength index's move into overbought range. This is the first such move in the past six months. \n\nThis is a lot of reversal signaling, so we looked at a potential trade of buying the November 35 put option at Wednesday's close. That put closed at an ask price of 0.81. With trading fees for a single contract, this will cost $90. A modest decline in shares of GM will move this long put option into profitable range.\nThis article is commentary by an independent contributor.
