Ross D. Franklin Share on twitter by John McDuling America's most prestigious newspaper and one of its most prominent tech companies have been engaged in quite an extraordinary public dispute this week.\nIn cased you missed it. Amazon, the $US260 billion e-commerce colossus and the second best-performing stock on the US S&P 500 this year (shares are up 80 per cent), launched an offensive against The New York Times after a series of damaging reports in the paper made it look like an awful place to work .\nThe offensive was led by the company's PR chief, Jay Carney, who, before joining Amazon, was press secretary to US President Barack Obama. Carney posted a 1300 word essay on the blogging site, Medium, outlining his issues with the Times' reporting and calling into question the veracity of the former Amazon employees that were Quote: d in its stories.\nThat prompted The New York Times top editor Dean Baquet to respond with a lengthy essay (also on Medium) of his own , defending the stories. Which in turn, triggered another response from Carney, and then an article in the Times outlining it all.\nWhile it descended into a juvenile argument over semantics and quite granular details, the impasse still raised a number of interesting issues.\nIn days gone by, this dispute would have played out on the phone, or perhaps in the letters pages of the Times itself.\nUsed to be you finished a big story and watched the reax roll in. Now you have to fight for it in the public square. https://t.co/Bf7uSRDhqY\n— Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) October 20, 2015\nThis week, it was carried out over an external website, namely Medium, which is led and backed by Ev Williams, one of the founders of Twitter.\nIt is equally interesting that Amazon felt compelled to respond to The New York Times reporting when other prominent tech companies have been inclined to ignore it.\nParallels to Amazon/NYT: Steve Jobs on saying \"no\" and the resultant \"shitty\" articles. https://t.co/xGbDP6DbcD pic.twitter.com/DltYb8BB8V\n— Chris Krewson (@ckrewson) October 20, 2015\nSome more cynical observers have pointed out that Amazon's CEO and biggest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, personally owns a rival outlet to The New York Times, namely The Washington Post, which is rapidly closing the gap to the Times in web traffic.\nThere's no way the NYT hatchet job on Amazon is due to Bezos's WaPo competing successfully in online traffic, right? pic.twitter.com/3HX6S64B4W\n— Mark Casey (@mistercasey) October 19, 2015\nRegardless, the dispute is yet another example of the growing tensions between the media establishment and big tech companies, which are becoming the most powerful corporate entities on earth.\nNewspapers, which used to be all powerful, are not used to having their journalism so publicly questioned. But then again, big tech companies - so often praised for revolutionising the economy and disrupting (there's that buzzword again) their older rivals - are not used to being in the firing line themselves, either.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/3HX6S64B4W", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/amazon-a-dystopian-work-place-but-a-massively-good-investment-20150827-gj8rfj.html", "https://t.co/xGbDP6DbcD", "https://twitter.com/ckrewson/status/656564441874628608", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/656482567244394496", "https://medium.com/@NYTimesComm/dean-baquet-responds-to-jay-carney-s-medium-post-6af794c7a7c6", "https://medium.com/@jaycarney/what-the-new-york-times-didn-t-tell-you-a1128aa78931#.vsvq29ugm", "https://t.co/DltYb8BB8V", "https://t.co/Bf7uSRDhqY", "https://twitter.com/mistercasey/status/656245278639460352"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:08:39.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
