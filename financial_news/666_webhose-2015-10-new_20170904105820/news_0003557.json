This has benefited the dollar’s rivals.\nThe Indonesian rupiah was the leader with a 9.2% gain against the dollar, followed by the Russian ruble, with a 7.3% gain. The Malaysian ringgit and the Brazilian real—two of this year’s worst-performing currencies—posted respectable weekly gains of 6.4% and 4.8%.\nThese gains represent the best weekly performance for the ringgit, real and rupiah against the dollar this year. Strong gains across the sector have made this past week one of the best for emerging-market currencies: “If not the best, then definitely one of the best,” said Piotr Matys, an emerging-markets currency strategist at Rabobank.\nEmerging-markets currencies have been battered over the past year by the expectation that the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates. Since Jan. 1, the ringgit has fallen nearly 18% against the dollar, while the real is down 40%—and that is after this week’s gains.\nThe week’s gains are also notable because several emerging-markets currencies, including the ringgit, the Turkish lira and the real, were trading at record lows only weeks ago.\nThese declines left the currencies overstretched to the downside, and primed for a rally, Matys said.\nStabilizing crude oil prices, and strength among global equities, has also helped stoke investor appetite for risk, sending money back into the developing world, said Ilan Solot, vice president of emerging-market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.\nCrude oil futures traded on Nymex posted a more than 9% rebound this week.\nThat is especially important for emerging-market economies like Russia and Malaysia, that are large crude oil exporters.\nBut emerging-market bulls should hold off on declaring this the beginning of the EM bull market.\nWith the Fed still on track to raise interest rates in December, or soon thereafter, the prospect of higher rates in the U.S. will likely continue to siphon capital out of the developing world in favor of a higher return in America.\n“EM currencies aren’t out of the woods just yet against the dollar,” Matys said.\nHere’s a chart of how the rupiah has traded against the dollar this year.\nFactSet More from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:18:29.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
