Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Bank of Queensland is facing a class action lawsuit from customers who lost funds after the bank allegedly failed to prevent transactions, ordered by banned financial adviser Brad Sherwin, from taking place in their accounts.\nShine Lawyers said it was starting a class action against BoQ on behalf of customers who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and were seeking compensation.\nThese customers held BoQ Money Market Deposit Accounts and suffered losses after transactions were performed in those accounts under the instruction of Mr Sherwin and his related entities. The customers allege these transactions occurred contrary to the bank's obligation to them as their customers.\nIn a statement, Shine Lawyers said the class action may also be brought against the accounts' administrator, DDH Graham.\n\"Our investigations have revealed that, by allowing certain transactions to take place, the Bank of Queensland and DDH Graham Ltd may have committed breaches of their obligations under the Corporations Act as well as to their customers,\" the legal firm said.\n\"We understand that almost all clients of Brad Sherwin and his related entities had a Money Market Deposit Account opened in their name or the name of their self-managed superannuation fund. Many of these clients appear to have been unaware that this had taken place.\"\nMr Sherwin was formerly a principal of collapsed advice group Sherwin Financial Planners.\nHe was also chairman of failed debenture issuer Wickham Securities. Mr Sherwin was charged with 33 counts of dishonesty causing detriment amounting to almost $10 million between 2009 and 2012.\n BoQ said on Monday it had yet to receive any correspondence from Shine Lawyers relating to the case.\n\"No proceedings have been commenced and the bank has received no formal notification of the potential class action from Shine Lawyers,\" BoQ said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\"The bank will defend any proceeding that may be commenced.\"\nBoQ is one of the latest financial services companies to face a class action from customers or shareholders.\nLast month, shareholders of QBE Insurance Group launched a class action against the global insurer over a 2013 profit downgrade that wiped $4 billion off its market value in a single day.\nLaw firm Maurice Blackburn said it had filed a case on behalf of almost 700 clients in the federal court in Melbourne, seeking to recover more than $200 million in compensation from QBE for \"shares purchased at inflated prices\".\n\"We have been approached by shareholders concerned that QBE was less than frank and timely in informing the market,\" Maurice Blackburn class actions principal Jacob Varghese said in a statement.\nMaurice Blackburn is also overseeing class actions against eight banks, including ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac and BankWest, relating to fees.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-10-05T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:06:53.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
