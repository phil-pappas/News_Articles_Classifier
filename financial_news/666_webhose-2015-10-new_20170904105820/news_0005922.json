Apple Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Apple has announced update to its iMac computers, bringing improved screen resolution through the retina displays familiar to users of its iPhones and iPads.\nIn a statement describing the computers as \"The most stunning iMacs we've ever made,\" Apple marketing chief Philip Schiller said text on the screens would appear sharper, videos would be unbelievably lifelike and users would be able to see new levels of detail in thier photos.\n\"From the first iMac to today, the spirit of iMac has never wavered - deliver the ultimate desktop experience with the latest technologies, gorgeous displays and cutting-edge designs,\" Mr Schiller said.\n\"With our gorgeous new Retina displays, more powerful processors and graphics and all-new Magic accessories, the new iMac continues to redefine the ultimate desktop experience.\"\nApple's new Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad 2 and Magic Mouse 2. Apple The 21.5-inch iMac will boast a 4K retina display, while the 27-inch model features a 5K display. The models also boast upgrades to its processors and graphics.\nAustralian customers can buy the 27-inch model from today in three models starting at $2799, compared to $US1799 in the US. Meanwhile the 21.5-inch iMac starts at $1,699 in Australia, compared with $US1099 for American customers.\nThe Magic accessories referred to by Mr Schiller are a redesigned keyboard, mouse and Trackpad, which Apple said have been redesigned to feel more comfortable than ever, and feature rechargeable batteries. The new Magic Trackpad 2 also brings Apple's Force Touch interface to the desktop, which means pressing with different levels of pressure offers up different options to the user.\nThe new Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 will come as part of the package with a new iMac, but the Magic Trackpad 2 doesn't come cheap and will cost an extra $199.\n All of the new Macs come with the latest OS X operating system El Capitan installed, as well as iWork office apps, iMovie and GarageBand apps.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:04:12.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
