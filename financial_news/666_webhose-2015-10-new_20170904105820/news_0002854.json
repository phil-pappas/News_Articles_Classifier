This volume represented a year-on-year decline of -10.8% – slightly worse than projections for a decline of -9.2%.The lackluster volume of PC shipments was consistent with expectations that the third quarter would face challenging financial conditions and be a transition period. Across many regions, the channel remained focused on clearing Windows 8 inventory before a more complete portfolio of models incorporating Windows 10 and Intel Skylake processors comes on the scene. Vendors and channels were also working to limit price swings in the face of changes in currency exchange rates. Though easing a bit, currency devaluation continued to inhibit PC shipments in the third quarter.While Windows 10 has generally received favorable reviews and raised consumer interest in PCs, many users opted to upgrade existing PCs rather than purchase new hardware. In addition, the unusually short time between Windows RTM (release to manufacturing) and the official retail release hampered the ability of OEMs to launch certified new models, resulting in a limited selection of Windows 10 PCs (as well as related advertising) through much of the third quarter.Although the overall market continued to see double-digit declines, and even the top vendors saw shipments decline from a year ago, the top 4 vendors performed much better than the rest of the market. Collectively, the top 4 vendors saw shipments fall by -4.5% from a year ago compared to a decline of almost -20% for the rest of the market. The advantages of scale, concentration on portable PCs, deeper penetration of distribution channels in emerging regions, as well as smaller vendors exiting the market are all aiding the largest vendors.\"The PC market continues to contract as expected, but we remain optimistic about future shipments,\" said Jay Chou, Research Manager, IDC Worldwide PC Tracker. \"While PC shipments will be hampered in the short run by the availability of a free upgrade to Windows 10, the improved PC experience across user segments should drive longer-term demand for new PC hardware that is expected help stabilize the market in 2016 and beyond.\"The U.S. PC market continued to suffer from soft demand in both the consumer and commercial segments. The July launch of Windows 10 had an immediate suppressive impact as many consumers took advantage of the free upgrade. In commercial, IT budgets remained focused on other projects including mobile-readiness and digital transformation initiatives.\"Still, there is some hope in the fourth quarter,\" stated Linn Huang, IDC Research Director, Devices & Displays. \"New designs running Windows 10 and powered by Intel's new Skylake processors are coming to market and may represent the most compelling reason we've had in years for consumers to upgrade their PCs. Whether this compulsion translates into actual sales remains to be seen.\"United States – PC shipments in the U.S. totaled 17.3 million units, down slightly year over year. HP retained its leadership position followed by Dell. Apple reclaimed a seat in the top three, narrowly edging out Lenovo in volume. Toshiba rounded out the top five. Inventory issues lessened somewhat in September, improving the channel's appetite for new Windows 10 PC shipments ahead of the coming holidays.
