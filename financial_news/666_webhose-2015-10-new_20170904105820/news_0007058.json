Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) is developing autonomous features, also with Mobileye technology . Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) expects to have self-driving vehicles ready in 2020.

Apple dipped 0.5%, Mobileye slumped 2%, and Tesla ended down 2.3%. Baidu slipped 0.1%. \nFord will also research new smartphone connectivity features for its cars in China, which passed the U.S. to become the world's largest car market a couple of years ago. \nThe moves are seen as a way for Ford to boost flagging sales in China, where car sales have fallen amid a slowdown in its economic growth rate. \nTotal sales of passenger cars in China fell to 1.34 million in August, down 9.4% from the same month a year ago amid the cooling economy and new local restrictions meant to reduce air pollution, according to China Passenger Car Association figures. \nFord recently said that it sold 531,702 passenger cars in China through the first eight months of this year, down 1.2% from the same period last year. \nFollow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:38:12.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
