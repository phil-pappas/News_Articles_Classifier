The auto maker recalled 6.5 million vehicles last week for power-window switches that could catch fire due to insufficient grease.\nAnd now Volkswagen diesel owners can count themselves among the millions who have had to bring their cars in to dealerships for recall repairs, after the auto maker announced its plans for a massive recall recently . \nLast year set a record for recalls, with nearly 64 million vehicles being called in for repairs, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a U.S. government agency. This year isn't far behind, with more than 25 million cars recalled as of May, and the Volkswagen VOW, -1.65% diesel recall added 500,000 cars in the U.S. to that tally. While the high number of recall notices could mean an increased vigilance by auto makers, it can be a cumbersome process for car owners.\n“Cars have gotten really complex,” says Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor at vehicle research company Kelley Blue Book. “Nobody’s built a perfect automobile.”\nRead more: Korea orders 24,000-car recall for Takata air bags \nAnd the recall process hasn't been perfected either. The NHTSA estimates that only 70% of recalled vehicles ever get the needed repairs. The initial roadblock is the notification process. Auto makers first notify NHTSA and dealerships of the malfunction, which is then registered with each affected car’s vehicle identification number, or VIN. They then mail recall notices to vehicle owners. However, less reliance on snail mail and a greater access to information via the Internet can complicate the notification and repair timeline. \nCarroll Lachnit, consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, says the issue arises when car owners learn of the recall via news outlets before the manufacturer letters are sent. They may take their car into the dealership before the repair shop is equipped for the recall, thus leaving drivers with knowledge of the recall but no immediate solution.\nOnce cars make it into the dealership repair shops, they can usually be fixed within a few hours, Lachnit says, and costs are completely covered by the vehicle manufacturer. The longer wait, she says, is getting the appointment in the first place. \nWhile most recalls are for relatively minor malfunctions and the car can continue to safely operate, some can be dangerous enough that drivers are told to immediately stop driving the vehicle until it is repaired. And if dealerships aren't yet equipped to handle the repair, drivers could be out of a car for months. This was the situation with the GM ignition switch recall last year in which more than 2.6 million vehicles were recalled for a faulty ignition switch that could slip into the “off” position, locking the steering wheel and disabling air bags. Many dealerships weren't prepared to handle the repairs, and, DeLorenzo says, drivers were told by GM not to put heavy or clunky items on their key rings as an interim solution. \nSee also: GM recalls: The numbers tell a surprising story \n“The real problem is that there are some things that have serious implications, like the ignition switch recall,” DeLorenzo says. “Even GM didn’t know what was going on, it really gets problematic for people.” \nGM spokesman Alan Adler says that so far, the manufacturer has repaired about 75% of the vehicles recalled for the faulty ignition switch, and is continuing to reach out to customers who haven't yet repaired their cars via Facebook and direct mail. The company is also offering rewards, including gift cards and tickets to state fairs, to customers who take recalled vehicles in for service.\nHowever, NHTSA is working with auto makers to streamline the process with early warning reporting requirements and educating drivers on the recall process, according to the agency. \nThe best way to mitigate this issue is to establish a relationship with your local dealer before you are caught in a recall jam, DeLorenzo adds. “Cars have gotten so dependable on the one hand, that a lot of people don’t have a relationship with their local dealer when it comes to service,” he says. “With a recent spate of service issues, it’s not a bad idea to have the service done at the dealership. They can run the VIN number and know if there are issues.”\nDespite dealerships’ past reputation for haggling with customers, DeLorenzo says that they have become much more inclined to perform repairs after the major settlements some manufacturers have been forced to pay for mishandling recalls. The federal government fined GM $35 million for its handling of the ignition switch recall, Toyota $1.2 billion for its handling of its 2010 recall of vehicles for unintended acceleration and NHTSA fined FCA $105 million in July for its overall low recall completion rates.\n“[Manufacturers] need to have people get their cars fixed,” DeLorenzo says. “If there’s anything standing between them and doing that they’re going to put more pressure on dealers.”\nHe adds that because of the recent government pressure, manufacturers are paying more attention to customer satisfaction reviews and surveys. If you have a negative experience with a dealership, filing a complaint could help improve future service. \nAnother way to monitor your car’s recall status is to run the VIN number through NHTSA’s vehicle safety website, www.safercar.gov . This service is especially useful if you own a used car. While new car dealerships are prohibited from selling recalled vehicles, used car dealers aren't covered under that regulation. Some retailers, like AutoNation AN, -0.10% , have pledged to not sell vehicles under a recall, however there are still many that do.\nLachnit says that ignoring a recall notice or not staying up to date on the recall status of your car could have dangerous consequences to you and others on the road. “People shouldn’t lose their heads, but they should take [recalls] seriously,” she says.\n(This story has been updated.) \nMore from MarketWatch What your credit card actually covers when you rent a car The 7 most popular used cars among millennials Top 5 new car deals for Labor Day weekend", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:05:51.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
