Peter Rae Share on twitter by Philip Baker Sharemarkets around the world are as well-trained as Pavlov's dogs.\nThis time, it was the European Central Bank giving them good news with the pledge of more cheap money – and it didn't take them long to start salivating again.\nBut in the next few weeks it could just as easily be the Federal Reserve talking about taking that cheap money away, and sharemarkets may well retreat whimpering with their tail between their legs.\nFriday was definitely a salivating day, however, sparked by the inevitable rally in Europe and on Wall Street after the ECB said it was on alert to adjust the \"size, composition and duration\" of its quantitative easing policy.\nEach month the bank buys €60 billion ($92 billion) of predominantly government bonds and it will keep doing this until at least September 2016.\nIt's now been just over three years since Mario Draghi, the ECB's president, said he would do whatever it takes to hold the euro together and since then the S&P 500, and a benchmark of Europe's top 50 stocks, have increased by more than 50 per cent.\nThe major S&P ASX 200 index is up around 30 per cent over that same period.\nBut apart from the United States, economic growth in Europe and Australia has been hard to come by while earnings from companies has been very sluggish.\n Sharemarkets don't rise and fall precisely in line with economic activity, they are more a forward-looking indicator and, despite lots of requests to do so, no one rings the bell or waves the white flag when the sharemarket hits the top or bottom.\nBut for the past three years or so growth forecasts have been revised down and bond yields have tumbled, implying that all is not well, and yet there has been no break in the sharemarket's psychology; shares are the place to be.\nOne reason for that is what the accompanying graph below shows.\nWith interest rates at record lows, it's just too hard to be out of the sharemarket.\nNot since the global financial crisis has the gap between the grossed up dividend yield on shares and term deposit rates been so high.\nOf course, dividends need to be maintained which involves studying profit growth and earnings prospects as well as just dividend rates.\nDifferentiation needed Perhaps from now on, investors might need to differentiate between the part of their portfolio invested in cash products which they use to protect the value of their capital and the part of the portfolio they are using to buy reasonably assured, long-term growing dividends.\nThe focus on dividends has meant that investors such as John Abernethy from Clime have set up a \"Dividend Detective\" to help identify shares that fit the bill.\nOne stock he favours at the moment is Arena, a company that specialises in childcare and healthcare.\nThe code is ARF and the company owns 197 properties all up, divided between 179 childcare centres, 7 medical centres and 11 childcare development sites.\nThe stock has gained more than 60 per cent since it listed just over two years ago and although the latest profit report got a lift from some of the properties getting re-valued, Abernethy likes the long-term leases and rental income they get along with the balance sheet that is conservatively managed.\nThe company also pays its distributions at the end of each quarter and has forecast annual distributions of 10.7¢ per unit for this financial year, which is 7 per cent higher than 2015.\nIt currently trades on a 6.6 per cent yields and if all goes to plan, Clime believe ARF is capable of at least maintaining this rate of distribution growth into the medium term.\nWith the US Federal Reserve looking like it won't raise rates soon and the Reserve Bank of Australia looking to cut rates the hunt for yield looks set to intensify.\nThis week the decision by the Commonwealth Bank and then the ANZ and National Australia Bank on Friday, to hike their variable mortgage rates, adds to the case for the RBA to cut its official cash rate to offset any impact from these moves in the lead up to Christmas.\nThe RBA might not want to cut but if the Fed stays steady and the ECB do more then it might be forced to.\nIt might be a better idea to tackle the debt problems the world has rather than make it cheaper to borrow more but if central banks don't do anything, nothing at all gets done.\nMaybe it will take another crisis for something else to be done. In the meantime, it will be more cheap money and although not everyone can define it, most experienced market players can recognise it.\nThat moment when investors realise that a bubble has been pricked; that enough people recognise that it's all been like a mirage.\nBut right now the there's the emotion about missing out on any gains in the sharemarket while term deposits offer nothing at all once inflation is taken into account.\nCapital preservation is just too expensive, for now.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:06:44.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
