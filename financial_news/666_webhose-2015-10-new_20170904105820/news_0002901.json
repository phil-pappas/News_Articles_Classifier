Mercedes Ruehl by Mercedes Ruehl and Robert Harley International technology giant Google has an opportunity to buy its Sydney headquarters.\nThe NSW government is tipped to shortly bring the White Bay Power Station development site to market. Located in Rozelle, the heritage-listed power station forms an important part of the revival of what is known as The Bays Precinct.\nThe residential and commercial redevelopment of the roughly 80 hectares of largely disused waterside land around Balmain, Rozelle, Annandale, Lilyfield and Pyrmont was announced by the government last year. It is the state's largest urban renewal project since the 2000 Olympics.\nThe White Bay site has long been considered as an option for Google, who has a preference for funky, unconventional office space. As part of its expansion into [publisher of The Australian Financial Review ] Fairfax Media's offices in Pyrmont last year, the company famously inserted two old Sydney Monorail carriages into the building through a balcony.\nUrbanGrowth NSW, the property development arm of the NSW government, declined to comment when asked about the sale of the power station site.\nSources said interest from the likes of Google had prompted the on-market sale because the government wants to ensure a competitive and fair price. However, residential developers and other groups may also bid for the historic site.\nTech giant needs 45,000-60,000 sq m for offices Google's hunt for a new Australian headquarters set tongues wagging last year, only a week or so before The Bays redevelopment was first announced in July 2014.\n The tech giant was outed as being behind the brief for 45,000 to 60,000 square metres of office space in Sydney, one of the largest corporate enquiries in years. Its expression of interest request said it would \"consider all forms of solutions from conventional to unconventional, and creative real estate solutions\".\nThe need to find a long-term home is pressing. At the moment Google is housed in three separate locations in Sydney and is quickly expanding. The Australian offices of Google have the 11th-largest engineering centre outside of the global corporate headquarters at Mountain View in California, with more than 500 engineers.\nMany other options have been canvassed, including The Australian Technology Park, Darling Harbour and Barangaroo, but owning the power station site would allow it huge freedom to purpose build an office complex to fit its needs for years to come.\nWhite Bay Power Station has stayed abandoned since it ceased operation in 1983. It fuelled Sydney's industrialisation from 1917 when it opened, providing power for the trains and trams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:09:41.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
