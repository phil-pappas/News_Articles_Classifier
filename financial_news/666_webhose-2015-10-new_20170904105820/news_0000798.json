ZTE will provide 100G optical transportation network design, engineering, installation, and operations and maintenance services to Reliance Communications India in Pune and Hyderabad during the next three years. The company will also provide its ZXONE series of equipment to satisfy the multi-service access and high integration requirements of Reliance Communications India, with ZTE’s low total cost of ownership (TCO) being one of the major factors in Reliance Communications India’s decision to partner with the company. Currently occupying 14.35 percent of Indian market share, Reliance Communications India is the fourth largest operator in India. With mobile networks entering the age of long term evolution (LTE), Reliance Communications India’s synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) was not able to meet growing data communication demands. ZTE’s 100G OTN solution allows Reliance Communications India to quickly develop Pune and Hyderabad’s 100G metro area transmissions and greatly relieve long-term evolution (LTE) bandwidth requirement pressures. ZTE’s leading OTN research and development platform and 100G OTN products satisfy Reliance Communications India’s requirements with their high performance, easy maintenance and low cost. With high integrity, ZTE 100G OTN supports any access rate from E1/T1 to 100GE, 4-22 client port with smooth evolution, as well as dense and coarse wavelength in one. At the same time, the product has highly efficient performance and can implement port self-adaption, dispatch subsystem (DSS) crossing, L2 switching aggregation, and common public radio interface (CPRI) transmission. Additionally, OTN encapsulation supports complete overhead, optical layer/electrical layer monitoring, and unified network management facilitating failure location and service configuration, which effectively improve operations, administration and management (OAM) efficiency. According to the latest optical network product market report by Ovum, ZTE increased its market share in optical networking products to 28 percent globally in Q2 2015, higher than any other Asia Pacific vendor. By Q4 2014, ZTE had completed the deployment of more than 200 networks of 100G OTN with three major domestic operators in China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. ZTE is also proud to be associated with international operators EE UK, T-Mobile Austria, TIM Brazil, TEF Peru, PCCW HK and TELKOM Indonesia as well as enterprise customers such as Cernet. ZTE has completed more than 200 100G OTN deployments, accumulated a 100G board delivery volume of more than 20,000 and 100G line length of more than 200,000km. About ZTE ZTE is a provider of advanced telecommunications systems, mobile devices, and enterprise technology solutions to consumers, carriers, companies and public sector customers. As part of ZTE’s M-ICT strategy, the company is committed to provide customers with integrated end-to-end innovations to deliver excellence and value as the telecommunications and information technology sectors converge. Listed in the stock exchanges of Hong Kong and Shenzhen (H share stock code: 0763.HK / A share stock code: 000063.SZ), ZTE’s products and services are sold to over 500 operators in more than 160 countries.
