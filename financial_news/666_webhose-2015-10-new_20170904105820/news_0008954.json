Jessica Shapiro by Joanna Mather Superannuation fees are forecast to drop below an average of 1 per cent within the next year, as the benefits of the no-frills MySuper regime flow through the market.\nLatest figures from respected actuarial firm Rice Warner show the average fee as a percentage of assets was 1.10 per cent for the year to 30 June 2014, or or 110 basis points on assets of $1.8 trillion.\nThat's down from 1.17 per cent the year before and, based on a similar downward trajectory , Australia should break through the 1 per cent mark by mid-way through next year.\n\"We believe this is the first evidence to measure fees falling across the entire industry since MySuper,\" Rice Warner consultant Nathan Bonarius said.\n\"We expect that we get below 1 per cent by 30 June 2016.\"\nAt 1 per cent, fees on a balance of $100,000 will be $1000.\nFormer Labor MP Nick Sherry, the first federal minister with exclusive responsibility for superannuation, established 1 per cent as an aspirational benchmark when he talked about the unacceptably high costs of the superannuation system in 2008.\nThe then Labor government introduced the MySuper regime as a low-cost, no-frills option for employees in default funds. Competition between providers of MySuper products has resulted in lower fees.\n A simplified system of employer contributions due to take hold at the end of October for large organisations, known as Superstream, is expected to reduce fees further.\nIn addition, trustees of superannuation funds offering MySuper products are required to transfer the existing balances of their default members to a MySuper product by 1 July 2017.\n\"There is still $60.9 billion in accrued default amounts which will be transferred to MySuper by June 2017 and as these move average industry fees could fall a few basis points,\" Mr Bonarius said.\n\"Encouraging sub-scale and inefficient funds to consolidate will reduce fees further.\"\nFSC aims to increase competition Indeed, the Financial Services Council wants all MySuper products to be allowed to act as default funds to increase competition.\nIf an employee does not nominate a super fund, their contributions go into a default fund. Default funds are written into modern awards and enterprise agreements.\nBecause these deals are negotiated by unions, the majority of default money flows to the union-aligned industry super funds.\nThis angers the FSC, which represents retail funds mostly owned by banks. The FSC commissioned the Rice Warner report.\n\"Rice Warner's analysis shows that competition in the superannuation industry could result in average fees falling by 15 basis points should this drive scale so that all funds were over $5 billion,\" the FSC said in a submission to a senate committee looking at new legislation that would require all super funds to have one-third independent directors and an independent chairman.\nThe change will affect industry super funds because many work on a representative governance model. That is, half of the directors are drawn from the union and the other half from an employer group.\nIndustry Super Australia sees no reason for a change.\n\"Industry super funds have led he way in delivering low fee, commission-free super to Australians and continue to deliver better returns on average to their members than bank-owned super funds,\" ISA chief executive David Whiteley said.\n\"The success of industry super is the reason the banks have been lobbying the government to dismantle the not for profit model. The banks want to redesign the compulsory super system to suit their scandal prone vertically integrated business models. The cost to members and ultimately national savings will be profound.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:13:37.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
