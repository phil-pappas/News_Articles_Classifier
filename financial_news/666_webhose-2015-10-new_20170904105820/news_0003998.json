It was seeking to enforce a rule restraining owners from renting their units for less than 30 days at a time.\nLate last year, Mr Salter won another separate, long-running and costly Supreme Court case against the City of Melbourne, which had argued short-term stays were breaching building regulations.\nWatergate's managers would lodge a Supreme Court appeal against the VCAT decision after a special resolution passed by most of the building's 655 apartment owners was formalised last week, long-term resident and owners' corporation chairwoman Barbara Francis said.\n\"We've worked hard to create a wonderful building for owners to live in. If short stays escalate further, we could be overtaken not only by short-stay operators but Airbnb, which is already starting to happen,\" Ms Francis said.\n\"We live here. We are a Class 2 building that's not designed for short stays.\"\n\"It's the encroachment into our everyday life of people illegally tailgating into the car park, overloading lifts with luggage, commercial cleaners and laundry. We just want to have it stamped out,\" she said.\nMr Salter, who owns some of the Watergate apartments he lets, said the owners' corporation had failed to tell owners where the VCAT had erred or informed them about the cost of the Supreme Court appeal.\nMr Salter will fight the case with support from the short-term accommodation industry around Australia.\n\"This will be the final step in validating this part of the sharing economy,\" he said. \"Provided it's run professionally, it [short stays] should have no impact whatsoever on the amenity of long-term owners.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:00:51.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
