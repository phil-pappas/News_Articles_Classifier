In a notification on its website, the central bank said that the corpus of this fund would be Rs2,000 crore.\nContribution to FIF would be from the “interest differential in excess of 0.5% on RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund) and STCRC (Short Term Co-operative Rural Credit Refinance Fund) deposits on account of shortfall in priority sector lending (as notified by RBI from time to time) kept with NABARD by banks,” said the RBI.\nWhen banks fail to meet their priority sector lending targets, they are required to maintain deposits with the RIDF and STCRC to cover for the shortfall. These deposits are held by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development or NABARD.\nUnder the revised guidelines, the fund shall be in operation for another three years or till such period as may be decided by the RBI and the government.\nThe new FIF will be administered by an Advisory Board constituted by the government and will be maintained by National Board for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).\nThe objectives of the FIF shall be to support developmental and promotional activities including creation of financial inclusion infrastructure across the country, capacity building of stakeholders, creation of awareness to address demand side issues, among other things.\nThe fund shall not be utilized for normal business or banking activities, RBI clarified.\nIn financial year 2007-08, the government had formed two funds namely the FIF and the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund (FITF) with a corpus of Rs500 crore, each. After completion of five years, the government has decided to merge the two funds to a single FIF, the banking regulator said in its notification.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:55:46.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
