The non-farm payrolls report on Friday showed the US added 142,000 jobs in September, well below analysts' expectations of 201,000. August was also revised down from 170,000 to 135,000. \n\"While it's always important not to over-react to one single data release, we'll make an exception in this case,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics . \"The chances of a rate hike by the US Federal Reserve this year just went way down,\" he added, saying he expects the central bank will wait until early 2016 for an increase. \nFed chair Janet Yellen had said policymakers expected a rate rise this year before the data. \nTurning to Monday's agenda, the Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) /CIPS purchasing managers' index on UK services is due at 0930 BST. Analysts expect a reading of 56 in September, up slightly from 55.6 a month earlier. A reading above 50 signals an expansion in activity while a level below that indicates a contraction. \nMarkit will also release its final estimate of US services PMI for September which is expected to be confirmed at a reading of 55.6. \nMeanwhile, ISM's US non-manufacturing composite at 1500 BST is predicted to fall to 57.5 in September from 59 in August. \nIn the Eurozone, Greece is set to unveil a 2016 draft budget later on Monday to satisfy international creditors. In July Greece agreed with its creditors to implement spending cuts and economic reforms in exchange for an €86bn bailout. \nOn the company front, Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) rallied on news the government will start offering portions of its stake in the lender to private investors in spring 2016. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) surged on reports the struggling mining company is in talks to sell its agricultural business. Singapore´s sovereign wealth fund, Japanese trading house Mitsui &Co. and a Canadian pension fund are among the parties who had expressed an interest in the unit, Bloomberg reported. \nTrinity Mirror (LSE: TNI.L - news ) gained after saying it is on track to meet full-year expectations. \nRolls Royce (LSE: RR.L - news ) advanced after announcing plans to cut another 400 jobs in its marine business on top of the 600 job cuts already announced in May. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,060.91 +1.42% FTSE 100 6,231.72 +1.66% FTSE 250 17,010.41 +1.28% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 104.40p +9.89% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 571.50p +3.23% Mondi (MNDI) 1,427.00p +2.96% CRH (CRH (EUREX: 558474.EX - news ) ) 1,759.00p +2.81% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'A' (RDSA) 1,648.50p +2.52% Carnival (CCL) 3,450.00p +2.47% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 4,624.00p +2.46% Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) (HL.) 1,260.00p +2.44% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 952.50p +2.42% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 682.80p +2.41% FTSE 100 - Fallers N/A FTSE 250 - Risers Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 96.90p +5.61% Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) (ALM) 378.30p +4.19% OneSavings Bank (Stuttgart: 2OS.SG - news ) (OSB) 372.00p +4.00% Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) (VED) 439.00p +3.66% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 199.50p +3.48% Wood Group (John) (WG.) 648.00p +3.35% Petra Diamonds Ltd (LSE: PDL.L - news ) .(DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (PDL) 89.50p +3.29% Sophos Group (LSE: SOPH.L - news ) (SOPH) 243.40p +3.14% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,262.00p +3.10% Petrofac Ltd.
