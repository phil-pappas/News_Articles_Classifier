It also left the key parameters of its quantitative easing (QE) scheme unchanged but said it would re-examine its policy at its meeting in December. \nAlthough some rate setters, such as Bank of Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde, have argued the ECB should tweak the asset purchases now, most believe quantitative easing needs to be given more time to work as its positive effects are just starting to pass through. \nThe ECB's plans have also pushed down returns on bonds and cash, driving investors over to the better returns available from shares, with Draghi adding that the ECB had discussed a possible deposit rate cut. \n\"Draghi's comments mean continuous support for equities from the ECB,\" said Hampstead Capital hedge fund manager Lex Van Dam. \nDenmark's Novozymes (Other OTC: NVZMF - news ) , the world's largest industrial enzymes maker, was among the best performing stocks in Europe. \nIts shares surged 9 percent as investors expressed relief that the company's results had managed to meet market forecasts, with the stock having slumped in August after it reported disappointing second quarter results. \nFrench spirits group Pernod Ricard (Paris: FR0000120693 - news ) also rose 4.6 percent after quarterly sales rose more than expected, as a strong U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . performance offset sluggish China sales. \nPublicis slumped 10 percent, however, after the world's third-biggest advertising agency cut its annual organic growth target to 1 percent from 2.5 as quarterly sales slowed. \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni; Editing by Alison Williams)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:42:17.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
