We have over 25 years of experience in this field and are well qualified to handle the most complex of cases presented.”\nAny individual with assets such as their family home and investments, needs to consider the protection of those assets. Each person’s situation is unique but GAB Chartered Accountants generally recommend a mixture of appropriate insurance cover and a family trust. The issues and options are discussed with you to ensure you understand what’s involved. They then liaise with your lawyer and other professional advisers to ensure the appropriate structure is put in place.\nTrusts can be established for a variety of reasons and there are two major types. Firstly, Trust’s which provide protection for personal assets such as the family home & investments. These are commonly referred to as “family trusts”. Secondly, Trust’s established to operate a business. These are commonly referred to as “trading trusts”. Trusts can provide a high degree of flexibility in managing your investments or business, and can provide a number of tax planning opportunities. GAB Chartered Accountants insist that correct management is vital if the trust is to operate effectively and avoid attack.\nAbout GAB Chartered Accountants\nGAB Chartered Accountants principal, Graeme Beardsley, hails from Christchurch and spent the first few years of his working life with the Inland Revenue.
