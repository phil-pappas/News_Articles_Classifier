It is highly treatable, but if left untreated, it can spread,” says Dr Sahni. “The second type, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), is described as the growth of abnormal but non-invasive cells in the lobules. It is generally not considered cancer. This, however, may indicate that the woman has an increased risk of developing breast cancer,” he says.\nBe aware of risk factors. These include family history, very dense breast tissue (visible on a mammogram), alcohol consumption and increased exposure to the hormone oestrogen (due to early menstruation, late birth of the first child, never having given birth, starting menopause at a later age, or taking hormones due to some medical condition), says Pawan Gupta, associate director, surgical oncology, Jaypee Hospital, Greater Noida, near Delhi.\n“The prognosis depends on a combination of factors: the stage at which it is caught, and how aggressive it is,” says Dr Gupta. Breast cancer is classified into four stages—I, II, III and IV—indicating whether it is limited to one area or has spread to healthy tissues inside the breast, or to other parts of the body.\n“Some cancers, like metastatic breast cancer (also called advanced or stage IV breast cancer), are usually incurable, but certain treatment options can help the patient live longer with a better quality of life,” adds Dr Gupta.\nTesting, then, is important, though two views are emerging on how useful mammograms are, or at what age you should start them.\nSome studies suggest that mammograms must begin at age 50 or so, says Dr Gupta. “But it depends on the individual’s risk factors. So it is important to continue doing the self-breast examinations and check with the doctor about when to begin mammograms,” he says.\n“For both DCIS and LCIS, there are no signs or symptoms. They are diagnosed on mammography, which is why regular clinical exams and mammograms are essential,” says Dr Sahni.\nThe mammography impact\nA study, published in July in The Lancet Oncology journal, found that more lives were saved when mammograms were started at age 40 instead of 50. In the study, British women aged 39-41 were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 53,883 were offered annual mammograms up to and including the year of their 48th birthday (the intervention group) and 106,953 women received the usual care, which meant the first mammogram at age 50 and additional mammograms every three years thereafter. Seventeen years of follow-up later, the results showed that fewer women in the intervention group died of breast cancer. “My advice is to start screening at age 40 instead of age 50 and do it annually,” says Dr Sahni.\nAnother study, published in May in the European Radiology journal, suggests that 3D mammograms help find more cancers than traditional 2D ones (three-dimensional mammography uses several low-dose images from different angles around the breast to create a picture using X-rays, whereas a conventional mammogram creates an image from two X-ray images of each breast). An analysis of 7,500 women who underwent mammogram showed that breast cancer was detected in 68 women. Both 3D and 2D mammograms detected 46 of these cancers, a 3D mammogram detected 21, and a 2D mammogram, one. “Two big advantages 3D has over 2D is greater accuracy, lesser radiation,” says Dr Sahni.\nWatch your weight\nResearch published in the 19 August issue of the Science Translational Medicine journal found that overweight and obese women (those with a body mass index higher than 25) have a higher risk of breast cancer than women who maintain a healthy weight.\nThere could be two reasons for this: Extra fat cells lead to more inflammation in the body, which is linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Two, fat cells make oestrogen, and oestrogen can make hormone-receptor-positive breast cancers develop and grow,” says Dr Gupta. “So, to keep your risk of breast cancer as low as possible, it makes sense to get to and maintain a healthy weight,” he adds. Dr Sahni agrees: “Not all women with cancer are obese but reduction in obesity can lead to a potential 30% decrease in breast cancer.”\nSo how much do you need to exercise? Researchers now believe that most exercise guidelines have been framed in the context of heart health, blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\nIn one study, published in September in the JAMA Oncology journal , researchers studied 384 non-active women past menopause, some of normal weight and some overweight. They found that women who were assigned to exercise for 300 minutes a week over the year-long study lost more body fat than those who were active for 150 minutes each week. The women didn’t change their diet or any other aspect of their lives; they just exercised as much as they were told to.\n“Since fatty tissue is the primary source of hormones that can drive breast cancer after menopause and also plays a role in the body’s immune and inflammatory responses, both of which are also involved in cancer, while 150 minutes of activity a week is good, but if you can do more, then from a cancer prevention perspective, 300 minutes is better,” says Christine M. Friedenreich, scientific leader of cancer epidemiology and prevention research at Canada’s Alberta Health Services, in the study.\nA study published in June in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers And Prevention reports that women who spent 6 hours or more a day sitting, outside working hours, had a 10% greater risk of breast cancer than those who sat for less than 3 hours a day. “Moving about every hour and spending more time walking is a good idea, as sitting has been associated with multiple other disorders too,” says Dr Gupta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T02:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:31:57.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
