That decision hasn't always paid off. \nThe personal seat license, which a potential season ticketholder pays a team just for the right to purchase season tickets, dates back to the 1980s -- though there's no consensus opinion on who came up with the idea. Some of the credit goes to Columbus, Ohio architect Rick Ohanian, who devised a similar scheme in 1987 in an effort to keep taxpayers from shelling out money for a professional sports stadium. Meanwhile, Standford University tennis coach Dick Gould floated his own take on the concept in 1986 while seeking money for a new tennis stadium. \nIn just about all scenarios, personal seat licenses are usually put in place to pay for the building or remodeling of stadiums and arenas without dipping too deeply into public funds. From the outset, that's been a futile proposition for NFL host cities and fans. Personal seat licenses made their first appearance in the NFL in 1995, when St. Louis used them as a means of paying for the then-Trans World Dome and luring the Los Angeles Rams to the city. Nearly 58,000 fans paid $250 to $3,000 just for the right to buy tickets and raised $74 million in the process. However, that came nowhere close to covering the initial $280 million cost of the stadium and St. Louis, St. Louis County and Missouri were left to pay $24 million a year just to service the bonds used to finance the stadium. Those won't be paid in full until 2021. More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:44:22.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
