(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) \n>\nU.S. initial jobless claims continue to linger near generational lows , coming in at 259,000 for the week ending October 17.\nBut according to Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro, that's no reason to get too excited.\nAfter the previous release showed filings  fell to their lowest level in more than four decades , the economist explained why this metric is painting a rose-coloured view of the U.S. labor market's health and prospects for employment growth.\n\"We would much rather watch jobless claims fall than rise,\" Dutta wrote. \"That being said, initial claims overstates the strength in the labor market.\"\nFar more often, you'll hear people talk about how initial jobless claims understate the strength of the economy relative to previous periods - that, adjusted for the size of the labor force, claims are actually at historic lows.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: OPEC Is About to Crush the U.S. Oil Boom \nBut Dutta points out that one has to take into account where we are in the business cycle when examining this flow variable, because the health of the labor market influences whether or not people file for benefits. If jobs are perceived to be plentiful and job openings are abundant - both of which happen to be indicative of the current situation - then laid-off individuals won't bother applying.\n\"Given where we are in the business cycle, the filing rate is declining,\" wrote Dutta. \"This, in turn, implies that the breakeven level (level consistent with job growth) on claims is falling).\"\nMore from Bloomberg.com: The Strongest El Nino in Decades Is Going to Mess With Everything \nHe calculates a breakeven level for claims by bringing data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey into the equation. First, he calculates the filing rate by dividing initial claims by total layoffs and discharges. Then, he subtracts quits and other separations from total hires, which leaves him with net job growth plus layoffs and discharges. The product of this number and the filing rate is breakeven claims level. \nOr, expressed differently:\nWhen claims are below the breakeven level, this suggests employment growth is positive:\nDutta's analysis helps square the circle of why employment growth hasn't picked up steam while initial claims have been on a downward trend: Because the latter metric is offering incomplete information on flows out of employment, and is completely missing hiring - the other half of the equation.\nMore from Bloomberg.com: A Lot of Cheap Housing Is About to Get Very Expensive \nLooking at this chart, the economist concludes that \"we are not in uber-boom mode,\" and that the spread between the breakeven level and initial claims is consistent with payroll growth of about 180,000.\nMore from Bloomberg.com\nThe 401(k) Crisis Is Getting Worse Tesla Loses Consumer Reports Recommendation Amid Rise in Sales How Could Volkswagenâ€™s Top Engineers Not Have Known?
