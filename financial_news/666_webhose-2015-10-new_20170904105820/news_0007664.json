Interest charges\nIf you fail to pay off your card off in full every month you are the sort of customer financial institutions like — a revolver — a card user who carries their balance over from month to the next.\nThis means you are paying interest on your debt and it’s not cheap.\nFigures from financial comparison website Finder.com.au show the average credit card rate is 17 per cent but shop around and you can get rates as low as 8 per cent.\nCOMPARE LOW RATE CARDS\n2. Fees\nConsumers often get sucked in by the rewards and offers that come with credit cards and forget to look into the fees associated with using plastic.\nFinder spokeswoman Michelle Hutchison says many users are simply wasting their money by paying annual fees.\n“It’s generally worthwhile using a credit card rewards program if you spend more than $14,000 per year on your card,’’ she says.\n“If you don’t use your card often, you pay off your balance in full each month and you spend less than $14,000 per year on your card then you shouldn’t need to pay an annual fee.”\nOn their database they have more than 50 cards that do not have annual fees.\nCOMPARE INTEREST FREE CARDS\nFinder.com.au’s Michelle Hutchison says don’t waste your money on annual fees.

Cash advances\nThese sting badly.\nCash advance rates range anywhere from about 19 to 30 per cent and you’ll most likely get hit with a cash advance withdrawal fee of about $3 or up to five per cent of the amount withdrawn — whichever is greater.\nAvoid these at all costs.\n4. Using your card too much\nIf you find you’re constantly spending on your card to survive each week then alarm bells should be ringing.\nTry leaving your card at home or chop it up — this will put an automatic stop to you spending.\nIf you do cut it up make sure you contact your credit card provider.\nThe Australian Bankers’ Association’s spokeswoman Diane Tate says cutting it up won’t solve all your problems.\n“If you’re finding it hard to manage your finances, you may be able to put a temporary hold on your credit card account or you could close your account,’’ she says.\n“Don’t just cut up your credit card — this doesn’t close your account and you may continue to have a debt with your provider.”\n5. Credit file\nEvery time you apply for credit a mark will be put on your file.\nFree credit score service Credit Savvy found that the average credit score of people with five or more credit card inquiries on file was 128 points lower than those without any inquiries, while consumers with more than seven credit card inquiries on file were 187 points worse off.\nSo think twice before signing up to credit because it will diminish your chances of being able to apply for a loan down the track.\nHutchison says, “try not to apply for a new credit card in less than a year of opening your last card.”\nJoin the Big Debt Switch and help consumers fight the growing problem of debt.
