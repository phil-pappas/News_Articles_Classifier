Steel Crisis Worsens As 1,800 Jobs Threatened By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nUp to 1,800 more UK steel industry jobs are set to go as the axe falls on 20 sites across the country. \nUK-based steel firm Caparo is the latest victim of the global steel crisis as it is set to enter administration. \nThe announcement looks set to bring the total recent job losses related to the steel industry to 5,300 after redundancies at Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland earlier this month. \nThe company, which is owned by Labour peer Lord Paul, produces a number of steel products. \nDue to overcapacity in the Chinese market the price of steel has fallen by 40% from around £318 a ton to under £191 in the past year, meaning that domestic firms are no longer able to compete. \nSky (LSE: BSY.L - news ) sources have said that administrator PwC is looking for buyers for the business, but prospects are bleak given the failure to find a buyer for the Redcar steel works. \nCaparo Industries reported a £0.8m operating loss in 2014, down from a profit of £3.1m in the prior year. \nAngela Eagle, shadow business secretary, said: \"With the Chinese president in the UK this week, I hope the Government will raise the issue of anti-competitive dumping which is driving down steel prices.\" \nThe Government held a summit last week to address the future of the ailing UK steel industry. \nThe economic slowdown in China has weighed on steel demand with volumes down 4% last year and likely to be 5-6% lower this year, according to Richard White at the International Steel Statistics Bureau. \nThis translates to a huge glut of Chinese steel which is no longer required domestically, prompting Chinese steel exports to double in 2014. \nThis means that China is now exporting 100 million tons of steel per year at prices which are below the Chinese cost of production, let alone the costs associated with UK steel production. \nThe majority of Chinese steel makers are currently loss making, with very few mills refusing to cut production and even fewer considering shut down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:06:41.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
