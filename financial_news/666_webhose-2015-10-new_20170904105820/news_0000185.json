This would mean more employees' pension pots would drift above the allowance, attracting the penal tax rate applying to the excess. This is as high as 55pc. \n= What is the lifetime limit? = \nThis restricts the total value of the pension entitlements (excluding state pension) that any one person can build during their life. The limit currently stands at £1.25m and will fall to £1m in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2016. \n= What would a reduction in lifetime allowance mean for final salary pension savers? = \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) could mean savers lose £15,000 a year in retirement as the annual amount they could receive without exceeding the £1m limit might reduce from £50,000 to £35,000 a year. \nThis is because final salary pension benefits are calculated differently for measuring against the limit. \n= Why the lifetime limit affects final salary savers differently = \nIt’s easy for savers with defined contribution pensions to work out if they’ve exceeded the limit, because their retirement fund is essentially one big pot or lots of little ones. If the value of their pot(s) exceeds £1m, they know they will have to pay tax on the excess. \nFor final salary savers it’s more complicated. This is because their pension value is expressed as a guaranteed retirement income, for example, £15,000 a year. \nTo test the value against the lifetime limit, savers must times their predicted starting annual pension by 20. For example, a guaranteed income of £50,000 in retirement works out as a total fund value of £1m. \nThis is around twice the annual income someone with a £1m defined contribution pension pot could expect to receive if they bought an annuity, which would provide a 65-year-old non-smoking male with around £26,000 a year. \n• Nine ways to improve your chances of retiring early • Get a weekly alert of pension advice and changes \nBecause of this disparity, experts say the calculation is likely to be revised to make it less generous. If the standard measure moved to multiplying annual income by 29, instead of 20, savers would have final salary benefits capped at around £35,000 a year. \nAccording to Alan Higham, founder of pensionschamp.com, such a move would sting a graduate starting on a £27,000 salary today for £390,000 in tax penalties. \nHe said: “On retirement at state pension age , given an estimated increase in wage over his career, his pension will be around £71,000 a year in today’s terms. Under current arrangements, because this would breach the £50,000 (£1m lifetime allowance), he would pay £5,250 in additional income tax per year, totalling about £130,000 over his retirement. \n“Under the proposed system, he would pay an additional £260,000 in income tax ‘penalties’ over the course of his retirement.” \nThe total cost of overstepping his lifetime allowance would reach a staggering £390,000. \nWhile this seems harsh, many argue that such a move is necessary to level the playing field between more common defined contribution pensions and generous final salary schemes, increasingly limited to the public sector. \nA source close to the talks told Telegraph Money that higher taxation of final salary schemes is “low hanging fruit” for the Government. \nThey added that a reduction in tax relief for these savers would be highly unlikely to stop them saving because the arrangements would remain “very generous”. \n= Could your pension exceed the lifetime allowance? = \nEnter your monthly pension contribution and the annual return (5pc a year is a fair expectation) and see how quickly your money grows to £1m \nAre you a higher earner and worried about cuts to your pension?
