Minds were focused on a path out of the financial crisis, and an end to measures helpful to stock prices - quantitative easing and low rates - still seemed some way beyond the horizon. \nAs a result, the River & Mercantile World Recovery fund was ideally named and timed. \nLaunched in March 2013, the fund immediately ran away from its peers and returned 50pc after a year. The period since has been tougher, in line with a wobble in world markets, and it has lagged other global funds so far this year. \nHere the manager, Hugh Sergeant, who uses the same strategy to run the River & Mercantile UK Long-term Recovery fund , explains why his “value” investment style struggled in the turmoil, but why he thinks there are now even more opportunities. \nWhat characteristics do you look for in a share? \nWe focus on buying “recovery” shares - businesses that in normal years are capable of earning an attractive return on capital, but where profits are temporarily depressed. We look for evidence of “self-help”, such as cost cutting and repositioning. \nSource: FE Trustnet \nHow is the fund positioned at the moment? \nWe love the best recovery regions of the world, led by the eurozone and southern Europe in particular. We also like Japan, believing that it has gone through a generational change in attitude to return on capital. \nWe are starting to warm to emerging markets. They have gone from hero to zero. Commentators in 2007 suggested that China could grow at 10pc a year for ever, but now seem to suggest that it is a flawed economy that will hardly grow at all. China still has a long way to go. \nWe do not like the US, where the cycle is mature, profits are close to peak levels and valuations are high. \nHow has the fund’s mandate hurt, or helped, performance in the turmoil this year? \n“Recovery” and “value” shares have struggled, as during these “risk off” periods other investors will tend to retreat to more defensive shares, an area we have almost no exposure to because valuations are at peak levels. Recent share price falls have provided attractive buying opportunities for us. \nWhich shares have you been buying and selling recently? \nThree shares we have been buying are Mediaset (Other OTC: MDIEF - news ) , Van Lanschot (LSE: 0O4B.L - news ) and China Lesso (HKSE: 2128-OL.HK - news ) . \nMediaset is the leading TV broadcaster in Italy and Spain. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a classic recovery investment. Before the eurozone recession it was earning a really attractive return on capital, but the recession brought a significant fall in advertising spend, causing Mediaset’s profits and share price to fall sharply. \nWe think it is worth at least €6.50, compared with €4 today. \nVan Lanschot is another classic recovery stock. It is the second largest independent private bank and wealth manager in the Netherlands. Towards the end of the 2006 credit bubble it unfortunately decided to “diworsify” into commercial lending. As it returns to its business roots, profits should recover. \nChina Lesso is the largest producer of plastic pipes in China. Its exposure to the residential building industry has caused the share price to be weak. The firm has been able to offset this by cutting costs and through benefiting from the low oil price. As a result, profits have been maintained and it is priced at only seven times earnings. \nWhat have been your most successful and least successful investments? \nSomero has been one of our most successful investments over the past few years. It is a small company that is the only global manufacturer of the kit that is used to make concrete very flat, required by the likes of Amazon to make sure their distribution centres can work efficiently. \nThe shares bottomed out at 10p and are currently 140p, a “14 bagger”. \nA poor recent investment has been jd.com , the “Amazon of China”. We think it has significant potential, but since we bought the shares earlier in the year they have fallen by 30pc. \nDo you invest your own money in the fund? \nI have a significant investment and have been adding to it recently. \nWhat would you have done if you hadn’t become a fund manager? \nWhen times get tough in the world of investment I sometimes reflect to my wife that I should have been a national park ranger. I love the outdoors the natural beauty and the sense of independence you get while walking (or working) in the great parks of this country. \n= Our view = \nThe River & Mercantile World Recovery fund has been hard to ignore given its stellar early performance. \nIt has the freedom to invest where it likes, without reference to any “benchmark index” (in City jargon it has low “correlation” to the index). This means it can steer clear of areas that are strongly represented in the index but that the manager regards as highly valued, such as the US. \nIt currently invests just 10pc of investors’ money there, against 57pc for the index. \nThis lack of correlation could, however, cause periods of underperformance relative to the fund’s peers. As a result, it should perhaps be considered more risky than some other global funds. \nJason Hollands of Tilney Bestinvest, the adviser and investment shop, tipped Artemis Global Income as an alternative core global holding. It too “underweights” the US. \nMr Hollands said: “For something a bit more punchy, I like the Ardevora Global Equity fund. \n“This fund uses a '150/50’ strategy. The managers invest up to 150pc of the fund’s net assets in stocks the managers believe will perform well, and then partially offset this with 50pc in 'short’ positions bets on companies they expect to perform poorly. \n“The overall exposure to markets is therefore 100pc, so this is not an absolute return fund. But gains can nevertheless be generated through both negative and positive views on companies.” \n= How to buy the fund as cheaply as possible = \nInvestors should ensure they buy the \"B\" share class, which includes no extra costs to pay middlemen. There is an ongoing charge of 1.24pc and the minimum investment is £1,000.
