A shift to renewable energy has resulted in slumping wholesale power prices exacerbated by an economic slowdown.\nShares in EON and RWE, Germany’s biggest utilities, fell 36 percent and 52 percent this year through Friday on concern provisions for decommissioning nuclear plants may prove insufficient.\nDifferent scenarios associated with the decommissioning process result in a range of necessary provisions from 25 billion euros to 77 billion euros, the ministry said, due to factors such as interest and cost increases, referring to a study by auditing company Warth & Klein Grant Thornton AG it commissioned.\n“We consider scenarios with high provisions improbable,” Gabriel said. EON, RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall said in a joint e-mailed statement that such scenarios are “unrealistic and have never been used in any sector.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:27:08.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
