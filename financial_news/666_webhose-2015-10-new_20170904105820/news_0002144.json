More Headlines Volkswagen Will Begin Recalls in January: 10 Things to Know About the Diesel Emissions Scandal \n\"It's too soon to say that the market volatility we've seen in recent months is fully behind us,\" according to a technical note Oppenheimer sent to clients on Monday. \n\"For the S&P 500, we expect this mean-reverting rally to continue based on pessimistic sentiment conditions and improving seasonals; in this case we're keying on the index's mean over the last 200 days, currently near 2060,\" the note said. \n\"Most notable about the index's latest rally is that the bounce has been led by what were the worst performing stocks of the year,\" the analysts said. \"For these beaten-up stocks, whether this is the start of a prolonged base-building process or simply a pause in an established downtrend will be crucial in determining if the S&P 500 can recover to new highs, in our view.\" \nHere's 10 stock ideas to buy in each S&P 500 sector, paired with ratings from TheStreet ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nIndustry: Energy/Oil & Gas Exploration & ProductionYear-to-date return: 15.6% \nCimarex Energy Co. operates as an independent oil and gas exploration and production company primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. The company owns interests in 3,240 net productive oil and gas wells. \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates CIMAREX ENERGY CO as a Hold with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate CIMAREX ENERGY CO (XEC) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and solid stock price performance. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.36, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. To add to this, XEC has a quick ratio of 2.36, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. After a year of stock price fluctuations, the net result is that XEC's price has not changed very much. Although its weak earnings growth may have played a role in this flat result, don't lose sight of the fact that the performance of the overall market, as measured by the S&P 500 Index, was essentially similar. Despite the fact that it has already risen in the past year, there is currently no conclusive evidence that warrants the purchase or sale of this stock. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 34.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues fell by 33.4%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels industry and the overall market, CIMAREX ENERGY CO's return on equity significantly trails that of both the industry average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $257.37 million or 38.97% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the industry average, the firm's growth is significantly lower.
