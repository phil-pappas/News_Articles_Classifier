In October, CCRA plans to unveil a new all encompassing company website that will feature CCRA’s new and improved travel agent and agency membership opportunities for both the U.S. and international markets. The existing benefits of OSSN membership will remain, but CCRA’s new membership program will also provide travel professionals with access to CCRA’s diverse array of travel agent products, services, and educational opportunities for discounted rates. CCRA will also for the first time provide accreditation and identification to travel agencies around the world, backed by the TRUE code, which will remain a separate yet integrated division of CCRA.\n“Now through the end of the year, we will be combining our CCRA products and services to significantly enhance our travel agent and supplier offerings and truly elevate the success of both independent travel professionals and travel agencies in the U.S. and abroad,” said Dic Marxen, President and CEO of CCRA Travel Commerce Network. “Margie Jordan will be a driving force behind our increased focus on new education and training opportunities, enhanced technology and the modernization of benefits for our travel agency customers. She will be a key player in helping us foster a new sense of community and re-introduce our organization to the industry as one of dedicated professionals that are focused on selling the very best travel experiences available in partnership with our growing number of preferred suppliers worldwide.”\nMargie Jordan will assume the new role of CCRA’s Vice President of Membership Services to oversee all aspects of CCRA’s new and enhanced membership experience for travel agents, ranging from independent agents to host agencies, and to assist OSSN members with the transition to CCRA’s new consolidated membership structures in January 2016. Effective immediately, Margie Jordan will take over the duties of Gary and Melody Fee, the former President and Vice President of OSSN who have supported CCRA in this company integration initiative since OSSN became a wholly owned subsidiary of CCRA in 2014.\nMargie Jordan brings over 15 years’ experience as a professional travel agent and successful travel agency owner to her new role at CCRA. She is the founder and CEO of Jordan Executive Travel and serves as an industry leader for educating travel professionals in the areas of entrepreneurship, technology and marketing. She earned her Certified Travel Associate (CTA) designation from The Travel Institute as well as several Destination Specialist (DS) designations. Margie and her agency have been featured in USA Today, Wall Street Journal, numerous Reuter's news stories, Smart Money Magazine, the Chicago Tribune and The Miami Herald to name a few. Since early 2015, Margie has led CCRA’s successful marketing tools training program for travel professionals and is both a presenter and educator at CCRA’s 2015 regional Power Solutions events and the upcoming Home-Based Travel Agent Forum.\n“I couldn't be more excited to help grow the CCRA Travel Agent Community through this new company integration initiative, that demonstrates an innovative and thoughtful approach to growing this segment of the travel industry,” said Margie Jordan, CCRA’s Vice President of Membership Services. “I've always played a part in educating my peers to help them modernize and grow their businesses. As CCRA’s Vice President of Membership Services, I have an amazing opportunity to play a much bigger role in assisting fellow travel agents and agencies through CCRA’s new and exciting membership opportunities that will enhance their professional capabilities, knowledge, and success. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition for existing members and communicating the added value behind CCRA’s revamped membership options for travel professionals.”\nCCRA’S INTEGRATED WEBSITE:\nCCRA’s integrated web presence is currently live and can be accessed via http://www.ccra.com , however, the new site will not be fully completed until the Home Based Travel Agent Forum that will be held in Tampa, FL on October 27-30th. Now through the end of 2015, the OSSN.com and checkatruecode.com websites will remain active to provide travel agents with an ample amount of time to become more acquainted with the new fully integrated CCRA site. The enhanced CCRA.com site will allow travel agents to more easily find CCRA preferred suppliers across the globe and access a much greater array of travel agent benefits offered by all CCRA company divisions. In addition to a much more modernized and sophisticated look and intuitive interface, the site will offer more streamlined navigation and an easier user experience for both travel professionals and suppliers. At this year’s Home-Based Travel Agent Forum, travel professionals will receive more information on CCRA’s new and improved website and enhanced membership opportunities for travel agents.\nNEW CCRA MEMBERSHIP OPTIONS:\nCCRA’s new consolidated membership structures will range from a free membership option that grants travel agent access to CCRA’s hotel booking platform and more, to a fully inclusive accredited travel agency membership that includes TRUE accreditation and affords a wealth of additional benefits from CCRA. In comparison to the OSSN membership structure, the new CCRA annual membership options will be simplified, offered at discounted rates, and provide a much greater array of travel agent benefits, including educational and online training platforms, discounts on industry trade shows, executive coaching from industry experts, local support at CCRA chapter meetings and much more. The new annual membership opportunities will be featured on the CCRA website and will become available at the end of October during the Home-Based Travel Agent Forum. In January 2016, all membership renewals and new member registrations will be made through CCRA’s website: http://www.ccra.com .\nINFORMATION FOR CURRENT OSSN MEMBERS:\nMoving forward, OSSN Chapters and regional directors will now be referred to as CCRA Chapters and Regions. There will be no major changes in Chapter Director leadership. CCRA Chapter and Regional Directors will receive enhanced educational and training opportunities and increased marketing support over the next year, to build more awareness, increase meeting attendance and promote the continued growth of CCRA Chapters across the United States. All current OSSN members will receive the information and support they will need to access the new CCRA website via internal member communications and website orientation webinars. Now through end of October, current OSSN members may renew their memberships online per the usual renewal procedures that can be accessed at OSSN.com. On January 1st, 2016, all OSSN members will be transitioned to the new CCRA membership platform. The TRUE brand will remain as a flagship product for CCRA.
