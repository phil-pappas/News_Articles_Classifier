The talks, which are fluid, have since moved on but it is believed that ABI will improve its approach this week. \nShould ABI clinch the deal, it would be not only the biggest-ever takeover of a British company, but also the sixth-largest in corporate history. \nAn offer of about £45 a share, which some City analysts are expecting, would value the FTSE 100 brewer at more than £70bn. The Takeover Panel has set a deadline of October 14 for ABI to make a formal offer or walk away, although that can be extended. \nBosses at the Budweiser brewer, led by chief executive Carlos Brito, have been prolific dealmakers with a track record for moving quickly. It only took about five weeks for InBev to agree on a takeover with Anheuser-Busch in 2008. \nSAB’s two biggest shareholders, the tobacco company Altria, which owns the Marlboro brand, and Colombia’s Santo Domingo family are thought to be receptive to a deal with ABI at the right price. The stance of both shareholders is key, as between them they own about 41pc of the company. \nSince the ABI approach was announced in mid-September, both suitor and bid target have been silent about negotiations. Neither is obliged to update investors if ABI makes another takeover proposal this week. \nA deal between the two brewers has been rumoured for years and is highly anticipated by industry observers. \nSAB attempted to ward off a bid from ABI with an unsuccessful tilt at Heine-ken last year. When the Budweiser brewer finally made its approach last month it struck a conciliatory tone towards, saying its “intention is to work with SABMiller’s board toward a recommended transaction”. \nSpokesmen for both SAB and ABI declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:54:43.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
