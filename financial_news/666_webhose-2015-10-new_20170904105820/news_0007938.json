But growth for services was not enough to offset a decline for business activity in the nation's crucial manufacturing sector. \nThe services PMI was 50.5 in September, down from 51.5 in August. A reading above 50 points to business growth, while anything below 50 signifies contraction. \nThe Caixin Composite PMI, which covers both services and manufacturing, was 48 in September, down from 48.8 in August. It was the second successive monthly decline for overall business activity in China. \nServices and manufacturing employment trends also continued to diverge in September. Manufacturers trimmed workforces at about the same rate as in August, while service providers continued to increase payrolls. But services hiring was not enough to offset factory job cuts. \nThe employment category of the services PMI pointed to \"continued strength of the services sector as a job creator,\" said Dr. He Fan, chief economist and director of research at Caixin Insight Group. \nBoth manufacturers and service providers cut prices in September amid weaker customer demand. \nAnd according to sub-indexes of the services PMI, services providers in September saw the rate of new business order growth decline to the slowest pace since July 2014.
