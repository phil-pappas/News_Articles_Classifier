The Fenton Charter Public Schools expanded its school offerings this year by the addition of two new schools: the Fenton STEM Academy (STEM) and the Fenton Charter Leadership Academy (FCLA), both K-5 schools, to provide a concentrated curriculum based on science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and a program emphasizing the integration of social and emotional learning. “As part of our mission, we offer an exceptional interdisciplinary curriculum in a technology-rich environment that challenges students to explore connections across subjects and use experiential learning to bridge gaps between theory and practice,” said Irene Sumida, Executive Director of Fenton Charter Public Schools. “The financing from TEQlease Education Finance has allowed us the flexibility and customization we needed to meet our extraordinary technology needs, and to expand into a new building to accommodate the newly introduced elementary schools.”“Fenton Charter Public Schools is an innovative charter school group, with a famous history in Los Angeles. Fenton Avenue Charter School was one of the first charter schools approved by the state of California in 1993. We are very pleased to provide the equipment lease financing that the school required to expand and deploy technology throughout its five schools,” said Mike Lockwood, president of TEQlease. “We are deeply committed to helping charter schools with the funding they need to educate their students. In addition, we are excited to be part of such a special project, and we take pride in knowing that our efforts go to an excellent cause and help shape the minds of the future.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:33:14.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
