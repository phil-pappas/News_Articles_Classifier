Follow @Kiplinger Thinkstock \nYou may be feeling the post-summer blues, but don't let the doldrums keep you from making money-saving Medicare moves. Although it's easier just to keep your current Medicare Part D prescription-drug plan or your Medicare Advantage plan, it's best to look at all the options for 2016 during open enrollment from October 15 to December 7. See Also: SLIDE SHOW: 11 Common Medicare Mistakes \nThe same advice goes for people under age 65 who buy individual coverage on the state and federal health care exchanges. Open enrollment runs from November 1 to January 31. \nIt's an especially good time to consider changes. Drug prices are rising and provider networks for Advantage and individual plans are narrowing. Also, about 30% of beneficiaries of traditional Medicare are likely to face big hikes in premiums for Part B in 2016 -- an incentive to shop around for a cheaper Part D or Advantage plan. (Read Big Price Hikes Coming for Medicare Premiums in 2016 .) Advertisement \nBe sure to review the notice that you received in September from your Part D or Advantage plan. The notice explains changes in coverage and costs. Even a small change, such as a new cost-sharing level for one of your drugs, can substantially raise your out-of-pocket costs. \"For a specific person with particular needs, a plan could get markedly better or worse,\" says Casey Schwarz, policy and client services counsel for the Medicare Rights Center. \nPart D drug plan. First, make sure your drugs are included in the plan you're considering. Insurers are paring their formularies and dropping coverage of some expensive options. \"They're getting more aggressive with drugs on their formulary exclusion list,\" says Amanda Forys, director for reimbursement strategy for Xcenda, a health care consulting firm. \nAlthough the average premium for Part D is expected to remain at about $33 a month, your out-of-pocket costs could increase significantly. \"People so often focus on the premium, and in many cases the premium may not be a good proxy for the costs throughout the year,\" says Tricia Neuman, a senior vice-president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. \nLook at the share of the costs you will have to pay for each drug. Insurers are charging consumers as much as 30% to 50% of the cost for specialty drugs. For example, before you even reach the Part D \"doughnut hole\" coverage gap, you may have to pay $300 to $2,000 out of your pocket each month for some common specialty drugs, such as Copaxone (for multiple sclerosis) and Enbrel (for rheumatoid arthritis), according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \nMost insurers have also increased cost sharing for drugs in the nonpreferred and preferred brand-name drug categories -- rising to a median of $85 from $55 over the past decade for a 30-day supply of nonpreferred brand-name drugs, Neuman says. And more plans are switching from fixed-dollar co-payments to co-insurance, which is based on a percentage of the cost. Your share under co-insurance is typically 20% to 40% of the cost. \"You could go to the pharmacy and find that you're not paying $50 anymore -- you're paying quite a bit more,\" says Colin Shannon of Avalere Health, a health care consulting firm. \nInsurers are also imposing more restrictions on the use of brand-name drugs, such as requiring prior authorization from your doctor or requiring you to try lower-cost drugs first (known as step therapy). Before switching plans, find out if there are any hurdles before the insurer will cover your brand-name drugs. \nAsk your doctor if you can switch to a generic drug or other lower-cost option before you pick a plan for 2016. \"The cost sharing for preferred generic drugs has actually gone down,\" Neuman says. The median cost of a 30-day supply is $2 for preferred generics and $5 for nonpreferred generics. The plan that offers the best deal for brand-name drugs may be different than the one offering the best deal for generics. \nYou'll need to pay a larger portion of the price for your drugs when you hit the doughnut hole. In 2016, your Part D plan will provide coverage until your drug expenses reach $3,310 (including both your share and the insurer's share of the costs). You then have to pay 45% of the cost of brand-name drugs and 58% of the cost of generics yourself. \"If you take a specialty drug, you could blow through the doughnut hole in one month,\" Forys says. When your out-of-pocket costs reach $4,850, your plan kicks back in, and you'll just have to pay 5% of your covered drug costs. \nYou can compare plans available in your area with the Medicare Plan Finder at www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan after October 1. Type in your drugs and dosages, and you'll see the premiums and total out-of-pocket costs for your specific drugs over the year, including a monthly breakdown of your costs. You can also get help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program. (Go to www.shiptacenter.org or call 800-633-4227 for local contacts.) \nAlso see if you can save money by using a plan's preferred pharmacies. \"There has been an explosion of preferred pharmacy networks over the past four years,\" says John Lee, senior director of Medicare Part D for Walgreens. You may have to pay 35% of the cost of certain brand-name drugs at preferred pharmacies, but 50% at other pharmacies, for example. \nThe difference can add up, even for generic drugs. If you use two common generic drugs (such as Lisinopril for high blood pressure and Metformin for Type 2 diabetes), you'd pay $24 out of pocket over the year at a preferred pharmacy versus $192 at a nonpreferred pharmacy, according to Walgreens. \nAdvantage plans. Instead of getting a Part D plan and a Medigap supplemental insurance policy (more on Medigap later), you can get both medical and drug coverage through a private Medicare Advantage plan. These plans tend to have lower premiums than the combination of Medigap and Part D. Average monthly premiums are $38 in addition to Part B premiums, and some plans don't charge a premium beyond Part B. The plan may also provide dental and vision care. But the Advantage plan may have more out-of-pocket costs, as well as limited provider networks. \nThe costs, coverage and networks can change from year to year. \"It's easy to focus on premium, but it's hugely important to make sure you have access to the doctors you want to see, and the drugs and pharmacy you use,\" says Avalere's Shannon. Cost sharing also varies from plan to plan. \nAs with Part D plans, it's essential to check the costs of drugs in Advantage plans. Cost sharing for brand-name drugs increased by about 70% for Advantage plans from 2006 to 2014, with the median co-payment at $95 for nonpreferred brand-name drugs and $45 for preferred brand-name drugs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many Advantage plans are also switching to percentage-based co-insurance for specialty and brand-name drugs. \nTo compare costs for all of the plans in your area, use the Medicare Plan Finder.
