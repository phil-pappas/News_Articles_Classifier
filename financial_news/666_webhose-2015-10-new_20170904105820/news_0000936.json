The average estimate of seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 858 million francs. The investment bank posted a pretax loss of 125 million francs.\nChief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, brought in to rebuild investor confidence, is seeking to boost returns under pressure from tougher capital requirements and record-low interest rates. A market rout over the summer ensnared assets from junk bonds to emerging-market currencies, denting results at U.S. banks.\nIn a separate announcement on Wednesday, Credit Suisse said it planned to increase capital by about 6.05 billion francs, including a rights offering and a private placing. It also outlined plans for 3.5 billion francs of cost savings by the end of 2018 and other strategic measures.\nCredit Suisse’s investment bank pretax loss missed an estimate for a pretax profit of 308 million francs for the third quarter. Revenue from underwriting and advisory declined 30 percent to 635 million francs.\nNet revenue from fixed-income sales and trading plunged 52 percent to 674 million francs as “extreme dislocations” in credit markets resulted in lower client activity, according to a company presentation. Equity sales and trading gained 8.8 percent to 1.17 billion francs.\nPrivate banking and wealth management posted 647 million francs in pretax profit, down 31 percent, Credit Suisse said. The wealth-management client business, the biggest part of the division, posted pretax profit of 477 million francs, down 11 percent.\nCredit Suisse saw a “significant decline” in emerging markets compared with the third quarter of 2014 due to subdued client financing volumes and trading activity, according to the presentation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:27:50.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
