Attacks on him should not derail policy discussions.. Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Let's hope Labor's nonsensical attack on Malcolm Turnbull's investments doesn't deter from the real tax debate affecting Australian entrepreneurs – how to best emulate Turnbull's early and very financially rewarding success in backing start-ups.\nYes, the Turnbulls are very wealthy as a result. The Prime Minister told Labor MPs to wear their sandwich boards to protest if they want. It's hardly news.\nBut to the extent the Turnbulls' offshore investments via global funds make higher returns, they inevitably end up paying the Australian Taxation Office more. Problem? Only for Labor.\nAll sorts of large managed funds have made use of the Cayman Islands, including AustralianSuper and Australia's Future Fund, for good reason. The general idea is to ensure pooled money from international investors and investments goes through countries with tax \"neutrality\" so tax on the income is paid only in the investors' home country without extra ticket clipping. That's why Turnbull can say he has paid his Australian taxes in full while avoiding potential conflicts of interest in Australia.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull during question time at Parliament House in Canberra on Thursday 15 October 2015. Photo: Andrew Meares Andrew Meares The much bigger issue is whether his government should use tax breaks to encourage more funding from other private investors in order to boost development of a stronger start-up culture.\nMood of excitement Some of that start-up momentum is already well under way in Australia. There's a mood of excitement about the possibilities evident in the various clusters of start-ups in Sydney and Melbourne that just didn't exist a couple of years ago. The term fintech, for example, no longer attracts the same puzzled expressions about its meaning.\nBut this is an increasingly crowded global race with no finishing line.\n Other countries like the UK, Singapore, Israel and Ireland are much more advanced in their tax strategies – with the results to prove such an approach works to accelerate the growth of investment and new businesses in their economies.\nSo how does Australia try to compete?\nMalcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister clearly understands this challenge, reflected in his constant enthusiasm about boosting innovation.\nThe enthusiasm is mutual from a sector which had felt largely ignored by Australia's political leadership and its rhetoric about the economy. It is not that there is no federal and state government assistance available through a combination of grants and incentives. But the process seems to be overly complicated and often not well targeted or understood enough to be particularly useful.\nMeeting on Friday Turnbull has called a meeting on Friday of university and research chiefs to talk about how to increase Australia's lousy record of commercialising its research despite the billions of tax dollars spent annually on research and development.\nBut the potential for this to be more effective is likely to require different and specifically directed tax breaks.\nIt's why David Coleman, a Liberal backbencher and former chairman of PBL Media, is backing broadening the capital gains tax exemption to encourage greater investment in start-ups, especially by wealthy individuals.\nThat's still not a politically simple call in a budget struggling with years of high deficits and massive spending commitments. Nor do more tax concessions fit easily with the idea of lower, simpler taxes overall as the most efficient way of boosting economic growth.\nThe alternative view is that well-targeted tax breaks still have a beneficial indirect effect, including on overall tax revenue, by encouraging businesses and activity that would otherwise not exist or go elsewhere.\nThe Committee for Sydney, chaired by none other than Lucy Turnbull, has already done a lot of work on the need to foster an innovative and entrepreneurial culture. Coincidentally, its latest research paper, prepared with KPMG, is called \"Building the start-up ecosystem in NSW: from grants to collaboration.\"\nInnovative and entrepreneurial culture It compares the experience of other countries such the Cameron Government's determination to use tax to successfully drive a thriving start-up culture in the UK, especially in fintech. The impact on London has already been huge.\nThese UK schemes provide capital gains tax relief for individuals based on the cost of shares purchased up to £100,000 under one early seed stage investor scheme and £1,000,000 ($2.1 million) for investments in smaller, higher-risk trading companies.\nNot that all tax breaks, even for innovation, are necessarily welcomed by other countries. The argument is that they contribute to profit shifting and unfair competition to encourage multinationals to artificially locate their profits in certain jurisdictions.\nUnder OECD pressure led by Germany, the UK has had to promise to phase out by 2021 its Patent Box regime which provides low taxes for profits from qualifying intellectual property development and sales.\nIreland, which already has a very low 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, has attracted massive investment from multinationals as well as increasing criticism it has effectively promoted tax avoidance at the expense of other countries.\nThe Irish are officially abandoning what is known as the \"double Irish\" tax structure but have just announced a new tax rate of only 6.25 per cent for revenue and royalties from intellectual property. This won't impress the UK.\nIt's more evidence of the complexity of tax rates.\nAny tax breaks in the Government's innovation package to be unveiled shortly are hardly likely to be internationally controversial, particularly given Australia's modest status. Presumably, they also won't produce more ill-informed Labor hysteria about \"appropriate\" tax for wealthy investors. But don't bet on it.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:07:45.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
