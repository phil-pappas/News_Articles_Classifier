Rob Homer by Sally Rose A proposal to improve the adequacy of women's retirement savings by allowing working-age couples to combine their super accounts has been criticised by leaders of the non-profit superannuation sector.\nANZ Global Wealth boss Joyce Phillips told a Senate economics committee into improving the adequacy of women's superannuation on Tuesday that couples should be allowed a joint superannuation account, similar to joint bank accounts and mortgages, to bolster the superannuation savings of women .\nIt is an idea that actuarial and consulting firm Rice Warner first floated in April last year.\nOn Wednesday, Mortgage Choice Financial Planning boss Tania Milnes backed the push and superannuation research house Chant West said it could help young couples by saving them about $6000 in fees and improving the quality of their retirement planning .\nWomen in Super chairwoman Catherine Wood said the proposal for joint accounts was worthy of further examination, but should be considered a \"side issue\" to structural changes that could make a more meaningful difference to the gender gap in retirement outcomes, such as tax reform or addressing the gender pay gap.\nPotential issues and complications with administering joint super accounts that would need to be considered include whether there would need to be sub-accounts with different investment profiles, which could also be influenced by the individual's ages, Ms Wood said.\n\"It is also hard to predict whether a joint account would increase a woman's interest in her superannuation, or whether for some it would potentially be disempowering.\"\nOther representatives from the non-profit super sector have opposed the push to allow joint super accounts.\n More expensive to administer Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia chief executive Pauline Vamos said: \"Allowing couples to combine their super accounts would benefit some women, but priority should be given to implementing changes targeted at boosting the retirement outcomes of the most vulnerable women in the system.\n\"Joint accounts would do nothing to help solve the inequity experienced by low-income and single women.\"\nMs Vamos also warned that requiring funds to allow some members to choose to have a joint account with their spouse would create a costly new administrative burden that would be borne by all members.\nAnother objection was that women tend to prefer more conservative investment options than men.\nAustralian Institute of Superannuation Trustees senior policy adviser Karen Volpatoâ€‹ said: \"There would be an issue of how to manage different risk appetite when women pooled their money with a spouse with a higher balance.\"\nMs Volpato also cited fee pressure in her opposition to changing the law to allow couples to pool their super accounts.\nIn non-profit funds, any extra administrative costs have a direct effect on the fees charged to all members, she said.\nBank-owned super funds tend to have greater access to technology that can bring down administration costs than their non-profit rivals .\nChant West head of research Ian Fryer suggested that allowing funds to link information about spouses accounts, for the purposes of providing projections on the likely retirement income for their household, would deliver couples much of the benefit of a combined account with less administrative complexity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:10:41.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
