With these exits, P&G will also exit the complexity that these brands create. However, the company will still retain 94% of its profit before tax.\nFocus on multimedia and e-commerce At the Barclays Global Consumer Staples conference, G&P’s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller, highlighted that the company is focusing on new technology to improve consumer value. For example, diapers have approached 30% growth annually in the e-commerce channel. According to Moeller, Pampers’ online share is greater than its offline share in eight out of ten of its top markets. The company also plans to communicate the innovations in products across multiple media sources.\nThis could help the company strengthen its 1Q16 sales execution with e-commerce. It could also improve valuations.\nTo learn more about P&G’s updates on growth and transformational moves, please read A Procter & Gamble Investor Update: Growth and Transformational Objectives .\nFor more industry updates and analysis, please visit Market Realist’s Consumer Products page .\nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Will Procter & Gamble Beat Revenue Estimates in 1Q16?
