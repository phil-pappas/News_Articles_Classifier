Just hide. Edwina Pickles Ouch. Tough love.\n\"Corrections happen; get over it,\" he continued. \"This is a dip that should be bought; it is not the beginning of the next bear market.\"\nBuckland points out that since 1970, the median annual sell-off in US shares has been 12 per cent, but the median annual return has also been 12 per cent. In other words, in an average year investors will experience a nasty sell-off at some point, but are still likely to end the year higher.\nWhich begs the question: can you handle losing money? Because while there may be life yet in the old bull market, the ride is likely to only get bumpier from here.\n“Corrections happen, get over it,” Citi chief global equity strategist Rob Buckland says. Dominic Lorrimer \"Look through what's happening in China, Greece and the potential turn in the US rate cycle,\" Buckland says. \"The most important event is [that US corporate credit] spreads have started to widen.\"\nThat is, investors are now factoring in growing risks in the corporate sector and have begun to demand a higher rate of interest for taking on that elevated level of risk.\nSo why is that so important? Because it's the turning of the credit bull market. It spells trouble down the line for equity markets, but – crucially – most likely not straight away.\nThis brings us back to the idea of a \"Market Clock\", which is a stylised way of understanding the credit and equity cycle. It differs from the doomsday version in two ways: it has a significantly less dramatic title, and the final reckoning for investors is at 9 o'clock, rather than midnight.\nOn this clock, the US is not long past 6 o'clock, reckons Buckland, nine to 12 months into a period that lasted around three years when we were last here in the late 1990s, when it took that long after the Asian crisis of 1997 for stockmarkets to peak.\nThat implies we may have a couple of years before the US sharemarket falls apart, which, let's face it, is big news for investors all over the world.\nIn this phase the trajectory remains broadly the same, says Buckland, but \"the way the stockmarket goes up is changing\".\n'Be brave and buy dips' The Citi strategist has looked at the past three such \"ageing bull\" cycles and says the first thing to note is that you make as much money per month in this period as you do in happier times, but that the volatility is much higher.\nThat means you have to \"be brave and buy the dips,\" Buckland says.\nIt is also \"absolutely typical\" that during this phase is when \"the world's biggest equity bubbles have been created\" – Japan in the late 1980s, the tech boom in the late 1990s. Those are the heady end-days where investors can make a lot of money – as long as they can get out early enough.\n\"We are playing a game of chicken [before] it all collapses in a hideous heap when we hit 9 o'clock,\" Buckland says.\nThere have been signs of frothiness in areas such as biotech and internet stocks, but nothing fits Buckland's definition of a bubble, which is something professional \"investors get fired for not owning\". That's also the thing you get fired for owning at 9pm.\nIf it's any comfort, central bank action can prolong this ageing bull market phase, and there has certainly been plenty of chatter around the potential for more in that vein.\nOn Thursday night came news that the European Central Bank is likely to expand its stimulus program , most likely in early December, which potentially complicates any plans for the US Federal Reserve to raise rates that month.\nJapanese monetary authorities could well up their quantitative easing, and here there are growing bets of more rate cuts from the RBA, particularly after the major banks' hikes to mortgage rates.\nThat's why Buckland, and many others, prefer investing in Japanese and European equity markets, where central bank support continues to flow, although you'd have to keep an eye on the currency effect.\nMeanwhile, investors need to prepare themselves for volatility, and keep an eye out for red flags. Right now valuations aren't cheap, but, as we mentioned, they are a far cry from bubble territory. Credit spreads are widening but haven't reached extremes. Merger and acquisition activity is picking up, but hasn't exploded. Company bosses aren't spending like drunken sailors – in fact, they are hoarding cash to return it to shareholders.\nWhich begs the final question: what to do when the clock does tick over to 9 o'clock?\nWhen that happens, \"all bets are off,\" Buckland says.\nHis investment advice? \"Just hide; just hide under the table.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:03:52.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
