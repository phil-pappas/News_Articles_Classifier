The rally is not going to all peter out, though having said that the jump today is in large part cause of short covering,\" said BNP Paribas strategist Stephen Briggs.\nZinc mine supply had already been set to shrink given the closure of MMG's huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland this year.\nLondon Metal Exchange zinc rose 10.2 percent to $1,837 at 0929 GMT, its highest price in a month and its biggest single-day gain on Reuters data records, which go back to mid-2005.\nLead, which is often mined alongside zinc, surged 6 percent at one point to its highest since late July at $1,774, copper and aluminium gained 4 percent while nickel surged more than 5 percent to hit a month high.\nThe price rally is set to be a shot in the arm for the beleaguered metals industry, many of whose members are heading for London for the annual LME Week celebrations which start on Monday.\nElsewhere, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's meeting on Thursday revealed the extent to which policymakers are concerned that a global economic slowdown might threaten the U.S. economic outlook.\nFor metals, concerns persist about the growth slowdown in China, which consumes about half the world's copper.\nSenior metals executives in China expect most base metals will face tepid demand there next year as growth slows in the world's second largest economy, although there is some hope appetite will strengthen later in the year.\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin\n($1 = 6.3444 Chinese yuan) (Additional reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Keith Weir )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:59:19.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
