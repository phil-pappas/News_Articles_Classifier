Photo: Bradley Kanaris\nThe news gets worse for Skroo.\nEales points out that, while executive pay is theoretically uncapped, \"natural curbs\" are in place to ensure salaries do not sky-rocket to \"unacceptable levels\".\nHe points out that, even if Skroo doubled the company's underlying profit last year to $750 million, under the pay structure in place he will have earned a relatively skimp $2.4 million.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that Skroo pocketed more than $15 million last year in franked dividends from Flight Centre, you would almost feel sorry for him.\nYou can't blame Eales for having a blind spot to this nice little earner. His 2000 shares wouldn't have yielded enough for a return flight to the latest World Cup.\nRich resort Your diarist was contemplating a retreat from the modern world and was drawn to the unspoilt charms of Woodwark Bay, just north of Queensland's Airlie Beach.\nThe boutique resort is a steal at just $19,000 per night, for a minimum of four nights during peak season.\n\"In the midst of the Whitsundays there is a jewel – containing exquisitely appointed accommodation for up to 14 guests, offering over 100 kilometres of roads to be explored, providing a private lake to be water-skied and fished on, waterfalls and picnic huts and more surrounded by 50,000 acres of uninterrupted and untracked national parkland,\" the website says.\nDon't worry, it includes breakfast lunch and dinner, but not the booze bill and other extras like quad bike hire. Although you had better be ready with the cash up front.\nThere is a 30 per cent deposit required nine weeks before arrival, a $10,000 \"damage and incidentals\" deposit plus a $1500 per day booked, advance on \"out-of-pocket expenses\".\nIf nothing else, it proves that the resort's owner, Jodee Rich , has learnt a thing or two about billing since the failure of One.Tel.\nPresumably James Packer has not graced the serene environs of Woodwark Bay since his visit just prior to the telco's collapse.\nThe website does not mention if mobile reception is any good.\nGrand Slam Four months ago Fairfax Media reported the awkward fact that the former executive chairman of failed stockbroker BBY, Glenn (son of Ken) Rosewall , was still a member of an official ASIC panel charged with taking action over breaches of the market integrity rules.\nOK, it took a bit of time, but the awkward moment is over, according to the corporate cop's website , which no longer lists him as a member.\nIt's just as well given allegations that BBY might have misused client funds, misled its lenders, and breached the Corporations Act.\nDecked chairs Amid the smorgasbord of awards to clog up the run towards Christmas, CBD thought it worth mentioning the lunchtime trinkets being arranged by publisher Peter Charlton at Sydney pasta bowl, Machiavelli, on December 14.\nCBD is being lined up as a judge on the panel to help determine the best boardroom chairs in the country.\nBut your scribe's skills are probably more adept at picking the other big awards for the event – picking the corporate chairs whose performance places them at the other end of the performance spectrum.\nNow that will be a tough short list to whittle down.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/markets/markets-disciplinary-panel/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:13:53.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
