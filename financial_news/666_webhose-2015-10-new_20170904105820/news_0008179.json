Yet many young Africans are pessimistic about agriculture, because they see too many farmers and agriculture businesses struggling to survive,\" said Dr. Agnes Kalibata, President of AGRA. \n\"The good news is that economic opportunities in agriculture are much bigger than many realize, and with the right kinds of support, Africa's rapidly growing food sector can become as much as a $1 trillion source of a wide array of financially rewarding opportunities for Africa's youth, on and off the farm.\" \nAGRF 2015 also comes during the African Union designated \"Year of Women's Empowerment and Development.\" \n\"Agriculture is the largest employer of women, employing up to 90 percent of women in some African countries,\" said Rhoda Peace Tumusiime, commissioner for rural economy and agriculture, African Union. \n\"Women anchor rural economies. Yet they farm without secure land rights, remuneration or the machinery and technologies essential to commercial agriculture. Policies and programs that address these gaps and link rural farmers to urban markets can transform livelihoods for smallholder farmers.\" \nThe AGRF 2015 will define clear strategies to enable youth and women to engage in agriculture as a business enterprise and generate a triple dividend of improved food security, increased incomes and job creation. \nIt will delve into issues including access to land, finance, energy and inputs, and the development of infrastructure, trade and markets, all with a particular eye toward overcoming challenges and expanding opportunities for women and youth.
