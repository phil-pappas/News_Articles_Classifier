While the ECB may not ease this month, markets remain guarded over the possibility of the central bank hinting of more stimulus steps later this year.\n\"Although the ECB is widely expected to stand pat on policy on Thursday, the euro risks weakening again on persisting worries about further easing,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, a senior strategist at Monex in Tokyo.\nThe dollar was little changed at 119.80 yen after edging up 0.3 percent overnight in range-bound trading.\nThe Canadian dollar steadied as the conclusion of Canada's elections, in which Liberal leader Justin Trudeau won a shock victory, removed an element of near-term uncertainty that had knocked the loonie prior to the votes.\nFocus has now turned to the Bank of Canada's policy decision due later on Wednesday. A majority of analysts polled by Reuters see the BOC keeping interest rates unchanged.\nThe dollar stood little changed at C$1.2987 after rising to as high as C$1.3048 on Tuesday.\nThe New Zealand dollar was on the defensive after a fall in international milk prices during a second auction held this month by Fonterra Co-operative Group, the world's largest dairy exporter.\nThe kiwi traded at $0.6753 after striking a 1-week low of $0.6736.\n($1 = 0.8810 euros) (Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:11:45.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
