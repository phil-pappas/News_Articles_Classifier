What is it doing, and why? \n= What is the Bank of England trying to do here? = \nRegulators want to split up retail banks the services you would get in a branch, online or that a small business would use from the investment banking and global operations of the giant banks. \nThe idea is that the essential parts of the business will become safer, making it less likely that normal people will be affected by a failure in the riskier parts, such as investment banking. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if the bank does crash, the new rules should make it easier for the Bank of England to let investment banking operations collapse , but keep the retail bank running. \n= Will it work? = \nThe ring-fenced banks have been told to make sure they are not too reliant on their investment bank for revenues, and to have their own separate legal, HR and risk operations. \nOn top of that they will have to set up their own independent access to the payments systems, and have substantial extra capital buffers. \nTogether, these should insulate the retail bank from wider problems in its group or in the financial markets. \nIn theory, it means the government will never have to bail out a lender with a big investment bank like Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) ever again - but of course the real test will come at a time when financial markets are panicking. \n= Are there any downsides? = \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will not be cheap to implement. A whole array of changes to the capital regime are on the way which could mean the banking sector has to put aside tens of billions of pounds more into capital buffers , which could limit the amount they lend out to ordinary consumers and businesses. \nIn addition, big banks will have to spend an estimated £200m each to implement the reforms, then £120m per year sustaining the extra staff in areas like IT, HR and risk. As always, that is likely to be passed on to customers. \n= Are these reforms finished yet? = \nAbsolutely not. The ring-fenced banks will learn next year how much extra capital they will have to set aside in this ring-fenced unit. \nThe biggest banks are on track to hold a 7pc capital buffer, plus up to an additional 2.5pc to cover the risks they pose to the wider financial system. Still to be decided are rules that could add another 3pc to those buffers to account for the ring-fenced bank's importance. \nRegulators will assess the size of each bank's loans based on how risky they are, then make the banks hold extra capital worth as much as 12.5pc of that value, to cover the bank in case the loans go bad. \nOn top of that, the Bank of England also has the power to add another \"counter-cyclical\" buffer if it fears the economy is growing unsustainably quickly. \nThere are further conditions set to be imposed by international regulators too, as they force big banks to get better at estimating the riskiness of their own lending. \nThe rules are all supposed to come into force in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:57:39.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
