What is it? Cesanta is a leader in embedded communication technologies. Its open-source software allows vendors to easily, securely and reliably connect their devices to the Internet of Things. Cesanta works with clients from all industries including home automation, appliances, aerospace, gaming, software and many more to bring the mission of making all devices in the world connected to life. Who’s behind it? Cesanta was founded by Anatoly Lebedev and Sergey Lyubka. Both come from an international Google background and brought further top Google engineers into the organisation as well as Twitter and HubSpot alumni to run the business side. How is it funded? Cesanta has secured investment from ACT Ventures, Enterprise Ireland and Kevin Hartz. Kevin is a founder and the CEO of Eventbrite. He is also an early-stage investor and advisor to successful start-ups including the likes of PayPal, Pinterest, Airbnb, Uber, Palantir, Tripit and Lookout. Future plans? Cesanta has always pioneered and championed innovative embedded technology. The next big step is Smart.js – a full-stack Internet of Things platform. What makes this platform different to other IoT platforms is its ease of use. Instead of having to work with complex and specialised developer languages, developers can code in the much more-used JavaScript. To make that possible, Cesanta develops the world’s smallest JavaScript engine, specifically designed for embedded environments. For business, this means getting to market faster by saving development time and reducing costs, as the need to hire a development team skilled in these specialised languages is no longer required.
