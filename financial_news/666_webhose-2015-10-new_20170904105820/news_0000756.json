Solomon Co who is working with Quiksilver, testified that \"at some point\" Oaktree might put the clothing companies together if it's able to bring California-based Quiksilver out of bankruptcy under its control.\nMr Savini added that he never directly approached Oaktree about a transaction with Billabong and that he didn't believe Billabong \"has the balance sheet to support\" such a deal.\nOaktree owns about 20 per cent of Australian-based Billabong.\nQuiksilver is in court defending its proposal to borrow as much as $US175 million from Oaktree and Bank of America Corp, part of a broader plan to have Oaktree covert its debt into equity and assume control of the company.\nThe maker of surf-style clothing is seeking court approval of the financing over a competing proposal from Brigade Capital, which is championed by Quiksilver's unsecured creditors.\nThe New York Post reported earlier that a Quiksilver-Billabong combination was being considered, citing a source close to the matter that it didn't name.\nBloomberg\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/quiksilver-restructuring-shines-spotlight-on-billabong-20150909-gji9wu.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:09:10.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
