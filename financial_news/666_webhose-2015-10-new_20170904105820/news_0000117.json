He is the chief investment officer of the investment management unit of Morningstar, a global mutual fund data and research firm, which also now manages money. Lill’s unit also caters to the US, the UK and Japanese markets, in addition to Australia. He explains the importance of global diversification and is particularly bullish about certain emerging markets at the moment.\nHow do you strike a balance between return and risk?\nRisk is the most important thing. Sometimes, investors take too much risk. And it’s not until when conditions turn volatile, like it’s been in 2015, that you notice how much risk the investment managers are taking inside their portfolios.\nOur No.1 objective is to maximise risk-adjusted returns. We define risk as a permanent loss of capital. That’s what we try and avoid for our clients. We’re very valuation focused because that’s the best way to avoid big losses. We try and find assets that are historically cheap, we invest when other investors are not investing, and we try and make sure we invest in sectors or companies that have strong fundamental earnings.\nIs global diversification important?\nYes, but you need to be careful. Currently, there’s the US and pockets of European markets that are overvalued on a historic basis. So, right now, exposure to the US markets should be low. We’ve had a very strong attraction to Japanese equity for quite some time now.\nUnderstand the benefits of diversification; do not put all your eggs in just one market, think about different drivers that various currencies and countries give. Global investing is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. Try and find customised areas that you think are more attractive.\nIn a newsletter, you talked about the difference between investing in currencies and in markets. Can you elaborate?\nIf you are investing on behalf of an Indian investor when the rupee is a strong currency, investing in a country could be positive, but investing in a currency could be negative. You have to weigh both ideas when you are investing in global equity markets.\nFor instance, in Japan, sometimes as the Yen depreciates, the equity markets go up because their many exporters become more competitive. Therefore, you have to understand the difference between a currency and a local equity market.\nBut if you are an Indian investor, and the rupee is appreciating, in most cases, you will lose money if you go overseas. If the rupee is depreciating, then you gain.\nHow important is equities if the target is retirement? And can a retired individual escape equity?\nSome allocation to equities at every point of life cycle is important; and certainly when the investor is young and investing for the longer term. There are times when equity markets are attractive, but there are also times when they are overvalued, which is when you must stop putting in equities.\nIn retirement, a small degree of equities is important. Our research shows that there are three stages of retirement. The first stage is when people spend more money because they are more active—they go on holidays or even take their grand-children on holidays. In the second stage, they are a lot less active, and their expenses go down. They stay at home. The third stage, unfortunately, is when you need assistance, and medical help. Then your expenses go up again. So, it is important to invest in equities for that third stage to get long-term growth, even though you could be focused on income, day to day.\nWhich geographies excite you right now?\nWe like emerging markets because we are long-term, valuation-driven investors. It’s a good time to invest in emerging markets if you have a 7-10 year horizon. We’re positive of growth being stronger here than in the developed markets.\nThe most attractive markets have fallen the most. For example, Brazil. It has the combination of energy markets; and energy companies have fallen a lot.\nWe are very positive on India, but as a whole it’s expensive. So, we prefer to choose particular companies rather than buy the whole market.\nChina is interesting but we prefer to avoid the large Chinese financial companies. The mixture of state-owned enterprises and very big exposure to the Chinese property market makes them quite risky on a long-term basis.\nWe are investing in oil companies, particularly in Europe and the US, where we feel the large oil companies will be great investments for over a 10-year period. The price of $100 a barrel of oil is not a strong probability, but the price may go back to $60-70. At that level, large oil companies such as British Petroleum, Shell or Chevron can make a lot of profit at $70 a barrel. These are low-cost producers and their earnings will be very strong.\nHow do you look at emerging markets? Do you see them as a homogeneous group or as individual countries within the bracket?\nWe try and find opportunities in specific areas. An Australian investor has a lot of access to iron ore and materials in the Australian market. So, there’s no need to invest in Brazil, for instance, which has similar companies. An Indian investor has access to technology companies in India, then, perhaps there’s no need to invest in South Korea.\nIt all depends on where you are based and getting access to different economies. If you are in India, then perhaps you can look at investing in Brazil, Russia or Australia; you’ll find many energy commodity supply companies there, and that would bring true diversification. The idea is not to duplicate and invest in the same way, but to add value. Each country has a bias towards particular sector(s) and you must seek out to explore the differences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:29:44.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
