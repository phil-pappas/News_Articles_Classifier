October 26, 2015 09:37 ET Global Arena Holding Sub Buys Into Blockchain With BTC Purchase \nGAHI Acquisition Corp. and Blockchain Technologies Corporation Officially Execute on Acquisition Plan With Initial Investment \nNEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Oct 26, 2015) - Global Arena Holding, Inc. (the \"Company\") ( OTC PINK : GAHC ), announced today, that the Company has officially secured, with an initial investment, six blockchain startups, five provisional patents, one non-provisional patent and the expertise of Mr. Nick Spanos, through its subsidiary's acquisition of Blockchain Technologies Corporation (\"BTC\"). \nAs noted in the Company's Form 8-K Filing , GAHI Acquisition Corporation (\"GAHI\") has formally initiated the acquisition of BTC with an initial investment into the technology firm, solidifying the Company's entry into the Blockchain . Mr. Matthews and Nick Spanos (BTC's President), commenced this acquisition effort during the 2nd Quarter of 2015. During the 3rd Quarter, the Company secured the initial capital required to start formal execution of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between GAHI and BTC. \nAs a result, the Company has a tenable accumulation of up to 30% of BTC in this initial transaction, having (i) acquired a 10% stake of BTC through a cash and stock deal, and, (ii) secured a right to acquire an existing position held by a third party BTC debtholder which is convertible into an additional 20% stake of BTC. As this deal solidifies the Company's entry into the Blockchain , BTC is expected to ultimately merge with GAHI, leaving GAHI as the surviving entity. \n\"It is now official!\" said Mr. John Matthews, CEO of the Company. \"Through this deal, we have now solidified the Company's entry into the Blockchain . What makes this foray even more exciting is that Global Election Services (\"GES\") now has complete access to Nick Spanos and his expert knowledge of the blockchain. This gives Ms. Maralin Falik the ability to leverage the power of the blockchain , through vertical applications developed by BTC -- and enhance the rapid expansion of our election services business.\" \nManagement believes that the Company is now well positioned to make significant contributions to the ongoing development of what Marc Andreessen suggests, could be the most important invention since the Internet itself. And with BTC under its umbrella, the Company intends to leverage its new competitive advantage, \"using this distributed consensus model , to influence and create vertical blockchain applications that will prove both useful to the world and lucrative to Global Arena Holding,\" concluded Matthews. \nFor a message from the CEO expanding on this opportunity, visit: http://wp.me/p6Nf5M-CX \nAbout Blockchain Technologies Corporation \nBlockchain Technologies Corporation (\"BTC\") is a technology company which leverages the underlying crypto technology of Bitcoin [Blockchain] and the blockchain's distributed consensus model .
