Photo: Photo courtesy Rice Warner\nA push from one of the big four banks to change the law to allow working age couples to pool their superannuation could save households about $6000 in fees and make it easier to plan for their retirement together.\nOn average Australian women retire with half as much superannuation as men, a reflection of the fact that women typically earn less than men and are more likely to have time out of the workforce to care for children or other relatives.\nANZ Global Wealth boss Joyce Phillips told a Senate economics committee into improving the adequacy of women's superannuation on Tuesday that couples should be allowed a joint superannuation account, similar to joint bank accounts and mortgages, to bolster the superannuation savings of women .\nMs Phillips said about two-thirds of Australians were married when they retired and pooled their finances across other areas of their lives, so joint superannuation accounts made sense.\nFor the average young couple on a low to middle income combining their managed super funds today would give them around an extra $6000 at retirement, according to preliminary financial modelling provided by superannuation research house Chant West for Fairfax Media.\nAdvertisement That calculation assumes that the couple is 27 years old with 40 years till retirement, and that super funds would only charge the one annual membership fee, typically $78, on joint accounts. It assumes a 3 per cent real rate of return and that member fees would increase with inflation over time.\n\"The savings on administration fees would be moderate at best, but who wouldn't knock back an extra $6000?,\" Chant West head of research Ian Fryer said.\nA more important benefit would be an improvement in the retirement savings adequacy projections funds can provide to their members, he said.\n\"Lots of funds now provide online tools to help members understand their projected retirement balance and what they can do to improve that, but for people planning to retire in a couple looking at projections for their own account only paints half the picture. Joint accounts would help funds provide projections that are much more meaningful and helpful to the majority of people who retire as part of a couple.\"\nPeople in self-managed super funds are already able to pool their retirement savings among up to four individuals. Allowing couples to pool managed super funds would extend this choice to people with lower balances for whom setting up an SMSF may not be a viable option.\nActuarial and consulting firm Rice Warner first floated the idea of allowing couples to combine their managed super funds in April 2014.\n\"Due to the need to maintain separate contribution and insurance records it is unreasonable to expect joint accounts would halve total membership fees per couple, but it should bring costs down,\" Rice Warner deputy chief executive Melissa Fuller said.\n\"The real benefit to centralising super is that it would make it easier for couples to identify it as a shared asset. This would assist with financial planning decisions, and make it simpler to protect women's rights in the event of a divorce.\"\nMortgageChoice Financial Planning boss Tania Milnes also backed the call to allow couples to pool their super funds.\n\"A joint super account might allow both parties to save on fees and charges, and in many instances would give older women more financial security,\" Ms Milne said.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/anzs-wealth-ceo-calls-for-joint-superannuation-accounts-20151005-gk1yk4"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:59:37.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
