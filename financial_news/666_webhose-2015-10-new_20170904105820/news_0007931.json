Walmart clocked $12.2 billion in e-commerce sales in fiscal 2015, a growth rate of 22% year-over-year.\nAccording to C. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s CEO (chief executive officer), the company is among the three largest online retailers in terms of web traffic, with the Walmart US app in the “top three apps in retail.”\n\nMarket expansion Over the next three years, Walmart is looking to scale up its online presence in more markets and increase its product assortment. It has already introduced grocery pickup service in 20 US markets and hopes to operate the model in another 20 markets next year.\nThe company reported a significant increase in pickup traffic from its neighborhood store formats this year, according to comments by Greg Foran, president and chief executive officer of Walmart US.\nProduct assortment Walmart’s availability of products online is also increasing exponentially. The company has 7 million products currently available on its website and plans to take the number to 10 million by the end of the year. In the future, product availability is expected to number in the tens of millions, according to Neil Ashe, CEO of Global e-Commerce, Walmart.\nWalmart’s also looking to introduce a marketplace model in the future. It’s also testing the unlimited Shipping Pass program, a competitor to Amazon Prime (AMZN).\nBottom-line impact While these initiatives are certainly beneficial to Walmart’s top line, their impact is less discernible on profitability. Margins in the grocery business are notoriously thin. Coupled with the high costs initially associated with investments in digital and distribution, Walmart anticipates that its e-commerce business will stay unprofitable until at least fiscal 2019, although the losses are expected to progressively decline.\nOnline players like Amazon (AMZN) and JD.com (JD) have been earning low margins. Walmart’s operating income margin in the trailing 12 months came in at 5.4% compared to 3.2% for Kroger (KR), 0.8% for Amazon, and -1.9% for JD.com.\nWalmart, Amazon, and Kroger together make up 1.9% of the portfolio holdings of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Walmart Stock Suffers as the Company Slashes Earnings Outlook Part 2 - Can Walmart Achieve Its Three-Year Revenue Growth Target?
