The MyHealth app , which launched in August 2014, allows members to submit medical claims more quickly and easily than ever before. Using only the MyHealth app, members simply provide a few key details about their claim, take a photo of their medical invoices and press ‘Submit’. Other key features of the MyHealth app include access to a member’s latest policy documents so they can check their cover at any time, even if they are not connected to the internet. Assistance features such as ‘Find a hospital’ can be used to locate hospitals nearby, in whatever country the insured member happens to be in, while GPS technology has been harnessed to provide directions to the hospital selected. Likewise, there is fast access to local emergency services’ numbers on a country by country basis, while the ‘Medical term translator’ is a useful tool that shows key medical terms in 17 different languages. Commenting on the success of the app, Susan Landers, Head of Market Management at Allianz Worldwide Care said: “We are really pleased with the interest in the MyHealth app and whilst we had anticipated significant uptake, its success has exceeded all expectations. In just one year, digital claims submissions have overtaken traditional post submissions. “With a globally mobile client base, accustomed to operating in a digital landscape, it was a natural step for Allianz Worldwide Care to enhance itsservice offering for members. The early response to the MyHealth app is a clear demonstration of the demand for digital services and we will continue to provide even greater value and convenience to our clients through this exciting medium.” Allianz Worldwide Care’s MyHealth app is available for free download from the App Storeand Google Play and can be used on a range of smartphones and tablets.
