He said this week that he would fight hard to get a better EU deal for Britain and that he would make sure the country never signed up to the EU's stated goal of \"ever closer union\". \nThe debate about Britain's membership in the EU is heating up, as Cameron seeks to renegotiate its terms ahead of a referendum he has promised by the end of 2017. \nHe has said the renegotiation was \"bloody hard work\" and refused to rule out campaigning for a British exit if other EU leaders failed to grant him the concessions he wants. \nHe says he will announce his final position only after negotiations. He personally favours Britain staying in a reformed EU but would \"not be heartbroken\" to leave.
