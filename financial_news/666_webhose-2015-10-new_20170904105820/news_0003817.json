A 401(k) loan can appear to be a good option because the interest rates are relatively low, but the ramifications can put you in a jam: if you leave your job for any reason, the loan must be repaid back quickly -- within 60 days. If you are under 59.5 years old and miss that mark, you'll typically be on the hook for a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the outstanding loan amount, plus federal and state income tax on the distribution. \nWhen 401(k) Loans Are a Good Option More Headlines Deadly Selfie Sticks Banned From These Tourist Attractions \nThe lower interest rates make these loan an attractive option, especially for people planning to pay down their credit cards, which typically carry rates into the teens. \n“For those really serious about paying off credit card debt, by all means, take the 401(k) loan, pay off credit card debt and repay yourself,” said Bill DeShurko, a portfolio manager at Covestor, the online investing marketplace and President of 401 Advisor, a registered investment advisor in Centerville, Ohio. \nWhile the terms for each plan varies, the rate on a 401(k) loan is “usually a few percentage points above the prime rate, which is currently 3.25% ,\" said Canon Hickman, a regional director at Equity Concepts, a Richmond, Va.-based investment and financial services company. One benefit is that the interest payments “will go back” to the individual once the entire loan is repaid. \n“It's also helpful for short-term needs if you can't qualify for a traditional loan,” he said. “Since there's no underwriting process, getting the money you need isn't limited by your credit score.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:26:59.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
