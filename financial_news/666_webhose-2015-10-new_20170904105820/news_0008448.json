In January, a Bloomberg survey of economists projected yields would climb through the course of 2015 as the Fed ended its zero-rate policy. Instead, the benchmark yield is declining as investors question how quickly the central bank can move against a backdrop of slowing deflation and a stuttering global economy.\n“I can only see deflation pressures” in the U.S., said Yusuke Ito, a senior investor at Tokyo-based Mizuho Asset Management, which oversees $29 billion. “The expectation that the world economy is going to recover is receding.” Long-term Treasuries are the best bet in the market, he said.\nTreasuries were little changed Friday with the 10-year note yield at 2.05 percent as of 11:27 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 2 percent security due in August 2025 was 99 19/32. The yield dropped to a five-week low of 2.01 percent Thursday. It will decline to 1.80 percent by year-end, Ito said.\nWeekly Advance The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index has gained 0.7 percent this week as of Thursday, the steepest advance in about a month and an half. The gauge is up 1.9 percent this year.\nThe difference between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer prices, has shrunk to 1.47 percentage points from this year’s high of 1.97 set in April.\nAverage hourly earnings growth slowed to 0.2 percent in September, from 0.3 percent the previous month, based on a Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department issues its monthly employment report Friday. Job gains quickened to 197,000 from 140,000, based on the responses.\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said Thursday risks to the economy from developments abroad haven’t worsened and domestic conditions remain positive, while repeating his call to raise interest rates this year.\nThere’s a 43 percent chance the Fed will move by its Dec. 15-16 meeting, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg. The odds are 52 percent by the January meeting. The calculation is based on the assumption that the effective fed funds rate will average 0.375 percent after liftoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:50:16.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
