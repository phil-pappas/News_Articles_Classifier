Jason Oxenham by James Frost New Zealand's $27 billion sovereign wealth fund has continued to outshine its Australian counterparts after its chief investment officer Matt Whineray was ranked the seventh most powerful investor in a global list of 100.\nThe Power 100 list from the Connecticut-based Chief Investment Officer magazine is a Who's Who of the investment world and this year the list includes ten women.\nThe list regularly features the top investment managers at storied Ivy League endowment funds and secretive Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds who control a combined $US9.8 trillion in assets between them.\nNZ Super CIO Whineray said he was humbled to be recognised for his work alongside many other leading CIOs before cheerfully noting that the number #7 was also the number of All Blacks captain Richie McCaw.\nThe Power 100 list from Chief Investment Officer magazine includes ten women this year. Jessica Shapiro NZ Super's Whineray and his CEO Adrian Orr are the driving forces behind $27 billion fund designed to fund the nation's universal pension system with an allocation to equities that is roughly double the Future Fund's .\nAmong the other highly regarded mangers from the region to collect a gong were the Future Fund's Raphael Arndt at #16, Australian Super's Mark Delaney at #28, UniSuper's John Pearce at #43 and First State Super's Richard Brandweiner at #54.\nThe Australian Future Fund's well respected managing director and former CIO David Neal was ranked #2 on the 2013 list and #6 in 2012.\nRecent portfolio updates from both the Future Fund and NZ Super highlighted a stark difference in approach to asset allocation .\n Over the last one, three and five years to September 30 the Future Fund delivered returns of 12.8 per cent, 13.8 per cent and 11.1 per cent compared to NZ Super's 5.1 per cent, 15.34 per cent and 13.47 per cent\nChief Investment Officer magazine editor Kip McDaniel said that the publication tweaked the process this year to score candidates across five sectors including innovation, collaboration, talent development, fund size and tenure as an asset owner.\nThis year's winner was David Swensen of Yale Investment's Office with a score of 82 out of 100. Swensen was ranked #18 in the magazine's 2014 survey. Editor Kip McDaniel said that Swensen was clearly too far down the list in previous years.\nOther investors to round out the top five placings were Canadian Pension Plan CEO Mark Wiseman at #2, Denmark ATP's Henrik Gade Jepsen at #3, Teacher Retirement System of Texas' Britt Harris and United Technologies Robin Diamonte at #5.\nAmong the many other globally recognised funds to be recognised are the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Singapore's Temasek International, Princeton University, Japan's GPIF, the Gates Foundation, Columbia University, Kuwait's Investment Authority and the world's largest pension fund CALPERs.\nFor the full Power 100 list from Chief Investment Officer magazine click here .", "external_links": ["http://www.ai-cio.com/lists/power-100-2015.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:04:38.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
