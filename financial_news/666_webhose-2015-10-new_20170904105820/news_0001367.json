The scheme is now likely to progress in stages, over years, to accommodate Berlin under a European Commission proposal expected later this month.\nEU leaders had not planned to make any direct reference to the deposit guarantee scheme, as under the draft conclusions of the EU summit, seen by Reuters, they only said:\n\"The European Council took stock of the discussions on the Presidents' report on completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union. It asked for work to be intensified on all aspects, stressing the importance of completing the Banking Union.\"\nBut the reference to completing the banking union was already too much for Berlin and it had to be removed from the final version of the conclusions, EU diplomats said.
