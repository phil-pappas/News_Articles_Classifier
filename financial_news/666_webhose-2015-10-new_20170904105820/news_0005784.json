(NAPS) Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 4:44 am | Updated: 12:30 am, Sat Oct 17, 2015. Selective Service Registration: It's Patriotic, Required And Smart By NAPS, North American Precis Syndicate Moscow-Pullman Daily News \n(NAPSI)—When a young man turns 18, he is required by law to register with the Selective Service System. This applies to almost all male U.S. citizens and immigrants living in the U.S. who are 18 through 25. It’s not only something men have to do; for many, it’s something they’re glad to do to show their appreciation for their country. This can be especially true for immigrants. \nNoncitizens \nThe obligation for young men to register with the Selective Service upon turning 18 applies to legal and undocumented immigrant residents and refugees. Selective Service does not collect any information about immigration status. Dual nationals of the U.S. and another country are required to register, regardless of where they live, because they are U.S. nationals. In fact, any male noncitizen who lives in the U.S. before his 26 th birthday must register except those who are in the U.S. on student or visitor visas or part of a diplomatic or trade mission. \nWhat If You Don’t Register? \nA man who fails to register could face a fine of up to $250,000 and prison for as much as five years. \nIn addition: \n• Registration with the Selective Service is a requirement for U.S. citizenship for men who first immigrated to the U.S. before their 26 th birthday. \n• Men who should register and don’t can’t qualify for federal student loans or grant programs. This includes Pell Grants, College Work-Study, Guaranteed Student PLUS Loans and National Direct Student Loans. \n• Federal job training programs under the Workforce Investment Act are open only to men who have registered. \n• A man must be registered to be eligible for jobs with the federal government and the U.S. Postal Service. \n• Some states require proof of registration before you can get a driver’s license. \nWhere To Register \nFortunately, registration has been made increasingly convenient. You can go to a U.S. post office to get a Selective Service registration card or register online at www.sss.gov . Many students can even register through their high school guidance departments. \nHow To Learn More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:19:18.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
