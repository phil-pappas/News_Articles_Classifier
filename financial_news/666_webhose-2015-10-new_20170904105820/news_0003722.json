Don't believe them.\" \nInstead he promised a new regime that would include better access to himself and senior oil managers in Iran. \n\"Think long-term and work directly with us. Corruption will be revealed eventually and will ruin both your business and credibility.\" \nIran's ageing and under-tapped oil industry is desperate for foreign technology and funding. \nA mere one-percent increase in efficiency would bring in $400 billion in added value, according to Gholam Reza Manouchehri, the chairman of Monday's event. \nAfter next month's Tehran conference, Iran will hold an international event on February 22-24 in London, by when all nuclear-related sanctions should have been lifted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:47:01.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
