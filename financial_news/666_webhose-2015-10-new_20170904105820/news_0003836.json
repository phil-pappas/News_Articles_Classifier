Motif Investing constantly looks for “trends, ideas and world events that could create an investment opportunity,” and then picks 10 to 30 related stocks to build portfolios around, weighing them based on their exposure to the coinciding idea, event or trend. Motif Investing have developed an equity portfolio that provides exposure to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and other large companies with \"lots of likes\" on their Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ) fan pages. A Barometer For The Social Media Era \nThe people behind the creation of the Lots of Likes motif explained what they were thinking at the time they constructed the portfolio. \n\"Popularity isn't just for angst-ridden teens. Businesses have their eye on wooing Facebook’s 1.11 billion users, who give out 4.5 billion 'likes,' along with more than 10 billion messages every day. Companies representing the 50 most-\"liked\" brands on Facebook had 1.3 billion likes as of June 2013,\" the site explains. \nThe stocks in this portfolio represent the top 20 liked brands on Facebook. Taking into consideration that Facebook generates 8 percent of all global page views, \"an aggressive social media strategy does have its advantages.\" Performance And Allocation \nThe Lots of Likes motif has managed to beat the S&P over the past year, having returned about 18.6 percent, versus the S&P’s 2.4 percent surge. In the past month, the portfolio has risen 6.5 percent, also outperforming the S&P index by nearly 3 percent. \nIn terms of allocation, only 18.1 percent of the portfolio's assets are destined to technology stocks. The remaining 81.9 percent of the assets is placed on consumer products and services stocks. \nAs for individual stocks, allocation goes as follows: 13.0 percent: The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO ) 12.8 percent: Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE ) 8.5 percent: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) 7.0 percent: McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD ) 6.3 percent: Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ) 5.8 percent: Yum!
