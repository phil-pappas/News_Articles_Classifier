Global regulators finalise new capital rule for big insurers Reuters - UK Focus â€“ 17 minutes ago \n* Nine top global insurers required to converse more capital \n* Raises question of whether companies might need to raise cash \n* Some insurers dispute need for new rules (Adds more detail) \nBy Huw Jones \nLONDON, Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) 5 (Reuters) - The world's nine biggest insurance companies will have to hold more capital under new rules finalised by global regulators that aim to prevent taxpayer bailouts of the industry in a crisis. \nRegulators decided to look at the multi-trillion dollar insurance industry following the massive public rescue of insurer AIG in the United States during the 2007-2009 financial crisis after a foray into risky credit default swaps. \nAt the request of the Group of 20 economies (G20), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) has designed a two-part capital requirement for the nine companies, whose collapse could wreak havoc in global markets. \nThey include AIG, Prudential Financial (NYSE: PJH - news ) and MetLife from the United States, Allianz from Germany, Britain's Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) and Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) , Ping An (HKSE: 2318-OL.HK - news ) Insurance of China, Italy's Generali (Swiss: ASG.SW - news ) , and Axa (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) of France. \nThe insurers will not have to make public their extra capital buffer until 2019. As with new banking capital rules, investors are however likely to want to know if a company is strong enough to comply early without having to raise fresh capital. \nSome U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . insurance supervisors have questioned the need for global capital rules at all, saying national rules are adequate and insurers don't pose risks in the same way as banks. \nThe IAIS said the first capital cushion, known as the basic capital requirement, will effectively be what each of the nine insurers are already required to hold under national law. \nA consultation had initially proposed that the basic capital requirement, to be phased in over three years from 2016, should be at least 75 percent of the national requirement. \nThe second capital buffer, known as higher loss absorbency (HLA), will be on average 10 percent of the basic requirement, depending on the riskiness of a company's operations, the IAIS said in a statement. \nThis has been scaled back from an original proposal for an HLA buffer, composed mainly of equity capital and retained earnings, that was on average 12-13 percent of the basic one. \nThe IAIS said total capital held by the nine insurers in the past two years averaged 260 percent of what they need to meet BCR and HLA requirements. \nAlthough indicating a healthy surplus, it also puts pressure on insurers to maintain a fat buffer of capital above their minimum requirements. \nIn the European Union, insurers must meet new EU capital rules known as Solvency II from January but it will be up to Brussels to decide if these requirements are \"equivalent\" to just the BCR, or the BCR and HLA combined. \nAll nine must formally meet their combined capital requirements from 2019 under finalised rules which G20 leaders are due to formally endorse next month at a summit in Turkey. \nThe G20's regulatory task force, the Financial Stability Board, is due next month to update its list of insurance companies deemed to be systemically important. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is not expected to say until 2016 whether big re-insurers like Munich Re should also be included, an omission that has raised eyebrows of some regulators. \n(Editing by Jane Merriman and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:48:14.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
