L.P. KKR might be turning to Africa as its next hotspot for private equity investments. As per Reuters, the company is expected to invest approximately $100 million in the continent over the next year.\n\nWhy Africa? \n\nAfrica is experiencing a demographic shift, wherein a rising middle class population is driving demand for infrastructure, consumer discretionary, financial services, etc. The shift primarily comes on the back of a booming urban population with higher disposable income. As such, investment in companies that support these facilities is likely to benefit private equity firms like KKR.\n\nAdditionally, according to data from the International Monetary Fund, over 50% of the world’s fastest growing economies belong to Africa. These include Nigeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia, among others. Such data hints that potential for investment in the region is high.\n\nBesides, a steep fall in commodity prices has weakened the African currencies, making investments cheaper for private equity firms.\n\nTarget Investment Areas \n\nDominique Lafont, senior advisor at KKR, had informed that the company is “not limited to one sector”, but is targeting diverse areas like agriculture, energy, infrastructure, and food business in Africa. Further, Nigeria will likely serve as the regional hub for KKR.\n\nNotably, Lafont, who has previously worked with Bolloré Africa Logistics, Africa’s largest ports and logistics network, was appointed by KKR in Jul 2015 to plan investments for the company in Africa.\n\nOthers in the space \n\nApart from KKR, private equity firms like The Blackstone Group L.P. BX and The Carlyle Group LP CG are also eyeing opportunities in Africa. Moreover, per a Wall Street Journal report, the New York State Common Retirement Fund, a U.S.-based pension fund, will reportedly invest close to 3% of its total assets in Africa.\n\nAs per data compiled by the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, private equity investments in the continent reached $8.1 billion in 2014, close to its pre-crisis level of $8.3 billion in 2007.\n\nKKR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Monroe Capital Corporation MRCC is a better-ranked stock in the same industry, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
