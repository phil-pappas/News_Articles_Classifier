Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Joe Hockey desperately wanted to remain Australia's treasurer. Well before the bitter end, virtually none of his colleagues agreed with him.\nHockey still gets a very decent consolation prize – at a convenient distance from Canberra – in Washington D.C. Almost everyone in politics, on both sides, also suddenly wanted to be nice rather than nasty as he gave his valedictory speech from Parliament after nearly 20 years. Tony Abbott should be so lucky.\nBut the quick exit of the once-treasurer is not just a marker of how enthusiastically the country as well as the party has moved on from the Abbott-Hockey era. It also means the Labor Party is busily trying to define the new Treasurer as a \"rookie\" who's also not up to the job of Australia's economic management. For now, at least, Scott Morrison is seen as a more vulnerable target than smooth St Malcolm.\nAdmittedly, complaints about Morrison's supposed inadequacies require a breathtaking lack of self-reflection on the part of the opposition about its own fiscal failings. Morrison is always very keen to remind Labor of these, particularly the contrast between its own record and commitments and its inability to cut spending. He's only likely to get better at doing so.\nFormer treasurer Joe Hockey leaves Parliament House after his valedictory speech with son Iggy and daughter Adelaide. Andrew Meares But it does reflect the most obvious risk for what is effectively a new government and a new Treasurer who, despite his sense of confidence, really does have his training wheels on in terms of economic management.\nThat's trickier to manoeuvre when the domestic economy is still sputtering along below-trend. Changing that is most unlikely to come from a sudden surge of strong growth internationally. The risk is the reverse. No matter the potential benefits flowing from new trade agreements like the China free-trade deal, Australia's return to robust economic health requires changes in domestic policy and vigorous momentum from governments, businesses and individuals. The longer the lack persists, the harder it becomes to catch up.\nClear direction critical As Citi economist Paul Brennan told a Citi conference on Wednesday, this is not just a short-term challenge and Australia in future has to \"make its own luck\". As well as a required but difficult lift in productivity, he argues more focus on areas like financing infrastructure and tax don't square easily with any suggestion of a return to budget surplus by the end of the decade.\n That's even without Hockey's helpful parting suggestions advocating a top personal income tax rate of 40 per cent cutting in at a much higher threshold than the current $180,000. (Where were you on this campaign over the last couple of years, Joe?)\nThe softening of the Abbott government's proposed (and blocked) cuts to family tax benefits also show that compromise in the Turnbull era might be sensible, but there's usually a cost to earlier brave budget predictions.\nThat's just when Treasury Secretary John Fraser was telling a parliamentary hearing that the massive build-up in global debt to $57 trillion was a major risk to the global outlook and only made the task of fixing Australia's entrenched budget deficit more urgent.\nHe declared that he was delighted the Harper review of competition policy now seemed to be \"very much back on the table\", along with other reform ideas.\n\"I think the tax reform discussion, whatever you want to call it, has been moving in a very intelligent direction with all parties airing options,\" he said. \"Yeah, I think there's progress.\"\nBut the many contradictions in all those options so happily aired are enough to give any treasurer a constant headache.\nNo early election The government will need to show a clear fiscal direction as well as the detail of some of its new economic policies well ahead of next May's budget.\nIgnore the semi-permanent speculation about calling an early election to get a mandate for policy changes, by the way. The Turnbull government will be intent on proving it can govern competently and provide stability as well as a dash of policy excitement before it wants to face voters.\nPresenting the response to the financial system inquiry as Turnbull government policy, even if this was largely finalised under Abbott, is part of that image. But beyond backing the regulatory pressure on banks to lift levels of capital, the policy changes announced remain either relatively modest or too vague to make much difference.\nSo far, for example, there's no detail on curbing super tax concessions, another area where Hockey belatedly declares himself a convert but where the fight is yet to begin.\nInstead, the adjustments to super are largely restricted to traditional Coalition bugbears on the governance of industry superannuation funds (more independent directors) and ensuring retail funds have more access to the default superannuation market.\nThe current system allows individuals to simply take their employers' agreed default option for their super contributions rather than choose a fund themselves. But that's usually because most people don't feel sufficiently interested or informed to make the choice and so the majority prefer to tick the default fund selected under their award.\nDespite the government's excitable rhetoric on opening up \"closed shops\", there are only a few enterprise agreements that don't allow individuals the ability to choose a different option. Those could – and should – be fixed.\nThe real driver from the retail sector is a determination to compete more easily with industry funds in this $10 billion-a-year default market. But the government has merely asked the Productivity Commission (once again) to develop options for more competitive tenders. For individuals, the main potential advantage is whether this could drive down fees a little more. It doesn't guarantee anything about overall returns – or how workers or small businesses should best judge that.\nMorrison will get back to them on that. And so much else.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:03:54.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
