The company got clearance early last month, making it the first crypto company to go public through the IPO process. All other publicly traded crypto companies took the “back door” route via the reverse merger process. \nShares of Bitcoin Group will debut for trade on November 11 as ASX:BCG. \nThe plans to issue 100 million new shares, at A$0.20 each, raising A$20 million ($14 million) through the offering. \nThe crowdfunding platform has raised $2.96 million (81.5%) of its $3.63 million investment goal. \nBitcoin mining is a high reward, high risk game for investors. Bitcoin prices have a major impact on profitability; unexpected drops can render well-capitalized operation unprofitable overnight.
