Those issues, combined with factors including uncertainty over China’s growth, U.S. interest rates and the global commodities price-slide, have combined to depress profits at European banks. U.S. banks, many of which are in growth mode, are also aggressively targeting and winning business from European rivals.\nStandard Chartered, which focuses on Asia, said in an internal memo that about a quarter of its 4,000 top managers would be notified by the end of November if they were affected by the cuts, which are under way. “We have already acted to reduce management layers, and [as] a result will have up to 25% fewer senior staff,” the bank said in a statement. Staff at managing director level and up are expected to be affected. Shares in the bank rose 4.7% as news of the management cuts emerged.\nIn the past decade, Standard Chartered expanded fast, growing aggressively to number about 86,000 staff around the world. Now, like other European-based lenders, the bank is being forced to rethink its business model to boost returns amid the bleaker global economic outlook and tighter regulation.\nStandard Chartered is under particular pressure given its exposure to a slowdown in emerging markets and the collapse in commodities prices. The bank’s chief executive, Bill Winters, is weighing how the lender can avoid raising equity amid a steep drop in Standard Chartered’s share price, according to people familiar with the matter. In August, the bank cut its dividend in half and Mr. Winters said he was monitoring its South Korea and wider Asian retail business as part of a strategic review. Standard Chartered has also scaled back its lending related to commodities.\nProblems are compounded by a Bank of England “stress test,” which will focus on banks’ exposures to foreign markets. Analysts expect Mr. Winters to outline a plan for the lender before the balance sheet check is published on Dec. 1.\nRelated\nEuropean Banks Set for Bumpy Reporting Season Heard on the Street : Time for Banks to Go Goodwill Hunting Deutsche Bank: Tip of the Iceberg for Cutbacks at European Banks? Standard Chartered has already shed a number of senior roles. V. Shankar, a 13-year Standard Chartered veteran who headed its business in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas, announced he was leaving earlier this year as did the lender’s CEO for Asia, Jaspal Bindra. The bank is also looking for a new head for its Corporate & Institutional Banking unit, to be unveiled soon, according to people familiar with the matter.\nJob cuts loom at other major European banks.\nCredit Suisse Group AG CS 0.98 % is widely expected to make cuts at its investment bank, though the Zurich-based lender is stuck in a holding pattern as employees await the results of a strategic review being conducted by new Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam. Credit Suisse’s investment bank reductions are likely to be focused on the prime brokerage business, which provides services such as loans to hedge funds, and on the providing of structured debt, said Al Alevizakos, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Geographically, Mr. Alevizakos thinks the U.S. will be a focus for cuts, though he doesn’t have an estimate for total head count reduction. A Credit Suisse spokeswoman declined to comment.\nAt Deutsche Bank AG DB 3.35 % some 18,000 employees alone are expected to be shed eventually as Deutsche Bank hives off the Postbank retail operation over the coming years. Further job losses at the German lender’s investment banking division could be announced when the bank’s management outlines its strategy later this month, analysts say.\nNew Barclays Executive Chairman John McFarlane said in August the bank had to focus on its core U.S. and U.K. investment banking businesses and no longer has the scale to compete globally with the now-dominant U.S. investment banks. A Barclays spokesman declined to comment.\nMeanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC continues to slash jobs and exit countries covered by its investment bank. A spokeswoman for RBS declined to comment. The bank cut several high level capital-markets jobs last month.\nWrite to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:10:42.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
