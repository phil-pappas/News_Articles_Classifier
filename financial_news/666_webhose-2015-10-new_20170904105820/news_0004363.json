This will be the first time in the aviation industry a commercial airline will use in-depth game-based instruction with an integrated training approach. \nThe programme, currently in development, will complement the airline’s existing world-class training facilities at the Emirates Aviation College – Crew Training in Dubai. Using a combination of virtual learning content and gamification both online and in classrooms, the new curriculum will allow Emirates’ cabin crew to learn and practice the skills required to ensure the highest levels of safety and service on board. It will facilitate a more immersive learning experience which has been proven to increase knowledge retention by 65% . \nThe science-based learning approach can be customised to support several training modules, increasing operational efficiency at the training college. With the new system, Emirates can better cater to its expanding crew population while maintaining the quality and effectiveness of its training. Aircraft familiarization is among the new content being developed, allowing cabin crew to fully immerse themselves in a virtual walk-through of both the interior and exterior of the aircraft. \nCatherine Baird, Emirates’ Senior Vice President, Cabin Crew Training explains: “We constantly revise our training curriculum to use innovative and cutting-edge learning tools. This is our biggest investment in crew training since we introduced our full-motion, high-fidelity aircraft simulators. As the airline expands, our main goal is being able to cater to our growing crew numbers without compromising our world-class training programme. This new technology will engage our crew and complement their learning, giving them all the skills necessary to deliver our signature service and keeping safety at the heart of our operation.” \nThe growth of Emirates’ cabin crew team has been steadily increasing in line with the arrival of new aircraft and new routes being added to the network. With 16 more aircraft deliveries expected by March 2016, Emirates is hiring over 5,000 new cabin crew this year alone. Today, Emirates has over 20,000 cabin crew from over 135 nationalities that speak more than 60 languages. \n“We’re proud to be working with Emirates in a commercial aviation industry first,” said Bill Toti, President of Cubic Global Defense. “We look forward to helping define a new industry standard in aviation training that focuses on safety and service while incorporating the best in learning science and emerging virtual technology.” \nCubic Global Defense, a business unit of Cubic Corporation, has extensive experience in designing and operating training technology focused in the transportation and defense training markets. They are also developing similar game-based training solutions for the U.S. Navy. \nAbout Emirates Cabin Crew Training \nAll Emirates Cabin Crew are provided with training in a dedicated state-of-the-art facility, at the Emirates Aviation College – Crew Training in Dubai. Training modules include Induction, Safety and Emergency Procedures, First Aid, Security Procedures, Service, Image and Uniform, and Leadership. \nIn 2014 alone, AED73 million was spent on crew training with 4,280 new recruits graduating from the college. \nKapp, KM, John Wiley & Sons, The gamification of learning and instruction: game-based methods and strategies for training and education, 2012 Business & Finance Follow Us IT IS NOT A MISTAKE TO MAKE A MISTAKE BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO REPEAT A MISTAKE By: KWASI ABRAH- YEBOAH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:16:53.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
