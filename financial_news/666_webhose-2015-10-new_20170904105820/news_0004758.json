Additionally, those who have received advance payments for health care premiums need to reconcile by October 15 or risk delays in 2016 subsidies. \nJackson Hewitt Tax Service ® reminds hardworking Americans they don't have to navigate the complex tax codes and health care laws alone. \"We're here to help hardworking Americans make smart decisions related to health care and their taxes,\" said Jackson Hewitt CEO David Prokupek. \nLate filers are reminded that while they received an extension to file, it does not constitute an extension to pay. Any tax balance owed was due on April 15, or is subject to failure-to-pay penalties and interest charges. Jackson Hewitt offers a number of simplified payment options through its Flex-Pay ® program, including direct payment, credit card payment or arrangement of an installment plan with the IRS. \nMedicare Open Enrollment Begins October 15 \nOpen Enrollment for Medicare, a health insurance program for people age 65 or older and disabled individuals, begins on October 15. Current Medicare beneficiaries will have the option to change their health insurance plans with no penalty through December 7. \nNew this year, DirectHealth is working with Jackson Hewitt to staff licensed insurance agents in Walmart stores. These agents will help customers navigate the more than 70,000 Health Exchange plans available to them, as well as help customers over the age of 65 enroll for Medicare. \nFor the third year, Jackson Hewitt is also partnering with GetInsured, a leading innovator in consumer health insurance marketplace technology, to help customers easily compare and shop for a health insurance plan that fits their needs and budget. Through a proprietary Accelerator program, Jackson Hewitt can offer help with Medicaid/CHIP applications at any of their locations. \n\"Through our partnerships with DirectHealth and GetInsured, two Marketplace brokers, Jackson Hewitt clients have the opportunity to enroll in a health insurance plan,\" said Jackson Hewitt CEO David Prokupek. \"Our goal is to help our clients hold on to every hard earned dollar and avoid the tax penalty for not having insurance, which will increase in 2016 to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is greater.\" \nFor those who received a Premium Tax Credit to help reduce, or even eliminate, the cost of monthly health insurance premiums, Form 8962 must be filed by October 15 to reconcile and ensure that they maintain eligibility for premium assistance in 2016. Failure to file by October 15 could result in the delay of 2016 subsidies leading to higher premiums until the 2015 return is filed and processed. \nAbout Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc.
