Nic Walker Share on twitter by Anthony Macdonald The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is concerned APA Group could increase rents on its east coast gas infrastructure and access information to the disadvantage of rivals should it buy the Iona Gas Plant in Victoria.\nIn a statement on Friday morning, ACCC chairman Rod Sims said the proposed acquisition would see APA own most of the gas storage options for Victorian gas customers.\n\"The ACCC's preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in the supply of gas storage services to customers in Victoria,\" Mr Sims said.\n\"The proposed acquisition, by giving APA access to more complete information along the supply chain, may allow APA to increase transmission and storage charges as compared to an alternative acquirer of Iona.\n\"The same access to information may also place APA in an advantageous position compared to other market participants competing for the development of pipeline augmentations.\"\nThe comments came as the ACCC released a statement of issues and called for gas industry players to provide their views by October 15.\nThe ACCC reserved the right to study the acquisition for another month, setting a November 5 decision date.\nAPA made a conditional offer to acquire Iona on Wednesday, after a three-month sale process undertaken current owner EnergyAustralia.\n A spokesman for APA said: \"We are confident that the issues raised by the ACCC are able to be dealt with fully and intend to engage further with the ACCC to prove our position\".\nIt's not the first time an acquisition from APA has been closely scrutinised by the ACCC.\nAPA Group chief executive Mick McCormack publicly expressed his frustration with the ACCC as recently as last month, telling shareholders: \"I can't get out of bed without the ACCC sending something to me\".\n\"As to any substance in their inquiries [at Iona], I'm sure they'll come back with a blank sheet,\" he added, when addressing analysts and investors on a results call in August.\nEnergyAustralia and adviser Lazard will have to decide whether to accept APA's conditional offer and hope for a successful outcome with the competition regulator, or sell the gas plant to another buyer.\nThe 23-petajoule Iona plant is one of only three gas storage sites available for use by third parties in an east coast market where gas demand is set to triple within two years because of the start-up of LNG exports from Gladstone.\nWith a capacity of 500 terajoules a day of gas, Iona has contracts with seven retailers and power generators, including AGL, Origin Energy and Snowy Hydro's Red Energy. EnergyAustralia, the country's third-biggest electricity and gas retailer after Origin Energy and AGL Energy, will have a contract to use capacity at the plant even after the planned sale.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/amacfirst"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:52.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
