China has held the men’s world team title for most of the century, each time winning it by pushing Japan into runner-up status.\nMaybe this year will be different. Or maybe it won’t.\nThe Japanese team held an edge over China throughout the superpowers’ direct clash in a qualification round of the 2015 World Gymnastics Championships on Sunday. They have to wait until the team final on Wednesday to see if they can extend it.\nRelated\nU.S. Women Gymnasts Qualify for Rio Olympics, Though in Mixed Fashion Debate Stirs Over Gymnastics’ ‘Two-per-Country’ Rule USA Gymnastics Prepares for Its Biggest Test Before Rio (Oct. 9, 2015) Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman Take Another Leap at Olympic Glory (July 27, 2015) China notched strong scores on parallel bars and rings in particular Sunday while Japan performed especially well on parallel bars, vault and the high bar.\nTension rose for the Japanese during their floor exercise rotation. Judges took 11 minutes to deliver a low score for Naoto Hayaska, who had struggled on complex tumbling passes. The delay left Uchimura, five-time world champion and 2012 Olympic all-around winner, standing on the side, having put back on his warm-up wear.\nWhen Uchimura finally competed, he came to his knees after a double twisting-double back salto. He left the floor rubbing his neck after struggling on another element.\nThe fall took him out of contention for the floor exercise final, though he remains the leading individual all-around finisher in qualifications so far. Compatriot Kenzo Shirai, performing next, posted an extremely high score of more than 16 points.\nUchimura said later that he felt the impact of getting cold in the second part of the routine, but that he was fine now. He also said he was more concerned about getting the team gold medal than another all-around title for himself. Asked what would have to happen to do so, he said that he had never beaten China, so wouldn’t know.\nThe China-Japan fight for gold is taking place almost entirely separately from a fierce tussle among half a dozen other teams for the bronze medal.\nThe British men, who opened the qualifying competition Sunday, recovered from a rough start on the high bar and displayed their considerable strength on pommel horse.\nRussia struggled, with star Denis Abliazin losing control of his floor exercise, falling once and going out of bounds twice. The entire team had some kind of difficulty on that apparatus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:20:09.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
