A single person earning £26,500 — the average UK wage — generates £3,180 in income tax and £2,213 in national insurance. \nThe Sunday Times report can be seen here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:21:44.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
