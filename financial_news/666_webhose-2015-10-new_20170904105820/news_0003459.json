Share on twitter by John Davidson Aaugh! That's the sound Charlie Brown makes, every time Lucy snatches away the football he's try to place kick and he tumbles heels over head.\nIt's the sound I make, too, every time I go to use a feature on Samsung's new Gear S2 smart watch, and Samsung snatches that feature away.\nThe Gear S2 is Samsung's sixth or seventh attempt at a smart watch (depending on how you count them), a smart watch that, like most previous Samsung watches, runs the open-source Tizen operating system rather than the Android Wear you find on most other smart watches designed to work with Android phones.\nAnd thanks to its wonderful round face and sharp screen; thanks to its excellent, three-day battery life (or four days, or two, depending on how much you use it); thanks to the fact it's the first Samsung watch to work with non-Samsung Android phones; and thanks to the very intuitive rotating bezel around the face of the watch, which you spin around to see messages and select apps and options on the watch, the Gear S2 is easily Samsung's best smart watch to date.\nThough in some ways it's also Samsung's least ambitious watch to date, with dramatically fewer features than its predecessor the Gear S.That's mostly a good thing, both for ease of use and for the battery life of the watch, but it does takes the simplification a little too far at times, in a very Lucy-like fashion.\nDisappearing options Want to add a new app to your Gear S2 watch? There's an option on the watch to do that, which you can easily navigate to on the Gear S2's rotating bezel interface. But touch on the option and … aaugh! It's snatched away. \"Download Gear apps using your phone,\" the watch tells you.\nWant to add a new buddy to your watch? The Gear S2 has a favourite contacts list, quite like the one on Apple's watch, that lets you quickly chose a contact so you can send a message or initiate a call. But select \"Add to list\" on your watch and … aaugh! It's taken away. \"Add buddy on your phone,\" the watch says.\n Once you've created a buddy back on your phone, you can then choose to call that contact or send a message. Making a call is simple. Rotate the bezel on the front of the watch until your contact is highlighted, click on the green phone icon, select which of your contact's numbers you want to call, and … aaugh! The call gets snatched away from you. \"Making call on your phone,\" the Gear S2 tells you.\nGood grief!\nI wouldn't mind it so much except that, after almost two weeks of wearing it, I've become rather attached to the Gear S2, and I want it to be perfect.\nThe S2 overcomes the biggest bugbear I have with most other smart watches – the need to charge them every night – and it does a very decent job of showing messages as they arrive on your smart phone, obviating the need to get your phone from your bag most of the time.\nIncoming messages are very well suited to the round interface of the watch, which takes the metaphor offered by the round face and the round dial surrounding the face, and uses it to very good effect.\nCustomisable experience You can think of the Gear S2 as having multiple faces, you see, all of them arranged in a circle just like the watch itself. The main time display is on one face, which you can customise to your heart's content till it gives you just the information you want, using the colours you want, the hands you want, and the complications (additional information areas) you want, just like you can on an Apple Watch.\nRotate the bezel clockwise, and you get to your apps – things such as the step counter and the weather, that you probably won't end up using very much, given you can usually add your favourite apps as complications on the main face.\nRotate the bezel counter-clockwise, and it gets you to your incoming notifications, with one face devoted to each type of message (SMS, email, chat etc). It's a really simple, really fast way to organise all that data and it works really well.\nBut it's not quite enough. Where the Gear S went so far as to have its own SIM so you could make calls even when you'd left your phone at home, the Gear S2 doesn't even have its own speaker, so you can't use it as a phone at all. When you try to, Samsung just snatches that feature away, telling you to go use your phone instead.\nWhere's the fun in that?\nOne of my favourite uses for a smart watch is to take calls when I can't get to my phone before it rings off, most commonly because it's lost inside some pocket inside some bag inside some room of my house. With other smart watches I can talk into my watch, and either have a whole conversation or, more commonly, tread water with the caller until I can find my phone.\nBut there's none of that with the Gear S2. A call comes in, and you can answer it with the watch and activate the phone's microphone, for sure, but you still have to find your phone before you can begin to have a conversation. With no speaker on the watch and no way of hearing what the other party is saying, what can you say in a conversation like that?\nI know one thing you can say.\nAaugh!", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DLLabs"], "published": "2015-10-26T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:10:22.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
