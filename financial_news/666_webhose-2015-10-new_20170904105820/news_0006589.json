If the licenses fail to attract $3.3 billion in bids, then Dish will pay the difference, the official said.\nWalking away from the spectrum isn’t a top option for Dish Chief Executive Officer Charlie Ergen, who has amassed a $50 billion treasure chest of spectrum. That strategy has been key to his plan to shift from a satellite-TV provider in decline to a formidable wireless network operator that will compete with Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. in services like mobile video.\nDish has been fighting for the small-business discount because spending the extra money on airwaves means there’s less cash to spend on acquisitions to create a mobile network. It may also lead the company to take on more debt, which would put pressure on its credit rating, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Moody’s Investors Service said in August it may lower Dish’s rating -- already three levels below investment grade. Paying the $3.3 billion would represent “a significant drain on liquidity and leveraging event,” Moody’s said.\nDish has said it followed the auction’s rules, and in September SNR and Northstar asked a court to overturn the FCC’s decision. Arguments are due after the new year in the case filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nDuring an Aug. 5 conference call, Ergen blamed the FCC for its unwillingness to give Dish the discount, saying the lack of support from the government is dissuading his company from pursuing big takeover deals and competing with large phone companies. He said he may even consider splitting the company in half -- one side would include the satellite-TV business and the other would comprise airwaves that could be sold or leased with some tax advantages. Still, he added, he would prefer to pursue his wireless ambitions.", "external_links": ["http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db1001/DA-15-1109A1.pdf\\", "http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db1001/DA-15-1108A1.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:19:20.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
