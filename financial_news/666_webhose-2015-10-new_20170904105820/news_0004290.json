Lisa Wiltse Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Su-Lin Tan Asian parents often joke that their children are their superannuation plan.\nThere is more truth in that than myth after developer Sunbright Development Australia launched Tao Home, an independent living residential project in Melbourne for Chinese seniors in response to demand from migrants wanting to buy homes for their parents.\nThe 82 apartments, at 19-21 Poplar Street in Box Hill, will be equipped with Chinese satellite TV connection, universal power plugs for Chinese appliances and its hallmark feature, a Fotile kitchen rangehood to accommodate Chinese stir-frying.\nOn the ground floor, there will be a centre for playing mahjong, a popular Chinese tile game, and a traditional Chinese wellbeing centre.\nBathrooms will have safety grab rails and there will also be optional joinery on the balcony for a wet kitchen, another Asian home feature.\n\"The Chinese have a very strong cultural DNA to look after parents but young Chinese-Australians don't necessarily want to live with their parents, so this project is another way to keep them close but not too close,\" Tao Home architect, Hayball's Eugene Chieng said.\nIt was the brainchild of the owner of Sunbright, a Beijing-based hotel developer, who was having some disagreements with his live-in parents.\n\"We joked about converting this building to a home for the developer's parents, that's where it started,\" Mr Chieng said.\n Chinese immigration to Australia is the highest after those from the UK and New Zealand. More than 20 per cent residents in Box Hill have Chinese ancestry, based on the last census.\nWhile the project is targeted at Chinese migrants who bring their parents into Australia with them, it is open to everyone.\n\"It's also a great investment especially for leasing to Asian renters,\" marketing agent Castran Gilbert's Michael Lang said.\n\"While there's a slant towards the Chinese community, anyone can live here. It's aimed at local Australians not residents from Shanghai or Guangzhou.\"\n\"The council approved it because they said, 'hey, here's something different finally'.\"\nThe complex will have one- and two-bedroom apartments priced from $325,000 to $630,000 as well as dual-key apartments which combine a one-bedroom with a studio apartment.\nLaunched two weeks ago, 40 per cent of the units have already been sold and Sunbright have plans for more projects in Balwyn or Glen Waverley, Mr Lang added.\n\"We've noticed an increased number of buyers looking at large double-storey houses with the intention of having aged parents live downstairs. So yes, Tao Home concept is definitely something that will get more popular,\" Australia's Chinese property website ACProperty.com.au's Esther Yong said.\nAn interested buyer, Mrs Yu, who visited Tao Home with her children said its proximity to local Asian grocery stores was appealing as was the tai-chi area on the roof of the building.\nConstruction will begin this year with completion due in 2017.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/103218209259241103549", "https://twitter.com/SuLin_Tan"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:09:37.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
