Luis Ascui Share on twitter by David Ramli Supermarket giant Coles and online retailer Kogan have become the latest companies to sell self-branded mobile services to their large base of customers.\nColes and Singtel-Optus partnered to launch Cole Prepaid on Monday morning, while Vodafone Hutchison Australia joined forces with Kogan to launch a new mobile service that sells low-cost services with 3G data.\nThey are the latest in a series of attempts by established brands to sell mobile services, insurance and other non-traditional products to their pool of customers, after Woolworths joined forces with Telstra in June .\nSome companies believe signing up their customers for more products such as insurance or telecommunications services will make them more loyal to the brand. The move could potentially force Telstra, Optus and Vodafone Australia to increase the amount of data being made available to customers.\nKogan Mobile will be available for sale only from the company's websites. Unlike most other mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) such as Amaysim, however, its network, provisioning and customer service will be provided entirely by Vodafone Australia.\nBut the service could struggle to gain traction if customers remain angry over Kogan's previous effort to sell mobile services that ended in 2013 with 120,000 customers in the lurch when its supplier went into receivership. It will also lack access to 4G services until at least early 2016.\nKogan chief executive Ruslan Kogan said he thought customers would support the new service.\n\"The way we view the past is a bit like The Lion King ,\" he said, referencing Disney's animated children's movie. \"Scar was bad, made Simba leave but that doesn't mean Simba shouldn't come back when the time is right.\"\n Kogan Mobile executive director David Shafer said on Monday that customers had not been out of pocket from the experience and insisted this service was different because it was being provided almost entirely by Vodafone Australia.\n\"Yes, it was inconvenient for them to have a SIM [card] swap out but nobody lost any money, we refunded all of the customers all of the unused credit,\" he said. \"The customers themselves have been inundating us with questions about when we're returning.\n\"Last time we were one of the fastest-growing mobile services in the country and there's no reason why this time we won't grow even faster.\"\nKogan Mobile's plans start from $29.95 a month with unlimited calls, text messages and 3GB of data on Vodafone Australia's 3G network. It will also offer one-year prepaid deals that will eventually be moved onto 4G services at an unspecified date in 2016.\nThe lack of 4G services could be a problem for customers wanting to join Kogan. Rival mobile reseller Amaysim suffered a dramatic slowdown in customer growth in 2014 because it was one of the only large providers to be stuck on 3G services .\nKogan Mobile's plans are much cheaper than those offered directly by Vodafone Australia, which has been attempting to improve its brand perception to compete against the likes of Telstra and Singtel-Optus.\nUsing Kogan as the sales front for low-cost services allows it to use up excess mobile network capacity without making its own brand appear cheap.\nVodafone Australia chief executive Inaki Berroeta told Fairfax Media that Kogan should not be seen as a second brand for the telco giant. He declined to state whether his company owned any equity in the new mobile service, citing commercial confidentiality.\n\"We saw an opportunity to market to Kogan customers, who are very loyal to Kogan, and also through an online business that telcos have not traditionally developed a lot – and that includes us,\" he said.\nTPG Telecom recently signed a deal to move its mobile customers onto the Vodafone Australia network, and Mr Berroeta said he had not told other customers about the new Kogan deal before its public announcement. Kogan Mobile's prices are lower than those offered by TPG Telecom.\n\"In this market there's always a certain level of overlap and there's also overlap with our own brand,\" he said. \"But we are very careful to choose partners that don't conflict on the main ... so we don't think this causes any problems.\"\nColes Prepaid is designed with two main plans. The first is a $10-for-10-days plan that comes with 400 megabytes of data, unlimited calls and unlimited texts designed mainly for tourists visiting Australia on short trips.\nThe second is a pay-as-you-go service that costs $10 and lasts 60 days a recharge. It charges 12¢ for each text message, megabyte of downloads and minute of phone calls.\n\"We're excited we can offer options on the Optus network for budget-conscious shoppers such as mums managing mobile plans for the whole family,\" Coles non-food general manager Karin Zimmerman said.\nThe last round of mobile resellers entering the market ended in most of the same big-brand names exiting the market, with Amaysim one of the few to stay alive . This occurred after several key suppliers either collapsed or raised their prices to more-expensive levels.\nAmaysim now expects to hit at least 1 million subscribers using the Optus network by mid-2019.", "external_links": ["https://www.woolworthsconnect.com.au/", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/amaysim-chief-leaves-hairy-goals-behind-in-chase-for-a-million-mobile-customers-20151006-gk24oy.html", "https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/mobile-customers-adrift-after-wholesaler-goes-into-administration-20130819-2s6xy.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:05:09.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
