Filling up the gas tank for your 8-seater Cadillac Escalade will cost you a heck of a lot less than it did in 2014, but it will still take a bite out of the monthly budget. \nFor instance, the Mercedes-Benz AMG G63, with its 8-cylinder engine, has the power to barrel through even the toughest winter storms, but it gets just 13 miles to the gallon and its annual fuel cost is estimated at a whopping $3,200, according to the Web site, Fueleconomy.gov , a joint venture between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy.
