Blame some gloomy data out of China and Germany — but maybe that rout for oil prices yesterday should also have raised a flag.\nAnd while those paper-thin gains for stocks on Monday may give way to total selling today, there may still be some hope left for this year. Given how it’s so late in the year, last week’s 3.26% gain for the S&P 500 could turn out to be the best week of the year for the index, notes Ryan Detrick on the See It Market blog. That would make it the worst best week in 10 years.\nOver a span of 20 years, the worst best week for the S&P 500 was a 2.25% gain in June 1995. “Of course, 1995 gained 34.11% for the year — making it also the strongest annual gain of the past 20 years,” he says. Among some other factoids, Detrick notes that the five days after the best week of the year are higher 70% of the time, and the month after the best week of the year has been up 13 of the past 14 years.\n“Given stock market seasonality is usually positive the next few months, if last week was indeed the best week of the year for stocks, this could be another bullet in the bulls pocket going forward,” says Detrick. Check out the full blog here .\nKeep those thoughts positive, because yesterday’s “Super Crash” call is followed up today by a head-for-the-bunker call from HSBC’s top strategist, who has abandoned ship on the S&P 500. Read more below on why he’s high-tailing it outta there.\nOur chart of the day takes a look at just how much money the 1% has been swimming in. And speaking of 1-percenters, James Dimon’s J.P. Morgan Chase will report results after the bell today. We’ll see whether the banks can lift this market up.\nKey market gauges Lucky 8 for the Dow industrials? Maybe not, as Dow YMZ5, -0.46% and S&P ESZ5, -0.46% futures have been taking on water in the early hours. Europe stocks SXXP, -1.20% are down after gloomy data and weak Swiss banks (see Buzz). Worrying China trade data has driven some of the losses, though the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.17% finished up slightly on some hopes that data will trigger more Beijing stimulus. A cool-off in risk appetite left the yen USDJPY, -0.38% higher across the board and the Nikkei 225 NIK, -1.11% off. Crude oil CLZ5, +0.40% completely reversed direction and is continuing with last night’s selloff. Gold GCZ5, -0.57% is also melting down.\nThe Quote: Everett Collection Hugh Hefner “12-year-old me is very disappointed in current me. But it’s the right thing to do.” — Cory Jones, chief content officer for Playboy, on the magazine’s decision to stop featuring photos of naked women .\nThe call If you can’t handle a bear call, then avert your gaze now. Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation for HSBC, has cut his weight in the S&P 500 index to 0% from 5%.\n“Financial markets face a tricky trinity of slower growth and limited ability for central banks to moderate cyclical downturns at a time when risk premia is relatively limited in key markets. Hence, our asset allocation is highly conservative going forward,” explains Nerbrand in a strategy note to clients, dated Oct. 12. For one, he says, we are already in a global U.S. dollar recession, which is worse than the 2001 recession.\nHSBC Dollar doldrums The portfolio breakdown is 38% safety — a 12% cash allocation and increased holdings of 10-year Treasury bonds — plus 42% in “carry”. “Carry” refers to borrowing and paying interest, in order to buy something else that offers higher interest. Nerbrand believes that as yield becomes an even greater scarce resource in a world with ever-shrinking yields, demand for carry will increase. He likes emerging-market debt and high yield.\nAs for growth, he’s got just 20% in that category, and here’s the kicker for U.S. stocks. “In the long growth asset universe we find more value in copper and zinc than the S&P 500,” Nerbrand says. But HSBC does like European equities, he notes.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.seeitmarket.com/what-happens-after-the-best-week-of-the-year-for-stocks-14864/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:32:39.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
