Andrew Quilty by Joanna Mather Australia's wealthiest families will be spared from having their tax affairs exposed to the public through a last-minute Senate victory by the government.\nAbout 800 privately held Australian companies will be exempted from a law that requires the Tax Office to publish details of taxable income and tax paid by enterprises with turnover of $100 million or more.\nThe disclosure laws were introduced by the former Labor government. On Thursday Labor MPs and senators were left reeling when a procedural blunder allowed the government's exemption to be waved through the Senate.\nAn estimated 1500 public and multinational companies will still feature in the Tax Office report, which is due to be published this year.\nThe government sought the exemption because it was worried about the privacy, commercial interests and personal safety of the families behind private companies.\nBusinesses said they were worried the information would be misconstrued and used in name-and-shame campaigns by activists.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told Parliament the exemption was a reasonable response to Labor's anti-business regime.\n\"[Labor's laws] had nothing to do with gathering tax,\" Mr Turnbull said. \"What it was calculated to do, however, was to prejudice medium-sized Australian private companies as against big multinationals and public listed companies.\"\n During a question time dominated by wrangling over his personal wealth, Mr Turnbull said private companies needed to be able to keep their financial affairs private when negotiating with big supermarkets, for example.\nLabor had planned to defer a vote until the next parliamentary sitting period in three weeks' time.\nBut when key independents and Greens senators did not show up to speak about the bill, and Labor did not react quickly enough, the changes were passed on voices rather than going to a \"division\", which requires all senators to attend the chamber to vote.\nThe government needs the support of six of the eight crossbenchers to get legislation passed when Labor and the Greens vote together.\nBecause there was no division, it is unclear how each would have voted.\nCrossbenchers had been lobbied for months by former assistant treasurer Josh Frydenberg and representatives of beef producer Teys.\nAlthough some of the nation's highest-profile families were set to be affected, only Teys went public with its objections.\nSenator Nick Xenophon later told the Senate he supported the exemption, and sources said the bill would have passed even without the procedural blunder.\nThe Greens said the Coalition had \"scratched the back of its big business mates\". Both Labor and the Greens are looking at whether there is any way to revisit the vote.\nShadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the changes were \"rammed through\" by a Prime Minister intent on denying Australians information about big companies.\n\"Labor introduced these tax transparency laws in 2013 because we know that scrutiny and openness help ensure everyone pays their fair share,\" he said. \"Without transparency, dodgy dealings can flourish in the dark.\"\nTax Justice Network Australia spokesman Mark Zirnsak said the outcome was \"alarming\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:53:18.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
