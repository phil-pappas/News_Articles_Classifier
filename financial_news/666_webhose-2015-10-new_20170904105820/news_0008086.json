He called on investors to take interest in investing in the education sector, especially in the tertiary, technical and vocational courses. \nThe President said the springing up of both public and private universities was a demonstration of the robust nature of the Ghanaian educational system which could become a shining example for the region and other parts of the world. \nHe said Ghana also had comparative advantage in the production of textiles and garments and could export the finished products to other African countries. \nApart from the sub-region, President Mahama explained that Ghana was a member of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and could reach out to greater markets in the United States of America and beyond. \nPresident Mahama said there were also great investment opportunities in light manufacturing, electrical appliances like fridges and the assembling of television and radio sets. \nHe said although Ghana was currently experiencing energy and power challenges, a number of projects were being undertaken to rectify the situation, adding that there were other avenues in the development of solar, wind and biomass energy where partnership was needed. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:52:36.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
