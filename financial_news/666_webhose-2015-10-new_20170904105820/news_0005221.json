Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is   HCLP, which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in HCLP.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 2 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.58 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.41.Also, for the current quarter, Hi-Crush Partners has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 23 cents a share from 27 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 44.5% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you donâ€™t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Mining - Miscellaneous industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Rio Tinto plc RIO. The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and may be better selection at this time.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
