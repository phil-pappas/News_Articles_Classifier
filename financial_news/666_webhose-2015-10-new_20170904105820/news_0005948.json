So later next year we'll have a true picture of the referral pathway,\" he told The Nation today. \nHe said the research would reveal what proportion of patients were referred back to GPs inappropriately and what proportion could be managed better in primary care. \nIn 2013, research funded by the Health Funds Association of New Zealand found 280,000 Kiwis met the clinical threshold for elective surgery, but only 110,000 had been formally placed on a waiting list. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:36:58.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
