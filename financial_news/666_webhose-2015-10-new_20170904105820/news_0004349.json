The Board will conduct this review with the assistance of financial advisors. There is no set timetable for the strategic review process.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will enter into any transaction at this time or in the future. The Company does not intend to make any further public announcements regarding this matter prior to the completion of this review.\nWithdrawal of Guidance \nThe Company is also announcing its withdrawal of previously announced Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year ending December 31, 2015 due to unanticipated project losses, delays and lower than expected new business in the environmental & remediation segment during the third quarter, and continued uncertainties in the segment. The Company does not intend to provide Adjusted EBITDA guidance going forward for the year ending December 31, 2015. Greater detail on the third quarter results will be provided in the upcoming earnings release and investor call.\nChanges to Board of Directors \nThe Company is also reporting the following changes to the Board of Directors. The Board elected Robert Uhler as a director on its Board of Directors, effective immediately. Mr. Uhler is President and Owner of The Uhler Group, a privately held strategy and marketing firm that assists companies with successful execution of strategic objectives.\nPreviously, Mr. Uhler spent 36 years in the engineering and construction field, most recently at MWH Global Inc., a leading global water and natural resources firm that provides technical engineering, construction services, and consulting services. While at MWH, Mr. Uhler acted as the company's chief business strategist for over 20 years through a variety of corporate leadership positions, including chief strategy officer, president, chief executive officer and chairman. In addition, he led the international expansion of MWH through a disciplined sequential approach of geographical and client set expansion, widening the service offering and automating the delivery system.\nEarlier this week, Nathan D.

Dickins tendered her resignation as director and Chair of the Audit Committee of the Company, in each case effective as of October 13, 2015.
