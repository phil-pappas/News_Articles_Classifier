Peter Braig by Sally Rose Australian Catholic Superannuation is the latest super fund to offer a retirement pension product as the industry awaits the federal government's response to the financial system inquiry, which recommended all funds offer a retirement income option.\nThe $7 billion fund launched its new retirement-income solution, Australian Catholic Superannuation RetireSmart, on Thursday.\n\"RetireSmart is a pre-packaged solution focused on making members' account balances last as long as possible into retirement. It's been designed to generate a consistent stream of income during retirement while continuing to grow savings,\" Australian Catholic Superannuation chief executive Greg Cantor said.\n\"Many of our members approaching retirement are concerned about whether they will have enough superannuation. At the same time some would say that they lack the confidence and knowledge to design an investment mix that will create a lasting and stable income\".\nFormer Commonwealth Bank boss David Murray, who led last year's financial system inquiry, pushed for all funds to introduce comprehensive income products for retirement (CIPRs). Mr Murray has championed CIPRs as a tool to help improve the adequacy and sustainability of the retirement phase of the superannuation system.\nThe inquiry's final report made the following recommendation to government: \"Require superannuation trustees to pre-select a comprehensive income product for members' retirement. The product would commence on the member's instruction, or the member may choose to take their benefits in another way. Impediments to product development should be removed\".\nIt was envisioned by Mr Murray that super fund members should automatically have their balance transferred to a CIPR when they retire, with them having the ability to opt out.\nThe government's long-awaited formal response to the Murray inquiry was derailed in September by the Liberal leadership spill which saw Malcolm Turnbull replace Tony Abbott as Prime Minister and undertake a major cabinet reshuffle.\n Regardless of whether the government pushes ahead in forcing all super funds to offer CIPRs, demographics and market forces are already leading the industry down that path.\nAs life expectancy increases the traditional strategy of moving all of an individual's retirement savings into a lower risk \"defensive\" strategy – typically cash and bonds – is under pressure.\nStaying invested in a \"growth\" strategy – typically stocks and property – used to being regarded as too risky for retirees. But increasingly the risk of a retirement savings portfolio being exposed to the volatility of sharemarkets is considered to be outweighed by \"longevity risk\" – the risk that people will outlive their savings.\nAustralian Catholic Superannuation's RetireSmart accounts will hold a minimum of two years' worth of pension payments in cash, providing a secure short term income. The remainder of the account balance will be invested in riskier assets to allow for capital growth, increasing the likelihood of pension income lasting longer into retirement.\nFunds will be automatically redistributed between the cash and growth \"buckets\" so members do not need to actively manage the allocation of their investments.\n\"Our modelling showed that the two years' worth of pension payments stored in the cash bucket would provide an adequate safety net in the event of a significant market downturn,\" Mr Cantor said.\nThe product was developed in collaboration with actuarial and consulting firm Rice Warner which over the past year has conducted workshops with numerous other super funds around how they might also develop suitable retirement income products for their members.\n\"Till now there's been a real lack of retirement product innovation by super funds, with few funds actually developing new retirement specific products. That is finally beginning to change, with funds beginning to plan and develop products,\" Rice Warner senior consultant Salvador Saiz​ said.\n\"In the years ahead most super fund members will require a higher level of growth assets, in order to generate good levels of income, protect assets against inflation and maintain balances for longer\".\nOther funds that have already launched CIPR-like options include QSuper, Equipsuper and NGS Super.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:56:36.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
