Kuwaitâ€™s wealth per adult also fell 7.6 percent from last year to reach $113,400. \nAverage wealth per adult for the MENA region as a whole fell by 6.9 percent to $15,800 in mid-2015, from $16,900 in mid-2014. \nIn terms of total wealth, Saudi Arabia ranked first among GCC economies, with an estimated total wealth of $0.7 trillion, followed by the UAE with an estimated wealth of $0.6 trillion. \nThe report said global inequality has grown since the financial crisis and the richest 1 percent now own half of all household wealth in the world. \nSo much of the world remains relatively poor that it has taken a net worth of just $3,210 this year to be among the wealthiest half of all world citizens, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:10:24.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
