I'll miss all my excellent partners! DM Qs\" Ms Prior said. \nThe cuts, eight per cent of the company's workforce, will come mostly from the product and engineering departments. \nIn a letter to employees, Twitter's newly re-installed global chief executive Jack Dorsey said the cuts were necessary for the company to implement significant structural changes that will \"reflect our plan ahead\". \n\"This isn't easy. But it is right,\" he said. \n\"The world needs a strong Twitter, and this is another step to get there.\" \nTwitter's Australian office did not want to say how many of its staff members will be affected by the redundancies when contacted by AAP. \nHowever a spokesman confirmed the company's board of directors had approved the restructuring. \nThe redundancies come as Twitter attempts to expand its user base. \nWith only 316 million monthly active users, compared to Facebook's and Instagram's combined 1.4 billion users, Twitter has struggled to entice new users and retain existing ones. \nAs part of its growth strategy, Twitter introduced a new option on its platform last week called `moments' that allows users to see the best of what's trending on Twitter. \nIt is the first stage of the company's growth plan, Mr Dorsey said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:00:27.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
