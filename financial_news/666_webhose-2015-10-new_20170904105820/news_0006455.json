Part of the problem that arises, is that while you hope that reputable firms won't put out products that are not well designed for consumers there are always going to be some who will try and exploit financial consumers.\nAdvertisement \"It will help stop a race to the bottom because one of the things we saw in the global financial crisis is when you've got entities putting out products that under-compete or under-cut other reputable firms there is often a tendency to follow suit to try and protect market share and margin.\"\nThe government plans to run an industry consultation program in the lead-up to giving ASIC the new power to ban dodgy or highly unsuitable products.\n\"We will consult with stakeholders on the development of a new ASIC product intervention power that could be used to modify products, or if necessary, remove harmful products from the marketplace,\" the official government response to the FSI said.\nASIC, which will on Wednesday give a formal response to the government's reply to the FSI when it fronts Senate Estimates, is understood to be very pleased with the expansion of its powers.\nThe Turnbull government has also backed a proposal to make issuers and distributors of financial products accountable for their offerings.\nThe consultation period on ASIC's product stopping powers will begin in mid-2016.\nBy the end of 2016, the government plans to consult on strengthening ASIC's enforcement tools in regards to financial services and credit licensing. The government will also consult on beefing up the civil penalty regime in Australia and to develop legislation to give ASIC the power to ban individuals from managing financial firms.\nProfessor Davis said he was disappointed the government did not agree to adopt the FSI recommendation to bring in a oversight committee for ASIC, saying the plan to expand the remit of the Financial Sector Advisory Committee to perform the same task was \"problematic\" because the FSAC was stacked with banking chief executives.\nThe Consumer Action Law Centre welcomed the government's decision to increase the powers of ASIC.\n\"A product intervention power will enable ASIC to amend or ban harmful financial products where there is risk of significant consumer detriment. When enacted, ASIC will be able to respond quickly when consumers are at risk, and intervene before harm has occurred,\" says Consumer Action chief executive Gerard Brody.\nProfessor Davis said it was important the government did not stifle innovation – a view shared by the Australian Bankers' Association.\nABA chief executive Steven Münchenberg said the banking lobby looked forward to working with the government and other stakeholders on the detail of reforms aimed at encouraging innovation in financial services and maintaining consumer protections.\n\"Financial services regulation must strike the right balance in protecting consumers and not stifling innovation and competition in financial products or creating inappropriate regulatory risks across the industry,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:30:44.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
