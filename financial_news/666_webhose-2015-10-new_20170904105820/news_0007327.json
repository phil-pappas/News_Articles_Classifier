That changed Wednesday.\nThe Treasury blamed a verification issue for a half-hour delay in the release of auction results that showed $5 billion of four-week bills sold at a rate of zero percent.\n“It is very, very rare for auction result delays to happen,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets LLC in New York, one of 22 primary dealer obligated to bid at the auctions. “Luckily, it was on a security that doesn’t have much interest-rate risk. So it’s not really harmful to anybody.”\nWednesday’s sale is the smallest since the four-week bill was reintroduced in July 2001. The Treasury auctioned $8 billion of the securities last week, after the auction size was at its 2015 peak of $45 billion as recently as July. While Wednesday’s auction bids were due by 11:30 a.m. New York time, the Treasury did not post results until around noon.\nThe four-week bill rate was negative 0.0152 percent at 12:50 p.m. New York time. Treasury Department rules don’t allow negative rates at auctions.\nReduced Sales Rates on one-month bills have been negative for weeks in secondary-market trading as demand has overwhelmed supply after the Treasury slashed sales of its shortest-maturity securities as it approaches its allowable debt limit. Amid the latest debt-ceiling standoff in Washington, the government may either lift the cap or halt issuance again, after the last suspension expired in March. That leaves the Treasury little choice but to reduce bill sales as it seeks to preserve auctions of longer-term coupon securities.\n“We have so little headroom beneath the debt ceiling that Treasury just keeps having to cut the bill issuance,” said David Keeble , head of U.S. rates strategy at Credit Agricole SA, before the auction.\nThe amount of bills has been sliding in recent years as the Treasury sought to lock in record-low long-term rates by focusing on selling securities with longer tenors. The decline in supply has come as heightened regulations on banks and money-market mutual funds have increased bill purchases. Money-market rates have been at rock bottom since 2008 when the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark to a range of zero to 0.25 percent to combat the financial crisis and spur growth.\nThe rate on the four-week bills has been zero percent at five straight auctions going back to Sept. 15. Treasury sold $20 billion of three-month bills Tuesday at zero percent, after it sold the securities last week at that rate for the first time.\nThe Treasury is likely to exhaust measures to stay under the debt ceiling on or about Nov. 5, Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in an Oct. 1 letter to House Speaker John Boehner. At that point, the U.S. won’t be able to sell additional debt and may have less than $30 billion of cash. The Treasury’s daily expenditures are as high as $60 billion, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:55.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
