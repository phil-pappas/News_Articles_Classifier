They wanted to be able to give money to their children for school fees, property and holidays, he said.\n\"There is an element of wanting to have their cake and eat it too.\"\nThe federal government's response to the financial system inquiry includes a commitment to define the purpose of super in law.\nSenior government ministers have emphasised the role of super is to provide an income in retirement, therefore reducing reliance on the taxpayer-funded age pension, which consumes about 10 per cent of the federal budget.\nInheritance The REST survey suggests many people see super as something they will use to help their children.\n More than one-third said they planned to draw on their super to give their children an inheritance, followed by helping to pay school fees for grandchildren (29 per cent), paying for a holiday (27 per cent) and a house deposit for their children (21 per cent).\n\"What comes through clearly is the desire of people approaching retirement to ease the financial burdens their adult children face today, especially buying a house and covering school fees,\" Mr Hill said.\n\"That's laudable but we would urge retirees not to forget that their retirement savings are first and foremost meant to fund their own retirement, and using retirement savings for other purposes may mean they become a financial burden on their own children later in life.\"\nREST is one of Australia's largest super funds by membership and has more than $37 billion in funds under management.\nMuch of the focus of debate about super has been on the accumulation of assets before retirement. But a major challenge still to be tackled by policy makers is how to ensure people have enough money to last them if they live a long time.\nAndrew Boal, the managing director of Towers Watson and head of the Actuaries Institute's superannuation committee, said most people underestimated how long they would live.\n\"In fact research by National Seniors found the average 50-year-old underestimates their own life expectancy by just over seven years,\" he said.\nMr Boal welcomed a government commitment to legislate to give financial services providers greater freedom to develop products to manage longevity risks, such as deferred lifetime annuities. He said the key change needed was to make such products tax free so they were as attractive as keeping money in super, which is tax-free post retirement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:03:09.484+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
