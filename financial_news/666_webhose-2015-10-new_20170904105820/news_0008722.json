WPP reported that its sales growth had accelerated in the third quarter, but nevertheless some traders said the numbers were not strong enough to justify a further rally in its stock, which had risen nearly 10 percent over the last month. \n\"WPP numbers looked OK, just below expectations of 3.4 percent on a like for like basis but we shouldn't also ignore the fact that the comparatives were quite favourable also, so naturally there is a bit of disappointment from these numbers,\" said XTB Ltd director Joshua Raymond. \nTalkTalk, which is in the FTSE 250 mid-cap index rather than the blue-chip FTSE 100, extended the previous session's sharp losses and was down more than 9 percent, as it grappled with the effects of a cyber attack on the company, first revealed on Friday. \nHowever, David Battersby, investment manager at Redmayne-Bentley, said he was looking to potentially buy Talk Talk shares, adding that in his opinion the market had overreacted on the stock on the downside. \nHe did not see a steep reduction in its customer base and said that recent price declines, alongwith its dividend yield of around 6 percent, had made the stock quite attractive. \nOn the positive side, Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) rose 3.6 percent, the top gainer in the FTSE 100 index. The company denied press speculation it is looking for a buyer, but an earlier Financial Times report that it was courting suitors was enough to stoke bid hopes and push up its shares. \nThe FTSE 100 is down around 2 percent since the start of 2015 and some 10 percent below a record high of 7,122.74 points reached in April.
