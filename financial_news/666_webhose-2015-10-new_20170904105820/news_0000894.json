View Enlarged Image \n\nHe added, \"With such massive decline in engine-powered cars, it's like the world is turning upside down, and Toyota has to change its ways.\" Gasoline or diesel still powers about 85% of Toyota's cars. \nToyota tweeted that it plans to sell 30,000 fuel cell vehicles and 7 million hybrids by 2020. \nToyota is seeing increasing competition, including high-end EVs from Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ). Tesla plans to launch the mass-market Model 3, priced at $35,000, within two years. \nGeneral Motors (NYSE: GM ) is also developing a mass-market EV, the Bolt, and already sells the mid-priced plug-in hybrid Volt. Nissan Motor 's (OTCPK: NSANY ) Leaf hybrid has also gained adherents. \nBut Ise said that Toyota isn't quitting on gas and diesel engines completely. Some areas — for example, in remote regions — will still rely on those fuels because of the difficulty of building EV charging stations. \nToyota closed down 0.8% on the stock market today . General Motors was up 0.6%, and Tesla fell 1%. Volkswagen was unchanged and Nissan ended down 2%. \nFollow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:34:23.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
