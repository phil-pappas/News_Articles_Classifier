It is a psychological barrier for investors,\" DZ Bank market strategist, Felix Herrmann, said.\nBund yields hit a record low 0.05 percent in April, just over a month after the ECB began its trillion-euro quantitative easing (QE) programme. Most in the market were betting they would turn negative.\nBut when a tiny uptick in inflation surprised the market, some investors took profits. An initial minor rise in yields snowballed into a widespread sell-off; the bond coupons were not enough to compensate for the loss in face value.\nMany investors suffered double-digit percent capital losses on their Bund investments in May. Traders now say investors are generally reducing their Bund positions when yields approach 0.50 percent.\nBunds are generally seen benefiting less than other euro zone bonds from any additional ECB bond-buying stimulus.\n\"I am not sure if for Bund yields it would make any difference, because more QE is bullish but at the same time you have a very positive reaction in the risk space and that tends to be bearish (for Bunds),\" Societe Generale global head of rates and FX strategy, Vincent Chaigneau, said.\nTraders say the ECB is likely to extend or increase its bond-buying programme in December, a Reuters poll found, while another cut to an already negative deposit rate may come but not any time soon.
