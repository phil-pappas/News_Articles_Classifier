About 75% of these vehicles received remedial service at Toyota dealers.\nThe recall involves the Auris models made between 2006 and 2008; Corollas made between 2006 and 2010; Yaris models produced between 2006 and 2010; and RAV4s made between 2006 and 2010.\n\"The remedial action involves inspecting the window switch board and applying heat-resistant grease to the switch to ensure smooth operation,\" Mr Yon said.\n\"If necessary, the switch board is also replaced,\" he said. \"At this stage it is not yet clear how many additional South African vehicles will be affected by the current international recall action.\n\"Toyota SA Motors will make this information available as soon as confirmation of the potentially affected vehicles is received from Toyota Motor Corporation,\" he said.\nOf the total vehicles affected, about 2.7-million are in North America, 1.2-million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan.\nThe parent company said parts in the power window master switch may have been lubricated inconsistently during the manufacturing process. \"Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short circuit. That in turn could cause the switch assembly to overheat and melt, and potentially lead to a fire, it said.\nAll the problematic switches have been supplied to Toyota by Japanese automotive supplier Tokai Rika.\nAmong other models subject to the recall are the Matrix, Highlander, Tundra, Sequoia and Scion xB. The vehicles were produced between January 2005 and December 2010, the group said.\nToyota issued a separate recall in Japan of about 140,000 Crown and Crown Majesta models for a glitch that could cause the bonnet to open inadvertently.\nWith Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:53:26.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
