We believe there are policies that should completely be abandoned rather than just clarified, and government bureaucracy, one of the major stumbling blocks to investment and investor confidence, should be dealt with decisively when implementing measures related to easing doing business in the country. \nPotential investors have clearly expressed their apprehension over the lack of property rights in the country, and policy inconsistency. \nThese are key issues and government should demonstrate commitment to reassure investors and lenders.
