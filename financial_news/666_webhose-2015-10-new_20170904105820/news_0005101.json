Included would be shares in Kingdom Holding, though Kingdom shares would not be sold and his actions would have no impact on either the company, or his general investment strategy, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:35:47.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
