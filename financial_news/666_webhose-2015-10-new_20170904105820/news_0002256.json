The Bank of Canada has cut its key interest rate twice this year in an attempt to boost an economy hobbled by a sharp drop in commodity prices.\nBMO noted that when interest rates are low it is a good time to make aggressive principal repayments on loans and its survey found that 35 per cent of those asked are looking to pay down their mortgage sooner.\n\"However, statistics have shown that debt service rates have not changed very much from the early 1990s, when interest rates were much higher,\" the report said.\n\"It appears that many Canadians have used low interest rates to get larger loans on more expensive houses rather than to aggressively repay their debt.\"\nThe online survey was conducted by ValidateIt for BMO from June 23 to 29, with a sample size of 1,014 Canadians.\nThe polling industry's professional body, the Marketing Research and Intelligence Association, says online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:44:37.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
