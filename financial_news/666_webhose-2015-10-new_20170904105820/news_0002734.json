Source: Reuters\nKohli, who was named man of the match, lavished praise on de Villiers for fighting it out in the hot weather.\n“It was pretty difficult out there because there wasn’t much of a breeze during the day when it was so hot,” said Kohli. “If AB (de Villiers) starts cramping then you know how hard it is because he is one of the fittest people around.\n“A century in a winning cause is always special, but the knock by de Villiers too was very special. I told him in the dressing room that my heart was in my mouth when he was batting. He plays unbelievable shots. Credit goes to him, he fought it out.” Indian batsman Virat Kohli gestures after scoring his century against the Proteas.

We had a great opportunity to clinch the series, but hopefully we will take some positives to Mumbai.”\nSouth Africa missed all-rounder JP Duminy and fast bowler Morne Morkel who were ruled out of the key game due to injuries.\nKohli struck six boundaries and five sixes in his 23rd one-day century, the first after a gap of 13 innings since scoring the match-winning 107 against Pakistan in the World Cup match in Adelaide in February.

De Villiers hit 10 boundaries and two sixes.\nThe match was officiated by Indian umpires at both ends after the International Cricket Council withdrew Aleem Dar of Pakistan for the last two games in Chennai and Mumbai due to security concerns.\nThe right-wing Shiv Sena party, known for its anti-Pakistan stand, had threatened to stop Dar from umpiring in the Mumbai match.\n Kohli, AB tons as India force decider", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/virat-kohli-ab-de-villiers-notch-brilliant-centuries-as-india-square-series-in-fourth-odi/story-e6frf3g3-1227579311617", "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/23/1227579/310732-2c129984-78f3-11e5-b984-b6d6a772c835.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/23/1227579/311590-4289baf8-78f3-11e5-b984-b6d6a772c835.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/23/1227579/310786-3499af66-78f3-11e5-b984-b6d6a772c835.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:41:33.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
