The German car giant admitted in September it had deliberately deceived officials about how much its diesel cars polluted using a defeat device in its engines. \nThe BBC reported the company is now looking into older versions of EA 288 engines built to the \"Euro 5\" emissions standard to see if it has the cheat software installed. \nVW previously said about 11m of its EA 189 diesel engines built to the same emissions standard were fitted with the software. \nThat number could grow substantially if more engines are found to be manipulating emissions test data. \nThe BBC reported newer EA 288 cars built to the \"Euro 6\" standard are said not to be affected. \nThe scandal has already led to a number of high-profile resignations including group chief executive Martin Winterkorn, and could cost the company anywhere between €23bn and €78bn, according to Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:40:21.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
