The Consultation Drafts have been designed to provide for a smooth transition from the current regulation of prospectus offerings and continuous disclosure; however, some aspects of the proposed governing regime have not yet been determined. \nGiven the scope of the Consultation Drafts, Blakes is publishing a series of bulletins, which can be accessed here​ . Also see our November 2014 Blakes Bulletin: New Proposed Provincial Capital Markets Legislation: What it Means for Registrants and Other Market Participants . \nAs anticipated, the draft Initial Regulations are proposed to rely primarily on the existing system of national and multilateral instruments, with each CCMRS Jurisdiction adopting a revised version of each of the instruments that are proposed to be taken forward under the new system. Some revisions eliminate existing carve-outs from the current national instruments while others represent the adoption in all CCMRS Jurisdictions of regulatory approaches that formerly only applied in one or two of them. \nBROAD MARKET PARTICIPANTS SCOPE MAINTAINED \nWhile the expanded scope of the “market participant” definition continues, the CCMRS Jurisdictions said in their backgrounder that they propose to add a provision to the Initial Regulations so that certain record-keeping requirements for market participants would not apply to: control persons of a reporting issuer; a person (other than a reporting issuer) distributing securities in reliance on a prospectus exemption, along with its directors, officers, control persons or promoters; a person providing record-keeping services to a registrant; or a general partner of any of the above persons. However, the business and conduct review, investigation and production requirements would apply to all market participants. \nREGISTRATION APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES AS WELL \nThe registration requirements in the CMA will apply to both securities and derivatives. The term “securities” will be interpreted to include all derivatives, which will include both over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and exchange contracts. Certain registration provisions and exemptions that currently apply specifically to exchange contracts only in certain jurisdictions would be expanded to all CCMRS Jurisdictions. It is expected that the Commodity Futures Act (Ontario) would be repealed upon the CMA coming into force. \nINTERNATIONAL DEALER, ADVISER EXEMPTIONS MAINTAINED \nExisting international dealer and international adviser exemptions would be substantially continued, although an agent for service would only need to be designated in one of the CCMRS Jurisdictions. \nONTARIO’S FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REGISTRATION EXEMPTIONS ELIMINATED \nOntario currently exempts certain financial institutions from registration as either a dealer, underwriter, adviser or investment fund manager, including banks listed in Schedule I, II or III to the Bank Act (Canada), co-operative credit associations or certain co-operative credit societies, loan corporations, trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions, caisse populaires or the Business Development Bank of Canada. That exemption will not be carried forward under the CMA. The commentary says that “financial institutions will nonetheless be able to avail themselves of a number of registration exemptions contained in the initial regulations. In addition, registrants and other market participants may apply for exemptive relief.” \nFor firms applying to become a dealer or adviser, all new applicants would be required to file along with their application their business plan, policies and procedures manual, and client agreements, including investment policy statements and investment management agreements. This was not previously a requirement in Ontario. \nThe Initial Regulation would require registered dealers to disclose prescribed information when it intends, as principal, to effect a trade in a security with anyone who is not a registered dealer, if it is making any statement in writing to the person about the security. The CMA provides for a right of rescission if a registered dealer fails to disclose when it intends to or does act as principal in respect of a purchase or sale of a security, contrary to the Initial Regulation. \nCertain existing British Columbia requirements for conditions of registration on investment dealers that trade in certain securities of OTC issuers would be extended to apply to all CCMRS Jurisdictions. The OTC conditions of registration include: Monitoring, record-keeping and reporting requirements Determination of beneficial ownership of securities of OTC issuers prior to selling Designation of a senior employee of the investment dealer responsible for compliance with the OTC conditions of registration Conditions relating to acceptance of physical deposits of securities of OTC issuers \nAn exemption from the OTC conditions is available for an investment dealer that does not, except for isolated trades, trade in securities of OTC issuers, subject to certain filings. \nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP on: \"My best business intelligence, in one easy email…\" Your first step to building a free, personalized, morning email brief covering pertinent authors and topics on JD Supra: * By using the service, you signify your acceptance of JD Supra's Privacy Policy. - hide Privacy Policy (Updated: October 8, 2015) : \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through its website (the \"Website\") as well as through other sources.
