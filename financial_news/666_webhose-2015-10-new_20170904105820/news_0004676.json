Illustration: Michael Mucci\nQ. I read your answer in a recent column about death benefit payments from a SMSF, stating that adult children receiving death benefits will need to pay tax if they are non-dependants.\nI understand that the definition of a child in this context means a child of the deceased of any age, even an adult – there does not need to be a financial dependency. If a death benefit is paid to a dependant there is no tax payable; but tax would be payable on the taxable component of the payment to a non-dependant at the beneficiary's personal tax rate. Is this correct?\nA. There are differing definitions of dependant under the superannuation laws and the tax laws. A dependant for superannuation purposes is any child of the deceased; whereas a dependant for tax purposes is a child aged less than 18, or an adult child who was financially dependent on the deceased just before his/her death.\nDo you have a personal financial problem you need solving? Send questions to Noel Whittaker at asknoel@fairfaxmedia.com.au Advertisement Although a death benefit can be paid to children of the deceased, the tax treatment will be based on whether the child is classified as a dependant under the income tax laws. Adult children that are not financially dependent on the deceased are treated as non-dependant and therefore tax will be payable on the death benefit. There are strategies available which may minimise these potential taxes so I suggest you seek advice – this is a potentially complex area.\nQ. My wife and I are both 54, and our preservation age for super is 56. By that stage we should have $200,000 in my wife's super and $500,000 in mine. When we reach 56, are we both able to make a tax free withdrawal of $185,000 from the taxable component of our super?\nA. Once you have reached your preservation age you could make a tax-free withdrawal of $185,000 from the taxable component of your super. Just keep in mind that you may have a non-taxable component too, and you are not allowed to elect which component you are going to withdraw. This withdrawal may result in greater Medicare and government levy payments in the individual tax returns and may affect eligibility for certain social security payments.\nQ. I bought an investment property in 2009 as a first home buyer, lived there for almost a year, rented it out for just less than six years, and now I am moving back in.\nDo I incur capital gains tax if I decide to sell it immediately after I move in, or do I need to live there for six months and then sell in order to avoid capital gains tax? In the latter case I understand it will be considered to be my principal place of residence.\nA. The fact that you lived in it first, and have not been absent for six years, means that you are still entitled to the capital gains tax exemption. There is no need to move back in.\nQ. Why does the government insist on minimum withdrawals from super after you reach 65? If we are able to live comfortably without these withdrawals, our super would last much longer.\nA. People in the pension mode enjoy a tax-free environment while drawing a tax-free pension. The reason minimum withdrawals are required is to stop people accumulating assets in a tax-free environment for ever after retirement. You can roll back pension funds to the accumulation phase to avoid the pension requirement, however 15 per cent tax would then be payable on fund earnings. Also, in certain circumstances it may have negative Centrelink implications.\nQ. I am eligible to retire next year but have reached preservation age and can access my super now. I worry that the financial markets will not do well in the next 12 months. Do you think I should cash in my super now, or leave it in the fund until I retire?\nA. Unless you have reached 65 you will need to trigger a condition of release to withdraw your superannuation, even if you have reached your preservation age. If you are concerned about market fluctuations a simple strategy would be to move your money to the cash option inside superannuation.\nQ I would appreciate your thoughts on an investment idea, where a group of five people would form a property-buying entity.\nThe first year, each person would invest $1000 a month for a deposit on house No.1, then continue for a further 18 months to pay off part of the mortgage, and put towards a second house. This would be repeated for 15 years, by which time they could have purchased eight houses.\nWhat type of entity would best suit this arrangement, and what would be the tax implications for each individual, and the entity itself?\nA. I think your proposal is fraught with difficulty, as there may well be dissent about the property to be bought, and there could be other challenges if one of the members has a change in circumstances and needs to get their money back, forcing the sale of the property at what may be an inconvenient time. If you are determined to go ahead, your accountant could suggest a suitable structure, but in my experience these types of shared arrangements seldom end up a success.\nNoel Whittaker, AM, is the author of Making Money Made Simple and numerous other books on personal finance.
