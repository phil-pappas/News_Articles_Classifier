Total payments will be capped at $50 for households with proof-of-purchase, and $12 for those without. \nSome 60,000 claims have been filed, and more are expected, said plaintiffs' attorney Tucker Ronzetti at a court hearing. \nAnheuser-Busch also agreed to add labels identifying the Beck's brand as having been made in the United States for the next five years, and to make similar changes to its website. \nThe beer maker also agreed to pay $3.5 million in lawyers’ fees under the agreement approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge John J. O'Sullivan in the U.S. Southern District of Florida. \nThe suit was filed by a Florida man in Oct. 2013, “alleging that Beck’s Pilsner had been falsely or misleadingly labelled,” according to court documents. \nIn its settlement, Anheuser-Busch did not admit wrong-doing. \n\"Beck's has always been truthful, transparent and in compliance with all legal requirements,\" Jorn Socquet, vice president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch said in an email. \n(Editing by Letitia Stein, Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:28:23.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
