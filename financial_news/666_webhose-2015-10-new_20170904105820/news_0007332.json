Photo: Sylvia Liber\nMajor pay cuts and 500 job losses at BlueScope's Port Kembla steel works will only delay the troubled plant's closure, Deutsche Bank analyst Emily Smith says.\nOn Thursday, BlueScope's unions made unprecedented concessions on jobs and benefits , including a three-year wage freeze, in a bid to keep raw steel rolling out of the nation's biggest steel works.\nBlueScope chief executive Paul O'Malley praised the decision to compromise but did not promise the No. 5 blast furnace would keep burning.\n\"This is a major step toward achieving the $200 million cost savings target. But we still have a lot of work to do in the coming weeks as steel prices remain under pressure from the global steel glut,\" he said on Thursday.\nAdvertisement Deutsche Bank analyst Emily Smith said on Friday that the collapse in steel prices meant the plant was unlikely to survive long term regardless of the cost savings.\n\"With steel spreads at record lows, we believe it is only a matter of time before Port Kembla is closed,\" Ms Smith said in a research note.\nSteel spreads (the difference between the cost of steel-making materials iron ore and coal, and the price of steel) have been hammered due to sustained surplus steel production in the face of slowing Chinese demand.\nIn August, when Mr O'Malley said he needed to find $200 million of savings or the plant would close, BlueScope said steel exports from China, which makes half the world's steel, doubled to more than 100 million tonnes a year from 2010 to 2015.\nTo put this volume in context, BlueScope's Port Kembla plant has annual capacity to make 2.6 million tonnes of raw steel.\nMs Smith said East Asia hot-rolled coil spreads fell 26 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 51.7 per cent year-on-year to $US144 a tonne for the week ending September 28.\n\"This is 50 per cent below the historical average of $US289 a tonne,\" she said.\nHowever, Credit Suisse analyst Michael Slifirski is less pessimistic.\nHe said the workplace overhaul presented \"very substantial progress\" and a \"near-term closure decision is less likely\".\nWhile many investors wanted BlueScope to stop making steel and move to an import model, which would stem losses on steel exports, this would not be a good near-term financial outcome, Mr Slifirski said.\n\"The exit option would entail greater complexity and cost while eliminating the option on seemingly inevitable steel spread recovery at some point in the future,\" he told clients.\nBlueScope has two more board meetings before it makes its final decision on Port Kembla.\nThe company has indicated it will decide whether to keep the plant running by its annual general meeting on November 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:10:03.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
