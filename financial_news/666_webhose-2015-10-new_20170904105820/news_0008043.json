Now it has been accused by ASIC of not complying with responsible lending rules. Photo: Craig Abraham\nCash Converters has suffered another blow after the corporate cop accused its car financier Caboodle of not complying with responsible consumer credit laws and ordered an independent review of its systems and procedures.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission said surveillance revealed that the systems and procedures of Green Light Auto Group, which trades as car leaser Caboodle, were not sufficient to ensure it was complying with national consumer credit laws.\nThe regulator said Carboodle also failed to obtain written consent to enter a property when repossessing leased motor vehicles.\nASIC said Caboodle had already made changes to its processes and procedures; new licence conditions will require it to appoint an independent compliance consultant to review its overall compliance arrangements.\nAdvertisement Cash Converters chief Peter Cumins told Fairfax Media the action was related to surveillance made by ASIC in 2011 and the company had already changed its systems and procedures.\nIt must give a copy of the consultant's report to ASIC, as well as addressing any deficiencies identified by its review.\nASIC deputy chairman Peter Kell said in a statement: \"The national credit legislation provides important protections to consumers both when entering into consumer leases and when experiencing difficulty meeting scheduled payments. These are key areas of focus for ASIC, and we will take appropriate action where we identify concerns.\"\nGreen Light Auto Group's income for 2015 fell slightly to $8.73 million, compared with 2014, and suffered an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation loss of $2.68 million.\nHorror year Cash Converters has had a horror year, beginning with a Four Corners expose that alleged it was lending to drug addicts.\nThis month, the Federal Court approved a $23 million settlement with 38,000 people in NSW who had borrowed from it . The borrowers, who launched a class action in June, alleged a \"deferred establishment fee\" they were charged when they repaid their loans early between June 2010 and June 2013 meant they were paying more than the 48 per cent interest cap on payday loans.\nCash Converters is refunding the fee to all the litigants.\nIn July, the company was hit with a second class action by borrowers in Queensland over a different fee called a \"brokerage fee\".\nAlong with new laws in Britain that hit its UK operations, the settlement was largely responsible for Cash Converters reporting a loss of more than $21 million at its annual results in August.\nIn July, Westpac announced that it would be pulling out of providing financing facilities to the payday sector, including Cash Converters. It was the only big bank still providing funding for payday lending.\nCash Converters chairman Reginald Webb and the CEO of Australia, Ian Day, retired last month. At the same time, the company commissioned CACE Partners to conduct a strategic review of the business overseen by new executive chairman (the former CEO of the Bank of Queensland) Stuart Grimshaw. The consultant is due to report back to the Cash Converters board by the end of the year.\nCash Converters is one of three listed companies that offer pay day loans, officially known as small amount credit contracts.\nThe federal government is now considering whether tougher restrictions should be imposed on pay day lending and consumer leases .", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/cash-converters-settles-class-action-20150618-ghr0sx", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/westpac-credit-check-threatens-cash-converters-money3-20150728-gim3l8", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/buy-now-pay-later-under-review-20150806-git1t5?stb=twt", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/cash-converters-overhaul-led-by-ex-boq-chief-20150910-gjj9n6"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:18:49.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
