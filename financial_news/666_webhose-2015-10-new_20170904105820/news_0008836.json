The company has set aside 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion) to cover costs but analysts say that likely is not enough.\nMueller said some of the cars - more than 11 million worldwide - could be fixed by adjusting the software, while others would need mechanical fixes. He didn't elaborate.\nVolkswagen has until tomorrow to give German regulators a binding timetable that sets out when it will have a fix for the cars in the country and by when it can be implemented.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:53:40.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
