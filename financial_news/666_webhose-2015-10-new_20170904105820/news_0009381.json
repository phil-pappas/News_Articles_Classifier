People who had been buying the miners over the last week would now be tempted to sell and lock in some profits on them,\" said Charles Hanover Investments' partner Dafydd Davies. \nHowever, SAB rose 8.5 percent after accepting a takeover proposal from Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI), the world's largest brewer, which set out a cash-and-share package currently worth about 69 billion pounds ($106 billion). \nAB InBev said it was willing to pay 44 pounds in cash per SABMiller share, with a partial share alternative set at a discount and limited to 41 percent of SABMiller shares. SAB shares were slightly below that level at 39 pounds. \nTraders said SAB shares were below ABI's headline offer price partly because of concerns that the proposed tie-up may face anti-trust issues. \nThe FTSE 100 is down by around 4 percent since the start of 2015, and about 10 percent below a record high of around 7,123 points reached in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) .
