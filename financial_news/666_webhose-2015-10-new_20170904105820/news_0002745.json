Picture: QUICKPIC\nThe interior is well designed but there are a few issues and plenty of options. Picture: QUICKPIC\nThe rear has more of a station wagon look to it. Picture: QUICKPIC\nThe Virtual Cockpit is great but should be standard at this price. Picture: QUICKPIC\nAUDI’s previous generation Q7 was a hulking, imposing thing that saw many of its owners slap huge wheels on to give it increased street cred among its rivals. It was available with an array of engines that included the bestselling 3.0TDI variant that remains in the current generation model. There was also a 4.2TDI that was launched in 2008, while in 2009, the mighty V12 TDI was ushered in and it turned out to be something rather special, thanks to its 368kW and 1,000Nm output.\nBe that as it may, the previous generation Q7 had its shortcomings. While it was relatively large in exterior dimensions, the interior never quiet mimicked this with headroom, particularly at the rear, being compromised due to the tapering nature of the roof’s design. It also used a rather old cabin architecture that was heavily borrowed from the then A6 range, which meant it became rather archaic in contrast to the BMW X5 and Mercedes M-Class, even more so toward the end of the Q7’s life cycle, as it was already two generations behind its rivals.\nThis seems to have changed with the latest model and, having driven it at its International launch in Switzerland earlier this year where I was left suitably impressed by it, I was keen to sample it again on local soil to see whether my initial impressions remained true.\nOur test unit came in the form of the 3.0l TDI and while the vehicle’s design may have been toned down compared to its forebear, it still turned a fair share of heads with its rather more conventional yet modern design. That front grille in particular is probably the largest to adorn an Audi, while the satin silver door trimmings with the quattro insignia embossed on the rear doors is a nice touch, without looking garish. The rear looks more A6 Avant than a full fat SUV, and does well to mask the vehicle’s sheer size.\nInside you are greeted by one of the most well laid out interiors in the business, something that the company has been renowned for over the years. The air vents in particular run the width of the dashboard and do well to provide air into the cabin to heat up or cool things down.\nThe multimedia interface that recedes into a crevice in the dash when the ignition is switched off is home to a number of vehicle functions, including navigation and other items. It can be accessed via the rotary switch or the touchpad that has predictive finger gesture inputs. The Virtual Cockpit, which debuted in the TT, remains a nice touch as it offers multiple views on the dash, including navigation, radio stations and the full gamut of driver information such as fuel consumption and driver aiding systems. But the cockpit is an additional option, which at this pricing point should be standard equipment.\nThat 3.0l TDI lump is a tried and proven mill in the company’s stable — doing duty in a number of models — but it has been fettled here to not only deliver slightly more power than before, but also to be more refined and thriftier.\nThe engineers have gone to great lengths to make the model lighter than its predecessor and, having used a medley of metals, including high tensile steel and aluminium, the model has shed about 325kg compared to its predecessor. This has resulted in a vehicle that feels less ungainly, is light on its feet and considerably more efficient, too.\nOut on the road is where the sum total of the improvements comes to fruition. The refinement stakes in particular have been heightened to levels surpassing that of the company’s flagship limo, the A8. This is complemented by the cosseting ride quality that after selecting comfort on the Drive Select menu, ensures that the air suspension constantly adapts to changing road conditions.\nThen there is the engine that is silky smooth, delivers ample power and is also economical. In fact I saw figures as low as 7.4l/100km, while the average, which included both urban, extra urban and stop/start traffic, worked out to about 8.6l/100km — impressive for a vehicle of this size and engine capacity. We did not have enough time to drive the vehicle out of Gauteng, which I suspect would have seen it return even better figures.\nOn-road manners will surprise many people and the vehicle did not protest when hurled into some coiling roads, responding to driver inputs better than one would anticipate, in fact.\nThere were one or two niggles with the vehicle, though. For starters, there was no keyless entry on our test unit, which meant we had to take out the key fob to lock and unlock the car which, at this price level, should be standard equipment. The other is that the starter button is obstructed by the steering wheel and would have been better positioned on the wide centre console between the seats.\nSo the ultimate question remains as to whether the Q7 is better than the Volvo XC90. Well, I am of the view that both are fantastic vehicles in their own right. Where the Audi seems to tick more boxes is in the variety of engines on offer and this 3.0 TDI variant in particular is a peach in the power, refinement and economy stakes and I feel it wins the duel, but only by a whisker.\nAUDI Q7 3.0 TDI\nWE LIKE: Technology, cabin layout, refinement\nWE DISLIKE: No keyless entry as standard, location of engine start button\nVERDICT: A refined and spacious premium SUV\nTECH SPECS\nENGINE\nType: Turbocharged diesel\nCapacity: 2,997cc\nPower: 183kW at 2,910r/min\nTorque: 600Nm from 1,500r/min\nTRANSMISSION\nEight-speed automatic\nDRIVETRAIN\nType: All-wheel drive\nPERFORMANCE (claimed)\n0-100km/h: 6.9 seconds\nTop Speed: 225km/h\nFuel Consumption: 6.3l/100km\nEmissions: 164g/km\nSTANDARD FEATURES\nMultifunction steering wheel, leather seats, multimedia interface with touchpad, sound system with dual USB ports, Bluetooth connectivity, climate control, cruise control, electric windows, Drive Select, Isofix rear child seat anchorage points\nCOST OF OWNERSHIP\nWarranty: One-year/unlimited km\nMaintenance Plan: Five-year/ 100,000km\nPrice: R924,000\n* At 10% over 60 months no deposit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:39:01.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
