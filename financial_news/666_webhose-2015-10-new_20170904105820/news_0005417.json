That doesn’t mean investors are souring on U.S. consumers.\nAfter getting swept up in August’s selloff and falling 10 percent in five days, stocks dependent on the buying power of shoppers have reasserted themselves in the rebound, handing them the biggest gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for the first time since 2013. Shares with the four best returns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year -- Nike Inc., Home Depot Inc., McDonald’s Corp. and Walt Disney Inc. -- belong to the category.\nWhatever concerns are hanging over the market, from China’s slowing expansion to the Federal Reserve and falling earnings, investors refuse to part with the view that rising employment and lower gasoline prices will keep Americans spending.
