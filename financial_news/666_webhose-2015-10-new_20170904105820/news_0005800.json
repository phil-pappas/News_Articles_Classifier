QGS contracts guarantee employees 20 hours work a week.\n\"These employees simply cannot pay full-time bills with part-time wages,\" the report of the survey results said.\n\"Airlines which once prided themselves on being highly sought-after employers are now being seen by their workforces as undercutting their conditions at every turn, forcing employees into cost contracts.\"\nThe report said Qantas has sacked 5000 employees and has replaced them with part-time workers.\n\"Qantas Airways has said it will no longer hire any new ground operations workers and instead is engaging low-paid, part-time and casual workers,\" the report said.\n\"As the market leader Qantas is creating an environment where other airlines and companies that service them are following them in a race to the bottom on workers' wages and conditions.\n\"This is a damning state of affairs for an industry awash with money.\"\nOne baggage handler and ramp worker, a father-of-three in Cairns, said: \"I would like full-time work. It's very hard to live on part-time hours.\"\nA Sydney catering worker and mother-of-two said she wanted \"more hours, more full-time jobs, no more four-hour shifts\".\nA Perth baggage handler and ramp worker said he could not afford to retire at the age of 65 and already lives \"pay cheque to pay cheque\".\nA spokeswoman for Qantas said the TWU survey is littered with inaccuracies and does not reflect the state of its workforce.\n\"The survey is also unreliable; less than 400 people were surveyed, which represents less than 1 per cent of the Australian aviation industry,\" she said.\n\"The Qantas Group employs over 30,000 people, and the vast majority of our employees are employed on a full-time basis.\n\"Like most airlines, we do have a small part-time workforce as some parts of the business are better suited to part-time work because of the peaks and trough-type nature of our flight schedule, but also because there are many people where part-time work suits their personal preference.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:17:59.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
