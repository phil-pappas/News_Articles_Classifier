Nic Walker Share on twitter by Philip Baker One of the key challenges facing investors is how to respond to the likelihood that the United States Federal Reserve won't be hiking interest rates any time soon.\nIs it good news for the sharemarket as the flow of cheap money rolls on? Or is it bad news that after years of easy money, the US economy is still not strong enough to cope with rates moving up by just one-quarter of a percentage point from almost zero?\nTalk from trading desks is that hedge funds think it is bad news and it won't be long before they start short-selling again. That implies that the short covering squeeze that investors have enjoyed since the major S&P ASX index fell to 4918 a couple of weeks ago – it was around 5229 on Thursday – will end.\nBut not all stocks will be the targets of the short sellers.\nSmall cap stocks have surprised many investors with their decent comparative performance so far this calendar year and one reason is that short sellers seem to avoid them.\nAccording to John Abernethy, fund manager and founder of Clime Investment Management, there is no shorting in the small cap space simply because fund managers don't lend out the stock.\nThat means any flows that go into the sector help to push up the prices straight away.\nIn any other line of business, selling something you don't own is a crime. But not in the sharemarket. Investors simply pay a fee to borrow the shares so the sale can be settled.\n Although there was a ban put in place during the global financial crisis against short-selling financial stocks, it's a practice that has grown like topsy over the past few years.\nSharemarket shorters can, by sheer weight of money, render a company insolvent and wipe out its shareholders.\nThese days, hedge funds not only target stocks they think are under pressure, they also use the money they get from selling the shares they don't like to invest in the companies they do.\nBut if there is a lack of short-selling in the small cap space, it might be one reason why small-cap stocks have been flat this year while stocks in the major S&P ASX 200 index are down 3.5 per cent.\nContrary to common sense Normally, when investors get whipped around, as they have since April when the major index peaked and almost pushed through 6000, it is the small-cap stocks that really get hammered.\nBut this year that hasn't been the case.\nFor sure, since April small-cap stocks are down 5 per cent. But large-cap stocks are down 11 per cent.\nSmall caps haven't always done better.\nOver the past five years, small-cap stocks have fallen 20 per cent compared to an 8 per cent gain gain in the major index. Over the past 10 years, small caps have fallen 12 per cent compared to a 28 per cent rise in large caps.\nAccording to Abernethy, it is becoming increasingly common to see small-cap companies trading at much higher earnings and equity multiples than large caps, contrary to traditional patterns and common sense.\n\"Often this is not supported by either historic or sustainable earnings growth or return on equity,\" he said.\nOne reason small caps have been so sought after this year by investors is that they are one of the few sectors to offer some sort of growth.\nIn a low-growth world, where interest rates are low and investors are being warned that returns are going to be poor, the small-cap sector, through IT and telecommunications, offers hope for investors looking for growth.\nAs Abernethy points out, when investors look around the world to see how high sharemarkets are, it doesn't quite stack up with the economic cycle or reflect how hard it is for a company to grow their earnings.\nNo, most major equity markets are where they are thanks to the low level of interest rates and \"the enduring hope for even more central bank largesse\", he warns.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-10-15T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:03:37.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
