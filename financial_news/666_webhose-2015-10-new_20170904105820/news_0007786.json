At Big W consumers can earn 1 frequent flyer point for every $2 spent over $30 in a single transaction.\nA spokeswoman from Woolworths said the supermarket had previously indicated that it planed to \"make changes\" to the Everyday Rewards program \"to benefit our loyal customers.\"\nShe said more information would become available in coming weeks.\nWoolworths revealed its plans to review its rewards program at an investor strategy day earlier this year.\n It's understood all options are on the table, including cutting key relationships such as Qantas, according to sources close to the retailer.\n\"I don't think anyone thinks Qantas is cheap, Qantas makes a fair bit of money out of its rewards program,\" the source said.\nWoolworths will report its first quarter sales next week and analyst Deutsche Bank is forecasting a decline in food and liquor sales of 0.5 per cent compared to forecast 3.1 per cent comparable food and liquor sales at Coles over the same period.\nA spokesman for Qantas said it had been in discussions with Woolworths over the details of the loyalty program \"to ensure it continues to meet the needs of our Frequent Flyers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:07:16.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
