After Crabtree designed it, she hired a carpenter, plumber and electrician. \n“I was born and raised in a house my father built, and I always planned to buy land and build my own home,” she said. “When I ran across the trend of tiny houses, I immediately knew that's what I was going to do, I didn't even need to contemplate. It just made sense for me.” \nTiny homes, which can vary from 100 square feet to 400 square feet, are sprouting up across the U.S. in both cities and more rural areas. The appeal of living in them is not limited to just Millennials and single people; in fact, many retirees are also drawn to them the empty-nesters they downsize. Many people value homeownership but do not want to be encumbered with a mortgage for 30 years . They also like the ease and speed of building a home that they can customize and design as well as downsizing their living space and environmental footprint.
