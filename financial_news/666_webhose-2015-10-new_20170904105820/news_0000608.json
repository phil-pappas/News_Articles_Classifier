ADVERTISEMENT \"Going down such a path will weaken the final deal and set the wrong standard for trade agreements going forward,” the six groups said in a statement sent to The Hill on Wednesday.\n\"Most importantly, it will do damage to the ability of businesses in the United States to access and have core rights of fairness in foreign countries to the detriment of U.S. exports, economic activity and jobs in our nation,\" they said. \nThey argue in a letter sent to all 12 nations late Monday that allowing exclusions in the TPP invites countries to put \"unscientific, discriminatory or otherwise unfair and illegitimate\" restrictions on products and sectors. \nTPP negotiations are aiming to conclude years of talks this week — as early as Thursday — during meetings in Atlanta. \nThe letter comes amid growing concerns from lawmakers on Capitol Hill that tobacco might lose protections in a final deal. \nIn July, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), among other tobacco-state lawmakers across the Capitol, warned that carving out tobacco would jeopardize passage of a final deal in Congress. \nOn Tuesday, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said that he will carefully review any deal that reaches Capitol Hill. \n“If the administration and our negotiating partners do conclude an agreement this week, they can be sure that I will examine it very carefully to ensure it meets these standards,\" Hatch said on the Senate floor. \" And, as I have stated many times before, if the agreement falls short, I will not support it. And, I don’t think I’ll be alone on that.” \nHe urged U.S. trade officials to take their time in getting a strong deal. \n“If you look at the bipartisan coalition that supported our TPA bill, you should get a pretty good sense of the balance it will take to get enough support here in the Senate and over in the House,\" he said. \nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee, on Wednesday said that while key issues remain outstanding “Americans deserve nothing less than a good deal for our workers and our businesses.\" \n“If an agreement can’t be reached in Atlanta that reflects these priorities and is consistent with the objectives of trade promotion authority, I expect the negotiations will continue until such an agreement can be obtained.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:31:10.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
