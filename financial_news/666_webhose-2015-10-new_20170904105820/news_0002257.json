Photo: Louise Kennerley\nTrans-Tasman dairy company, a2 Milk, plans to raise $NZ40 million ($36.7 million) to help fuel its expansion across China, the US and Britain after sales of its Platinum infant formula brand surged higher than it expected.\nThe capital raising comes after a takeover bid from a2's biggest shareholder Freedom Foods , which is controlled by the billionaire Perich family, and US dairy giant Dean Foods evaporated.\nA2 had agreed to halt the capital raising plans after Freedom and Dean lodged an expression of interest in the company in June. But an insider trading investigation into Dean by the US regulator derailed the takeover plans.\nA2 chief executive Geoff Babidge said on Thursday sales in China, Australia, New Zealand and its other Asia businesses for the first two months of FY16 were ahead of budget.\nAdvertisement \"Infant formula is emerging as a more significant and meaningful growth driver for the company than expected, with a current focus on sales in Australia and New Zealand and in China,\" Mr Babidge said.\n\"In addition to the growth in infant formula, the prospects for growth of a2 Milk branded whole milk powder are also encouraging.\"\nThe company has appointed Goldman Sachs as the sole arranger, book runner and underwriter to raise the $NZ40 million of new equity.\nMr Babidge said the cash would support a2's continued growth in Australia and New Zealand and its targeted international markets of China, Britain and the US.\n\"The new capital raised will be applied primarily to fund increasing working capital associated with the significant growth in infant formula in Australia and New Zealand and China,\" he said.\nA2 Milk's Platinum branded formula, which launched in August 2013, has become the second biggest infant formula player in Australia, according to Coles' sales data compiled by research firm Nielsen. Total Platinum sales leapt 445 per cent to $41.67 million for the 12 months to June 30.\nMr Babidge said last month that the company's infant formula sales were on track to triple this financial year , saying sales in July and August were around $13 million.\nIt is intended that the placement shares will be offered to institutional investors in New Zealand, Australia and other selected international jurisdictions. The price will be determined by a bookbuild, which has been underwritten at a floor price of NZ 67 cent a share.\nMr Babidge said the milk producer also recently increased its debt facilities from $3 million to $10 million to give it additional flexibility in its expansion plans.\nThe company is negotiating a further bank guarantee facility of $NZ10 million, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:08:33.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
