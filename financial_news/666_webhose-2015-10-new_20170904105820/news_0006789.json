Alex Ellinghausen by Fleur Anderson At one point in question time on Wednesday, former treasurer Joe Hockey rose from his backbench seat to fetch himself and his benchmate, the former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a glass of water each.\nWhen he returned, the two briefly clinked glasses with wry expressions of their faces. History does not record the reason for the impromptu toast.\nGiven that not so long ago Smokin' Joe was lampooned by Labor for his good fortune – largely thanks to his luck in marrying a canny investment banker wife – the toast might have been \"better him than me\".\nFor question time fodder, is there a sport more mouth-wateringly tempting than goading Malcolm Turnbull into explaining to Parliament just how amazingly, stonkingly rich he is?\nCartoon: Rod Clement While Liberal MP Craig Kelly took to Twitter lamenting Parliament's \"appalling\" contemporary art featuring bare buttocks, the Turnbulls are well-known supporters of the arts and own their very own John Olsens, William Robinsons and – good grief – a couple of Bill Hensons.\nThe only surprise on Wednesday was that Labor restrained itself for so long.\n\"How is it appropriate that the Prime Minister of this country thinks it is acceptable to have his investments sitting in the Cayman Islands?\" Labor's corporation attack dog Senator Sam Dastyari asked in the Senate shortly before question time.\nWe all know the Member for Net Worth is rich, worth an estimated $200 million at last count, and now the question is whether the public will buy into Labor's strategy of painting Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull as tax transparency hypocrites in a climate where corporate tax evasion is a dirty word yet everyone still wants the latest Apple watch.\n Almost all of his and Lucy's investments are in overseas managed funds, any income is taxed in full in Australia and they have no say in where those companies invest – even if some of it seems to have travelled through the notorious Ugland House, downtown George Town in the Cayman Islands, Turnbull explained in his reassuring rational tone.\n\"Once again the Labor Party is endeavouring to run a new campaign on the politics of envy,\" he said.\nLabor's real message was that Turnbull is not \"one of us\". It's something that could still resonate with one or two of Turnbull's own colleagues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:05:50.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
