With the Muslim population currently standing at 1.6 billion and the second-largest worldwide, and with cultural strictures that demand the consumption of Halal-certified foods - particularly meat and poultry, opportunities for food manufacturers and processors to capitalize on the significant revenues offered by this target segment abound. Those in the Middle East and South East Asia regions, in particular, are in strong positions to leverage their geographic location in what are already well-established Islamic economies. Gulfood Manufacturing, the region's largest sector specific trade show for the F&B manufacturing, processing and packaging industry, takes place at the Dubai World Trade Centre ( DWTC ) from 27-29 October and is well situated to highlight the opportunities and meet the needs of manufacturers looking to grow their business in this sector. \nWith more than 1,500 exhibitors from 60 countries confirmed to introduce the latest equipment, ingredients, packaging and technologies to the region, the show provides an invaluable platform for the region's food manufacturers and processors to access the necessary elements required to raise standards, increase production capacity and meet requirements of growing sectors, such as Halal. \n\"The opportunities for food manufacturers supplying Halal certified foods exists not only in serving their respective local populations, but in using the capabilities developed locally to serve global Muslim demand too,\" said Trixie LohMirmand, Senior Vice-President, Exhibitions and Events Division, DWTC . \"These opportunities, however, require modern technologies in production, processing, packaging and logistics. Gulfood Manufacturing attracts the industry's top suppliers from around the world to Dubai - making it easy, accessible and exceptionally targeted for companies to find the answer to their needs.\" In addition to the Middle East, which is well-established as a halal food manufacturing and processing region, neighbouring markets such as India are also looking to grow their Halal meat production industry to capitalize on global demand. As of 2015, India is now the world's largest red meat exporter, widening its lead over other more established players such as Brazil and Australia. \nWith a domestic Halal food market valued above US$100 million last year, according to the latest Thompson Reuters Global Islamic Economy report, Turkey is also growing its export market globally, driving investment in sectors such as Halal poultry processing. Among the focus areas for Halal meat and poultry production and trade are pre- and post-slaughtering procedures to ensure quality, livestock management and slaughterhouse automation. Equally important are the use of modern machinery, packaging solutions and tools, as well as training - all easily accessed through Gulfood Manufacturing.\nMarel Townsend Further Processing is the leading global supplier of advanced equipment, systems and services to the poultry, fish, meat and further processing industries. Providers of equipment to some of the largest manufacturers around the region, the company has incorporated considerable innovation to deliver the best solutions for production, including Halal foods. \"By linking what we do best to what our customers do best, we create innovation through partnership to add value. Our state-of-the-art equipment and systems help food processors of all sizes, in all markets, to operate at peak productivity, and we'll be showcasing these solutions at Gulfood Manufacturing,\" said Mark Boom, Marketing Manager, Marel Townsend Further Processing. \nAlso offering full service solutions for slaughterhouses, meat processing, and convenience food facilities, United Food Technology (UFT), will showcase its range of speciality food processing equipment, packaging machines and hygiene systems at Gulfood Manufacturing. The company not only follows the highest European standards, but also recognises Halal criteria in all solutions for its customers. \nWith a growing demand not just for Halal meat, but also for secondary industries that are based on the by-products of Halal meat, including raw materials such as casings, gelatin, sausages and leather. For manufacturers, ensuring each product ingredient, additive and raw material is Halal is important. This even includes rennet in cheese, and ingredients like casein, a common protein ingredient used in processed foods. At Gulfood Manufacturing, exhibitors like Linxia Huaan Biological Product. Co. Ltd manufactures and supplies casein of the highest quality and Halal certification. \n\"As the demand for Halal foods increases around the world, trust and confidence in quality, standards and ingredient origins will be key differentiators for the food manufacturing and processing sectors. To ensure this, the best technology, equipment and environment are required to process the right raw materials. Gulfood Manufacturing helps businesses source these,\" added LohMirmand. \nGulfood Manufacturing is open between 10am-6pm from 27 - 28 October and 10am-5pm on 29 October 2015 at DWTC .
