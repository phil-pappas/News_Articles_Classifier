Jesse Marlow Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro They're the largest and most secretive investors in the world, but after decades of investing billions in bonds, shares and hedge funds, these investors are now turning into sellers and redeemers.\nSovereign wealth funds, which control about $US7 trillion ($9.5 trillion) of assets largely created out their nation's vast mineral riches, are drawing down on their financial wealth as resources decline, creating a potentially vicious feedback loop for financial markets.\nLast month the Financial Times reported Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund, SAMA, had declined by $US73 billion, hitting several funds with large redemptions, as the fourth-largest sovereign fund shrunk by one-tenth.\nJust last week, Norway, which has the world's largest sovereign fund at $US820 billion as a result of its oil riches, called on the fund for a $US450 million withdrawal – a modest amount, but it did mark the first time ever that the nation has drawn on its reserves.\nHalf of the world's top 10 sovereign wealth funds were created from oil wealth. At the same time, the large pools of foreign currency reserve assets built up by China, which peaked at $US4 trillion last year, is in the midst of an unprecedented liquidation after decades of growth.\nThe reasons sovereign assets and currency reserves are falling are intertwined. China's extraordinary industrialisation extended a boom in commodities, swelling the already abundant coffers of resource-rich nations. But China is slowing, which means commodity prices are falling and, as capital takes flight, China is selling its foreign currency holdings to prop up its currency.\nThese pools of capital are the link between the physical world of commodities and state budgets and the financial world of stocks and bonds, creating a potentially worrying feedback loop.\nProfound shift in status quo It's quite a profound shift in the status quo that has existed for the duration of almost every hedge fund manager, bond trader and private equity tycoon. But is the financial world ready?\nMark Burgess, who ran the Future Fund during 2012 and 2013 and has just returned from a gathering of sovereign wealth funds in Milan, said it always pays to keep a close watch on the actions of the $US7 trillion community of asset managers.\n\"What we may see is withdrawals beginning to occur and this is a dramatic change for sovereign funds, which will now have to sell as well as buy assets; that's going to present opportunities for those that are prepared to invest,\" Burgess said at a panel discussion in Melbourne last week hosted by bond fund JCB.\nThe liquidation of the so-called petrodollars is just half the story. Foreign reserves of high-quality assets, such as US Treasuries and even Australian government bonds, are being dumped onto the market by China as it liquidates its enormous stockpile of foreign bonds.\n\"The standard response to any Chinese problem is that they have $US3.6 trillion of assets. That money has been spent 10 times over in fixing their problems, but they are definitely selling bonds at the moment,\" Jamieson said during the discussion.\n\"In isolation, that's not good for the bond market, but this is not happening in isolation. It's happening because the Chinese domestic economy has issues and it's overriding the fact they need to sell. They are selling to protect against capital flight out of China.\"\nChina's problems are the world's problems and a troubled world translates to weaker growth and stronger demand for bonds.\nBonds hold their own In the past 12 months, when Chinese reserves have begun to fall (and incidentally the US Federal Reserve has wound back its stimulus and flagged higher rates), bonds have held up just fine. The US 10-year rate is virtually unchanged at 2.10 per cent, 5 basis points below the 2.15 per cent yield in mid-October 2014.\nWhile official investors may be selling, Jamieson pointed out that there is a very large private sector \"prepared to take the other side of the trade\".\nThe $US190 billion California Teachers Pension plan (CalSTRS), for instance, revealed intentions to shift as much as 12 per cent from equities into bonds and other defensive assets.\nThat shift is an important reminder of the context of sovereign funds on financial markets. Their size is well and truly eclipsed by the size of pension assets around the world, which stands at about $US33 trillion, one-third of which resides in the United States.\nAnd to Burgess's point: we also shouldn't underestimate the sophistication of sovereign funds that, he believes, are taking a more active approach to managing their assets as market conditions change.\n\"What is interesting is to look at how they have constructed their portfolios to learn about the benefits of diversification. This is going to be required because you will need to pick the eyes out of each asset class,\" he said.\n\"That's the underlying change in the sovereign fund community – that and them having to sell assets for the first time in a decade.\"\nTactical component Others believe there may be more to the selling by sovereign funds than budgetary pressure as a result of falling commodity prices. There may be a tactical component. More large funds are repositioning their funds to be more agile and \"liquid\" in what could be a turbulent period ahead.\nSovereign funds have, as Burgess suggested, considered the coming investment environment and elected a more active approach.\nIt is ironic, and perhaps smart, that some oil-backed funds may be allocating to distressed debt experts that are ready to deploy billions of dollars to bail out or restructure embattled US energy firms that overloaded on debt at a time when the oil price was double its current value.\nIt is also worth considering that while the commodities rout may be triggering an early liquidation of assets by these resource-rich countries to fund their state spending, how they deal with divestment is relevant to all pools of capital – including Australian superannuation funds.\nAs Towers Watson's Tim Hodgson pointed out in a recent interview with The Australian Financial Review , the asset management industry has only known how to accumulate and deploy capital, but has precious little experience managing the liquidation. He fears the industry simply isn't set up for this.\n\"It used to be all about accumulation and, actually, that's only half the story. You have to get people through the decumulation phase as well, and I don't think the system has yet found the answer.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/story/giant-pension-fund-calstrs-to-propose-shift-away-from-stocks-bonds-2015-09-02", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/worlds-biggest-investors-must-think-ahead-with-our-trillions-20150921-gjrgge.html", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8f2eb94c-62ac-11e5-a28b-50226830d644.html#axzz3oLWR5ARR", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-10-13T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:07:24.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
