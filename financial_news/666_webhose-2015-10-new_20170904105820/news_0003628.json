Photo: Bloomberg\nTwitter Inc chief executive Jack Dorsey is giving a third of his Twitter stock to the company's employees, he said in a tweet on Friday.\nThe shares amount to 1 per cent of the San Francisco-based company, worth about $US200 million.\nI'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small.\nJack Dorsey The move is to \"reinvest directly in our people,\" he said. It will go into the employee equity pool.\n\"I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small,\" Mr Dorsey tweeted.\nAdvertisement \"I'm confident we can make Twitter big!\"\nI'm giving ~1/3rd of my Twitter stock (exactly 1% of the company) to our employee equity pool to reinvest directly in our people.\n— Jack (@jack) October 23, 2015\nAs for me: I'd rather have a smaller part of something big than a bigger part of something small. I'm confident we can make Twitter big!\n— Jack (@jack) October 23, 2015 His decision to give away shares may increase employee morale after recent staff cuts and help Twitter expand the pool of stock used to compensate employees without dilution.\nIn the two weeks since he officially took the top job, Mr Dorsey has made some big moves.\nThe CEO cut 8 per cent of Twitter's workforce, appointed a new executive chairman, introduced the new Moments product and held a developer conference.\nMr Dorsey owns a bigger share of Square Inc, the payments company where he is also CEO, which is currently preparing for an initial public offering.\nOf his 24.4 per cent in Square, Mr Dorsey is giving a large portion to an organisation he created. The Start Small Foundation will invest in artists, musicians and local businesses in underserved communities, according to Square's prospectus.\nTwitter will announce third-quarter earnings on October 27.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jack/status/657351519461707776", "https://twitter.com/jack/status/657351775918288896"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:36:42.549+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
