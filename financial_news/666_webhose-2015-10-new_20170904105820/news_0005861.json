Klawe has been recognized nationally for her efforts to increase participation of women in the so-called STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering and math. \n\"If you think about Google , whom do you think about,\" she said. \"You think about Sergey (Brin) and Larry (Page). Sergey and Larry do not look all that attractive to young women. They work by themselves, they don't have a social life, they are very smart but they but really there's not much else they do in their life but sit at a computer and type. Women don't make the connection about the potential of a STEM job.\" \nShe added the problem is \"there isn't this connection between the fact that somebody who is writing software to extend battery life for an electric vehicle is actually doing something wonderful for the earth and something that is actually highly creative and fun. We're not promoting the correct image of what a computer scientist or engineer does, and their potential impact on the world.\" More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:01:09.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
