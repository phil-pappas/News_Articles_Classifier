In a letter to DUH dated Oct. 21 and seen by Reuters, the carmaker said its own tests had shown the Zafira 1.6 CDTi's emission levels complied with EU standard limits.\n\"The DUH's findings imply a subtle suspicion of manipulation on our behalf,\" an Opel spokesman said. \"We strongly deny this accusation.\"\nDUH said the emissions-testing site at the Bern school mainly performs tests for Swiss authorities. It said it planned to examine other diesel models of German and foreign carmakers designed to meet the latest Euro 6 emission standards.\n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by David Goodman)\nOpel Zafira", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:08:39.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
