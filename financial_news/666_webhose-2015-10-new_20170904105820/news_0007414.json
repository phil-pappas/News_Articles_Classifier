Because this is not about short-term popularity but about substance,\" he said.\nGermany expects at least 800,000 migrants this year, almost 1 percent of its population. Merkel's popularity has dropped since she threw open the doors to Syrian refugees nearly two months ago.\nIn her weekly podcast, Merkel said many of those arriving in Germany would have a tough time. \"For some of those who come to us, things will go really well. But there will be a proportion who don't have such a good education and we must make sure that they quickly find work, especially young people.\" (Reporting by Madeline Chambers )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:28:48.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
