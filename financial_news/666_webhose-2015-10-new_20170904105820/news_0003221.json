Photo: Jessica Hromas\nCBL Corporation, the largest and oldest credit surety provider in New Zealand, popped 14 per cent as it made its debut as a $355 million publicly listed company in a deal that raised $114 million to fund offshore growth.\n\"CBL has successfully pursued an international strategy of strong growth by focusing on profitable, non-traditional insurance lines in specific markets. Our new capital structure will allow us to do that even more effectively,\" chairman Sir John Wells said.\nThe boutique company sells reinsurance, property deposit and rental bonds, income protection and builders indemnity insurance.\nOn Tuesday CBL floated as a dual-listed company on the New Zealand Stock Exchange and the Australian Securities Exchange.\nAdvertisement The shares, which were offered at $NZ1.55 ($1.41), closed their first session up 14.2 per cent at $NZ1.77 ($1.61).\nCBL posted an operating profit before tax of $NZ36 million for the year to December, and gross written premium, or revenue, of $NZ240 million.\nIt has forecast 38 per cent earnings growth this year, with hopes pinned on new products, international markets and joint-venture partnerships.\nCBL already sources a large chunk of revenue from Europe, particularly France, and is eyeing expansion in Australia and south-east Asia.\nIt bought Assetinsure, one of Australia's biggest surety bond insurers, for $46 million earlier in 2015.\nPitched with a price range between $NZ1.45 and $NZ1.85 a share, choppy market conditions meant the company had to settle on the final price at the lower end of its target range.\nThe deal reflected a forecast price to earnings ratio for the current financial year of 8.4 times and an implied gross dividend yield of 4.9 per cent for calendar year 2016.\nSources close to the deal said about 90 per cent of the $NZ125 million free float was allocated to institutional investors in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong.\nTwo of the largest investment managers in New Zealand bought into the deal: the $NZ28.8 billion New Zealand Superannuation Fund and the nation's $NZ27 billion Accident Compensation Corporation.\nJoint lead managers on the offer were UBS and Forsyth Barr. CBL was also advised by Bancorp and Minter Ellison Rudd Watts.\nNo large research houses have started formal coverage of the stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:14:07.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
