Britons urged to claim £15bn in lost pensions and bank accounts Are YOU due a windfall? Britons urged to claim £15bn in lost pensions and bank accounts BRITONS have failed to claim billions of pounds of money that is rightfully owed to them by financial institutions, according to a study. PUBLISHED: 17:21, Wed, Oct 21, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:41, Wed, Oct 21, 2015 GETTY Many people could find lost money through a quick online search \nAn estimated £5billion is lying in dormant bank accounts, another £3bn is unclaimed pensions and £1bn is waiting to be paid out by life insurance policies, found cover provider Beagle Street. There is a further £3bn sitting in both National Savings and Investment (NS&I) accounts and unfulfilled shares and dividends. And a further 1million of Premium Bonds worth around £50m have been unclaimed - the largest unclaimed prize is estimated at £25,000.Some people have even failed to claim lottery prize money, with more than £8.5m lying idle, including one £4.6m jackpot winner from Barking. Matthew Gledhill, managing director of BeagleStreet.com, said: \"There is simply too much money sitting unclaimed and far too many people missing out on money that is rightfully theirs. \"For people who have experienced bereavement in the family, a life insurance policy could be a lifeline but there are clearly people who do not know they have been financially protected or have forgotten their policy even exists.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:50:37.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
