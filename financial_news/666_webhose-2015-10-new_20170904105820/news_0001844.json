Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Thomson Reuters in a recent statement on the quarterly metrics, “I am pleased to report another quarter of steady progress. I am encouraged by the way we continue to execute against our key priorities, by the progress towards our financial targets and especially by the underlying performance of our subscription revenues.” \nEarlier this month, Thomson Reuters announced the group’s latest FX trading figures for the month of September 2015 , which showed a tepid growth over the previous month.
