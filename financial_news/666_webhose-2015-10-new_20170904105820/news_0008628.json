(Photo: Business Wire) “The ThinAir Hand Dryer eliminates the need to recess the dryer into a restroom wall to achieve a protrusion of no more than 10 cm, which is beneficial for facilities with walls that are difficult to modify,” said Excel Dryer Vice President of Marketing, William Gagnon. “ThinAir has a lower cost of ownership than other hand dryers, and is easier to install making it a cost effective and affordable option for facilities looking for reliable performance and high efficiency.” ThinAir features a slimmer profile, adjustable speed and sound control, on/off heat, an antimicrobial ABS cover and a washable pre-filter to extend the life of the unit. The speed and sound control can adjust the operational sound level from 75 decibels down to 67 decibels, making it one of the quietest dryers on the market. The on/off heat control brings the wattage down from 960 watts to as low as 333 watts with the heat turned off. As a sensor-activated, touch-free hand dryer, ThinAir reduces touch points and decreases the risk of cross-contamination from users contacting potentially unclean surfaces in a restroom. Optional MICROBAN ® Antimicrobial Wall Guards protect wall finishes from excess water and are ideal for high-traffic restrooms. Wall Guards are both hygienic and easy to clean. ThinAir hand dryers can be ordered in 110 to 240 volts in 60 Hz or 50 Hz for distribution worldwide. Excel Dryer manufactures the only hand dryers that are Made in USA Certified ® , the first to be GreenSpec ® Listed and also qualify for several LEED ® v4 Credits and Green Globes to meet corporate or government sustainability goals.
