Photo: Warner Bros Entertainment\nSome children may not get their Christmas wishes fulfilled this year as Lego's factories, although running at full speed, may not be able to make enough plastic bricks to keep up with demand from toy stores in Europe.\nThe Danish company has become the world's largest toymaker by sales, overtaking US Barbie-maker Mattel, thanks partly to toys linked to movies, including The Lego Movie.\nBut difficulties in forecasting demand accurately means some orders may not be filled on time.\nLego admits it may struggle to keep pace with demand in some markets this Christmas. Photo: Robert Shakespeare\n\"We will not be able to deliver all of the orders coming from customers in the remainder of the year,\" spokesman Roar Trangbaek said.\nAdvertisement He declined to specify which lines of toys or which European countries would be affected.\nMr Trangbaek said the company would be able to deliver the orders it had already received but may have trouble filling new orders later this year.\nThe arrival of the new Star Wars: The Force Awakens movie could bring another boost to Lego sales.

It will add about 3000 workers to its site in Monterrey, Mexico, in an expansion plan that runs through to 2022. Its factory in Hungary will add 150 workers, but that number could expand to 1600 over the next five years, the company said.\nLego already has factories in Denmark, Hungary, Czech Republic and Mexico.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:20:46.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
