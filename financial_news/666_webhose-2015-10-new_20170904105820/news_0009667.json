Similarly, Goldman Sachs lowered their price target to 2,000 from 2,100, and Morgan Stanley cut its 12-month price target to 2,200 from 2,275.\nThose levels are well down from fairly bullish forecasts made at the beginning of the year .\nIn a separate note, Subramanian expressed concern this is shaping up to be a particularly opaque earnings season from companies in the grip of uncertainty.\nBy her count, only 26 S&P 500 companies issued an outlook for the third quarter in September, well below the September or monthly average since 2000. Calling the level “disturbingly low,” Subramanian said that caution could cost companies as the stocks of companies who provide guidance tend to trade at a premium to those who don’t.\nIt’s quiet out there. Almost too quiet. “While this datapoint alone may not be cause for alarm, the building loss of transparency from the S&P 500 amid a volatile market could cause the index to be more penalized than in a less fragile environment,” Subramanian noted.\nThe S&P 500 is 7% off its May high of 2,134.72, while the 50-day moving average for the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -6.69% has jumped 53% over the same period of time.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:10:43.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
