The following dates apply: \nEx-Dividend Date Record Date Payable Date October 2015 10-21-2015 10-23-2015 10-30-2015 IGR’s current annualized distribution rate is 7.6% based on the closing market price of $7.91 on October 8, 2015, and 6.4% on a closing NAV of $9.32 as of the same date. \nFuture earnings of the Fund cannot be guaranteed, and the Fund’s dividend policy is subject to change. For more information on the Fund, please visit www.cbreclarion.com . \nThe Fund’s distribution policy is established by its Board of Trustees. The monthly distribution is set by the Board at regular intervals with consideration of investment income, realized gains, return of capital by portfolio companies, potential net appreciation of investments in “passive foreign investment companies” (“PFICs”), and other net unrealized appreciation and other income expected for the year. Each distribution is expected to be paid from some or all of the following sources: net investment income, realized capital gains and, in certain cases, return of capital. The Fund’s distribution rate should not be confused with pure income or yield. The Fund strives to establish a level monthly distribution that, over the course of the year, will serve to distribute an amount closely approximating the total taxable income of the Fund and all of the returns of capital by portfolio companies received by the Fund during the year. \nCBRE Clarion Global Real Estate Income Fund is a closed-end fund, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and invests primarily in real estate securities. Holdings are subject to change. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. \nFor the current fiscal year (January 1, 2015 to October 31, 2015), the Fund has made or declared ten (10) regular monthly distributions totaling $0.47 per share. The source of the distribution declared for the current month and fiscal year to date is estimated as follows: \nEstimated Source of Distributions: Estimated Allocations Distribution Net Investment\nIncome* \nNet Realized Short-\nTerm Capital Gains \nNet Realized Long-\nTerm Capital Gains \nReturn of\nCapital \nCurrent $0.05 $0.008 (16%) \n-- (0%) \n-- (0%) \n$0.042 (84%) \nYTD $0.47 $0.075 (16%) \n-- (0%) \n-- (0%) \n$0.395 (84%) \n*Includes PFIC losses, as defined below. \nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE SENT A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR INDICATING HOW TO REPORT FUND DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. \nThe Fund invests primarily in real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and similar companies. When these companies make distributions during the year, they do not disclose the character of those distributions. The Fund uses historical information to generate the estimated character reflected in this notice. Until the Fund receives information as to the character of distributions it has received from these companies – generally around January 31 of the following year – it cannot provide a definitive characterization of the source of distributions paid to shareholders. \nThe Fund invests in certain companies that have been designated as PFICs for purposes of U.S. tax regulations. Increases in the value of these PFICs (“PFIC Income”) increase the income of the Fund, even when those gains have not been realized. The amount of net investment income described in the foregoing table (Estimated Source of Distributions) may include PFIC Income. Conversely, decreases in the value of these PFICs (“PFIC Losses”) offset the other investment income of the Fund, even when those losses have not been realized. The amount of net investment income in the foregoing table (Estimated Source of Distributions) may have been reduced by PFIC Losses. \nThe Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. \nShareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table below is based on the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). The Fund’s NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total value of its liabilities. Performance figures are not meant to represent individual shareholder performance. The value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund is determined by the market price of the Fund’s shares. \nThe Fund’s Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year to date 2015 (January 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Cumulative Total Return and the Fund’s Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2015, as well as its Current Annualized Distribution Rate. Moreover, the Fund’s Average Annual Total Return for the preceding five-year period (October 1, 2010 through September 30, 2015) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Fund’s Average Annual Total Return and its Average Annual Distribution Rate for the preceding five-year period. \nFund Performance and Distribution Rate Information: \nYear-to-date 01/01/2015 to 09/30/2015 Cumulative Total Return 1 -8.22% Cumulative Distribution Rate 2 4.70% Preceding Five-Year Period 10/01/2010 to 09/30/2015 Average Annual Total Return 3 8.28% Average Annual Distribution Rate 4 5.95% Current Annualized Distribution Rate 5 6.72% 1 Cumulative Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over the year-to-date time period including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions. 2 Cumulative Distribution Rate for the Fund’s current fiscal period (January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015) measured on the dollar value of distributions in the year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of September 30, 2015. 3 Average Annual Total Return represents the simple arithmetic average of the Annual Total Returns of the Fund for the preceding five-year period. Annual Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions. 4 Average Annual Distribution Rate is the simple arithmetic average of the Annual Distribution Rates for the preceding five-year period. The Annual Distribution Rates are calculated by taking the total distributions paid during the period divided by average daily NAV for the period. 5 The Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the current monthly distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund’s NAV as of September 30, 2015.
