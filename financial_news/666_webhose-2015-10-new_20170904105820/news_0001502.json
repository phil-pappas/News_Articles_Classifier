Tamara Voninski by Joanna Mather A federal government taskforce established in the May budget to look at serious financial crime has recovered $85 million in just three months.\nFocusing on abuse of trusts, offshore tax avoidance and illegal phoenix activity, the Australian Tax Office hit squad has conducted 500 audits since it was established on July 1.\nEight investigations are under way but no further details were released about the amounts involved.\n\"This is a very powerful taskforce,\" Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said in Canberra on Wednesday.\n\"It has the ability to look across jurisdictions, to work with international partners and share information in a way that previously has not been done before.\n\"The government is absolutely committed to ensuring tax avoidance, whether international or domestic, does not corrupt our tax system in Australia.\"\nIllegal phoenix activity involves the intentional transfer of assets from an indebted company to a new company to avoid paying creditors, tax or employee entitlements.\nThe taskforce was announced by former treasurer Joe Hockey in the May federal budget. It was allocated $127.6 million over four years for investigations and prosecutions.\n The Australian Federal Police, Australian Crime Commission and Australian Securities and Investments Commission are involved, among others.\nThe Serious Financial Crime Taskforce builds on the Project Wickenby tax avoidance investigation.\nSeparately, the ATO's Trusts Taskforce has identified between 10 to 20 individual advisers who appear to have developed and facilitated the implementation of tax avoidance schemes.\n\"One taxpayer has been found guilty of dishonestly causing a loss to the Australian tax system and dealing in the proceeds of crime, being sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment with seven years' non-parole,\" an ATO spokesman said.\n\"This matter is now the subject of an appeal by the taxpayer and the ATO.\"\n\"A further four cases involving serious exploitation of trusts have been referred to the Fraud and Anti-Corruption Centre [of the AFP] for joint law enforcement action.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:22:50.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
