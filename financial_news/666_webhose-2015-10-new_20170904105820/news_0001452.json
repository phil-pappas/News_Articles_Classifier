The cut, which is effective as of October 1, will last until the end of the next year. The sales tax cut is a recent move by China to boost its sagging economy. Prior to this, China had cut its benchmark lending rates five times since November 2014.\n\nChina’s passenger car sales fell 3.39% year-over-year (or YoY) in August, as can be seen in the graph above. August marked the third consecutive month in which China’s passenger car sales registered a YoY decline. In the first eight months of 2015, passenger car sales rose at a dismal 2.5% as compared to the last year.\nWill the tax cut help? The rate cuts announced by China (MCHI) have not had much impact on the country’s sagging economic growth. However, a purchase tax cut could have some impact, as it directly benefits consumers. Lower vehicle prices could benefit China’s faltering car sales. Many fence sitters tend to move up their planned purchases to take advantage of such measures.\nHaving said that, almost all auto manufacturers in China are already offering hefty discounts to increase their sales.\nGeneral Motors China is General Motors’s (GM) largest market. The company had record sales of 1.7 million units in the first half of 2015 in China. GM’s China joint ventures generated equity income of over $1 billion in the first half of 2015 at an impressive net profit margin of 10.1%. Ford also posted pretax profits of $192 million in 2Q15 in the Asia-Pacific region at a healthy operating margin of 7.8%. So far the earnings of both these companies have been immune to China’s slowdown. However, we could see a sequential fall in these companies’ 3Q15 China earnings on the back of lower sales.\nMeanwhile, the sales tax cut could lead to more sales in 4Q15. This would benefit automakers such as Ford and General Motors. Auto component suppliers such as Delphi Automotive (DLPH) and Johnson Controls (JCI) would also benefit if China’s vehicle sales picked up.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - US Auto Sales Boom in September, but Stocks Continue to Fall Part 2 - Can Auto Sales Continue Their Upward Trajectory?
