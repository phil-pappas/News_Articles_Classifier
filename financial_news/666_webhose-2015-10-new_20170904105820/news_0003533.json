Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires Morgan Stanley has turned contrarian investor on emerging markets, saying now is the time to buy emerging market and commodity-exposed stocks and currencies while anticipating a sharemarket bounce to finish the year.\nThe US-based investment bank's global strategy team doesn't share market concerns that emerging markets, led chiefly by China, would send the developed world spiralling into a recession.\n\"We believe [global economic] expansion is still in tact, with strong consumer trends in developed markets helping to offset the drag of [emerging markets] growth,\" Morgan Stanley said in its updated Autumn Outlook paper.\n\"This is one reason why we think investors should approach recent weakness as a bull-market correction, rather than a more ominous turning point.\"\nThe 15 per cent pullback in global equities between May and September was consistent with average corrections since 1998, they added.\nDespite the market remaining volatile, Morgan Stanley advised investors to \"keep the faith\", anticipating a strong bounce in equities to finish the year.\nAdding to Morgan Stanley's optimism was that monetary and fiscal policy in emerging markets remained accommodative, while commodity prices and China's currency seem to have stabilised.\n\"Economic activity is showing signs of stabilisation, particularly in manufacturing and China's housing markets,\" strategists James Lord and Hans Redeker said.\n \"This should help capital flows to normalise, reducing the need for currency intervention to maintain stability\" of the Chinese yuan.\nThat would both reduce the need for China to make another snap devaluation from its peg to the US dollar, the first of which took place on August 11, sending markets into a shock sell-off. But China's monetary policy could become more effective.\nBullish bear Meanwhile, recent commodity prices including iron ore, copper and crude oil were encouraging as they remained broadly unchanged since July 31, indicating there had not been a sharp decline in demand in the past two months, the strategists said.\nThe note marked a significant change from Morgan Stanley's previously bearish view on emerging markets. The bank has started strategically buying into emerging markets currencies, in particular the Mexican peso and Indian rupee, which it said were underpinned by \"strong fundamental stories\".\nBut Mr Lord and Mr Redeker warned the long-term view for emerging markets remained \"challenging\" due to a lack of growth prospects, and high debt levels.\nIn equities, exposure in emerging markets should be through companies from developed markets that have exposure to those economies, the report recommended.\nMorgan Stanley favours European and Japanese stocks, which it says are inexpensive and have supportive monetary policy.\n\"We recommend investors raise their exposure to [emerging markets]/commodities given the combination of very low sentiment, attractive relative valuations and a likely inflection in macro sentiment,\" European strategist Graham Secker said.\nBut expectations of a rise in commodity prices in line with historical interest rate rises by the US Federal Reserve are misplaced, as the global environment was vastly different this time, Pimco commodities portfolio manager Nicholas Johnson warned.\n\"The Fed isn't increasing rates today to slow growth or slow inflation, rather they're raising rates to normalise policy. You're likely to not see the same increases in commodity prices,\" he said.\nAdding to that, most commodity markets were dealing with large inventory overhangs, and divergent monetary policies mean a strengthening US dollar will keep pressure on prices.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-10-14T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:02:55.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
