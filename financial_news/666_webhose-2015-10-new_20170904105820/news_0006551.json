The Bank, with the support of our members, will respond ambitiously to this great challenge.\" \nFrench finance ministry officials said other development banks including the European Investment Bank, Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank had made similar pledges for a total of $15 billion in new funds. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Development banks pledge $15 bln in new climate funds: officials AFP \nDevelopment banks including the World Bank have pledged an additional $15 billion a year by 2020 to fight climate â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:40:52.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
