Hardly.\nLike IBM ( IBM - Get Report ) and other business icons in trouble, the Arkansas retailer is simply being squeezed by better competitors -- mainly Americans -- heralding a new age of American innovation. This is the new American century. \n\nLook at Walmart -- its recipe for success was simple. Through a detailed knowledge of supplier costs, disciplined supply chain management and low wages for store personnel the retail bargained hard with manufacturers and delivered goods at the lowest prices.\nUnfortunately, its methods were hardly occult and others, including Dollar General ( DG - Get Report ) and Target ( TGT - Get Report ) caught on, undermining the Arkansas behemoth's competitive edge.
