The current 14.50 euros is due to rise next year to 22 euros. \nFor Nahon, \"we must at least get up to between 20 and 30 euros a ton ... or even go a lot higher than that.\" \nThe European Union is already committed to a 40 percent drop in CO2 emissions by 2030. \nEarlier this year, France's fellow EU state Britain almost doubled its carbon floor price to £18.08 ($27), prompting analysts to see coal-fired power plants being taken out of commission. \nEDF says its own carbon footprint in France is small owing to its 58 nuclear reactors as well as investments in wind and solar power. The French group calculates its emissions at 17 grams (0.6 ounces) of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour -- below a European average of some 300 g/kWh. \nBy 2030, EDF says it wants to double its renewables footprint to 50 gigawatt hours from a current 28. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so it is committed to building a coal-fired power plant in southeastern China. \nBoth EDF and French competitor Engie (Other OTC: ENGIY - news ) have both been criticised by NGOs for their involvement in coal-fired plants. \nEarlier this year, Oxfam France and Friends of the Earth criticised both publicly-owned companies, claiming they emit more than 151 million tonnes of CO2 annually outside France from 46 coal power stations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:18:10.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
