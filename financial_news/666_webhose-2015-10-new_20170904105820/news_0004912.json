Designed to bring together company decision-makers with the creators of the industry’s most innovative technology solutions, this annual industry gathering has become the place to learn about and do research on the best marketing, productivity and workflow solutions available.\nWESTON, FLA (PRWEB) October 09, 2015\nFinancial industry leader Joel Bruckenstein and his event planning team are in the final stages of preparing for the third annual T3 Technology Conference for large RIAs and IBDs interested in learning about the latest and greatest enterprise solutions for their firms. The event will take place at the Bonaventure Resort and Spa in Weston, Florida (a short and lovely drive from the Ft. Lauderdale airport). The opening night reception and pre-conference events take place November 2, 2015. The conference runs November 3rd and 4th. The full conference agenda is available for viewing at http://www.t3enterpriseconference.com/agenda .\nDesigned to bring together company decision-makers with the creators of the industry’s most innovative technology solutions, this annual industry gathering has become the place to learn about and do research on the best marketing, productivity and workflow solutions available.\n“The T3 Enterprise Conference will feature nine general sessions and 34 breakout sessions,” said conference organizer Joel Bruckenstein, CFP®. “We begin the evening of November 2 with our grand opening reception in the exhibit hall, but special by-invitation-only meetings and roundtables will occur earlier that day before the official conference kick-off. November 3 will feature main stage presentations from Riskalyze, MoneyGuidePro, eMoney, Salesforce, Advicent, Junxure, Oranj, Vanare | NestEgg and FolioDynamix.”\n“Breakout sessions will feature many of the amazing sponsors and tech providers in attendance. I’m especially looking forward to visiting all of the booths in the exhibit hall where 40 of the financial services industry’s leading enterprise technology providers will be making announcements and demonstrating their unique solutions. On Wednesday November 4, the conference concludes at 3:40 so that folks can catch an evening flight home. But make no mistake, this final day is jam packed with break out sessions and big announcements. It should also be noted that the exhibit hall sold out this year; would-be sponsors are being put on a waiting list and/or being encouraged to sign up now for next year’s T3 Enterprise conference (which will be held in November 2016) and/or the T3 Advisor conference (which will be held in February 2016),” Bruckenstein concluded.\nPREVIEW OF NEWS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS\nThe T3 Conferences are not just a hotbed of activity and conversation. Many of the industry’s leading technology companies and rising stars make major announcements at T3. “I’m privy to a number of interesting developments and announcements that will be made while we are all together in Florida. In fact, we expect a record number of announcements to be made,” Bruckenstein said. “As a courtesy to members of the media who will be covering the conference in person – and for those who are unable to make the trip but would like to stay on top of all the news – we will be posting major announcements on the T3 blog ( http://www.technologytoolsfortoday.com/blog ). We will be sending out a daily digest of those announcements to members of the press. Anyone who would like to be notified immediately when an announcement goes up on the T3 blog can sign up for an RSS feed ( http://www.technologytoolsfortoday.com/blog/feed ) or follow @t3fan on Twitter.”\nHere is a small sampling of the presentation topics and announcements that Bruckenstein expects to be made, with more details being revealed November 2-4 during the T3 Enterprise conference:\nAdvicent will demonstrate and talk about how demographic shifts, disruptive competition, and consumer expectations are forcing enterprise firms to evolve their market proposition to avoid commoditization. Advicent believes that enterprise organizations that can deliver a modern, interactive client experience that captures the style, strategy and unique story of their respective firm will gain more new clients while keeping existing ones. From multi-channel engagement to peer-planning to client portals and more, organizations that build custom solutions to support the unique collaborative experience will ascend to the top.\neMoney Advisor will demonstrate and talk about financial life in between the numbers and how to create the ultimate client experience. Providing sound financial advice is no longer enough to differentiate advisors from the competition. Today, the most successful advisors understand the importance of creating a unique and inclusive experience that meets a client’s financial and emotional needs. eMoney will share how they are working to revolutionize the client experience with innovative technology to reveal the emotion behind financial decisions.\nJunxure will unveil its ClientFirst initiative, a comprehensive suite of client engagement and productivity tools within Junxure Cloud that help firms elevate their client service levels while keeping productivity high. ClientFirst highlights include a Client Service Monitor, which will provide a “safety net” to ensure no tasks are missed, actionable data automation features triggered by client status changes, and a new client portal that will enable advisors to further customize the client experience. Additionally, Junxure Cloud's upcoming expansion of its reporting dashboard will deliver customizable, at-a-glance metrics on Client Service business development and efficiency. They will share more in their general session and at their booth in the exhibit hall.\nLaserfiche will in their general session talk about beating the robos at their own game. Today’s financial firms need to compete not only with traditional wealth management competitors, but also with emerging online “robo advisors.” Firms that take a page out of the robo playbook can provide an outstanding client experience while complying with stringent regulations and improving margins. Top performers leverage process automation tools to eliminate bottlenecks in core business and compliance processes such as new account opening, blotter submissions and advertising approvals, among others. During their interactive session, a leading broker/dealer will share how they have deployed tech solutions to drive operational efficiencies while delighting their advisors and clients.\nLiquidHub will talk about taking a business-centric approach to technology strategy and planning. Traditional business functions such as marketing, onboarding, and servicing are fundamentally transforming as new technologies emerge and client expectations of digital engagement evolve. Competitive pressures are also forcing more automation to drive efficiency gains. Financial institutions must now come up with ways to remain relevant in a world dominated by technology devices and clients’ insatiable need to be constantly connected. A digital integrator that partners with businesses to improve client engagement and drive growth, LiquidHub will share their expertise, both from the podium and in the exhibit hall.\nOranj CEO and founder David Lyon will in his general session talk about the rise of the digital advisor and how technology is changing the way financial advisors interact with investors. Oranj will also have a big presence in the exhibit hall, where they will be sharing two key enhancements that will be added to their platform this fall – enhancements that will make financial advisors more nimble and efficient while adding value to their client relationships.\nOrion will demonstrate and talk about how financial advisors can avoid being “just status quo.” As new technology abounds, the choices can become exciting but also overwhelming. Attendees will earn how the right technology platform and integration decisions can impact daily work and interactions with clients. During their general session appearance, one of Orion’s top clients will join them on stage to discuss practical steps firms can take to change and improve their business practices.\nRiskalyze CEO and founder Aaron Klein will in a main stage presentation talk about the digital wealth management experience. Riskalyze will also unveil their next-generation platform for putting risk alignment at the heart of advisor productivity, client acquisition and retention, and compliance analytics.\nSalesforce will in their general session talk about how to supercharge wealth advisory teams. To stay competitive, wealth managers and their firms must invest in technology to improve processes and strategies. In the exhibit hall, attendees will learn how Salesforce is helping its wealth management customers reimagine the client-advisor experience, reinvent organizational processes, and rebuild systems in harmony with a new digital, mobile, and social world.\nVanare | NestEgg partner and COO Lex Sokolin will in a main stage presentation share his Millennial perspective on future tech innovation trends and how they will change the financial advice industry. Founder and CEO Rich Cancro and other team members will be present in the exhibit hall, where they will be revealing a new product announcement and demonstrating Vanare’s “next-generation wealth management platform built on Roboadvisor DNA.”\nREGISTRATION AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES\nJournalists may contact Teresa Law at 800-974-7753 or teresalaw(at)impactcommunications(dot)org to request a press pass.\nHeads of IBDs and large RIAs are invited to attend as T3 guests, without charge.
