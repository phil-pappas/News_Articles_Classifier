Photo: Jessica Hromas\nAPP Securities, the re-badged and downsized former BBY business, has secured market participant status with the Australian Securities Exchange, although the firm has steered away from self-clearing equities trades.\nIn a process that has taken about four months, the stockbroking and advisory firm will now be a direct market participant in its own right, while ABN Amro Clearing will continue to conduct the firm's clearing function.\nAPP chief executive Craig Mason told Fairfax Media the process was undertaken relatively quickly as the firm looked to rebuild a business with an emphasis on risk control and profitability.\n\"We don't want to be large, we want to be focused,\" he said, noting that APP wasn't phased about picking up institutional equities market share because \"profitable business\" was a priority.\nAdvertisement \"With direct participation we can facilitate business in a more efficient way.\"\nBut the firm still needs to overcome the sour taste left by the demise of BBY, and creditors and many clients are still fighting to recoup their funds. APP is not linked to the BBY liabilities and acquired only two former BBY entities but not their licences after voluntary administration.\nThe ASX's website says only clients of ASX participants have protection under the National Guarantee Fund, a federal compensation vehicle, and that participation is subject to \"a strong regulatory regime and a clear set of rules\".\nMore stringent requirements Self-clearing of trades, which BBY did, requires more stringent capital requirements of the firm.\nBut Mr Mason said the industry was moving away from that model.\n\"Clients are expecting a greater robustness around their assets,\" he said, adding that investors wanted \"more visibility\" about where funds were held.\nBBY collapsed after run-ins with the ASX over its capital requirements and failing to repay a loan to St George Bank. AIMS Financial Group's George Wang acquired several of the entities and retained some employees, but dropped the BBY name as administrator KPMG uncovered a string of issues at the collapsed firm. Potential fraud and poor financial record-keeping were among KPMG's findings, and the firm also said BBY might have been trading insolvent since June 2014.\nPart of the issue for BBY clients was a shortfall of up to $16 million in their accounts, and the fact that client money might have been mixed together under a legislative loophole.\n\"I think the pooling of assets will continue to have problems both domestically and globally,\" Mr Mason, a former Pershing Securities boss, said.\nHe was tapped to lead APP ahead of a deed of company arrangement being voted on by BBY creditors.\nAPP is building a China and Asia desk for trading and listing companies and has about 63 employees in Sydney and Melbourne.\nMr Mason highlighted a segregation between staff writing business and those with control over the firm's risk profile.\n\"It is more about enforcing behaviour,\" he said.\nï»¿\nAPP hired Peloton Capital's Danielle Smith in August as a compliance manager, while BBY's former head of risk Hitesh Gupta was retained in the same role at APP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:08:54.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
