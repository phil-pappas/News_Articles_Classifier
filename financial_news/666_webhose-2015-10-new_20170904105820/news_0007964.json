United Parcel Service Inc. UPS 0.14 % is setting a new round of rate increases this year and the WSJ’s Laura Stevens and Greg Bensinger report the extra charges are aimed directly at retailers and their cybershopping strategies . UPS says it will follow FedEx Corp. FDX 0.24 % in boosting its fuel surcharge for the second time this year, nearly double its fee for oversize items and add a surcharge next year for third-party billings—the practice where merchants apply their shipping discounts to separate online marketplaces. That’s one way retailers are using cheap shipping in their online sales competition, a battle parcel carriers don’t look interested in underwriting.\nThe U.S. Postal Service doesn’t look any more interested than the private package carriers in handling more cheap e-commerce shipments. The USPS is looking for a 9.5% increase for commercial-package shipping rates and double-digit hikes in its bread-and-butter business of shipping packages weighing less than a pound , the WSJ’s Laura Stevens reports. The request to the Postal Rate Commission marks a complete turnaround from last year, when the Postal Service slashed rates for high-volume Priority Mail shippers. The lightweight end is the biggest concern for the USPS since postal officials say they make only a penny on those residential deliveries. Commercial customers may be more worried over the long term that the Postal Service, long a sanctuary for low-cost shipping, is so tightly focused on its per-package profitability.\nThe big factories going up in a rural area south of Ho Chi Minh City are a sign of the shifting winds of global trade. The WSJ’s Kathy Chu reports the agricultural expanse of the Long An province is giving way to industrial parks and big factories like one recently established for sportswear company Nike Inc. NKE 1.30 % Economists expect the rush of foreign investment heading into Vietnam to accelerate if the U.S. and other Pacific Rim nations ratify the landmark Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Trade experts expect more garment business to move to Vietnam, but South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. SSNHZ 0.00 % plans to nearly double its current $4.5 billion investment in manufacturing electronics in Vietnam. That may help redraw the country’s supply chains as surely as factories are remaking the countryside.\nTRANSPORTATION ENLARGE The biggest retailers get discounts of as much as 60% with UPS and FedEx, price breaks some pass along for third-party marketplace sales. Photo: Stephen Brashear/Getty Images China’s once-world-beating economy sputtered further in the third quarter. The 6.9% growth is the slowest pace since the global financial crisis and the WSJ’s Mark Magnier reports the weak number, along with other poor economic data released Monday, it renews pressure on Beijing to take more actions to jump start expansion . Even in a slowdown, China’s economy remains a major engine for global consumption and production, adding to the stakes as the country’s leadership addresses the deceleration. China is trying to shift its economy from a focus on goods production to one that relies more consumer spending and services. Exports remain a linchpin of the economy, however, and new policy moves are likely to aim at the sector and echo around the world.\nU.S. highway programs expire in 10 days and that means another short-term extension of transportation spending is on the way. Congressional aides say that even with a new long-term plan ready to move in the U.S. House, there is little time to get a vote on the $325 billion, six-year measure and then reconcile it with a separate plan in the Senate. The shipping business may be anxious to see the transportation framework advance since it would establish a new freight and infrastructure program. But the House plan also keeps in place one long-established feature of highway spending: a shortfall in revenue to pay for the programs and no suggestions for how to close the gap.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ At some point some of the charge is going to get pushed back to the purchaser of the goods. ’\n—John Haber, chief executive of Spend Management Experts, on shipping price increases.\nIN OTHER NEWS Industrial production fell 0.2% in September and factory capacity utilization declined.
