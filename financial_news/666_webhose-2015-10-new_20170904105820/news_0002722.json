And if we get a cold winter, we will see a spike in power prices.\" \nNational Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) last week confirmed that Britain faced the worst power crunch in a decade this winter as old coal power stations close. \nThe spare capacity margin - the 'safety buffer' between peak demand and available supply was forecast to fall as low as 1.2pc before National Grid intervened with emergency measures to bolster it to 5.1pc - still the lowest since 2007-08. \nMr Marchant, the former chief executive of 'Big Six' giant SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) , said: \"We have not had a seasonally cold winter for the last four or five years, and that will be the real test. \n\"If we have a normal winter we will be fine, it is if there is a sustained cold spell - that is when the system will get under stress. \n“I am not talking about the lights going out, I'm talking about very high spot prices that force commercial organisations to effectively ration demand.” \nUnder one of its emergency schemes to cope with the tight margin, National Grid has already signed up a number of businesses who may be paid to switch off between 4pm and 8pm on winter weekdays . \nHowever Mr Marchant suggested a cold spell could still cause problems for other businesses. \nOnce all available power plants were already running flat out, \"the price has to go up sufficiently to stimulate people to reduce demand\", he said, suggesting prices could “easily double”. \nBusinesses confronted with high electricity prices might instead say “we are going to shut our factory two hours early”, he said. \nSome businesses could also see their energy companies cut off their supplies because they had signed up for “interruptible” contracts, where they pay a lower price usually in return for agreeing they may be cut off in a supply crunch. Mr Marchant said experience from when this happened in the last decade suggested affected businesses would still “howl with protest”. \nHe said households should not see any short-term effect because big energy companies would have bought most of their electricity in advance but such spikes could feed through to increases of 5pc or 10pc in longer-term power prices. \nThe Government and energy regulator Ofgem have also been keen to reassure consumers that the lights will stay on. \nBut the warnings of rising prices echo comments made by former Ofgem chief Alastair Buchanan, who warned in 2013 that margins falling below 5pc in years to come would be \"uncomfortably tight\" and said: \"We have to face the likelihood that avoiding power shortages will also carry a price.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:21:39.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
