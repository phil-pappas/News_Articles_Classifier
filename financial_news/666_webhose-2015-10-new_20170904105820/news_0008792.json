Bloomberg by Matthew Stevens Ivan Glasenberg's decision to shut-in 500,000 tonnes of zinc capacity around the Glencore globe will doubtless galvanise markets for both the rust-protecting metal and the commodity trader's shares.\nBut the news will come as a threatening blow at Mt Isa, the legendary home of Queensland mining, whose moniker was coined by the Melbourne-born prospector who first revealed one of the world's great lead-zinc deposits on the fringes of the great savannah to the north of the Cloncurry copper district.\nMt Isa is the processing hub around which Glencore's massive Australian zinc and copper business swings. And it is the company's Australian zinc and lead mines that will carry by far the greatest weight of Glasenberg's apparently pretty individual view of commercial rationality.\nFor the better part of two years, Glasenberg has chastised his major international competitors for their pursuit of price eroding production growth. The legendary commodities trader remains resolute that this is a dumb way to operate. Through this year of trauma across all minerals and metals markets, he has translated that narrative into resolute action.\nHaving cut coal production in the face of enduring price misery and structural over-supply and closed in his highest cost copper mines in Africa, Glasenberg has now turned his laser on Glencore's struggling zinc business. And this time around - for the first time - the bulk of the burden of the Glasenberg Doctrine will be carried by Australian workers.\nFrom Saturday morning, mining all mining will stop at Glencore's Lady Loretta zinc mine. At the same time, work will slow profoundly at the company's costly and consistently controversial Macarthur River project and it will be trimmed at the margins at the Swiss giant's biggest Australian lead-zinc mine, George Fisher.\nIn all about half of Glencore's Australian zinc production will be shut in to wait for better days, with Mt Isa's satellite zinc mines contributing 380,000 of the production targeted for temporary closure.\nMore than 500 jobs will go across the three operations with Lady Loretta and George Fisher losing just more than 200 a piece and Macarthur River something less than 100.\n The reason these workers – most of them fly in-fly out miners – will lose there jobs is that the zinc market is in shallow over-supply and, as a result, the price is running at cyclical lows. As we understand it, the Lady Loretta and Macarthur River operations are barely cash positive at current prices.\nThings are slightly better at the much bigger George Fisher underground mine but it looks like Glencore has decided to preserve capital by constraining the investment necessary to sustain production levels. So it will keep operating but output will be allowed to wither slowly until zinc prices induce the investment necessary to rebuild the production base.\nThere are two basic principals at work here.\nFirst Glencore is under the most severe pressure to preserve and protect its cash flows as it moves to trim a $US50 billion debt burden that has investors and credit markets repricing the risk of investing in the company.\nSo, as part of a $US10 billion cost management exercise, it is closing in high cost mines measured against both its own production fleet and by those of its competitors. This is patently sensible.\nAnd second, Glasenberg believes unshakeably in the idea that his minerals resources should be preserved in the face of poor pricing. As well, with good reason, he is convinced that by reducing supply to bring markets into balance, Glencore can bring forward price recovery.\nBack in early September when Glencore confirmed the 18 months long closure of copper mines in Zambia and Congo, the copper price spiked about 2 per cent and it has pretty much held that gain since.\nThe story is the same in thermal coal. Glencore has plans to chop 15 million tonnes of annual production from its coal stream. It is working methodically towards that end.\nSince that decision was made, pricing at the top end of the thermal coal quality chain have held comparatively solid and the word is that, over the past week, Glencore has earned itself a surprisingly solid price settlement with Japanese contract customers.\nWhat works in copper and coal will likely work better in zinc. Unlike other traded metals, there is not really any sort of secondary market in zinc. To use it you have to buy it from someone who has dug it up and turned it into metal. Unlike say copper, you cannot recycle it.\nThe Glencore view is that the zinc is currently priced at a discount to is market fundamentals, that the over-supply is slight if it exists at all and that a number of mature zinc mines (including Australia's Century mine) are about to disappear from the system.\nSo it is banking on a speedy recovery that will see the zinc price move into a trading band that better reflects the post-GFC trends. That view implies a floor price maybe 10 per cent higher than where zinc sits right now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:16:15.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
