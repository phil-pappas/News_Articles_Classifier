Darrian Traynor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin David Gram, head of marketing at Lego's Future Lab – which is tasked with inventing \"the future of play\"– says the Danish toymaker learnt some hard lessons when it almost went bankrupt in 2004.\nIn Australia to speak to companies about \"intrapreneurship\" – getting big business to embrace an entrepreneurial culture – Mr Gram warns that in the race to innovate, companies can lose sight of their core identity or DNA\n\"If you forget that, innovation can sometimes go in all directions,\" Mr Gram told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"In the 90s the business was going OK but the profits were not all that great, so we had some brilliant consultants fly in and say, 'well guys this piece of plastic, this brick is really obsolete, it's been around since the '50s, why don't you diversify into all kinds of other toys that your competitors are doing, Mattel has a huge portfolio of various products, the brand is strong,' so we did,\" Mr Gram said. \"We did action figures and all kinds of other toys and what happened was that actually the company almost went bankrupt. Consumers lost track of who we were,\" the marketing executive told an Interactive Minds breakfast in Melbourne.\nThe 2014 smash hit The Lego Movie reignited children's love for the Lego brand. Lego's Danish founder refused to put the company into bankruptcy and instead poured in $400 million to return the business to its core Lego brick which had clicked together since 1958. Lego continued to innovate but under new global CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp established firm structures and processes . \"The rule we set after the crisis is that it has to be obviously Lego but never seen before,\" Mr Gram said.\nMarketing alliances with the Harry Potter and Star Wars franchise movies helped re-ignite the brand and in 2014 the smash hit The Lego Movie resurrected Lego to become Forbes 2015's Most Powerful Brand with a net profit in the first six months of this year which has jumped 30 per cent to 3.6 billion kroner ($750 million).\nDon't make budgets too big to fail Another key Lego lesson is to keep business budgets \"so small\" that executives are not afraid to fail.\nPart of Lego's success has been harnessing fans and marketing alliances with movie franchises like Star Wars. Luis Ascui \"Executives have a tendency that if they have something they really want to get done, they just keep throwing cash at it,\" Mr Gram said. \"With more money, comes more stakeholders, more steering committees and generally the project just gets so big that they are too big to fail. These projects can wreck an organisation for years but nobody dares shut it down because it is too important, it is too big, it has to continue.\"\nMr Gram said their secretive R&D arm experiment with new products using low risk pilots, despite the protests of their engineers.\n\"In order to get faster to the market we only develop the few key features that are really needed. A typical engineering mistake is wanting to invent all the things the product might consist of in one go and then launch it but learning from the software industry ... we throw that into the market and get feedback from consumers.\"\nHarnessing fans Lego also began \"accrediting\" fans who were using their IP, rather than fighting them in the courts, and crowdsourcing ideas for new Lego products.\n\"When we started up our crowdsourcing site, there was complete resistance in the company. Nobody wanted an external platform. No, we have our designers, they know better. We don't want to show our competitors what we are doing, so it was a no, no.\"\nThe Future Lab team pushed ahead anyway with a beta site in Japan called Cuusoo where fans proposed two Japanese submarines which became among Lego's most popular local products. The global platform followed and support for Lego's Minecraft set also became a best-seller.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lego-profit-boosted-by-asia-1441171591", "http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/10/features/building-success", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://harrypotter.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathryndill/2015/02/19/lego-tops-global-ranking-of-the-most-powerful-brands-in-2015/", "http://www.interactiveminds.com.au/", "http://www.fastcompany.com/3040223/when-it-clicks-it-clicks", "http://starwars.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:19:12.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
