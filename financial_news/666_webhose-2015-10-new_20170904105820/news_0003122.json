Even if you have previously tendered for your GTU units, you are still eligible to receive this enhanced value. Sprott believes it is unfair that you have been burdened with financing the costly lawsuits and expensive advisors to protect GTU's manager, the Spicer family and the fees they receive , and have made this amendment to our offer to compensate GTU unitholders for this abuse of trust. SPROTT IS NOW OFFERING GTU UNITHOLDERS ADDITIONAL VALUE \nAs of October 5, 2015, GTU unitholders would receive a premium of US$1.14 per GTU unit based on trading value and the NAV to NAV exchange ratio, including the increased consideration. We would remind you that historically GTU has traded at significant discounts to the actual price of gold , and when this offer was announced on April 23, the premium was over US$3.00 per GTU unit. \nThe Sprott offer provides you with an opportunity to exchange your GTU units for PHYS units at an immediate and attractive premium on a NAV to NAV basis, receive additional consideration of US$0.10 per GTU unit payable in PHYS units, and trade a management team committed to entrenchment and self-dealing for one committed to protecting and enhancing the value of your investment. GTU DOESN'T WANT YOU TO TENDER SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO PROFIT FROM YOUR INVESTMENT \nIt is only through the public spotlight that the Spicers and GTU have been forced to disclose the variety of fees paid by the Spicers to supposedly independent trustees. Only hollow justifications have been offered in response, as compared to the real value we are offering you through this unique opportunity. \nDo not miss your opportunity to get the value for your investment that you deserve. We encourage you to tender your units as soon as possible. \nUnitholders have a unique opportunity to exchange their units for an immediate premium and with the assurance of management by a regulated entity that is committed to their best interests. ONLY YOU CAN UNLOCK IMMEDIATE VALUE FOR YOUR INVESTMENT TENDER YOUR UNITS BEFORE THE CURRENT OFFER EXPIRES AT 5:00PM ON OCTOBER 30, 2015 \nIn connection with this increase in consideration, the expiry time for the Sprott offer is being extended to 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on October 30, 2015. We currently anticipate this extension will be the final extension to the Sprott offer. \nGTU unitholders who have questions regarding the Sprott offer are encouraged to visit our dedicated website at http://www.sprottadvantage.com or contact Sprott's unitholder services agent, Kingsdale Shareholder Services at 1-888-518-6805 (toll free in North America) or at 1-416-867-2272 (outside of North America) or by e-mail at contactus@kingsdaleshareholder.com . \nThank you for your support. \nSincerely, CEO, Sprott Asset Management \nSoliciting Dealer Fee \nSprott is committed to providing GTU and Silver Bullion Trust (\"SBT\") unitholders with an opportunity to own a superior product. In order to reach these unitholders, as is common in transactions with a large retail base, Sprott has agreed to pay to each soliciting dealer a solicitation fee of US$0.1358 per GTU unit and US$0.0448 per SBT unit deposited through such soliciting dealer if such unit is either (i) taken-up and paid for under the applicable Sprott offer (as detailed below), or (ii) provided the Merger Transaction (as defined in the applicable Sprott offer) is completed, deemed to be withdrawn from the applicable Sprott offer under the Merger Election (as defined in the applicable Sprott offer), subject to a minimum fee of US$50.00 and a maximum fee of US$1,500.00 with respect to each beneficial unitholder of GTU or SBT and a minimum deposit of 300 GTU units or 1,000 SBT units. Where units deposited and registered in a single name are beneficially owned by more than one person, only one minimum and maximum amount will be applied. \nSprott Private Wealth LP will act as dealer manager for the soliciting dealer groups in Canada, which groups will consist of members of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Sprott ‎Global Resource Investments, Ltd. will act as dealer manager for the soliciting dealer groups in the United States, which groups will consist of members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. \nInquiries regarding the soliciting dealer groups may be directed to Glen Williams, Director of Communications for the Sprott Group at 1-416-943-4394. \nAdditional Details of the Sprott Offers \nSprott's offer for each of GTU and SBT (each a \"Sprott offer\") is subject to conditions, including, but not limited to, the number of GTU or SBT units (as applicable) in respect of which an Exchange Offer Election or Merger Election (as such terms are defined in the Sprott offers) has been made, together with the number of GTU or SBT units (as applicable) held as of the Expiry Time (as such term is defined in the Sprott offers) by or on behalf of Sprott, if any, representing at least 66 2/3% of the then issued and outstanding GTU or SBT units (as applicable); the receipt of all necessary governmental or regulatory approvals; no material adverse change in relation to GTU or SBT; GTU, SBT, Sprott Physical Gold Trust and Sprott Physical Silver Trust (together with Sprott Physical Gold Trust, the \"Sprott Physical Trusts\") not being prohibited by applicable law from completing the Merger Transactions (as such term is defined in the Sprott offers); and no litigation or regulatory order that may jeopardize the Sprott offers, as described in the Offer Documents (as defined below). \nEach Sprott offer is open for acceptance until 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on October 30, 2015, unless extended or withdrawn.
