The solution is tailored to the requirements of asset managers while leveraging the power and functionality of Murex's market leading front-to-back-to-risk platform. In the current economic and regulatory environment, asset managers are having to diversify their investments to meet clients' needs and to improve performance. Both regulators and investors are demanding greater transparency, with fuller reporting and explanation of results. Securities and cash inventories need to be consolidated in a timely manner and managed more proactively to meet the evolving margining requirements for cleared and non-cleared products. Randa Saghieh, head of Murex Asset Management, comments: “More sophisticated risk analytics are required, not only to comply with new rules, but also to enable managers to include risk more effectively in their investment decisions. Our new solution has evolved to support clients in all these challenges.” Among the extended features of the new release is an enhanced version of the Investment Management Risk & Performance Attribution module. The module takes advantage of the extensive cross-asset coverage and sophisticated pricing and risk analytics capabilities of the MX.3 platform with detailed decomposition of risk and performance by effects, at any aggregate or detailed level. This makes it easier for managers to monitor their sources of risk ex-ante, and how their bets are placed, as well as to explain the risk/return decisions ex-post to investors. Managers can now also rebalance their portfolio against an optimal portfolio so that it aligns with their ex ante risk expectations. The release also benefits from major investments in the Collateral space: managers can now rely on full collateral management and transformation capacity including securities and cash, margining, and margin call processing . MX.3 for Investment Management provides full automation throughout the investment lifecycle, integrating performance attribution and other dedicated portfolio management functionality with order management, compliance and risk. Asset managers can rely on MX.3 strong instruments offering to diversify their investments to meet clients' return expectations and improve performance.
