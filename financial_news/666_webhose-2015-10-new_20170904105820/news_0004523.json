Photo: Supplied\nYour friendly barista may know the secret to making a killer latte. But do they know how to fill the tips jar ?\nSome say it's the funny slogan attached: \"Tippers make better lovers\" or \"Every time you don't tip a child gets a mullet\".\nGhebar used a sign that read, \"Please help, my mum thinks I'm a barrister\" to reel in the tips.\nWhile others swear by tip jar contests where more than one tip jar is used and customers are asked to vote by putting their change into their preferred jar. It could be anything from \"iPhone v Android\" to \"Vegemite v Peanut Butter\".\nBut there's only one sure way to attract loose change and it doesn't involve a sign. Cafe experts say it always comes down to two simple things – serving up a great product with friendly service.\nAdvertisement Jason Ghebar was a full-time barista for six years and now owns five Sydney cafes including Charlotte Cafe in Birchgrove. He says friendly service is the number one way to keep the tips coming.\n\"It's not rocket science – the secret to getting tips is good service,\" he says.\n\"If anyone tells you anything else, tell them I said they're a liar.\"\nService with a smile or even better, a laugh, is key to drawing tips, Ghebar says.\n\"Tipping really comes down to how the person is feeling at the time that you serve them,\" he says.\n\"No one wants to tip someone who is frowning and if you're funny or crack a joke, you've got a lot more chance of that person recognising that you deserve something extra.\"\nOf course, not everyone will feel compelled to throw a few coins into the tips jar. Tipping is a contentious topic in Australia with a 2010 McCrindle Research survey finding 56 per cent of Australians tip rarely or not all.\nIn the US hospitality workers depend on tips to make up part of their income, but it's just the icing on the cake for Australia's cafe and restaurant workers. Yet it supplements low salaries for baristas, who earn an average of $37,632, and waiters, who make $32,205 according to PayScale.\nBen Coyle, author of Spilling the Beans and owner of Dancing Dog cafe in Melbourne, says customers contribute about $200 to the cafe tip jar every week. When it's not being divided between staff, it gets donated to charity, he says.\n\"It all goes to the staff – I have a manager who will divvy it up at the end of the month,\" he says.\n\"We don't go out of our way to create tips. It's really about smiles and your staff giving a good experience.\n\"It's saying thank you for your service or a nice coffee.\"\nContactless technology such as payWave and PayPass have now made it even harder for customers to reward good service with tips.\nAlthough this has been countered by equally new technology such as DipJar – a unit similar to a credit card swiper – greater adoption of the digital wallet means less money in the tip jar.\nFollow these five steps to inspire your customers to dip into their hip pockets for tips:\nMake it fun\nGreet your customers with a smile and match that smile with a fun atmosphere. This is especially important for baristas and waiters who serve time-poor caffeine-addicts every morning.\nIf you use humour in your banter or on the tips jar sign, make sure it's in good taste. Ghebar used a sign that read, \"Please help, my mum thinks I'm a barrister\" to reel in the tips.\nBe seen\nThere's no point having a tip jar if it's hiding behind a jar of biscuits, says Coyle. Clearly label your tips jar and take care not to place it in a spot that's too obvious as to be intrusive.\nKickstart it\nPut a few gold coins, instead of silver coins, in your tips jar to get things started. It stimulates customers to donate the same. Elgin Taylor, author of Marketing Psychology Secrets, calls this \"seeding\" the tips jar.\nGet to know your customers\nMemorising your customers' names and what they like to order will go a long way towards making them feel welcome. \"Regulars\" can make great tippers, especially if they are always treated to warm service.\nBe fast\n\"Coffee it's one of those things people want really quickly and the longer you make them wait the more they've got to whinge about,\" says Ghebar.\n\"If you give them a good product, you give it to them nice and quick with a joke at the same time, that's probably the best chance you've got of getting a tip.\"", "external_links": ["http://mccrindle.com.au/ResearchSummaries/Australians-are-Tiny-Tippers.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-13T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:13:31.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
