Photo: Andrew Meares Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Former Treasurer Joe Hockey has bowed out of politics proposing controversial tax changes and pleading for an end to the revolving door of leadership changes on both sides of Parliament, saying it was the ruination of good policy-making.\nIn an emotive and powerful farewell, Mr Hockey called for policy changes that he either shied away from or was unable to implement in government.\nHe called for a GST with a higher rate and broader base, concessional taxes on superannuation to be \"carefully pared back\", for negative gearing to be \"skewed towards new housing\", and for penalty rates, which he said inflicted \"profit murder\" on business, to be looked at.\nMr Hockey said it was inconceivable that in this day and age there was still \"non means-tested welfare\" in which he included Medicare and public schools.\n\"We need co-payments in health, greater cost recovery in education and universal means-testing in welfare so we have a sustainable and affordable social safety net for those most vulnerable in the community,\" he said.\nOn tax, Mr Hockey hit out, advocating controversial solutions, many of which he had been forced to reject when in government. The Turnbull government is still not committed to any of them.\nCall to lift and broaden GST \"We must increase and over time broaden the GST, we must lower all income tax so people and companies are given more incentive to take risks and receive rewards,\" he said.\n At a minimum, Mr Hockey said there should be a 40 per cent top personal tax rate \"at a much higher threshold\" than the current $180,000, a 20 per cent rate for most taxpayers and 20 rate for business.\n\"We should be wiser and more consistent on tax concessions to help pay for that, in particular tax concessions on superannuation should be carefully pared back. In that framework, negative gearing should be skewed towards new housing so that there is an incentive to add to the housing stock rather than an incentive to speculate on existing property.\"'\nHe also revealed that before he lost his job, he had approval to impose a levy on traffic movements at Kingsford-Smith airport to help fund the second Sydney airport at Badgery's Creek.\nMr Hockey will leave after 19 years and replace Kim Beazley as Australia's ambassador to the United States. His career came to an abrupt end last month when Malcolm Turnbull rolled Tony Abbott for the leadership.\nMr Hockey said such business had to stop, for the good of the nation. He said voters would never respect politicians who did not respect each other.\nJam the revolving door \"That's why the revolving door in Australian politics must be jammed shut. If we don't show enough respect to each other then how can we hope that the electorate will respect us?\" he said.\n\"The stability of the Howard Government has been replaced with rapid and unpredictable changes of Government on both sides. That turnover has dramatically weakened the policy hand of whoever occupies the Government benches in this chamber.\n\"Most public servants are very good but some, confused by the inconsistency of policy and the rapid change in the number of Ministers, they will simply wait out a Minister or a Government when they are asked to implement very difficult decisions.\"\n\"Ultimately, this chamber can end up being responsible for its own undoing. We cannot make it normal to have four Prime Ministers and four Treasurers in just four years. Leadership instability and ministerial turnover is the enemy of good public policy.\"\nHe said the Abbott government was good at policy but poor at politics and acknowledged the 2014 budget was over-ambitious.\nHe conceded he and Mr Abbott did not do enough to win the hearts and minds of the people and the Senate and that they underestimated the time constraints of national security and hosting the G20 in 2014.\nMr Hockey's wife, children, father, sister and brother were among those in the chamber for the speech. So were former colleagues and friends, including NSW state Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-21T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:04:59.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
