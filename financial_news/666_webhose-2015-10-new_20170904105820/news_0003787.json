Picture: TREVOR SAMSON Related articles Wage bill crowds out all else Chaotic scenes as EFF and student protest The medium-term budget policy in a nutshell State seeks stronger control over its entities No intention to cut infrastructure, says Nene Treasury allots R200m to nuclear plan Step forward as cabinet insists on single NHI proposal Nene says no new funds will be allocated for higher education in 2015 In this article Companies and organisations: Reserve Bank | Treasury People: Nhlanhla Nene WHEN foreign fund managers visit SA to check on how the economy is doing, the officials they see, more often than not, are those of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, who play a kind of financial communications role for SA Inc, over and above their day jobs.\nThey do it well. That means there is often a disconnect between the face visiting investors in stocks and bonds see and the less investor-friendly face they might find if they were to connect with other government departments, which have different and often competing priorities.\nThere was a sense of that disconnect on Wednesday in the medium-term budget documents and in the budget speech Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene managed, somewhat belatedly, to present to a Parliament that had the Economic Freedom Fighters staging \"fees must fall\" protests inside while students protested outside.\nNene made all the right, measured comments about the need to find a sustainable model to fund universities in the longer term as well as to find a solution to the crisis in the short term. He also said all the right things about the need to strengthen partnerships and take bold action to restore growth momentum. He spoke of improving the efficiency of government, and of government spending.\nThe budget book spoke of building a more competitive economy. And there was much about how government was implementing the National Development Plan, even if not necessarily quickly or consistently, and embarking on structural reforms to remove constraints to economic growth. (There was even a commitment to a new socioeconomic impact assessment process that would test the effect of proposed new legislation or regulations — though the invisibility of the regulatory impact assessment the government promised several years ago might prompt scepticism about that.)\nNene and his officials did the right things with the budget too, providing the reality check investors and rating agencies were probably looking for, but nonetheless managing to craft a three-year medium-term framework that will bring the deficit down and stabilise the public debt ratio.\nHe was frank about slower growth and volatility remaining features of the world economy for some time, but made it clear that SA’s growth woes were as much, if not more, of its own making. He was frank about the constraints this placed on the government, saying not once but twice that \"if we do not achieve growth, revenue will not increase. If revenue does not increase, expenditure cannot be expanded.\" And he made it crystal clear that the steep public sector pay increase agreed on earlier this year had \"crowded out\" the government’s ability to increase spending on almost anything else, or to employ more people.\nThe budget process is often easier, paradoxically, when there is no money. With Nene apparently getting the buy-in of his colleagues to shift spending around, and the Treasury undertaking 14 \"deep dig\" reviews of pots of public spending such as catering and travel over the past two years, he has managed to stick with the expenditure ceiling put in place in 2012 that fixes government spending in each of the three years in absolute terms, making for real inflation-adjusted growth of just 1.6% a year over the medium term. The Treasury has turned that spending ceiling into a long-term fiscal \"rule of thumb\", which should please rating agencies — and provide for fiscal policy to be disciplined while taking the edge off economic downturns and upturns.\nAs always with budgets, though, the devil is in the detail. The numbers Nene presented on Wednesday deliver to an extent on the fiscal consolidation that had been promised, with the deficit coming down and the debt ratio stabilising, but they may turn out to be a case, again, of kicking the can down the road. For the current year, the numbers come in on target despite a revenue shortfall of R7.6bn, with a consolidated budget deficit that, at 3.8%, is slightly below February’s estimate, thanks to the R13.5bn Unemployment Insurance Fund contribution holiday that did not happen and some financial profits on the rand exchange rate.\nNext year takes a much larger hit, with the deficit revised up to 3.3% from 2.6%, while the following fiscal year, 2017-18, sees a revision from 2.5% to 3.2%. A deficit that stays in the 3% range rather than falling into the 2% range may still count as an acceptable fiscal consolidation path. It works to stabilise the gross debt ratio, which had doubled since the financial crisis, at about 49% of gross domestic product even though the net debt ratio rises to 45% as the Treasury draws down on its cash balances.\nThe trouble is that this relies on a forecast for economic growth in 2017 that, at 2.6%, is much more optimistic than the Reserve Bank’s 2% or the even lower International Monetary Fund forecast. The Treasury’s economists seem more optimistic about Eskom’s ability to turn electricity supply around and the global economy’s ability to pick up growth momentum than some of their peers, and perhaps (hopefully) they will be right, even though 2.6%, followed by 2.8% in 2018, is hardly shooting the lights out — and hardly what SA needs to cut unemployment or poverty, or what the government needs if it wants to deliver on promises to fund nuclear or National Health Insurance programmes or expand higher education.\nEven those growth numbers are subject to what economists call \"downside risk\". So are the tax collections that for the past many years have tended to grow faster than the economy has grown, but that trend could also change.\nBriefing journalists ahead of his budget speech, Nene opened with, \"If you find it boring, there is a very good reason.\" Hardly the stuff of great headlines, even though when it comes to fiscal policy, boring is generally good, as is realism — especially in a climate in which SA is vulnerable to rating agency downgrades and capital outflows.\nBut as much as it needs prudent fiscal policy, and prudent macroeconomic policy generally, SA desperately needs higher growth. And as Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile put it, there is only so much fiscal or monetary policy can do to support economic growth.\nImplementing the structural reforms needed to remove the constraints to growth and make the economy a lot more competitive is largely outside Nene’s job description — \"trespassing on territories that are supervised by Cabinet colleagues\", as he put it on Wednesday about some of the challenges that needed to be attended to to transform SA and put it on a new growth path.\nHowever good the spin, and however carefully crafted the budget framework, there are limits to how far the people at the Treasury or the Reserve Bank can go to make that growth story happen if the government does not line up with it. And the risks, as they say, are on the downside.\n• Joffe is editor at large", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:43:49.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
