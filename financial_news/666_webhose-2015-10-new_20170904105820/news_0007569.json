Photo: John Woudstra\nIt took 30 years for vitamins maker Blackmore's shares to reach $100, and just six weeks for it to add another $50. Organic baby formula maker Bellamy's Australia has gone from an issue price of $1 in July, 2014 to be seven times higher now at above $7.\nAustralian investors have watched plenty of bubbles over the past 15 years. There is an increasing sense that health foods and vitamins may be the modern-day version of the mining boom and slow bust, and the much-faster dot com boom and bust of 1999 and 2000.\nWhile both Blackmores and Bellamy's are well-run and highly-respected companies, they are both trading on price-earnings multiples of around 40 times expected 2015-16 earnings. Contrast that with the long-run average of a forward-looking p-e for the Australian sharemarket of between 15 to 16 times.\nThere's no doubt the broad market dynamics are running absolutely the right way for both companies and investors see vast potential for both as they capitalise on strong demand from China and other Asian countries for trusted brands made in a \"clean and green\" environment, with rigid quality control.\nAdvertisement Investors fortunate enough to take a slice of the Tasmanian-based Bellamy's at $1 a share have absolutely cleaned up. A seven-bagger is a stellar outcome at a time when sharemarkets have the wobbles and there are question marks across the globe about a low-growth economic environment.\nBellamy's shot the lights out in surpassing prospectus forecasts, but there is also a scarcity factor at play, with the company having a total of 95 million shares on issue after having raised $25 million at $1 per share in its float, as some new investors came in.\nBut when it comes to Blackmores shares, they have more in common with the rare Mountain Pygmy Possum when it comes to scarcity. There's only 17.2 million shares on issue and chairman and founder Marcus Blackmore alone holds almost 20 per cent of the company.\nBlackmores has done an extraordinary job of building its brand and capitalising on demand from China from both expatriates and entrepreneurs sending vitamins back to relatives and friends, tourists visiting Australia, and on Chinese language online sites like Tmall.\nCitigroup analyst Craig Woolford pointed out in an extensive report on ASX vitamins newcomer Vitaco on October 6 that Blackmores has traded for a long time on the ASX after having listed in 1985 and provides a useful proxy for longer-term horizons.\nWoolford says the one-year forward p-e ratio for Blackmores on a 10-year average is 17.8 times. He also points that the sale multiples for Hong Kong-listed Biostiome's $1.67 billion acquisition of Swisse Wellness were at similar levels to where Blackmores is trading.\nBlackmores hit a high of $156.50 during intra-day trading on October 8 before falling to $141.87 at the close. It went through $100 per share for the first time in late August 2015.\nBut on the plus side for the Australian vitamins and health foods groups according to Citigroup is the rising number of \"China connections\" to Australia through international students studying here, tourists coming to visit, and through migration. The connections have been growing at a double-digit rate for each of the past five years and now sits at 1.4 million people in total. That's substantial in a total population of 24 million, and very good for building brand awareness.\nBut even for companies in the sweet spot for China demand, sometimes share prices run up too hard. Rio Tinto reached $145 in late November, 2007 while BHP Billiton got to $49.55 in May, 2008 as the flagbearers for what was supposed to be a once in 100 year resources boom that experts predicted would just keep on going. BHP, even with its mini-surge of 16 per cent over the past three days, is now at half those levels of seven years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:10:57.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
