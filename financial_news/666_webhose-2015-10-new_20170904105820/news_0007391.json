Nantucket-Dukes Counties, Massachusetts: $85,163 \n2. Washington, D.C.: $81,783 \n4. New York City: $78,518 \n5. Honolulu, Hawaii: $78,423 \n6. Nassau-Suffolk, New York: $78,301 \n7. Arlington-Alexandria, Virginia: $78,094 \n10. Westchester, New York: $75,992 Housing Shortage Reaches Critical Mass in #1 Area \nCompounding heightened expenses in these areas is the lack of basic necessities families require and depend upon most. \nOften regarded as a top vacation destination for the rich and famous, both Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard are a dichotomy of sorts. “People come to the island to get away from the hectic pace of life,” Matrisciano says. “What seasonal residents and vacationers don't know or see is that the people who keep this island functioning and provide the services they seek are the ones who struggle the most.” \nMatrisciano owns Rise Vineyard Performing Arts dance studio, and her husband is a home builder. She has lived on Martha’s Vineyard for 20 years and experienced the sting of what many hard-working families endure, called “the Vineyard shuffle.” \n“The lack and expense of housing presents a significant problem to the vast number of families trying to make a living on the island,” she explains. “Rent is high, and the number of seasonal rentals outnumber homes that are offered for rent on a year round basis. Families may often secure a rental during the winter months but have to vacate in May or June once season begins because owners can command a significantly higher rent on a weekly basis. This ‘shuffle’ presents an ongoing hardship that I have experienced and have seen a number of my dance families endure year after year.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:24:01.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
