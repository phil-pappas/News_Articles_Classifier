He is now cutting global zinc production by 500,000 tonnes per year. Bloomberg Share on twitter by James Chessell Glencore will suspend almost half its zinc production in Australia as part of broader cuts to the company's global zinc, lead and silver mines in another attempt by the Anglo-Swiss mining and trading house to reduce pressure on already depressed commodity prices.\nIn a move that will result in the loss of 1600 jobs worldwide, Glencore announced on Friday it was temporarily reducing its zinc production by more than a third, or the equivalent of 500,000 tonnes per year, by either shutting down or cutting back mine operations in Australia, South America and Kazakhstan.\nGlencore will suspend all production at its Lady Loretta mine north of Mt Isa and is cutting back production by 135,000 tonnes a year at its McArthur River mine in the NT and 245,000 tonnes at its underground George Fisher mine in Mt Isa.\nThe cuts in Australia are expected to result in the loss of 535 jobs, which represents about 18 per cent of the zinc division's local workforce. Glencore's annual lead production is also expected to be reduced by 100,000 tonnes as a result of the changes.\nGlencore would not say for how long it expected the cuts to be in place.\nFederal parliamentarian Bob Katter and Queensland member for Mount Isa Rob Katter pointed to the fact that the cuts were focused on fly-in-fly-out mine workers as evidence the area wouldn't be hit too hard.\n\"The decision to continue operations at George Fisher reinforces what I have been saying all along â€“ that these are world class ore bodies and have a guaranteed future.\"\nAmid a downturn in commodity prices brought about by fears of weaker Chinese growth, Glencore last month bowed to shareholder pressure by announcing plans to cut its debt by $US10 billion ($13.8 billion) through a capital raising and asset sales. However, questions remain about the strength of the company's balance sheet during a prolonged slump in commodity prices prompting wild swings in the company's London and Hong Kong-listed shares.\n Competitors increase ops While BHP and Rio have stepped up their low-cost Pilbara iron ore operations during the downturn to increase market share at the expense of higher-cost producers, Glasenberg has advocated curbing production to put a floor under prices.\n\"We should not be increasing production in anticipation of China demand,\" he said in mid-August. \"Keep it in the ground. You can dig it out any time.\"\nIn November and again in February, Glencore announced cuts at its Newcastle coal operations to avoid pumping tonnes into a heavily over supplied market at depressed prices. Company executives claim the decision has helped stabilise prices.\n\"We continue to review our operations in the current market environment,\" Glencore's head of coal, Peter Freyberg, said on Wednesday. \"We won't and can't run mines that don't make a financial contribution.\"\nLast month, Glencore said it would suspend 400,000 tonnes of copper production at its mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The copper price responded by jumping more than 5 per cent.\nMr Glasenberg, who is also Glencore's largest shareholder, will be hoping for similar response in the zinc market. Zinc prices have fallen by around 32 per cent since May to $US1670 a tonne.\nUsed to rustproof steel in the car and construction industries, zinc was thought to be less susceptible to market nerves over China given the lack of new projects being developed and the closure of others such as MMG's aging Century mine north-west of Mt Isa.\nIn a statement released to the Hong Kong exchange Glencore said: \"We do not think current prices reflect the value of our zinc resources\". Glencore is the world's largest producer of zine with its mines producing 1.4 million tonnes in 2014, which accounted for about 12 per cent of world production. Glencore said it was not decision it had \"taken lightly\".\n\"We believe the current prices do not reflect the fundamentals of supply and demand,\" said a source. \"We can wait for investor sentiment to change, which may take 12 to 18 months, or we can be proactive. The way to be proactive and to preserve the value of the resource is to take a global approach by basically temporarily suspending production in three continents\".\nThe source said Glencore had \"taken steps\" to reduce the effect on the Australian workforce. The majority of the job cuts in Australia will affect fly-in/fly-out workers rather than those based in communities near the mines. The company also hopes to re-employ staff once full production is resumed.\nGlencore will continue to operate its zinc and lead concentrator as well as its lead smelter in Mt Isa. The announcement will not affect existing investment plans such as Glencore's exploration program at Lady Loretta and a treatment plant in Townsville.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/glencore-shuts-down-coal-mines-for-three-weeks-20141113-11mhp2.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:06:23.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
