Angela Wylie by Andrea Slattery There is a missing link in how Australia funds its infrastructure: the $590 billion self-managed superannuation sector is effectively locked out of the game. Although there is an obvious relationship between SMSF trustees with long-term investment goals and infrastructure assets, structural impediments to this investment remain, denying access to many professionals, small business people and self-employed who constitute the bulk of trustees. At a time when Australia needs this investment, it is a fatal flaw in the system that needs to be addressed urgently.\nAnyone doubting that Australia needs infrastructure investment need only pick up the Infrastructure Australia Audit report for 2015 to become aware of the enormity of the challenge. Our population is growing fast – it is the fourth-fastest-growing of the 40 OECD countries in the 10 years to 2012, and is leading the pack of those countries with a population exceeding 10 million. By 2031, we are expected to be home to more than 30 million.\nMost of these people will be born in or choose to migrate to our four major cities –Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth – with their collective populations expected to exceed 18 million by 2030. With population growth comes congestion, and one of the audit's key findings is that without significant investment, traffic congestion alone could cost Australia's economy $53 billion by 2030.\nAdd the necessary capital spending on water, ports, energy and telecommunications to the equation and it's understandable why a detailed report by the Australian Council of Learned Academies says an infrastructure spend of $350 billion is required over the next decade – at the very time state and federal governments are \"fiscally challenged\". Private capital will have to be \"encouraged\" to fill the gap.\nOne source is the $2 trillion superannuation pool – and some of the larger funds, in particular, are attracted to this asset class. The APRA-regulated funds had $54.8 billion (4 per cent of their total funds under management) invested in Australian and overseas infrastructure at June 30, 2015. Of this figure, two superannuation sectors, industry funds and public sector funds, dominate with $45.8 billion (84 per cent).\nBut clearly more capital will have to be found, and the $590 billion SMSF sector (predicted to grow to $2.2 trillion by 2033), with about one-third of its funds under management now held in low-risk assets, would seem ideally suited.\nThe consequence of excluding SMSF investing in infrastructure is not just to deny capital to badly needed infrastructure projects; it excludes SMSF trustees from an asset class which, particularly in the pension phase, would dovetail neatly with their retirement income goals.\nThe investment reality is that SMSFs find it extremely difficult to invest directly in infrastructure due to the high dollar threshold (typically $100 million to $500 million), illiquidity and the high entry and ongoing management fees these investments often attract. Certainly the latter issue would need to be addressed for cost-conscious trustees.\n So what is required to open up infrastructure as an asset class to SMSFs?\nOptions include offering unitised investments in smaller parcels (our recommendation to the Financial System Inquiry was $25,000) or the issuing of small-scale infrastructure bonds. In the early stages of an infrastructure project, a government guarantee might be needed to entice SMSF funding (and APRA funds for that matter). Infrastructure is not without its risks, as BrisConnect and the Lane Cove tunnel attest.\nIt's not just an issue of lowering the entry price to a level where individual trustees of an average SMSF with about $1 million in FUM would feel comfortable investing a percentage of their portfolio. It's also critical to develop a secondary market so that trustees can manage liquidity risk, especially in the retirement phase.\nIn this context, the offering of ASX-listed infrastructure funds would certainly address this issue, critical to give trustees the capacity to respond to changing life circumstances. It's interesting to note that in submissions to the FSI, even large funds were critical of the lack of liquidity.\nHowever, if this asset class is offered to SMSF trustees it must take account of the fact that their preference is to invest directly. [SMSF investment in managed funds has been declining since the global financial crisis and now stands at 5.1 per cent of funds under management] If this can be achieved in an environment where the cash rate is a low 2 per cent, then, in all likelihood, infrastructure investment would find a receptive audience in the SMSF community.\nRemember, trustees are traditionally \"sticky\" investors who take investment decisions with the long term in mind. In addition, with infrastructure as an investment class sitting between cash/fixed interest and property/equities in terms of risk-reward, it provides a degree of security with the added bonus of potentially higher yields than what's on offer from cash or term deposits – an excellent outcome for those in the pension phase.\nIndeed, the income from infrastructure investments could be used to fund income streams in retirement – a quasi-annuity. Trustees are looking to manage longevity risk by accessing long-term investment options with low volatility, moderate yield (relative to inflation) and moderate capital growth (helpful but not critical). Infrastructure assets would seem to fit the bill.\nRecent research by Investment Trends and a 2015 ATO report said that although trustees were conservative investors, they have a good understanding of investment classes, often leading the financial industry in moving into new markets when they have been well advised and the investment offers appropriate returns in terms of the risk.\nIt suggests that SMSF trustees would not be averse to infrastructure investment, provided they got the necessary professional advice so critical in such a decision. The asset's characteristics of low volatility, stable yield, inflation hedge and relatively low risk would appeal, whether trustees are in the accumulation or pension phase. That their investment would be helping fund infrastructure for their children and grandchildren would be an added bonus.\nAndrea Slattery is chief executive of the SMSF Association", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:06:09.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
