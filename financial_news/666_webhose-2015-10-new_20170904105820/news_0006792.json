If elected -- and if said policies would actually see support by Congress -- the candidates would apparently address only some isolated and disjointed aspects of the topic. The result would be feel-good legislation but nowhere near the degree of institutional change that will need to happen to reform society.The problem with endemic and systemic problems is that they are deucedly difficult to address. You can't pick out a single aspect and hope -- all praise to the silver bullet theory -- that a simple fix do the trick. System problems require systemic understanding and correction.In the debates, concern about economic issues seemed to break out into a few categories. Bernie Sanders talked about a $15 an hour federal minimum wage. Martin O'Malley also supports the figure , while Hillary Clinton has praised a $12 an hour , although without officially announcing what she would do.[caption id=\"attachment_492556074\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] LAS VEGAS, NV - OCTOBER 13: (L-R) Democratic presidential candidates Sen.

Hours are the other. If you can't get enough hours of work, you can't make a living that keeps you off the poverty roles, even at $15 an hour. If reasonable and predictable hours aren't available, helping people move themselves out of poverty will only be so much talk. Talking about paid family leave is fine, but what exactly does that mean? How about paid sick time? And while blaming Republicans for opposition may be popular, simply saying \"we can do these things\" only gets you to the Donald Trump level of assertion. Hand waving is not enough.Clinton said she wanted to find a way to make companies share profits with workers, which is fine, but the real issue is sharing productivity gains, not just profits. As a company increases its ability to make money, it should recognize, as used to happen, that there has to be a more equitable split between corporations and management. The reason isn't some dream of socialism, or even democratic socialism, but a recognition that economic sustainability is necessary.There were calls for free or subsidized higher education in various forms. But to effectively use a path to college, children must be ready to travel, and too many aren't. The education gap begins shortly after birth and it broadens over time. If you haven't been properly prepared -- taught not just math and reading and science, but history and art and, importantly, how to study -- you're not going to get through school.There was no agreement on how to deal with the era of big banks, which is another aspect of inequality, because the biggest become above the law out of fear that their failure could take the economic system down with them. If, as Sanders wants, we are to break up the banks, how would that happen and what would the effects be on the economy? If, as Clinton argued, you charge banks more to monitor them, what is the response if something goes wrong? And how do you monitor all the speculative investments -- ones that are seen as safe at the time and only questioned in retrospect -- to keep a failure from happening?And problems with racism and class and inequity in the justice system and incarceration also are intrinsic parts of economic inequality. They feed and enforce and, to many, excuse it.The inequality problem is vast. It is complex. Perhaps the candidates have well-formed and integrated plans of how all this fits together. From the debate last night, though, you would find it impossible to identify a single candidate who could articulate a full, coherent, and plausible response. Let us hope that this is an issue of how public debates are structured and how questions are asked -- and let us remember to ask these harder questions and listen closely to see if someone answers, or dances around.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/492556074/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hillary-clinton-voices-support-12-national-minimum-wage-article-1.2309667", "http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/10/13/5-issues-to-watch-at-the-democratic-presidential-debate/"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:17:18.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
