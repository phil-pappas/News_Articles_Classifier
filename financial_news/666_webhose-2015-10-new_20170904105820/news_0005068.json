Today, on International Poverty Eradication Day, a new Rockefeller Foundation-funded project is being launched which will undertake a timely and much needed look at where market systems, including social enterprises, micro and small-scale businesses and supporting services, organisations and policies, have successfully improved the lives of the poorest and most marginalised in society. About the research Led by ADD International, the Coady International Institute and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), the project is made up of three key pieces of research: Working with Disabled People's Organisations (DPOs) in Uganda to identify both barriers to, and promising possibilities for, market-based approaches to reach one of the most marginalised groups, groups of disabled women. According to some reports only 0.2% of people with disabilities in Uganda is employed in the formal sector and, based on recent ILO findings, it is likely that only a small minority of these will be women. Documenting case studies of market systems innovation from across the world and will use this 'global scan' combined with the more in-depth work in Uganda to draw conclusions to underpin the targeting of funding and interventions for other poor and excluded groups globally. Convening those involved in this research, along with other relevant experts, the project will produce recommendations for how similar approaches could be rolled out more widely to eradicate poverty amongst the poorest communities. Tim Wainwright, CEO of ADD International said: \"Studies show that it is often wealthier people in a community who benefit from market approaches to combatting poverty - men more than women, non-disabled more than disabled. We welcome the chance to lead this innovative research which turns this problem on its head. We will look for those examples around the world where disabled women and other highly excluded groups have engaged with the market successfully - and find out why - prompting action to roll out new approaches to reach the very poorest, and leave no one behind.\" Susan's story, Uganda Susan lives in one room with her four children on a small plot of land which she farms.Susan and her family have always been poor. Living in an area of conflict where large areas of land are strewn with hidden mines, their situation became even more precarious when Susan lost her leg after standing on a landmine.However, after her accident, Susan joined the self-help group in her village run by the Gulu disabled people's organisation (DPO) Women with Disabilities and received business training and seed capital to start her own enterprise selling produce at the local market. \"I used to not know much about business but I got some entrepreneurship training. I learnt about customer care, how to display your goods to be attractive, savings and simple book keeping.\" \"The training was wonderful; it's now what is helping me to run my business. I sell tomatoes, fish in the nearby market. I do some small farming. I grow vegetables in the garden here.\" \"We were given 500,000 shillings to begin with. We would borrow money and pay it back with interest. We did that for 1 and a half years. When we opened our cash box I discovered I had 380,000 shillings in my saving account. I used 100,000 to add to my business. I took out 250,000 to pay my daughter's school fees. The remaining I kept in savings.\" The collaboration This international collaboration project will be carried out by ADD International, the Coady International Institute and the Institute of Development Studies (IDS): ADD International (formerly known as Action on Disability and Development) fights for independence, equality and opportunity for disabled people living in poverty, in Africa and Asia. The Coady International Institute at St. Francis Xavier University has been educating development leaders from around the world since 1959. Through its unique, community-based approach, the Institute equips them to address contemporary global challenges and opportunities. The Coady network includes more than 7,000 graduates and partners working in 130 countries. The Institute of Development Studies (IDS) is a leading global institution for research, teaching and learning, and impact and communications, based at the University of Sussex. We believe passionately that cutting-edge research, knowledge and mutual learning are crucial in shaping the transformations needed to reduce inequalities, accelerate sustainability and build moreinclusive and secure societies. Our commitment to engaged excellence means that the high quality of our work is dependent upon it linking to and involving those who are at the heart of the change we wish to see. This approach is applied across all of our work and encapsulates IDS' unique mix of university organisation and thinktank. www.ids.ac.uk The project is funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. For more than 100 years, The Rockefeller Foundation's mission has been to promote the well-being of humanity throughout the world. Today, The Rockefeller Foundation pursues this mission through dual goals: advancing inclusive economies that expand opportunities for more broadly shared prosperity, and building resilience by helping people, communities and institutions prepare for, withstand, and emerge stronger from acute shocks and chronic stresses. To achieve these goals, The Rockefeller Foundation works at the intersection of four focus areas - advance health, revalue ecosystems, secure livelihoods, and transform cities - to address the root causes of emerging challenges and create systemic change. Together with partners and grantees, The Rockefeller Foundation strives to catalyze and scale transformative innovations, create unlikely partnerships that span sectors, and take risks others cannot - or will not.
