REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/Files By Devika Krishna Kumar\n(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit as heavy promotions helped the company attract postpaid subscribers amid the launch of Apple Inc's new iPhones.\nThe largest U.S. wireless service provider has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, who have been offering massive discounts on call and data plans. \nApple launched the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in September, triggering heavy promotional activity in the telecoms industry towards the end of the third quarter.\nVerizon shares rose about 2 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday. \nThe company net added 1.3 million wireless retail postpaid subscribers in the quarter compared with 1.1 million in the second quarter. \nDrexel Hamilton analyst Barry Sine said the subscriber numbers were slightly better than expected.\nHowever, Verizon's average revenue per account (ARPA) declined to $152.38 from $153.73.\nAs its ARPA comes under pressure, Verizon is entering new markets such as mobile video and \"Internet of Things\" - the concept of connecting everything from industrial machines to household devices to the Internet - to boost its earnings.\nRevenue from its Internet of Things and related offerings rose to about $175 million from $165 million in the prior quarter. \nRevenue from FiOS high-speed Internet, TV and phone service rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier to $3.4 billion.\nThe net income attributable to Verizon rose 9.3 percent to $4.04 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.04 per share, slightly higher than the average analyst estimate of $1.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal operating revenue rose 5 percent to $33.16 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $32.94 billion.\nVerizon shares were trading at $45.50 before the bell. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen about 4.5 percent this year. \n\n(Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)\nCompany Earnings Verizon Communications Inc Apple Inc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:42:17.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
