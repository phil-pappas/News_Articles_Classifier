It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) sells more than 12m items a year. \n\"We have had another amazing six months, helped by the wet August but with our summer products also selling well earlier in the season,\" Mr Neale said. \n\"I’m delighted to say, as we head into autumn, that this has continued, which means that 2015 is shaping up to be another record year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:31:56.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
