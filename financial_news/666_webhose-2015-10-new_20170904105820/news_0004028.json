Combined with the interim dividend, the lender's full-year dividend payment comes to 74c per share.\nChief executive John Sutton said the lender had delivered record results for five successive halves, \"a significant achievement in an environment of low growth and changing regulations\".\n“Though we have more work to do, particularly around returning to higher levels of asset growth, most of our key financial metrics are moving in the right direction,\" he said.\nThe lender attributed its result to strong margin management and a further improvements in asset quality.\nOver the year, BoQ's cash net interest margin rose 15 basis points to 1.97 per cent, in an environment where most lenders' margins are coming under pressure.\n“There are many factors driving the outlook for margins in the year ahead given the changing regulatory environment, with banks positioning for global industry change under the Basel IV framework expected to be introduced in the coming years,\" Mr Sutton said.\n“The potential reduction in the significant capital advantage enjoyed by advanced accredited banks should be a positive to BoQ’s competitive position and relative return performance.”\nLoan impairment expenses fell 14 per cent over the year to $74m.\nMr Sutton said the Australian economy remained below trend with recent improvements in business and consumer confidence likely to take time to translate to a sustained and meaningful uptick in activity.\n“State economic performance remains mixed with Queensland and Western Australia still feeling the impacts of the mining slow down,\" he said.\n\"Queensland house prices are still affordable and, in time, this is likely to result in increasing net migration, further boosting the state economy.”\nMr Sutton said, as the banking community awaits the federal government response to the Financial System Inquiry, the regulator has already taken steps to level the playing field on mortgage risk weighting requirements.\n“As a standardised bank, we remain very comfortable with our strong capital position,\" he said.\nWe will continue to monitor the Basel process and assess the benefits of advanced accreditation under Basel IV. We are also encouraged about the prospects of a faster path to accreditation.\"\nOriginally published as BoQ posts record FY profit", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/boq-posts-record-fy-profit-buoyed-by-strong-margin-management/story-fni0dcne-1227561578621"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:47:20.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
