To coincide with the tour, the bosses of Boral, Incitec, Sims and Brambles gave interviews to The Australian Financial Review to explain their optimism about renewed prospects in the US.\nAfter the deepest recession in 80 years, the US economy finally appears to be on steady footing, despite headwinds from a slowing China and a soaring US dollar that is crimping exports.\nA lower-than-expected 142,000 US job additions for September reported on Friday disappointed economists, but they do not expect a sharp slowdown.\nEconomic growth in the June quarter surged at an annual pace of 3.9 per cent and the unemployment rate is a relatively low 5.1 per cent. While the economy is not booming like it did in the 1990s, growth appears sustainable enough to have the US Federal Reserve considering raising interest rates for the first time in almost a decade . The Federal Reserve has pledged to raise rates gently.\nProtracted home-building recovery Mr Kane, of Boral, Australia's biggest supplier of building products and construction material, is tipping the US to have the most protracted home-building recovery in its history.\n Americans broke ground on more than 1 million new homes in 2014-15, and all indicators point to a steady climb back to the long-term average of 1.5 million homes a year.\nAfter years of reduced building in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Mr Kane believes there could be 10 years of increasing earnings from his US business.\n\"Look at the low level of housing inventory in the US and the pent-up demand. I would expect an elongated recovery lasting many years longer than we might expect,\" he said.\nMr Kane said the housing recovery would take Boral's US revenue from $US695 million ($984 million) to $US1.4 billion .\nBoral aspires to get US revenue to $US2 billion and Mr Kane is looking to deploy some of the company's $800 million balance sheet capacity to buy fly ash, roofing, stone, cladding and decking businesses.\nJames Hardie is bringing on new production capacity to meet increased demand.\nSlower than expected However, the fibre cement building products maker said that while US home-building activity was improving, the recovery was taking root slower than expected.\nTom Gorman, who runs $15 billion supply-chain logistics giant Brambles, is gearing up to launch new pallet products in the US.\nBrambles is investing $US1.5 billion over the next four years to bolster its business and meet new demand . About $US500 million of growth capital will be invested in 2015-16, up $US150 million on last financial year.\nThe investment will be focused on emerging markets, Europe, and the US.\nAbout $US125 million will be directed to the US business, to support growth in Brambles' traditional 48x40-inch pallet line and to introduce smaller \"fractional\" pallets into the market.\n\"There are a number of green shoots and positive signs,\" Mr Gorman said of the US economy.\n\"Good housing data, low unemployment … we've also seen some inventory build and whether that turns into long-term higher sustainable demand we don't know but we do see that retail inventory build.\n\"We feel good about the US.\"\nCrimping demand Still, not everyone is feeling the benefits of the US recovery. Galdino Claro, the chief executive of the largest scrap-metal recycler in the world, Sims Metal, said consumers were taking longer to replace their cars and refrigerators. This was crimping demand for scrap metal used in replacement products. Sims earns 40-50 per cent of its revenue in the US.\n\"While the US economy has partially recovered over the past few years, the positive impact on the metals recycling business really has not been meaningful,\" he said. \"Consumers need confidence in the economy and their financial stability to replace.\"\nWages growth has been weak and households have largely saved their windfall from plunging petrol prices, though consumer spending began to pick up in July and August.\n\"The real consumer spending outlook for the remainder of the year looks relatively bright, supported by improved job prospects, solid gains in real disposable income, modest consumer price inflation, and a housing market that is gaining traction,\" IHS director of consumer economics Chris Christopher said.\nIncitec Pivot has invested $US850 million in building a new ammonia plant in the business-friendly state of Louisiana . The firm sells explosives to the quarry and construction sectors, which are benefiting from the housing recovery Boral is experiencing.\nBet on recovery Chief executive James Fazzino is delighted Incitec bet on the US recovery in 2013, when others were more sceptical.\n\"It's [cheap] gas, the competency of the workforce and skills, it's the largest economy in the world, a huge customer market and the way the state government works,\" he said on why the country was an attractive place to do business.\nIncitec Pivot expects its 800,000-tonnes-a-year Louisiana ammonia plant, which is fully contracted, to start production in late 2016.\nThat should be just in time to capitalise on the resurgent quarrying and construction sector, which rival explosives maker Orica tips will increase its explosive demand by 5 to 8 per cent a year over the next five years.\nBHP Billiton chief Andrew Mackenzie told a Washington business audience on September 16 that his earlier career experience running British Petroleum's chemical business in Chicago taught him that the US's \"dynamism and flexibility is priceless\". He said the US must hold on to this flexibility and not layer itself in red tape, to remain one of the most competitive economies in the world.\n\"One of the risks of hanging on to that is that you layer on too much regulation and seek to pick winners,\" Mr Mackenzie said. \"Let the market work.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:06:15.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
