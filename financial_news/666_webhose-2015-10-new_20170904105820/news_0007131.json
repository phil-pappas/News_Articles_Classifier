But that is just what Luxembourg and the Netherlands did this week, after the European Commission ruled that subsidiaries of multinationals in the two countries were paying €20m-30m ($23m-34m) too little. The commission argued that the favourable tax treatment the firms were receiving was tantamount to a government subsidy, and thus illegal under European rules on “state aid”. The two countries, worried that the decision will deter other foreign firms from investing, demurred. \nThe ruling marks an important advance in the battle against tax avoidance by jurisdiction-shopping multinationals. The commission took issue with an advance ruling the tax authorities in the Netherlands had provided to a subsidiary of Starbucks, a coffee chain, confirming that its tax planning in the country was sound, and with a similar assurance Luxembourg had given a unit of Fiat Chrysler, a carmaker (whose chairman, John Elkann, sits on the board of The Economist ’s parent company). Such “comfort letters” are fine in principle, the commission said, but in these two instances had been used to provide preferential treatment.
