Diageo presses ahead with wine sale By Ben Martin | Telegraph – 7 hours ago Diageo plc \nThe FTSE 100 drinks company is understood to be exploring a sale of its wine brands, which include Blossom Hill \nDiageo (LSE: DGE.L - news ) , the company behind Captain Morgan rum and Smirnoff vodka, is believed to be pressing ahead with a sale of its wine brands, including Blossom Hill, as its under-pressure boss Ivan Menezes continues his sell-off of the group's peripheral businesses. \nAustralian firm Treasury Wine Estates was named as a leading suitor for the FTSE 100 company’s wine business, which also encompasses the Piat d’Or and Rosenblum brands. \nTreasury, which was spun out of Foster's in 2011, is the world’s largest listed wine maker and produces Wolf Blass and Rosemount Estate. \nA disposal would be in keeping with Mr Menezes strategy. Diageo, the owner of Guinness, Baileys and Pimm’s, has offloaded a number of non-core divisions under Mr Menezes, including Scotland’s famous Gleneagles hotel and golf resort three months ago. \nThe Diageo boss, who is fighting to restore investor confidence after two years of stalled growth, hinted in July that the company’s wine brands could be sold , when he said the group would be “active managers of our portfolio” and that wine “is not going to get bigger for us”. \nThe wine business only accounts for 4pc of Diageo’s net sales and has long been considered a prime candidate for disposal. Sky News was first to report that the FTSE 100 giant was stepping up its efforts to sell the brands. \nA spokesman for Diageo said: \"Wine is a small part of our business but it plays an important role. We have no other comment to make.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:11:33.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
