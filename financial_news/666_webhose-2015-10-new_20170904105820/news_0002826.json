It will also have to hold up to antitrust scrutiny, which A-B InBev's $20.1 billion deal for Mexico's Grupo Modelo didn't when it came before the Department of Justice. Grupo Modelo's products, now brewed for the U.S. at a separate facility and sold by Constellation Brands, have a roughly 7% share of the U.S. beer market, according to Beer Marketer's Insights . SABMiller's joint venture with Molson Coors, MillerCoors commands 26% of the U.S. beer market.

It also gets the rights to the first and last offer on the remaining 50% and to the naming a new chief executive. So there's a chance that, for consumers, everything stays just as they know it. \nBut there's also a chance that it won't. MillerCoors saw sales in the second quarter sit flat from a year ago at $2.2 billion. Its chief executive, Tom Long, retired in June and left MolsonCoors chief financial officer Gavin Hattersley as the joint venture's interim leader until he assumed those duties full time a month ago. That month, MillerCoors took two steps: it bought San Diego craft brewer Saint Archer for its Tenth and Blacke specialty beer division, and it announced plans to shut down its 9-million-barrel plant in Eden, N.C., and lay off more than 500 employees. \nEven before this deal, MillerCoors was getting leaner and shifting focus. The Miller Lite brand -- which still accounts for 7% of all U.S. beer volume, compared to 11% for all craft brewers combined -- has seen production, sales and market share slide steadily for a number of years. The Miller High Life brand has also sputtered, with sales slumping by more than 5% a year for the last three years, on average. Even low-budget Keystone Light, which saw growth in the years following the recession, saw sales slip 7.4% last year. \nIn fact, the only brands seeing consistent growth for MillerCoors are its Blue Moon and Jacob Leinenkugel craft-style beers, its Redd's fruit-flavored malt beverages and its Coors Banquet -- helped out largely by packs of nostalgic stubby bottles. As a result, MillerCoors has worked at making its brewing facilities in Milwaukee and Virginia more efficient and, more importantly, more nimble and able to brew different kinds of beer. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:03:15.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
