Photo: Peter Braig\nWoolies looks to cut ties with Qantas The nearly 8 million members of the Woolworths Everyday Rewards scheme could find it harder to earn as many frequent flyer points on their everyday spending if Woolworths severs its longstanding relationship with the Qantas Frequent Flyer program.\nSince 2009, Woolworths loyalty program members have been able to earn one Qantas point for each dollar spent over $30 at its supermarkets and BWS bottle shops and 1 point per $2 spent over $30 in store at Big W. But Woolworths, which pays Qantas for each of those points, is under financial pressure and is considering whether to axe the relationship .\nThe loss of the ability to earn Qantas points for shopping at Woolworths could make some of the supermarket chain's customers consider whether they should shop elsewhere. Arch rival Coles signed a deal on Tuesday with Qantas rival Etihad Airways that will allow members of the Coles flybuys loyalty scheme to earn points shopping at its supermarkets and liquor stores.\nAdvertisement Linked program members of both flybuys and Etihad's loyalty program will earn three Etihad Guest tier miles for every $1 they spend at Coles, Coles Online, Coles Express, Liquorland and First Choice Liquor shops, capped at a maximum of $2500 tier miles a month. At the same time, they will also collect flybuys points.\nThe deal between flybuys and Etihad could help the Abu Dhabi-based carrier gain more traction in the Australian market. Etihad is a shareholder and alliance partner of Virgin Australia. Virgin, in turn, this year launched its own major everyday spending program with petrol retailer BP. Members of Virgin's Velocity frequent flyer program can earn two points for every litre of fuel bought and two points for every dollar spent in store, with no minimum spend on their purchase.\nIf the Woolworths/Qantas relationship comes to an end, Qantas frequent flyer members with branded credit cards from companies including ANZ, NAB, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, Citibank and American Express , will still be able to earn some points shopping at Woolworths if they pay via those credit cards. The status of the Woolworths-offered co-branded Qantas Platinum Credit Card is less clear. However, the future earnings potential of all cards linked to loyalty programs is under a cloud as a result of a Reserve Bank review that could reform payments regulation .\nThere has been industry speculation for a few years that Woolworths was unhappy with the high fees it was paying Qantas for points as part of their deal. Last September, Fairfax Media reported Woolworths was planning to shift the focus away from Qantas frequent flyer points toward immediate rewards such as shopping vouchers .\nFor Woolworths, severing links with Qantas could come down to a decision on whether the boost in margins from doing so is worth the potential loss of sales from customers that had shopped there in large part because they could earn frequent flyer points with the airline.\nIn 2009, when there were just 3.3 million members of the Woolworths Everyday Rewards scheme, analysts estimated Woolworths was paying between $40 million and $158 million a year to Qantas to cover the costs of giving points to its customers.\nQantas Loyalty, which has 10.8 million members globally, reported $1.369 billion in billings over the last financial year, two-thirds of which was generated by partners other than the airline such as Woolworths and credit card partners. The loss of a deal with Woolworths could represent a substantial hit to Qantas Loyalty's revenue from partners and lower earnings from the division.\nQantas frequent flyer program members can earn points shopping through other retailers , such as as David Jones, ebay and Apple Store via its online mall. However, Woolworths is its only major partner for everyday spending.", "external_links": ["http://www.qantas.com.au/cardselector/InitialLoadAction.do", "http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2015/VELOCITY-LANDS-AT-BP/", "https://www.flybuys.com.au/partners/etihad", "https://www.woolworthsmoney.com.au/credit-cards/qantas-platinum-card.html", "https://onlinemall.qantaspoints.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:56.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
