One place is in Guaranteed Investment Funds.\nGIFs, or segregated funds as they are sometimes called, offer unique features not found in other investment products that can help you achieve the priorities of growing, preserving and protecting your money in a period of high volatility when markets and securities are rising and falling like a stormy ocean.\n\"GIFs are good for anyone who is looking for downside protection,\" says Stephen Carter, senior vice-president, product management and development with BMO Insurance. \"But they may be particularly appealing to pre-retirees who are serious about saving for retirement and for retirees who are concerned about protecting what they have accumulated and passing that on to the next generation.\"\nSegregated funds are individual insurance contracts that invest in one or more underlying assets such as mutual and exchange traded funds, bonds and equities. They provide many of the same features as mutual funds such as professional portfolio management, growth while diversifying risk, liquidity and, in certain circumstances, the ability to bypass probate.\nUnlike mutual funds, however, they can offer creditor protection, a guarantee of all or a specified percentage of the principal at maturity and at death, and the ability to lock in market growth using a device called resets.\nSegregated funds do not issue units or shares. The investor is the holder of a segregated fund contract that can be held inside registered accounts such as an RRSP or Tax Free Savings Account or in non-registered accounts. Investments in a registered account qualify as annual tax-sheltered RRSP or TFSA contributions. Non-registered investments are subject to tax payments on the capital gains each year but capital losses also can be claimed.\nAll segregated fund contracts have maturity dates - the date when the maturity guarantee becomes available to the contract holder. Maturity dates typically are for 10 years or longer.\nDepending on the contract segregated funds will offer a guarantee of either 75 per cent or 100 per cent if held to their maturity. If the value of the fund increases some funds allow holders to \"reset\" the guaranteed amount to the higher value. However, this will also reset the term of the contract and extend the maturity date. Fund holders usually are allowed to make only a certain number of resets.\nThe guarantee amounts offered will be paid out at the contract's maturity or on the death of the holder.\nIf certain qualifications are met segregated fund investments may be protected from seizure by creditors. This feature may be particularly appealing for business owner or professionals whose assets may have a high exposure to creditors.\nIf a beneficiary is named the segregated fund investment may be exempt from probate and executor's fees and pass directly to the beneficiary. If the named beneficiary is a family member such as spouse, child or parent the investment also may be secure from creditors in the event of bankruptcy. These protections apply to both registered and non-registered investments.\nSegregated funds generally have higher Management Expense Ratios (MERs) than mutual funds and your money is locked in for the maturity period. If you do withdraw early there usually is a penalty.\nGIFs have grown over the last few years as investors become more aware of them and their benefits. \"They have been available from insurance companies for many years but generally they are not as well-known as mutual funds,\" says Carter. You will pay higher fees because of the protection they provide so you need to carefully consider all features before you decide to buy.\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:38:22.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
