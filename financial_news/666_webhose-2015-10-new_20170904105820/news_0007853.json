Last year exports stood at $310.53 billion while imports were at $447.540 billion.\nThe commerce ministry aims to take goods and services export to $900 billion by 2020 and increase India’s share in world exports to 3.5 per cent from 2 per cent.\nAssuring the exporters of making interest subvention available soon, the government has, however, asked them to “become more competitive as it has a limited role to play in increasing exports”.\nThe Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo) has identified 36 products including bovine meat, cashew nuts, maize, sesamum seeds, granite, benzene, P-Xylene, vaccines for human medicines, reactive dyes and preparations thereof, insecticides, polyproylene and textured yarn of polyesters among others to boost overall exports.\nAccording to Fieo, these 36 products showed a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21 per cent in India’s exports during 2010-14 as against overall exports CAGR of 9.56 per cent. The CAGR of world’s imports for such products was 16.63 per cent in the same period as against CAGR of overall global imports of 5.3 per cent in the same period.\nThe total export of these 36 products from India in 2014 was $45.58 billion, close to 14 per cent of our overall exports. The world imports for these 36 products in 2014 stood at $700.45 billion.\nIndia’s share in world exports for these 36 products was thus 6.5 per cent in 2014 as against our overall share of about 1.7 per cent in the world merchandise exports,” the export organisation said as it made case for supporting these sectors to boost exports.\nIt said that if the country is able to increase its share from 6.5 per cent to 10 per cent in the next three years, exports from these sectors can go up to over $110 billion from the current $45.58 billion.\nExporters from the leather industry said that the government needs to set up a marketing fund for aggressively marketing Indian products in markets like China, which have huge demand for leather products. The sector has already started witnessing job losses, M Rafeeque Ahmed, chairman, Council for Leather Exports, said.\nThe commerce ministry has as such been asking for cost of capital for exporters, increase in EXIM Bank’s capacity for project exports and restoration of tax benefits to special economic zones to provide cushion to exporters.\n 13, 2015 9:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:38:00.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
