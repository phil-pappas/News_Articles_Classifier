Share on twitter by David Ramli Opposition spokesman on communications Jason Clare has indicated Labor will ramp up the number of homes connected using fibre-optic cabling as part of the $56 billion national broadband network if it wins the next federal election.\nThe Coalition under then-Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, now Prime Minister, changed the NBN to use a range of cheaper and slower technologies including fibre-to-the-node, which relies on existing copper phone lines to deliver broadband.\nIn July Labor's national platform said the party would now be forced to adopt a two-stage rollout if elected. Many fairly assumed that meant it would complete the Coalition's NBN before upgrading the connections to full fibre.\nBut in a speech to the CommsDay Summit in Melbourne on Wednesday, Mr Clare said a vote for Labor would be a vote for a fibre to the premise NBN.\n\"Fibre to the node will be gone,\" he said. \"It's not a question of if this will happen, it's when it will happen and how it will be done.\n\"If you vote for the Labor Party at the next election you will be voting for more fibre.\"\nDetails scarce Mr Clare declined to release more policy details. But sources close to the party said it meant Labor would make the contractual changes required to deploy more fibre-optic cabling across Australia if it won government. It previously wanted 93 per cent of premises to be directly connected to the NBN using fibre to the premise technology.\n The sources said such a move would occur gradually because the locations already slated for fibre to the node would already have their deployments locked in. But rollouts planned after that would move to using more FTTP.\nThey also suggested the hybrid-fibre coaxial cables used for Pay TV services, may be kept given the billions of dollars being spent on upgrading them.\nThe NBN project predicts just 20 per cent of Australian homes and businesses will get fibre to the premise, with 38 per cent getting fibre to the node or basement and 34 per cent getting upgrades to their hybrid fibre-coaxial, or HFC, connections, which are now delivering pay TV.\nThe move would come with a risk of delay – the NBN under Labor consistently missed rollout targets due to lengthy construction delays and worker shortages. Mr Turnbull has said this would also result in years of delays and tens of billions of dollars in extra funding requirements.\nIndependent telecommunications analyst Ian Martin said any shift in policy would come with a major rise in costs because of the difference between connecting homes with fibre optic cabling and fibre to the node.\nFull fibre costs more \"Fibre to the premise will clearly be a lot more expensive,\" he said. \"It's just hard to say how many lines you'll have to replace in the [current system].\n\"Labor itself probably won't know until it does its own strategic review so it'll be another year or so [after a Labor election victory] before you can answer that.\"\nMost Australians under the Coalition will have to pay for their own upgrade to a full-fibre connection, making it demand-driven.\n\"If you force the pace of upgrades you will incur costs before you get the returns,\" he said. \"The returns are already pretty marginal so adding that cost without the corresponding benefit is going to push them down and probably quite materially.\"\nBut Mr Clare said the Coalition's reliance on copper networks for the NBN meant in some locations, such as Newcastle and the Central Coast, more than 90 per cent of copper pairs needed to be fixed – a process the telecommunications industry calls \"remediation\".\nHe cited unnamed contracting sources, who said up to 15 per cent of copper lines in those regions had to be partly replaced.\n\"Another contractor told me in Campbelltown in Sydney that NBN has had to recently replace almost three kilometres of old copper with new copper,\" he said.\nLast month, NBN told Fairfax Media almost none of the phone lines in its Newcastle trial sites had to be fixed.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:03:12.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
