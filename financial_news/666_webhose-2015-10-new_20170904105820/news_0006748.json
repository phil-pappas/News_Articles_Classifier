MSI Credit Solutions is hosting their annual Halloween Costume Contest for employees, all competing for the grand prize. Employees are encouraged to bring their A-game to the table when it comes to their costumes. Whether it a home-made costume, a creative spin on a character, something spooky, a “punny” costume or anything else that is eye-catching, they are in the running for being the winner!\nThis year, there will be two winners. The first place winner will be granted a cash prize. The winners are determined by voters on Facebook. Clients and fans can vote based off of the pictures uploaded to MSI’s Facebook page. A vote is determined by a “like” on a picture. Whichever participant/costume receives the most “likes” on Facebook will be granted first place with the cash prize. The second-highest amount of “likes” will be the runner-up.\nMSI employees are also able to compete in Park Central 789’s building costume contest for additional cash prizes!\nTo learn more about the contest, visit MSI Credit Solution’s Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MSICreditSolutions .\nAbout the company:\nMSI Credit Solutions is committed to helping the local community.
