Peter Braig Share on twitter by Tim Binsted The NSW government has agreed to defer $60 million of payroll tax for BlueScope Steel to help keep the company's Port Kembla plant running.\nEarlier this year, BlueScope said it needed to cut $200 million of costs from the plant otherwise the remaining blast furnace would be mothballed, endangering 5000 direct and indirect jobs.\nThe company said on Monday that its unions, the NSW government, and other stakeholders had all pitched in to help find the \"game-changing\" reduction in costs needed to keep the plant open.\nOutgoing BlueScope chairman Graham Kraehe said the board intends to keep Port Kembla open subject to the ratification of new enterprise bargaining agreements with BlueScope's unions.\n\"We applaud the contribution by our employees, site management and the combined unions in helping to secure $60 million per annum in labour cost savings,\" Mr Kraehe said.\n\"We also thank the NSW government for deferring $60 million of payroll of payroll tax payments over the next three years, as well as reductions in other charges.\"\nBlueScope also announced plans to buy out Cargill's 50 per cent share of the North Star mill in the United States for $US720 million.\nThe steelmaker said it had exercised its right of last refusal on the stake, matching an offer for an unnamed third party bidder.\n BueScope will now move to 100 per cent ownership of North Star, an asset chief executive Paul O'Malley has previously described as the best steel mill in North America.\nMore to come.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/timbinsted"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:33:38.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
