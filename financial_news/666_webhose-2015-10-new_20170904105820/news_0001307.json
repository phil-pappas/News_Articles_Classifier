Blatter and Platini suspended by Fifa In this article Companies and organisations: Fifa LAUSANNE — Suspended Fifa president Sepp Blatter claimed on Friday that the $2m payment he made to UEFA president Michel Platini was a \"gentleman’s agreement\".\n\"It was a contract I had with Platini, a gentleman’s agreement,\" said the 79-year-old in an interview with Swiss media RROTV.\n\"It was implemented. I can’t give any more details, the issue is being discussed in two investigations.\" Asked directly if the contract had been made within the rules, Blatter added: \"Yes, certainly, it was within the rules.\" Blatter and Platini, 60, have both been suspended for 90 days by Fifa’s ethics committee as Swiss authorities conduct a criminal investigation into corruption allegations at the scandal-tainted world football governing body.\nBlatter defiantly backed his right to discuss the ongoing controversy and investigation.\n\"I don’t have the right to go to a football stadium, but I do have the right to talk to whoever I want,\" he added.\n\"I am not sidelined, I am only suspended.\" Blatter, who has been in charge of Fifa since 1998, still intends to be present when the Fifa congress meets on February 26 to elect a new president.\n\"My goal is to preside over the congress, that is my objective. I don’t believe it will be postponed.\" Blatter also blasted the international media for \"pre-judging\" him, saying his suspension had been a \"shock\".\nHe added he was baffled by the decision to bar him from his office.\n\"I have not stolen, I haven’t killed, I haven’t favoured anybody!\" The suspension, he said, had given him \"time to think\" and that he was \"doing fine, even if it is a difficult period.\"\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:18:52.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
