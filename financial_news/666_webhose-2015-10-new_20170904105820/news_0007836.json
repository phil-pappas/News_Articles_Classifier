UberPool enables its users to share a ride and split the cost with another user requesting for a ride along a similar route.\n“The idea of UberPool is very simple, it is sharing a ride and splitting the cost moreover it is instant and the user can avail a discount of up to 40% irrespective of whether he gets a match or not, depending on the route and the time of the day,” Bhavik Rathod, GM Bengaluru, Uber told FE.\nUberPool already exists in San Francisco, Paris, New York, Los Angeles and Austin and according to the company UberPool is a solution to challenges like congestion, pollution, urban parking and transportation costs. With many players entering the carpooling market and even Ola planning to launch similar services, Uber is confident that their quality of service will stand apart given that they have already rolled out these services globally.\n“UberPool is a special technology and we have done a great job in San Francisco and Austin and we are confident about our algorithms and technology, so bringing the same quality of technology to India gives us an edge over other players in this market,” adds Rathod.\nTo begin with, the services will be available for users in Koramangala, Indiranagar, inner ring road and techpark and the destination can be anywhere in Bengaluru. “Bengaluru is a tech savvy city and has always adapted well to new technology, moreover it has a genuine transportation and congestion problem. Uber is already trying to solve this problem and with UberPool’s launch I am sure this problem will be solved to a greater extent,” Rathod said.\nTo ensure the safety of the commuters, just weeks prior to the launch of UberPool, Uber upgraded its in-app safety features and launched features like Help and disguised phone numbers. Help, according to Uber is a more convenient way for riders to trigger real time safety emergency alert to Uber and the local authorities in the rare event of an emergency or incident during an Uber trip. Disguised phone numbers on the other hand ensures that all calls between riders and driver-partners are connected using anonymous phone numbers so both sides can communicate with each other to coordinate a pick-up without revealing their personal phone numbers.\n 13, 2015 12:32 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:36:08.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
