The portion of the float reserved for them was subscribed 90 per cent.\nThe shares reserved for its employees saw a subscription of 86 per cent.\nThe maiden public offering of Prabhat Diary, which closed on September 4, managed to sail through but the shares set apart for retail investors were subscribed just 34 per cent.\nA total of 16 companies have launched their IPOs in 2015 so far and have collectively raised about Rs 7,800 crore, making it the best period in four years in terms of money raised through public offers.\nHowever, when it comes to response from retail investors, only 11 IPOs have witnessed full subscription for the portions reserved for such investors, while another six have seen a relatively tepid interest.\nApart from Coffee Day and Prabhat Dairy, shares reserved in IPOs of Pennar Engineered Building Systems, PNC Infratech, MEP Infrastructure Developers and Ortel Communications did not get enough response from the retail investors.\nThe portion reserved for retail investors in the IPO of MEP Infrastructure saw a subscription of 97 per cent, followed by Pennar Engineered (41 per cent), Ortel Communications (39 per cent) and PNC Infratech (28 per cent).\nIn case of seven IPOs out of total 16 so far this year, the portions reserved for HNIs remained under-subscribed. These included Coffee Day, Navkar Corp, Manpasand Beverages, PNC Infratech, Syngene, Adlabs and Ortel.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 1:11 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:10:31.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
