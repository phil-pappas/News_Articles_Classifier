Instead, we have a system which tends to deliver the very opposite: anodyne, nationwide-mandated policy reform that suits the need of at least a few regions with the least complaint from any of them.\" \nStill, federal systems, such as in Australia and the US where different provinces set their own legislation, would be an overkill for New Zealand, the group says. \nThe group has organised a panel discussion in Wellington on Monday to showcase the report and prompt discussion about the ideas it presents. \nNational MP Chris Bishop, Labour MP Clare Curran and NZ First's Ron Mark are talking at the event, as is well known Wellington investment banker Rob Cameron of Cameron Partners. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:17:03.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
