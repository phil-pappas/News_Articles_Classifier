Smith announces an investigation on behalf of investors in Apollo Education Group, Inc. (“Apollo Education” or the “Company”) ( APOL ) securities. The investigation focuses on whether the Company and its officers violated securities laws by issuing misleading information to investors related to the Company’s risks and liabilities and Apollo Education’s compliance with applicable government standards. \nOn October 9, 2015, the Company reported that the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) had placed Apollo Education’s wholly-owned subsidiary University of Phoenix, Inc. under probationary status and that the DoD might terminate the Company’s ability to provide services to the U.S. military. The Company further stated that the DoD placed the Company on probationary status due to alleged issues with the University of Phoenix’s marketing practices, and that a further investigation is underway by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and California Attorney General into the Company’s business practices, including the Company’s recruitment practices. On this news shares of Apollo Education declined sharply in value, falling $1.09 per share, or nearly 9%, during intra-day trading on October 9, 2015. \nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired Apollo Education securities and have suffered a loss, or if you have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Howard G.
