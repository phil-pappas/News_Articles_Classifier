The impact of this is widespread and, in one year, it has had policyholders waking up to the reality of being hit with taxation, even as the returns are meagre. Many single-premium policies offer pathetic insurance cover which clearly makes it taxable on maturity or surrender. Ironically, these products are sold for investment purposes for customer segments ranging from people in small towns to even HNIs (high net-worth individuals). Raj Pradhan had written the Cover Story about taxation on insurance and pension products in March 2013, to alert readers on the issue which has become even more relevant now. Confusingly, insurers have different opinions about TDS on pension and also about Form 15G/15H. Cut out the noise when investing in stocks, says R Balakrishnan.

Sucheta, in Crosshairs, writes on the implications of high frequency trading (HFT), as highlighted in the April 2015 report of the senior supervisory group (SSG) of global market regulators.

Through cases that come to us, at Moneylife Foundation’s credit helpline, we find that the lending system is completely unforgiving for those who have defaulted. Borrowers are unaware of their credit report or the system of credit bureaus. Many realise that they have been listed as defaulters only when they are refused a credit card or a loan. Sucheta writes about this one-sided system which affects genuine and creditworthy borrowers. On 28th November, Moneylife Foundation will be conducting a credit score camp. We’ll announce the details soon. To know the details, and to register for other events planned this month, visit foundation.moneylife.in .
