(HFF) announced today that it has closed the sale of The Shops at Sunset Place, a mixed-use lifestyle center anchored by a 24-screen AMC Theatre and multiple national retailers in Miami, Florida. \nHFF marketed the property on behalf of the sellers, Simon Property Group, Inc. and Miller Capital Advisory. A partnership led by Federal Realty, Grass River Property and Comras Company purchased the asset. An existing loan was assumed as a part of the transaction. \nThe Shops at Sunset Place is a four-level, open-air lifestyle center with a 1,862-space, eight-level parking garage. The mixed-use center has retail and office space in addition to a multi-housing component that was not included in the sale. The center is anchored by the 24-screen AMC 24, Barnes & Noble, LA Fitness, GameTime, Forever 21, Splitsville and Z Gallerie. Other tenants of the 84-percent-leased center include Gap, Hollister, Express, American Eagle Outfitters, Buffalo Wild Wings, Panera Bread, Mellow Mushroom, Armani Exchange and Banana Republic. Situated on 10.36 acres at 5701 Sunset Drive in South Miami where U.S. 1 and Red Road intersect, The Shops at Sunset Place has more than 1,000 feet of frontage on U.S. 1, Sunset and Red Roads, all high traffic commercial corridors. Additionally, the center is surrounded by many of Miami’s most affluent residential neighborhoods. \nThe HFF team representing the seller was led by senior managing director Daniel Finkle and managing director Luis Castillo. \n“The Shops at Sunset Place remains one of the premier mixed-use projects at an irreplaceable location in Miami,” Finkle said. “South Miami continues to be one of the most desirable commercial markets in South Florida, and The Shops at Sunset Place’s dominant position made this a coveted acquisition.” \nAbout Simon Property Group, Inc. \nSimon Property Group, Inc.
