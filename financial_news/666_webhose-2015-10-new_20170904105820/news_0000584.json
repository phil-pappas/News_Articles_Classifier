That reflected the relative weakness of the euro against the Chinese renminbi when compared with sterling. \nJUST A BLIP? \nBurberry forecast a return to around 5 percent growth in comparable sales in its second half of its financial year which runs until next March. \nHowever, analysts said it was not yet clear whether Burberry had just had a bad quarter or whether it was the beginning of a downward trend. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) would not be the first time we have seen a one-quarter blip at Burberry,\" JP Morgan Cazenove analyst Melanie Flouquet said. \nIndustry leader LVMH this week blamed the Chinese slowdown and stock market collapse for lower sales growth at its fashion and leather unit. Gucci owner Kering (Swiss: KER.SW - news ) publishes third-quarter sales next Thursday. \nBurberry's figures were more disappointing than LVMH's, said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca. \n\"There seems to be a sign of brand specific fatigue at Burberry,\" he said. \nSolca added that injecting fresh creativity and innovation into the brand might prove difficult to implement since Christopher Bailey is both chief executive and chief creative director. \n\"We have recently seen the case of Gucci, where CEO and creative director proximity reduced available options and delayed change, for a time,\" he said of a duo who were in a relationship and were eventually sacked last year. \nIn Sept. 2012, Burberry was to first to warn about a major slide in Chinese demand in response to the country's anti-corruption campaign. \nOn Thursday, it said it had addressed the tougher environment by reallocating marketing spend and controlling costs, such as travel expenses and performance related pay. \nThat would minimise the impact on profit for the 2015-16 year. \nIt said it expected to meet the average forecast of analysts who had recently updated forecasts, for adjusted pretax profit of 445 million pounds. It made 456 million in 2014-15.
