Nicholas Rider Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Reserve Bank of Australia believes the low Australian dollar and ultra-low official interest rates are helping the economy adjust to the end of the resources boom and have strengthened the labour market.\nWhile China's outlook continues to be clouded, the Reserve Bank board signalled in minutes of this month's meeting that there was no need to cut the benchmark cash rate below 2 per cent any time soon.\nIncreasingly, there are signs the economy is rebalancing towards non-mining investment, with the June quarter's growth figures dragged down by what appeared to be \"temporary weakness\" in resources exports.\n\"This rebalancing was being increasingly supported by the depreciation of the Australian dollar, which had led to a noticeable increase in net service exports over the year, the bank said in the minutes.\n\"Members noted that reductions in the cash rate earlier in the year continued to provide support to aggregate demand, particularly dwelling investment and household consumption.\"\nThe main domestic risk to financial stability, and the economy more broadly, continues to come from the housing market.\n\"Members noted that growth in lending for housing had been steady over recent months and that there were some signs of an easing in the strong rate of increase in dwelling prices in Sydney, in particular, although trends had been more varied in a number of other cities.\n\"At the same time, members judged that there were signs that the response of the banks to supervisory measures implemented by APRA were helping to manage risks in the housing market. Credit growth overall had been moderate.\"\n Lending standards key challenge Board members said a key challenge from here on would be ensuring that lending standards at banks do not weaken.\n\"While Australian banks continued to perform well, they were taking steps to enhance their resilience.\n\"Banks' asset performance continued to improve, profitability remained high, and the large banks had raised substantial amounts of capital in advance of forthcoming prudential requirements.\n\"Most banks had strengthened the serviceability metrics used in their mortgage lending and taken steps to slow the pace of growth in investor lending towards the prudential regulator's expectations.\n\"Banks were also reportedly becoming increasingly wary of lending to property developers in markets that were thought to be at risk of becoming oversupplied.\n\"Nonetheless, competition among lenders had intensified in the owner-occupied segment of the housing market and had continued to do so in parts of the business lending market.\"\nThe timing of an eventual US Federal Reserve interest rate hike continues to focus the minds of board members, some of whom noted that some in the financial markets don't expect an increase \"for the foreseeable future.\"\nThe Australian dollar rallied to $US72.65¢ from around $US72.45¢ just before the minutes were published.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-20T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:13:18.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
