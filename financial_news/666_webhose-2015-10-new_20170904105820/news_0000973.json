These new modules transform Asset Panda into the ultimate business software. Asset Panda has introduced five new modules: Compliance, Enterprise Service Desk, Facilities Management, Mobile Audit, and Purchase Order to expand its business reach beyond fixed asset tracking. Now, not only will customers be able to keep an accurate and updated record of every piece of equipment they own, they will be able to efficiently carry out other business processes such as requesting and approving purchase orders, ensuring equipments’ compliance with regulations, fixed assets support and maintenance requests, tracking facilities procedures and tasks, and auditing fixed assets straight from a mobile device.\n“Our goal is to create the best fixed asset management system available in the market, but in order to make it happen, we need to constantly evolve and expand our reach,” said Krista Lugo, Director of Operations. “We’ve launched five new modules but we haven’t stopped thinking about other businesses challenges that need solutions.” Asset Panda has set the precedent of innovation with their pioneering philosophy where every account is a premium account and now they aim to bring even more solutions to their premium customers.\nAsset Panda launched in 2012 as a division of LRK Partners and is headquarted in Plano, TX.
