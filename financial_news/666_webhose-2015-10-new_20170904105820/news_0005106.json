But it is simple economics.”\nMr Smith was speaking after the Federal Government yesterday unveiled its formal response to the Financial System Inquiry report handed down last December by inquiry head David Murray.\nThe Government backed Mr Murray’s call for the banks to have “unquestionably strong” capital buffers.\nThe banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, has since heaped pressure on the major lenders to set aside billions of dollars more to guard against a future financial crisis.\nMr Smith yesterday also backed Westpac chief Brian Hartzer, who was roundly criticised last week for hiking home loan rates out of cycle with the Reserve Bank to help pay for regulation.\n“He’s taken a bit of a battering which is probably a little unfair,” Mr Smith said.\n“The fact is if you are forced to raise capital, somebody has to pay for it.\n“This stuff doesn't come free — the choice is either the customer or the shareholder or a combination of both.”\nCommonwealth Bank chief Ian Narev welcomed the Government’s response, saying he agreed Australian banks should be “unquestionably strong” and recognised as such.\nThe Government said it accepted APRA’s push to ensure banks bolstered their books.\nMr Smith said the guidance from the Government suggested most of the “heavy lifting” had already been done by APRA in terms of capital buffers, but there was still “fine tuning” to take place.\nHe cautioned that the latest set of global guidelines around banking capital would “take a few years to sort out”.\nMr Smith declined to say whether further rate hikes were likely by Australian banks without a lead from the Reserve Bank. “I couldn’t possibly comment on that,” he said.\nAustralian Bankers’ Association chief Steven Munchenberg said customers would share some of the burden as banks raised capital.\n“I know people won’t see it like this when they are sitting around their kitchen table looking at their mortgages, but in many ways that extra cost is an investment in the security and safety of Australia’s economy in the future,’’ Mr Munchenberg told Sky Business.\nAmong other initiatives in response to the Financial System Inquiry, the Government said it would look into different systems for allocating default superannuation funds, and ban “excessive” surcharges on credit and debit-card transactions.\nIt will also introduce legislation to improve standards in the financial advice industry.\njeff.whalley@news.com.au\nOriginally published as Customers were warned, says ANZ chief", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/customers-were-warned-says-anz-chief/story-fni0dcne-1227576280559"], "published": "2015-10-21T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:33:48.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
