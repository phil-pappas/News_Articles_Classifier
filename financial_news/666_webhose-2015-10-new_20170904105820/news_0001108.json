This system is now being simplified, preparing the bank further for privatisation. \nThere are still some negative factors dragging down RBS’s financial results. \nIan Gordon, an Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) analyst, expects RBS to pay a further £600m in compensation for PPI and other misconduct, as well as £800m in restructuring costs in its third quarter results. \nThe bank is also awaiting a legal settlement for pre-crisis toxic loans sold in the US. This is expected to be in the region of $5bn (£3.3bn) but could come in at as much as $10bn . The bank will be the last of 18 banks to end the dispute with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If RBS does not agree a settlement, the case is expected to come to court next year. \nHowever, Bernstein maintains that a small dividend is likely in spite of a “worst-case litigation outcome”. \nAny settlement should also help the bank's share price, as it removes a cloud hanging over the stock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:48:39.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
