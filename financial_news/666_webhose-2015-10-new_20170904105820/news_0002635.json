The index, which sampled over 30,000 graduates, found that two-thirds graduated with debt. The average amount of the loan was $35,000.\nIt’s no surprise that graduates are discouraged. The number of student-loan borrowers owing between $50,000 and $75,000 has doubled since 2004, and the number of those owing more than $200,000 has tripled. Overall student-loan debt has increased by 325%, while all other categories of non-housing debt decreased by 5%.\nAlthough two-thirds of 2015 college grads needed loans, it hasn’t always been that way. In 1993, fewer than half needed loans, which averaged below $10,000, a third of today’s average loan. Although students didn’t have smartphones or the Internet in 1993, their overall debt burden was lower.\nCollege tuition has increased by 1,180% since records began in 1978, compared with 240% for food costs. Fifty-four percent of recent college graduates are either underemployed or unemployed. These days 115,000 janitors and a quarter of retail salespersons have college degrees.\nThis is the time when high school seniors are considering applying to college. Early applications at some schools are due next month. What can high school students do to graduate with lower debt? As the application process kicks into gear, here are five suggestions.\nCommunity colleges Community colleges deliver valuable courses of study — and credits — at a fraction of the price of four-year schools, both private and public. These credits can be transferred to many four-year schools, enabling students to get an education at half the price.\nStudents at the University of Texas at Austin explained to me when I visited last May that it wasn’t “cool” to get a degree from a community college. But when it’s a choice of graduating with $30,000 or $15,000 in debt, “cool” should be secondary.\nIf the cool factor is the issue, students could get together with high school buddies and all decide to do the community-college option together, and all could transfer to a four-year university. There’s safety in numbers, and a sensible decision by a peer group — encouraged by parents and guidance counselors — could enable cost savings and fun at the same time.\nWork colleges Some colleges, such as College of the Ozarks in Missouri, don’t charge any tuition. Known as “work colleges,” they are free of charge. Students work campus jobs in order to keep costs low. In addition, the colleges have businesses run by students that generate revenue.\nOther work colleges include Berea College in Kentucky, Sterling College in Vermont and Blackburn College in Illinois. Berea College students run the Boone Tavern Hotel and work in the local arts-and-crafts industry to generate income.\nIt is difficult to start a college and get accreditation. But with rising tuition, more colleges might choose to become work colleges to survive. It’s possible to envision a hospitality school, such as the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, that could run hotels at a profit and use the revenue to fund tuition.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.gallup.com/services/185888/gallup-purdue-index-report-2015.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:05:48.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
