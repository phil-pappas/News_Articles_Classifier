The judges include serial entrepreneur Henry Lane Fox and Angels Den founder Bill Morrow, among others. \nWomenswear start-up Gormley & Gamble was founded by 21-year-old Phoebe Gormley last year. The company already boasts a customer list that includes Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia and an unnamed Spanish princess. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is the only tailor dedicated to womenswear on Savile Row, and uses hi-tech silk printers to create one-off linings for its high-end pieces. \n\"We can print your Instagram feed or pictures from a family holiday,\" said Ms Gormley, who left university to start the business. \"We also use technology for pattern cutting that reduces human time and error.\" \nThe company, which charges between £200 and £1,200 for customised clothing, is on target to turn over six figures within its first 18 months trading. \"We'd love to win MassChallenge so that we could invest in getting samples made and employ someone to help with back of house,\" Ms Gormley said. \nCompare and Share (LSE: SHRE.L - news ) , an online directory of sharing economy businesses , was launched two and a half years ago by Benita Matofska, 48. The business helps users to sift through 7,850 websites across 17 categories, from minding your pet to ride-sharing. \n\"We have big ambitions to build the go-to brand for the sharing economy,\" said Ms Matofska. \"MassChallenge is a springboard for us.\" \nGiveVision uses wearable technology to help blind or partially-sighted people to \"see\" digitally. The start-up uses Google Glass and other hi-tech smartglasses to translate a visual world into an audio stream. \nGiveVision is currently trialling a prototype of its smartglass software with 180 users. \"People think it's science fiction but we can use technology to magnify or turn visual information into audio in real-time,\" said co-founder Elodie Draperi. \nThe other shortlisted companies are: BuyerDeck, Cambridge Bio Augmentation Systems, Carbon Analytics, Converge, DOYA Medical, Financial Market Rank, FoPo Food Powder, Glisser, Great Little Place, HelpingB, Live Better With..., MOM Incubators, Preliminal Games, RE-VANA, Renovagen, Resonance, Shoot, Sinclair Fire, twosigmas, Unique Access, Vidsy, World Around Me, and zipcube.com. \nThe winner will be announced on October 22 at a gala ceremony in London. \n\"These top 26 start-ups are poised to make a tremendous impact across a variety of industries, from transportation to healthcare to robotics,\" said MassChallenge founder John Harthorne. \nMassChallenge is a not-for-profit organisation, which aims to fund and support emerging technology talent.
