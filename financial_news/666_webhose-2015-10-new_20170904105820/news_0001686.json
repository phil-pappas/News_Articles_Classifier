Slightly more than 14,000 additional new jobs are needed if Australia is going to maintain its current rate of 6.2 per cent unemployment. Analysts have a consensus view of 9600 new jobs, which would keep the employment rate on track after several surprisingly positive months.\nMonthly employment numbers are particularly precarious as analysts wait to see the slowing mining boom, and associated redundancies and finished contracts, hit the totals.\nBetaShares economist David Bassanese said mining employment peaked in May 2012, and has shed 60,000 jobs since then, before 30,000 new jobs in mining were created over the past six months.\nRequired employment growth. NAB \"It remains well above levels earlier this decade and further weakness seems likely,\" he said.\nThe National Australia Bank said it was expecting employment growth will continue on trend in September.\n\"Forward indicators of employment growth remain solid, and suggest employment growth of around 17,000,\" economist Tapas Strickland said.\n\"We suggest some moderation could be expected this month with our own headline models undershooting actual employment outcomes for the past two months.\"\n Economics and investment firm TD Securities is expecting a weak, flat outlook on jobs growth.\n\"We have forecast this because after months of outsized increases, both raw and seasonally adjusted, a breather is due and the message from the leading indicators is that annual employment growth is likely to remain around 2 per cent a year, and a flat outcome (in September) is consistent with that,\" chief Asia-Pacific macro strategist Annette Beacher said.\nThe data is a significant economic indicator and is one of the key influences on the dollar.\n\"We expect markets to remain sensitive given better than expected employment outcomes (and business conditions) have driven the Reserve Bank Australia's more favourable assessment of the economy and hence economists' expectations of the RBA being on hold,\" Mr Strickland said.\nHigh unemployment is never good news, but it could be especially concerning given a spike in unemployment rates could place additional pressure on Australia's booming housing sector, potentially leading to defaults and significant impact on prices.\nWhile many aspiring home owners are priced out of the market, real estate is one of the few sectors spurring the economy along as it transitions from a mining-led economy to services-based growth.\nThe former head of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has accused the organisation of badly bungling the way it collects and analyses its monthly employment survey and said parts of it should be dumped immediately for as long as five years.\nAfter working for the organisation for over 40 years, Bill McLennan said changes early last year to the way the data is gathered suggest the bureau has abandoned \"strict methodological and operational practices\" established over half a century ago.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:03:13.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
