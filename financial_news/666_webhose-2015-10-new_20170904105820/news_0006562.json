The gruesome nature of the crime shocked nation. This week’s release Talvar, is another ‘take’ on the story after Rahasya and the plot treads on similar lines. Will Talvar prove to be as sharp as its moniker in decimating its rivals at with its box office collections , or not, is the question.\nThe film starts off with an ‘official introduction’ of Inspector Ashwin Kumar (Irrfan Khan) in the officers’ get together of CDI (Central Department of Investigation). This is followed by his senior officers’ handing over to him the double murder case. The film then goes into a flashback of events which had led to the murders. The flashback shows the family of the Tandons which consists of Nutan Tandon (Konkona Sen Sharma), Ramesh Tandon (Neeraj Kabi), their daughter Shruti Tandon (Ayesha Parveen) and their domestic help Khempal. Needless to say, the body of Shruti is discovered on a bloodied bed. Police picks up Tandons’ domestic help’s close friend Kanhaiya. Based on his ‘assumptions’, he spins a story that it was the husband-wife duo who had killed their daughter because they had seen her in a compromising position with Khempal. Wasting no time, Inspector Dhaniram and his senior officer declare the murder as a clear case of ‘honour killing’. Who ultimately are the killers of the 14 year old Shruti Tandon? Do they happen to be Shruti’s own parents or someone else? And does the case ultimately get solved after all the unexpected twists and turns is what forms the rest of the story.\nThe film’s director Meghna Gulzar, who, has to her credit of having directed films like Filhaal, Just Married and Dus Kahaniyan tries her hand in the hard-hitting genre with Talvar. She does full justice to the film as a director. Talvar is such a film in which the script is the undisputed hero. And Meghna has let the film’s ‘hero’ do the talking. The film’s narrative is superlatively gripping and keeps the audiences glued to the edge of their seats till the end. While the first half of the film is outstanding and tight, the second half slows down after the interval, but picks up towards the end.\nEven though the film is powerhouse of talent, it is Irrfan Khan who leads the film right from his entry. With this film, he has yet again proved why he is the most bankable star in Bollywood today. His performance is absolutely magnetic and compelling. Even though Konkona Sen Sharma seems to have underplayed her role, she is convincing in her part.\nOn the whole, Talvar is an engaging, edgy thriller with no dull moments. A must watch.\nRating: 3.5/5\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 10:36 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:05:05.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
