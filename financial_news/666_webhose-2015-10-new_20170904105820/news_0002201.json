Dallas Kilponen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Treasurer Scott Morrison is not expecting internal Liberal party tensions fuelled by Tony Abbott's dumping to disappear overnight.\nHe said, however, that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull gaining a further lead over Opposition Leader Bill Shorten in the latest Newspoll was a sign the country supported the leadership change.\nThe comments come after a volatile weekend for Mr Turnbull who was heckled by members of his own party at an event and came under pressure from his colleague, National's deputy leader Barnaby Joyce, over their post-coup agreement on irrigation.\nMr Morrison said there would be \"bruised feelings\" in some parts of the party, and they were dealing with the tension by \"getting on with the job\".\n\"There will still be some bruised feelings out there for a period of time. We acknowledge that. The best response the Government has and the Prime Minister and I and others have is to get on with the job,\" he said.\nMr Joyce revealed he wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to ensure day to day responsibility for water remains within his portfolio, rather than being given to a junior minister, Senator Anne Ruston.\nNational Party sources said Mr Joyce wants Senator Ruston to be given horticulture and wine.\n\"We're in the process of negotiating the role... outlined in the charter letters and how you are going to work with your junior ministers,\" he told the ABC on Monday.\n Mr Joyce indicated part of honouring the Coalition agreement would be taking control of water, after the deal was rewritten when Mr Turnbull came to power.\n\"The Coalition is a business arrangement between two parties and within that certain requirements are there, and we support the Prime Minister and legislation and with that come other things.\n\"One of those [is] that water return to agriculture, and I'm absolutely certain that will happen,\" he said.\nIn some good news for Mr Turnbull, the latest Newspoll, published in The Australian , has 57 per cent of people regarding Mr Turnbull as the better prime minister, two points more than last month, while Mr Shorten lost two points to be preferred by just 19 per cent of respondents.\nBut the parties were deadlocked at 50-50 on a two party preferred basis, down from 51-49 in the Coalition's favour in the last Newspoll in September.\nWelcoming the poll results, new Industry minister and South Australian MP, Christopher Pyne, gave an indication of how spooked some Liberals had been under Mr Abbott's leadership.\n\"I went out supermarketing out in my electorate on Saturday it was one of the best experiences I've had in the last few years meeting my electors.\n\"About a month before I went to a supermarket in my electorate and it was one of the worst experiences I'd had as a member of parliament,\" he said.\nSaturday delivered an awkward moment for the new leader at a NSW Liberal Party event where he was publicly heckled by fellow members.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott is also expected to make his first appearance on the backbench after being dumped as leader on Monday.\nHe will be seated next to dumped Treasurer Joe Hockey and dumped Defence Minister Kevin Andrews, who has been less than subtle about his disappointment in losing the portfolio.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:38:39.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
