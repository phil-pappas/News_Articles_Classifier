EBA is one of the industry’s most prominent voices in the benefits industry.\nSelden Beattie founder and CEO Beverly E. Beattie and Chief Client Officer Monica Digon were recognized as women who excel in categories including significantly increasing a firm’s sales or market share, providing strategic consulting to help clients achieve their highest goals, fostering employee benefit innovations, advocating successfully for advisor causes and, in general, elevating the status of all women in the profession.\nAnother UBA Partner, Russ Blakely, CEO of Russ Blakely & Associates, was a featured speaker at the EBN Benefits Forum and Expo, held Sept. 30 – Oct. 3 in Orlando, Florida, presenting his groundbreaking work on the concept of Personal Physician Networks.\nPersonal Physician Networks utilize on-site health clinics and pharmacies, enabling an employer to partner directly with a group of physicians dedicated to serving their employee population. Blakely, who has tested this market disruptive strategy with employers in the southeastern U.S., says participating employers are saving hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on their health care.\n\"The combination of onsite clinics, onsite pharmacies, and the Personal Physician Network have been a home run to several area employers in the Chattanooga area,” says Blakely. “It’s like a network within a network, and so far has been met with great success.”\nUBA is a unique community of nearly 140 independent employee benefits advisory firms, comprised of more than 2,200 professionals offering thought leadership and best-in-class solutions that positively impact employers. With partners in 42 states, Canada and the United Kingdom, UBA is the nation’s leading organization of independent benefits advisors.\n“We are thriving because we offer the best of both worlds: national presence and local advice, including our annual Health Plan Survey of nearly 10,000 employers, plus hundreds of advisors on the front lines of health care benefits,” says Les McPhearson, CEO of UBA. “By collaborating together, pooling resources and insisting on class leading solutions, UBA has become a recognized leader in the market at a time when many industry professionals are struggling.”\nFor further information, contact UBA to explore stories about local approaches to controlling health plan costs, or pre-order a copy of the 2015 UBA Health Plan Survey Executive Summary today at https://www.ubabenefits.com/wisdom/surveys .

The report database contains the validated responses of 18,186 health plans, sponsored by 10,804 employers, who cumulatively employ more than two million employees and more than five million total lives. Individually validated responses from employers in more than 3,000 communities were utilized in compiling the database.\nWhile other surveys primarily target large employers, the focus of the UBA survey is to report results that are applicable to the small and mid-size companies that represent the overwhelming majority of the nation’s employers, while also including a mix of large companies in rough proportion to their actual prevalence nationally.\nThe survey includes plan renewals from June 2014 to May 2015 through the joint effort of 129 of the nation’s premier independent benefit advisory firms, which comprise UBA. The national distribution of UBA Partner Firms, the diversity of their client base, and the extraordinary number of survey responses provided a unique basis to conduct a non-probability sample survey that yields benchmark results that pertain to a representative cross-section of the nation’s employers.\nContact a UBA Partner Firm for a customized benchmark survey based on industry, region and business size.\nAbout United Benefit Advisors\nUnited Benefit Advisors is the nation's leading independent employee benefits advisory organization with more than 200 offices throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.
