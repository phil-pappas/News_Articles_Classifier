The Maine railroad filed for bankruptcy, and the settlement fund is part of those bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. and Canada. \nWrongful-death lawsuits were put on hold pending approval of the settlement, which is valued at $338 million in U.S. currency, or $446 million in Canadian currency. Judges in Maine and Quebec have given their approval to the fund, which includes about $110 million in Canadian currency to settle wrongful-death claims brought by victims' families. \nCanadian Pacific declined to contribute to the settlement fund, opening itself up to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, unlike settlement contributors that were offered legal protections. \nCanadian Pacific, which transported the oil shipment from North Dakota to Quebec, had fought the settlement until it obtained a judgment reduction provision that allowed it to drop its opposition. \nFinal legal formalities should be wrapped up this week, and payments are expected to be made to victims by year's end, said Robert Keach, a U.S. bankruptcy attorney in Portland. \nBut lawsuits against Canadian Pacific could drag on for a year or more. \nFlowers, who's seeking monetary damages, said he could have his lawsuit before a jury in the Circuit Court of Cook County within 18 months. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:46:34.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
