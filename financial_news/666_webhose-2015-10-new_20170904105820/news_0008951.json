Oliver Sanderson, an analyst at Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) Point Carbon, said this was possibly a reaction to low prices. \nIn the power market, Torness-2 nuclear reactor is expected to restart on Friday, reducing the need for gas-fired power generation. \nFurther along the curve, front-month November gas prices were down 0.05 pence at 41.25 pence/therm. \nThe new forward seasonal contract, summer 2016, was down 0.15 pence at 38.50 pence/therm. \nIn the Netherlands, the day-ahead gas price at the TTF hub was down 0.17 euros at 17.83 euros per megawatt-hour. \nIn Europe's carbon market, the benchmark EU Allowance (EUA) edged down by 0.04 euros to 8.13 euros a tonne.
