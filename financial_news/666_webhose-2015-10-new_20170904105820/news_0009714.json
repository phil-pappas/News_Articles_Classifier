Afterwards she will draw on CPP and OAS to bolster her income, along with a small pension from a previous employer -- about $350 a month.\nMargaret also has a TFSA of about $40,000 to serve as a slush fund for home repairs and vacations.\nBut she has one other significant source of savings she hopes will remain untouched throughout retirement: about $69,000 of stock in a blue-chip Canadian company.\n\"I'd like to leave that for my daughter,\" Margaret says. \"It's my little nest egg for her.\"\nCertified financial planner Doreen Sigurdson, with Edmond Financial Group in Winnipeg, says Margaret would be in good shape heading into retirement if she didn't have the mortgage.\n\"She is currently paying it off quite aggressively at $1,118 per month, which will take about eight years,\" says Sigurdson, also a registered financial planner and chartered life underwriter.\n\"So if she retires in three years, the monthly payment cannot be sustained from her pension income alone, meaning she will use up her savings quickly to pay the mortgage off around age 60.\"\nHere's how the numbers might play out: annually increasing her income needs to keep pace with inflation, Margaret could build an after-tax monthly income of about $2,300 a month from both pensions and all her savings, excluding the stock, to age 90.\nThis falls short of her current monthly expenses of $3,383, which includes the mortgage payment. To make up for the deficit early on in retirement, she would need to lean heavily on her RRSP.\n\"Margaret would need to draw an extra $17,000 per year gross -- or $13,400 net -- from her RRSP from age 55 to 60 to pay off her mortgage,\" Sigurdson says. \"As a result, she will deplete her RRSP right around age 60.\"\nWithout a mortgage payment, and some costs associated with full-time work, Margaret's monthly budget would fall to about $2,165 in retirement. Yet without the RRSP, she would face another shortfall from age 60 to 65: about $5,000 net a year.\nEven worse, this deficit would actually grow from 65 to 67. Due to changes a couple of years ago by the federal government, OAS eligibility increased from age 65 to 67 for Canadians born after January 1962.\nSo Margaret would lose about $6,839 annually before taxes in today's dollars. Moreover, once she turns 65, her main work pension's bridging benefit ends, resulting in a drop in pension income of about $5,000 net a year.\nStill, Margaret does have a few options to deal with these retirement-planning challenges. She could, for example, sell her blue-chip stock -- worth about $69,000 -- to help cover costs.\nWhile Margaret wants to hold onto this asset for her daughter, it is \"a ready source of capital that could be used now to allow her to retire early,\" says Sigurdson.\n\"If she doesn't want to consider selling the shares, she could use her TFSA holdings to apply against her mortgage. However, her TFSA is a nice lump sum of money to carry into retirement to use as an emergency fund, or for extras.\"\nAnother option would be to refinance her mortgage at retirement, stretching the amortization for 25 years on an amount owing of about $68,000. This would reduce her monthly mortgage payment to $300.\nMargaret could also sell her home and move to a less costly condominium to eliminate her mortgage.\nSigurdson says Margaret should also consider taking CPP at 60 instead of 65 to avoid a common problem for retirees who retire prior to age 60.\n\"If she delays CPP until age 65, she may end up with many years of less than the maximum contributions to the plan that would ultimately hurt her monthly entitlement overall,\" Sigurdson says.\n\"If we take into account the additional payments she will receive by drawing earlier, it shows her being in a better position, using age 90 as her life expectancy.\"\nWhile these changes may allow Margaret to retire at 55, she would have to largely live off pension income after age 65.\nThat's a risky gambit that could leave her with little ability to absorb unexpected costs late in life. As a result, Sigurdson suggests Margaret's best choice is likely none of the above.\nInstead, she should consider delaying retirement to contribute more to savings while allowing the value of her monthly work pension benefit to increase.\nEqually importantly, it would afford her more time to pay off her mortgage.\n\"Two or three more years of work could make really make the difference between a worry-free retirement and being stressed with living on not quite enough income,\" says Sigurdson.\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:04:09.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
