After the bubble burst, thousands of people’s homes went “underwater,” that is to say that the mortgage is worth more than the property itself, and stayed that way. It led to the middle class catastrophe as a nation of homeowners found themselves not only unemployed or under-employed, but also unable to even sell homes they could no longer afford. \nAlthough employment has largely recovered, property values in many areas continue to struggle under the weight of a buyer’s market . Thousands of homeowners still owe more on their property than it’s worth. It’s a financially tough position to be in, locked into a piece of property that’s too expensive to leave, but fortunately there are some government programs to help. \nOne of the best is set to sunset at the end of next year. HARP, the Home Affordable Refinance Program, was passed in 2009 by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) as a way to help homeowners better manage their mortgages. It helps people with negative equity (“underwater”) properties refinance at new, lower rates to which they otherwise wouldn’t have access. \nMillions of people have taken advantage of HARP, and according to the website LowerMyBills.com up to 700,000 more could still qualify.
