Photo: Brendon Thorne\nWhen someone is regarded as running a small business, they have access to the small business entity concessions. These concessions relate to income tax, capital gains tax, pay-as-you-go instalment tax, GST and fringe benefits tax.\nIn addition, when someone is classed as self-employed, they can make tax-deductible super contributions up to the relevant concessional contribution limits. The problem is the tests applied to decide whether someone is running a small business as a contractor , or is really an employee, are complicated.\nQ. I work as an independent contractor for a large plumbing business and get paid on an hourly basis for the work that I do. I am starting to think about making tax-deductible self-employed super contributions. Am I eligible to make these tax-deductible contributions?\nA. The Australian Taxation Office has issued much information on what determines whether a person is running a business as an independent contractor or whether they are really an employee. If the ATO made a ruling that you are in fact an employee and not running a business, you could not claim a tax deduction for the super contribution and the plumbing business would be liable to make compulsory super contributions on your behalf.\nAdvertisement One of the publications issued by the ATO related to contractors and employees sets out the characteristics, which are effectively six tests, that decide whether a person who works as a contractor will be classed as running a business or not. The six tests are as follows:\nThis test requires a contractor to have the ability to appoint or subcontract someone else to do the work on their behalf rather than being required to do the work. This means if the plumbing business requires you to perform all of the work you would fail this test. An independent contractor must be paid to produce a result, preferably based on a Quote: , rather than just being paid on an hourly basis. As you are being paid on an hourly rate, this would mean that you would more than likely be classed as an employee. The tools, equipment and other assets used to perform the work must all be supplied by the independent contractor and they cannot receive an allowance or reimbursement for the cost of the tools or equipment. Where there is a mistake made by an independent contractor, they must be liable to fix any defects and mistakes at their own cost and they are, therefore, legally responsible for the quality of their work. An independent contractor has full control over how they perform the work and, effectively, do not have someone directing them how to perform their duties. The final test requires the independent contractor to have the ability to refuse work and also work for other people, rather than only working for the one business. From what you have described, because you are working for an hourly rate rather than being contracted to produce a result, you would not be classed as an independent contractor and, therefore, could not make tax-deductible self-employed super contributions.\nQuestions on small business income tax and other issues can be emailed to max@taxbiz.com.au\nMax Newham is the founder of www.smsfsurvivalcentre.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:16:50.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
