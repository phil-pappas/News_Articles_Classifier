My husband and I attempt (not always successfully) to continue the cost-conscious tradition I grew up with where saving was routine. We try to comparison shop and find value (which doesn’t always mean the cheapest option.) I’m not as extreme as my parents, whose cars regularly topped 200,000 miles and who reserved bread bags to pack lunches in and displayed countless other saving ways. But we do attempt to spend mindfully, look for coupons and when we splurge, to do so with the aim of improving daily life – though to be sure not all spending hits that bar. Studies show that while money may not buy happiness, some purchases enhance the quality of your life and money spent on experiences can have a lasting benefit.So looking back over my recent buys, I chose to exclude “necessity” shopping – or anything I lacked much choice over including food, energy and electricity costs, utilities and housing. Our family’s grocery list remains strikingly similar week to week from bananas to milk, and well, we have to eat. I’d say the same with utilities and housing – we could cut back just at the margins unless we drastically changed our lifestyle by downsizing, as many families are attempting to do these days. I also omitted my husband's purchases.But keeping a record of my spending also reminded me of one of the first money lessons from childhood, and not in a good way. My parents required that my sister and I jot down all our financial transactions (small as they might have been) in an account ledger before they would dole out our allowance. It was an exercise intended to encourage awareness, or consciousness of our spending – to really know what we spent. Granted, as a kid, my sister and I loathed our “accounts” and regularly rebelled, but even as a reluctant participant I could see patterns in spending, saving and earning, as I hope to now.[caption id=\"attachment_63b2735435a049efa044790810b4d842\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Cellist Yo-Yo Ma in rehearsal. (AP Photo/Steven Senne)[/caption] Sunday 1. Family concert with Yo-Yo Ma and The Knights (tickets for 3): $40 A delight to hear Yo-Yo Ma, including his amusing responses to audience questions from children, like ‘Do you play other instruments?’ The famous cellist's response: picking up a colleague’s violin to eek out one bar of “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.” Wednesday 2. Diner dinner: $32 We were all recovering from colds and comfort food like the diner’s yummy chicken soup appealed. Thursday 3. Mom’s night out for drinks: $17 Getting out with other moms was a great chance to compare notes about our fledgling kindergarteners and see friends. Friday 4. Tea and a treat with a friend: $14 After many failed attempts to get together, I reconnected with an old friend. It was great to catch up in person, not just by phone or e-mail. 5. ‘Madeline’ book and birthday card: $23 We chose the first “Madeline” book as a gift for a new school friend’s birthday – a classic and favorite of ours. (If duplicative, a gift receipt will permit exchange.) 6. Overhead fan: $147 OK, this is one I wish cost less, but overhead fans just aren’t cheap. I’m trying to look at the bright side in the hopes that we will use less energy long-term with a fan rather than relying on air conditioning. (Besides, life will improve without my husband complaining about stuffy air.) And after comparison shopping, I was pleased to spot a coupon for a local dealer, much to the amusement of the salesman, Jeff. Saturday 7. Take-out pizza: $27 This was a welcome break – totally worth it especially since we had to cancel our babysitter and night out due to an utterly exhausted new kindergartener. Sunday 8. [entity display=\"Netflix\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"netflix\" ticker=\"NFLX\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/6132\"]Netflix[/entity]: $8 A bargain appealing to the entire family for on-demand watching. (Unlimited Angelina Ballerina? Priceless.) Monday 9. Household supplies: $20 It’s always surprising how quickly buying “just a few things” can suddenly add up to $20. Tuesday 10. Kate Atkinson’s ‘A God in Ruins’: $20 I’m looking forward to reading this for my new book club and good reviews suggest this will be a keeper. Besides, I rarely regret the purchase of a book – though I could have borrowed it from the library (perhaps something to consider next time.) Want to let FORBES into your wallet?
