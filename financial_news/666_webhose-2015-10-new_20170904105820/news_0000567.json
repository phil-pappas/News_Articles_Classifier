DraftKings has pledged to give away at least $1 billion. The companies are valued at $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nNew-York based Fanduel, which was early to the market in 2009 and long the dominant player, started with a relatively muted approach. It gave fantasy-sports players a chance to compete for prizes by building virtual teams of athletes. In 2013, it raised $11 million in financing from venture-capital companies. The following year it raised another $70 million.\nBut what pushed the business to its current frenzied level was the fast rise of Boston-based DraftKings, founded in 2012, which adopted a more aggressive fundraising and marketing posture and quickly came to rival FanDuel in size and profile.\nENLARGE The fantasy-sports website FanDuel. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images\nFanDuel has declined to comment on the federal probe. The company has said fantasy sports are a legal game of skill and not gambling. DraftKings in a statement said they “strongly disagree with any notion that our company has engaged in any illegal activities.”\nAs part of its pedal-to-the-metal culture, people familiar with DraftKings said, it spared no expense pursuing one goal: getting as many customers as possible.\nWhile both companies blanketed the country with advertisements this fall. DraftKings’s $81 million in ad spending between Aug. 1 and mid-September was four times the $20 million FanDuel spent in that time, according to iSpot.tv.\nAdam Krejcik, managing director of digital and interactive gaming at Eilers Research LLC, said last month the NFL season, when fantasy-sports activity peaks, would be “make or break” for the industry.\nBut the fuel that ignited the current spending boom was the most recent round of financing this July, when FanDuel raised $275 million from six investors while DraftKings announced it had secured $300 million. Companies that were listed as investors included Google Capital , GOOGL 0.33 % KKR , KKR 0.56 % Comcast , CMCSA 0.51 % TimeWarner and 21st Century Fox FOX 0.75 % in addition to several major sports leagues.\nDraftKings raised roughly half of its money from media companies and sports leagues including Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League and Madison Square Garden. These deals gave the company credibility as well as valuable exposure in sports venues and on team and league websites. DraftKings also bought the rights to become the official daily-fantasy partner of NHL, MLB and Major League Soccer, allowing the right to use official league marks on their games, people familiar with the deals said.\nDraftKings often landed these deals ahead of competitors by offering extremely generous terms, the people said. In July, Fox Networks contributed $150 million to a $300 million venture-funding round for DraftKings and received an 11% stake in the company. In a related deal with Fox, DraftKings agreed to spend $250 million during the next three years on advertisements for the company’s Fox Sports unit, said a person familiar with the terms. That arrangement allowed Fox to take an ownership stake while collecting a 66% return on its money within three years.\nFantasy Sports Trade Association Gets Subpoena From U.S. Prosecutor Daily Fantasy Sports Sites Ordered to Shut Down in Nevada (Oct. 15, 2015) FBI, Justice Department Investigating Daily Fantasy Sports Business Model (Oct. 15, 2015) Yahoo, NHL Ban Employees from Paid Fantasy-Sports Sites (Oct. 9, 2015) Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp NWSA 2.10 % and 21st Century Fox were part of the same company until 2013.\nA person familiar with the Fox investment said the promise of advertising was a major incentive for investing in the company. Another reason was research that suggested daily fantasy would encourage players to watch more sports.\nPeople familiar with the MLS and MLB investments in DraftKings said neither paid cash for their stakes. Instead, DraftKings offered to pay the leagues to become an official sponsor. These payments, these people said, involved a combination of cash and stock. Because DraftKings had issued stock to these partners, the company listed them as investors in the funding round, even though the leagues had not spent a dime. The deal terms also allowed DraftKings to increase its valuation to $1.2 billion.\n“We prioritize and place a different value on some of these partnerships than our competition because of the product differentiation they allow,” said DraftKings chief executive Jason Robins. “Our competition might see this as advertising. The integrations we receive create a differentiated experience.”\nFanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles acknowledged that competition from DraftKings has changed the landscape, but said the company hasn’t dramatically altered its strategy in response. “I’d put their rapid ascent on simply spending a lot of money,” he said. “We’re very focused on building a long-term business.”\nFanDuel and DraftKings, the biggest daily fantasy-sports operators, are now valued at more than $1 billion each. WSJ’s Kate O’Keeffe explains how the online sports leagues work.\nMr. Eccles said FanDuel turned down the same big media deals struck by DraftKings in part because the company believes digital media is outpacing television. “We were offered all of those deals. I think those are very bad deals,” he said.\n“We did not want to be in a place where we were committing to media over multiple years when we’re seeing a dramatic shift.”\nWhile FanDuel’s investors include TimeWarner, NBC Sports and Comcast, Mr. Eccles said FanDuel refused to agree to buy advertising in exchange for investments.\nDaily-fantasy games are expected to generate roughly $3.72 billion in entry fees and $370 million in revenue this year, according to industry consultant Eilers Research. By 2020, they are expected to reach about $17.7 billion and $1.77 billion, respectively.\nLast week, after a DraftKings employee admitted to prematurely releasing sensitive data about the site’s biggest contest, the companies released joint statements asserting that they have “strong policies in place” to ensure proper handling of data. This week The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department and FBI were probing whether the daily-fantasy business model violates federal law.\n—Sarah E.
