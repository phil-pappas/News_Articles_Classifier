The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.\nChina had set the tone late on Friday when its central bank cut the benchmark one-year lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to 17.5 percent.\nThe surprise move lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that the central bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates into even deeper negative levels.\nThat saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them rather than get paid.\nThe benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.\nAs negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989.\nThe yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, following the lead from the ECB and China.\n\"Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound. Markets are now expecting easing from the BOJ,\" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank.\nThe offshore yuan traded at 6.3908 to the dollar, near one-month low of 6.3990 hit on Friday after China's rate cut.\nMarkets are looking to Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a five-year plan.\nAhead of the meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.\nOil prices fell, however, still pressured by concerns of over-supplies.\nBrent futures stood at $44.62, little changed so far this week after having fallen 5.6 percent last week.
