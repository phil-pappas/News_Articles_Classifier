Steven Siewert by Joanna Mather The union movement is outraged at the Turnbull government's willingness to challenge its control over the $433 billion industry superannuation system but isn't signalling what it plans to do about it.\nGovernment plans to force changes in the make-up of super fund boards and to break open the lucrative default system have angered the Australian Council of Trade Unions.\n\"Workers have been served extremely well by high performing industry super funds and we will continue to stand up against attacks on industry superannuation that would reduce members' retirement savings,\" ACTU president Ged Kearney said.\nThe ACTU wouldn't say if it is preparing a public campaign to convince voters that the changes would hurt their savings.\n\"We live in an era when the biggest wealth management game in town is the investment of the nation's superannuation and retirement funds, which is now worth more than $2 trillion and growing fast,\" Ms Kearney wrote in Friday's The Australian Financial Review .\n\"This is shaping up to be a contest between a corporatised for-profit sector and a not-for-profit industry fund sector as to who should be the custodians of these funds.\"\n The union-aligned industry super sector is also upset over a speech by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority member Helen Rowell, who accused parts of the super industry of promoting \"fallacies\" about their superior performance on fees and investment returns.\n\"There is a fine line between a regulator making an observation of the operation of an intended policy, and advocacy for that policy,\" Industry Super Australia chief executive David Whiteley said.\n\"The perception is that on this occasion the regulator crossed the line into political advocacy. This is regrettable, and a situation APRA is unlikely to want to be in.\"\nIn a Senate committee hearing on Thursday, Labor politicians pressed Ms Rowell on whether she had been too overly political. She denied being influenced by the government or Treasury.\nLong history Industry super funds, which are jointly run by union and employers, have long boasted lower fees and superior returns to their retail rivals, which are owned by banks and other for-profit financial institutions.\nMs Rowell took a swipe at that claim. \"Across the different industry segments, the median and range of returns for MySuper products is broadly the same, as are the median and range for total fees and costs,\" she said earlier this week.\nThe former Labor government introduced MySuper to deal with issues relating to competition, including fee competition and transparency.\nAnalysts said it was true that the fee gap between retail and industry funds had narrowed but the jury was still out on investment performance. Questions have been raised over why Ms Rowell cited only a year's worth of data.\n\"Given the generally strong equity markets since the launch of MySuper products in January 2014, and the greater exposure to listed markets for the retail sector, it may appear as if the playing field has levelled out between the two competing sectors,\" SuperRatings chief executive Adam Gee said.\n\"It is important to note, however, that the investment horizon has not yet been long enough to make categorical conclusions in relation to the performance of MySuper products across a full market cycle.\"\nAside from fees, there are a range of factors that set the funds apart.\nLong investment horizons Industry super funds tend to have younger members with long investment horizons, which allowed them to invest in infrastructure and therefore shield members from the equity dives of the global financial crisis.\nAs Ms Rowell noted, retail funds tend to have older, richer members who are more inclined to switch funds. This liquidity requirement affects decisions about asset allocation.\nUnder legislation before Parliament, all super funds will be required to have one-third of board seats filled by independent directors from July 2017, and a majority of independent directors on an \"if not, why not\" basis by July 2019.\nMs Kearney insists the changes are dangerous. \"By shifting the balance of Industry Super boards so that the majority are Directors with a particularly motivated business focus will bring the same culture to super funds as exists currently with banks and retail funds,\" she has written.\n\"Then these hard-working member-led superannuation funds will be brought to the same level as the rest of the industry, which offers lower returns and is plagued by scandal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:48:37.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
