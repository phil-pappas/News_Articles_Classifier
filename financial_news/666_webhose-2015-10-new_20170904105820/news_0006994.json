The JV is expected to benefit from GIC’s experience of investing in integrated developments across the globe,” DLF had said.\nThe company sold around 50 per cent shareholdings in these two upcoming projects, adjacent to existing project ‘Capital Green’ at Moti Nagar here.\nSources said DLF wants to maintain the debt of its residential business (DevCo) at current levels by raising private equity funds at project level.\nIn the short-term, PE funds would be the substitute for the cash flow which would have normally come from sales.\nDLF’s net debt stood at Rs 21,598 crore as on June 30, 2015, of which the net debt attributable to development business (DevCo) was Rs 7,598 crore while Rs 14,000 crore pertained to rental arm (RentCo).\nIn the rent business, DLF’s Board had earlier this month decided that promoters would sell their 40 per cent stake in the company’s rental arm DLF Cyber City Developers Ltd (DCCDL).\nDLF would continue to hold 60 per cent stake in DCCDL.\nPromoters will re-invest a significant part of the amount realised from the proposed sale in DLF Ltd, which in turn would utilise this fund to trim its debt.\nRental business’ debt could rise slightly till promoters sell their stake in DCCDL and reinvest significant part of that amount in DLF, sources said.\nDLF expects to earn an annual rental income of Rs 2,400 crore this fiscal by leasing its commercial properties having 30 million sq ft of area.\nThe company has a land bank of nearly 300 million sq ft, of which about 50 million sq ft is under construction.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 4:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:20:50.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
