Any expert group can make its recommendations but it should go to the government only through the panel of MPs.\n“Any expert group’s recommendations cannot be superimposed on the panel of MPs,” a member of the Committee told PTI on the condition of anonymity.\nSources said MPs from most parties, who attended the meeting today, made it clear that the mandate of the Parliamentary panel should “not be diluted”.\n“Our argument is that even if a three-member commission is set up, it should function under the Parliamentary panel which should have the powers to review its recommendations. Otherwise what is the point in continuing with this Parliamentary panel,” the member said.\nWith the members not willing to allow any independent mechanism to have its sole say in determining their salary and allowances, the issue is back to square one.\nProposing the Emoluments Commission to determine salary and allowances of MPs, Government had said that was being done to decide this in a fair, transparent and equitable manner.\n“The setting up of an independent Emoluments Commission for recommending the salaries and allowances of MPs will not only put to rest the public outcry and media criticism over MPs themselves deciding their salaries, it will also provide an appropriate opportunity to take into consideration the huge responsibilities and the important role they play in our representative democracy.\n“It would ensure that recommendations on Parliamentary salary are reached in a fair, transparent and equitable way. Once there is consensus on setting up of the Commission, the Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act,1954 will be suitably amended,” it had said.\n 08, 2015 9:30 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:55:54.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
