Some regulators, looking for the cause of the next crisis, worry that they might, particularly at times when markets are already volatile and liquidity ebbing. Fund-management firms, understandably, take the opposite view: unlike banks, they do not take risks with their own money and do not have much debt.\nA new paper* suggests that big fund managers could have an outsize impact on the market. It does so by examining the impact of the merger of two asset managers in 2009: BlackRock and Barclays Global Investors (BGI). The deal created the biggest fund-management group in the world, looking after $2.7 trillion of assets at the time. Between them BlackRock and BGI had stakes in some 60% of listed global firms, by value.\nIn this section Weighing anchor No TEE, thank you Grey days Friends without benefits Oily food The pause before fast-forward Two’s a crowd Journalist wanted Quantitative frightening BlackRock Inc. Industries Financial services Investment services Asset management The authors focus on the reactions of other investors to the merger. In theory, they could have piled into the shares jointly owned by BlackRock and BGI, viewing their stakes as a seal of approval from the world’s largest investor. But they did the opposite, rushing out of the stocks when the deal went through. The jointly owned shares underperformed: for those stocks where the increase in BlackRock ownership due to the merger was unusually high, risk-adjusted returns fell by 1% per month over the three months it took to consummate the deal.\nThe motivation for such sales, the authors suggest, was the risk of a future “fire sale” were BlackRock forced to liquidate its position suddenly. Such a sell-off might lead a share to plunge in price—a big risk for other fund managers who might need to sell such shares to meet redemption demands from their own clients. Sure enough, the authors found that asset managers who had previously seen more volatile flows into and out of their own funds were more likely to desert the BlackRock stocks.\nMutual-fund investors are not guaranteed to panic; there was no sign of mass withdrawals from equity funds as markets plunged in 2008, for example. But the authors suggest that, were a large fund manager to suffer a future hit to its reputation that caused clients to lose confidence, the impact on the market could be big.\n* “Who is afraid of BlackRock?” by Massimo Massa of Insead, David Schumacher of McGill University and Yan Wang of Erasmus University\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:22:16.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
