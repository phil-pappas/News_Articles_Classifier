Michele Mossop by Matthew Stevens The opening of a new front of legal contest over the Wiggins Island coal terminal serves mostly to reinforce the view that the only corner of commerce likely to make any real money out of Australia's newest coal terminal will be its lawyers.\nLate last week, the seven solvent owners of the Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal (WICET) invited their train track provider to consider new terms for the agreement that linked the project to the Queensland coal network.\nThat link cost $843 million and it was paid for by Queensland's publicly-listed coal rail track operator Aurizon. And that capital was allocated on a basis pretty familiar to those who watched closely the boom-time rail expansions in Queensland between 2009 and 2013.\nAurizon said on Monday it had received seven separate notices that \"purport to exercise a right\" to reduce their individual contributions to the rail project by as much as $509.5 million over the 19.5-year life of the access agreements .\nTo be clear on that, Aurizon says the claw-back proposed by its customers could amount to anything from zero to $27 million in earnings for interest and tax over any one year through the life of deal contracts that justified its investment.\nGiven the customers sustain their case (and there is nothing more certain on the planet than that this issue is headed for the courts), the collected notices would reduce Aurizon's EBIT by $10 million.\nTo originally secure that goodly portion of Aurizon's expansion capital from 2012, the miners that own WICET agreed to a set of track tariff arrangements that offered the operator something considerably better than the regulated cost of capital, which was about 9.9 per cent then.\nSignificant irritant These sorts of over-the-odds deals continue to sit as a significant irritant to Aurizon's customers. And, to be fair to them, it really did look then like Queensland's integrated coal freight operator was exercising excessive market power in these deals.\nAurizon kept insisting that the margin over the regulated return reflected only the weight of risk it accepted in making the upfront investment needed to meet its mining customers' increasingly desperate demands for rail capacity. But with prices running hard and demand set strong, it was hard to see what risk Aurizon imagined.\nNow we know. There is nothing in coal that is as certain or profitable as it was in 2010-11, when WICET's community of owners opened discussions with Aurizon about the need for a rail path that might eventually support a two-step expansion that would end with a 120 million-tonnes-a-year coal port.\nFive years on and the story has changed profoundly. WICET management remains overtly optimistic about the longer future of coal and their port. But, honestly, it is very hard to see how it will fill the first 27-million-tonne phase of this project, let alone justify the expansion doubtless baked into the original investment case.\nWith its capital sunk and the Wiggins Island Rail Project delivered on budget and a little early, a new family of legacy and new coal miners that have been hit hard by coal's cyclical and structural downturn have attempted to force a repricing of track access on Aurizon.\nThe first coal trains chugged down Aurizon's tracks to WICET in April and trial shipments have been running since May. So far WICET has shipped almost 2 million tonnes but management has until October 16 to satisfy everyone, including its bankers, that it can run its new machines at the design capacity of 27 million tonnes a year.\nSeeking relief WICET's first phase is owned by eight miners. One of them, Bandanna, is effectively no more. The senior partner is Australia's biggest coal miner, Glencore, and the rest of the WICET family includes New Hope, Wesfarmers Curragh, Yancoal, Cockatoo Coal, Caledon Coal and Aquilla Resources, which is owned now by Baosteel. None of them is making much of a return from coal at current prices and each is seeking relief from the Aurizon contract.\nJust a week ago the now former chief executive of WICET, Robert Barnes, indicated he was pretty happy with the shape of his development. \"The project completion tests need to be done the end of October 2016,\" he said. \"The banks are all happy at where we are at. The plans are in place to prove up the 27 million tonnes a year of capacity. We are comfortable we can get there, that we are within three or four months of hitting mechanical completion, which at this point means getting top agreed speeds required on belts and loaders.\"\nNeatly enough, on Friday WICET passed into new executive hands, with the bloke who oversaw its construction, Barnes, handing over the reins to the even more optimistic Marcus McAuliffe. He is a former chief executive of Aurizon's government forebear, Queensland Rail. As luck would have it, on the same day that his appointment became formal, his new owners went medieval on his old employer.\nThe $500 million question here, then, is just what is the trigger for the fee relief being demanded?\nSadly, as things stand, we know more about what it isn't than what it is. We were told it might have something to do with the Wiggins rail loop. But one of the miners involved said this was not the case. It was suggested port capacity was the issue. Not the case, apparently.\nWe were pointed to approvals offered to the original agreements by the Queensland Competition Regulator. And there is certainly a catch-all that requires a fee rebate in the form of an \"annual capacity adjustment mechanism\". It reads that if \"actual delivered capacity is less than contracted\", Aurizon's network business will offer a rebate to \"adversely affected\" users.\nCapacity available We might be reading that all wrong but it feels to me that this clause refers to capacity available rather than capacity used. So if this is the trigger pulled by the WICET Seven we can expect a lot of debate around the wording and its intent.\nWICET management, meanwhile, is already deeply entrenched in confrontation with one of the lead contractors who helped add the 27-million-tonne terminal to Gladstone's industrial landscape.\nFor more than 15 months WICET and local contractor Monadelphous have been in and out of mediation, arbitration and the Queensland Supreme Court to secure settlement of rolling disputes over what the port operator might actually owe the builder.\nDistilled to its essence, WICET has consistently pushed Monadelphous to explain and justify the difference between the construction costs written in contracts and the final reckonings delivered to the operator. WICET has, at one time or another, been asked to pay $95 million for a shiploader that was supposed to cost $59 million and $920 million for a wharf and jetty that was supposed to cost $390 million.\nTo WICET public irritation, the Monadelphous disputes have played out largely through Queensland's building dispute settlement forum, the Building and Construction Industry Payments Agency.\nBut the matters are also playing out across a collection of Supreme Court cases launched by both sides against the other. Monadelphous has been rather more successful at the BCIPA level than in the courts and in June 2014 WICET lodged a Supreme Court claim against Monadelphous for $158 million in damages for overpayments made as a result of the Queensland umpire's decisions.\nCounter claim As things stand Monadelphous and its Malaysian joint venture partner in the jetty and wharf project, Muhibbah Construction, have confirmed a counter claim against WICET. Details of that claim were originally scheduled for confirmation on Monday last week but have been pushed out to October 12.\nYou could be excused for imaging that a modus operandi is emerging here, that a peak-coal project whose financial reality is nothing like that imagined in 2012, when construction started, is aggressively exercising whatever legal protections are available to it to preserve cash, to keep its outgoings under the firmest control possible and to squeeze the services providers who have made their port possible.\nBut we are assured that is not the case, that the dispute with Monadelphous is different in its manufacture, motivation and conduct from the contest opened on Monday between the coal terminal's seven viable shareholders and Aurizon. We are assured that the management of WICET is independent of the project's owners and that the Chinese walls are rumour-tight.\nFor the moment, we will just have to take everyone at their word.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:04:22.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
