Are we there yet? Are we there yet?' with the question not resulting in any progress to reaching the destination.\" \nThe second problem was with Facebook's in-app videos, which play automatically. \nMr Grant said: \"If you leave the Facebook app after watching a video, the audio session sometimes stays open as if the app was playing audio silently. \n\"This is similar to when you close a music app and want to keep listening to the music while you do other things, except in this case it was unintentional and nothing kept playing.\" \nBecause it stayed awake in the background, it continued to suck the phone's battery life. \nA new update fixes the problems, he said, so users are urged to get the latest version of the software as soon as possible. \nUsers were alerted to the problem after installing Apple (LSE: 0R2V.L - news ) 's iOS 9 software, which shows how long apps are active and how much battery they use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:19:14.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
