Reuters Share on twitter by Karen Maley Global equity markets have spent the past week partying hard, in what appears a deliberate bid to discredit doomsayers who warned of October's potential perils.\nTwo key factors are responsible for reawakening the market's appetite for risk.\nThe first came with the release of deeply disappointing US employment figures, which showed that non-farm payrolls rose by only 142,000 in September, or about two-thirds of what economists were expecting.\nInvestors quickly decided that the poor jobs figures would make the US central bank even more wary about raising interest rates – and that, indeed, there was no longer any need to worry about a rate hike until next March.\nThis sent US bond yields tumbling, while the US dollar - which has been strengthening, particularly against embattled emerging market currencies, eased back. At the same time, the US share market shrugged off its September to stage a convincing rebound, while the oil price climbed back above $US50 a barrel.\nInvestors were also cheered by last week's release of the minutes of the US central bank's September policy meeting which indicated that key officials wanted to see more signs of inflationary pressures before raising interest rates.\nBut some of the credit for restoring investor confidence must also go to Beijing. For months, global markets have been weighed down by fears of a sharp slowdown in the world's second largest economy could trigger a global recession.\nSlowing Chinese growth has already resulted in a collapse in commodity prices, which has eroded the export earnings of emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, South Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia that are heavily reliant on raw material sales.\n Fears about China not realised Investors were also anxious that Beijing's surprise decision in August to devalue the yuan would hurt other countries in the region – such as Taiwan and South Korea – because it makes Chinese-made goods cheaper in global markets. Some worried that China would continue to push its currency lower in a bid to boost exports and to discourage hefty capital outflows, and that this could ignite a new and damaging currency war.\nBut these fears eased this week, after new figures showed China's foreign currency reserves fell by just over $US40 billion in September – well below the record $US94 billion plunge the previous month. Analysts argued that capital outflows from China appear to be slowing, which reduces the pressure on Beijing to push the yuan sharply lower.\nAs a mood of optimism spread through the markets, investors began to suspect that fears about slowing Chinese growth had been pushed too far. This set the stage for a major recovery in share prices in emerging markets, which some commentators saw as being reminiscent of strong surge in markets in the final three months of 1998.\nSeventeen years ago, emerging markets were again grabbing the headlines as a virulent financial and economic crisis spread through the Asian region. The crisis reached its climax in September 1998, with the failure of the US hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, which suffered losses of close to $US4.5 billion as a result of its high-risk trading strategies.\nIn order to prevent a major market meltdown, the US central bank stepped in and organised a bailout for the embattled hedge fund, which then led to a surge in US share prices.\nHowever, not all analysts are convinced that global equity markets are poised for a strong rally.\nThey note that the outlook for the global economy is continuing to darken, with the International Monetary Fund this week downgrading its forecast for global growth this year to 3.1 per cent. It also warned that most emerging economies face a tougher external environment as their borrowing costs are rising, while the economic slowdown now under way in China has weighed on commodity prices and reduced Chinese demand for their products.\nEmerging economies' debts leave them vulnerable The Washington-based fund also warned that the huge build-up in debt in many emerging countries has left them vulnerable to rising US interest rates, and any future economic downturn.\nSome analysts warn that the latest market rally could be short-lived, particularly if the oil price again comes under pressure.\nThey also warn that investors may again start fretting about the slowing Chinese economy now that the US earnings-reporting season is under way.\nAlthough the world's largest sportswear maker, Nike, reported that its Chinese sales jumped by nearly one-third in the three months to the end of August, other US companies have not been as fortunate.\nThe fast food restaurant operator Yum Brands saw its stock tumble after it reported that \"unexpected headwinds\" had led to disappointing Chinese sales.\nMeanwhile the US cosmetic company Nu Skin saw its share price come under pressure after it reported disappointing third quarter results because of China.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:08:12.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
