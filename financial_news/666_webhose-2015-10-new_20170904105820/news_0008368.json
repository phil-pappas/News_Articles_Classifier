Thinking strategically, European stocks have never been so interesting,\" he said. \nPortugal's PSI (Taiwan OTC: 8028.TWO - news ) -20 index was the best-performing market in Europe, climbing 2.1 percent as Portugal's prime minister made a final push on Friday to boost his chances of not only winning this weekend's election but also of securing an absolute majority and a more stable government. \nPrime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho's campaign has focused on his record of guiding Portugal through the euro zone debt crisis and returning it to growth, and his Social Democrat-CDS-PP coalition looks set to be returned to power. \nGerman utilities RWE (Xetra: 703712 - news ) and E.ON were also among the best performers, both climbing more than 6 percent after Societe Generale (Swiss: 519928.SW - news ) upgraded RWE to \"hold\" from \"sell.\" \nThe FTSEurofirst had been up by about 1.5 percent before the U.S. data was released but then lost some of that ground after the figures came out. \nU.S. employers' hiring stalled over the last two months and wages fell in September, raising new doubts that the world's biggest economy is strong enough for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by the end of this year. \nWorries over a slowdown in China, the world's second-biggest economy, have also contributed to driving down European stocks in the last three months, pushing them close to their 2015 lows. \nNevertheless, traders such as Logic Investments' Harry Shann said the backdrop of the ECB's monetary support would ensure that dips in the stock market would attract buyers. \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Danilo Masoni and Alasdair Pal; Editing by Louise Ireland/Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:24:21.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
