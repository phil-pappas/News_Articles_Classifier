The conversations are the first Puerto Rico officials have held with holders of the government’s debt since the territory’s leadership released a restructuring and economic plan that would seek to cut government services and force losses on most creditors.\nThe development bank is closely tied to other government borrowers because it acts as a lender to the commonwealth and its localities. The GDB has been working with Citigroup Inc. to help oversee its financial restructuring.\n“In order to maintain the integrity of this process, we have no plans to publicize the nature of any of our conversations with our creditors,” said Barbara Morgan , a spokeswoman for the GDB at SKDKnickerbocker in New York. Scott Helfman, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment.\nThe group is advised by law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and financial advisory firm Ducera Partners, people with knowledge of the matter said in July. Adam Verost, a representative for Ducera, and Susan Peters, a spokeswoman for Davis Polk, didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages.", "external_links": ["http://www.bgfpr.com/documents/PuertoRicoFiscalandEconomicGrowthPlan9.9.15.pdf\\", "http://www.skdknick.com/staff/barbara-morgan/\\"], "published": "2015-10-21T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:50:35.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
