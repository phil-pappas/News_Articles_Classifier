The section of the Grand Canal is in the eastern province of Zhejiang. \nThe NDRC has said that local governments and companies will provide some of the investment for the roads, bridges and dredging, and bank loans will cover the remainder. \nOne of the rail lines will run from Aletai to Zhundong, in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, and the other connects Chongqing, in the southwest, and Huaihua, a city in the central province of Hunan. Those two projects will cost around 26.8 billion yuan. \nOn October 13, the NDRC approved work on six other rail lines that will cost a total of 274 billion yuan. \nLi Pumin, secretary-general of the NDRC, said on October 15 that the top economic planner has approved 218 fixed-asset investment projects in the first nine months this year. The total cost of the projects was 1.8 trillion yuan. He said the works will boost the country's economic growth. \nThe latest Caixin China Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing fell to 47.2 in September, down from 47.3 in August. (A reading above 50 points indicates business growth while a reading under that signifies contraction.) \nThe country's trade has also fallen off recently. The total value of imports and exports in the first nine months was 17.87 trillion yuan, down 7.9 percent compared with the same period last year. \n(Rewritten by Guo Kai) NDRC Approves Eight Big Projects Worth over 95 Bln Yuan Expert says economic planner's green light to road, rail, bridge and dredging projects is effort to boost flagging economy By staff reporter Huang Wenhui SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:56:37.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
