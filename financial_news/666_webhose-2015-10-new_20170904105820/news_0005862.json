Advertising Print This Post Photo:Bloomberg \nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) has seen its second marquee initial public offering (IPO) in as many days, this time with Equiniti looking to raise approximately $484.4 million (£315 million) from its London IPO. \nYesterday, the LSE saw the rollout of the largest UK IPO since 2013 when Worldpay, a British payment processor, moved ahead with its plans to raise a staggering $3.8 billion (£2.5 billion).
