He served briefly as foreign minister before he was appointed to the UN job in 2014. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that US authorities have launched \"a series of wide-ranging investigations into whether Venezuela's leaders used PDVSA to loot billions of dollars from the country through kickbacks and other schemes.\" \nThe paper quoted \"people familiar with the matter\" and said the probes were also attempting to determine whether PDVSA and its foreign accounts were used for other illegal purposes, including black-market currency schemes and laundering drug money. \n\"I am calm, I have a clear conscience,\" Ramirez told reporters on Friday outside the UN Security Council, on which Venezuela is currently a rotating member. \nThe US and Venezuela have not had ambassadors in their respective capitals since 2010. \nThe relationship deteriorated further after the White House adopted sanctions against some Venezuelan officials in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:23:39.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
