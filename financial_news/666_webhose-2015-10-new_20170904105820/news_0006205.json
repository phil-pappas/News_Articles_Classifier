Wolter Peeters by Adele Ferguson Sarah Danckert The former owner-operators of a 7-Eleven store in the Melbourne suburb of Parkville could be hit with fines after allegedly falsifying payroll records and underpaying 12 employees more than $84,000 for a year, including one staff member who was paid $6.25 an hour for some shifts.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman launched action against the former store owners, Yiran \"Janice\" Gu and Haiyao \"Harry\" Xu, of Balwyn North, and their company Hiyi Pty Ltd as part of a major investigation into the payment practices of 7-Eleven franchisees .\nThe Parkville 7-Eleven was one of 20 stores raided by the regulator in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in September 2014. It was the third raid of 7-Eleven stores by the regulator in the past six years.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said preliminary results from the investigation was concerning, with contraventions identified at most of the 20 outlets recently targeted for investigation.\nUnderpayment rampant across chain A joint Four Corners -Fairfax Media investigation revealed rampant underpayment of staff at 7-Eleven's 620 stores in Australia, including explosive internal documents that showed 69 per cent of 225 stores internally audited had payroll compliance issues.\nSince the revelations, 7-Eleven majority owner and chairman Russ Withers has resigned, along with chief executive Warren Wilmot and general manager operations Natalie Dalbo. The company has set up an \"independent\" panel to review payroll claims and outlined changes to its business model after Fairfax Media revealed many franchisees did not earn enough income to pay their staff the legal award wages.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman's action against Ms Gu, Mr Xu and their company Hiyi is the fourth time the agency has put a 7-Eleven operator before court since July 2009. It recently took action against the operator of a store in Blacktown in Sydney's west.\nMs Gu and Mr Xu sold the Parkville store earlier this year, soon after the raid, but continue to own a store in the Melbourne CBD on the corner of Flinders and Spencer streets that they bought in 2013.\nAccording to a statement from the Fair Work Ombudsman, the CBD store is under investigation.\nThe couple did not respond to inquiries.\nInaccurate hours entered into system Court documents state Hiyi had operated the Parkville store since June 2011.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman filing in the Federal Circuit Court covers the period between September 2013 and September 2014.\nIt alleges Mr Xu and Ms Gu \"entered inaccurate hours and rates of pay into the payroll technology made available ... by 7-Eleven head office which created records appearing to show employees were paid at award rates of pay which bore no relation to their hours of work or actual hourly rates\".\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman alleges that not only did Ms Gu and Mr Xu fail to pay the minimum wage during that period, they did not pay casual loading rates despite all staff being classified as casual workers. The couple also allegedly did not pay penalty rates to staff who worked on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays and allegedly failed to pay staff who worked night shifts the legal minimum, which during the period was $22.39 to $24.07.\nA directions hearing is listed in the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on November 17.\nMs James said that while it was pleasing all but $500 of the underpaid wages bill had now been rectified by the employer, legal action was initiated because of the alleged deliberate exploitation of vulnerable overseas workers.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman alleges Ms Gu, Mr Xu and Hiyi made \"multiple breaches of workplace laws\". Ms Gu and Mr Xu face maximum penalties of up to $10,200 a breach and their company up to $51,000 a contravention.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/worker-exploitation-destroys-the-economy-20151001-gjz2sn.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:12:54.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
