Since then, RBS has reduced its stake from 100pc to 20.9pc. \nRBS is widely expected to sell its remaining stake in the coming months, as it moves away from its pre-financial crisis goals of becoming a global giant and closer to its new strategy of focusing on retail and business banking in the UK . \nCitizens' interest rates on loans increased by more than the rise in deposit rates, leaving the balance 4pc higher at $856m in the quarter. Rising fee income from cards and investment services increased 4pc to $353m. \nAt the same time, Citizens cut costs by 1pc to $798m as the bank continued with its plan to save $200m per year by the end of 2016. \nCitizens’ chief executive and chairman Bruce Van Saun, who used to be RBS’ finance director, said that separating from RBS has given Citizens more freedom to hire its own top staff and directors. \n“A highlight for us is that we continue to attract great talent into leadership positions in the company [with new executives in] wealth, mortgages and retail distribution, and we added a distinguished Federal Reserve alumnus to board,” Mr Van Saun said, referring to Christine Cumming, the former first vice president and chief operating officer for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. \n“This is an important by-product of our separation from RBS and our journey to independence .” \nThe results sent the shares up 2.7pc to $23.48 as markets opened in New York, although the stock is still priced well below the it June peak of $28.32.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:59:36.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
