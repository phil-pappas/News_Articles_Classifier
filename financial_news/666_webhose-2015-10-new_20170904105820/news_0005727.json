This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,\" including oil, said Daniel Ang of Phillip Futures in Singapore in a market commentary. \nPRECIOUS METALS \nGold prices have fallen for a third straight day as a rebounding US dollar continues to pull the precious metal away from last week's three-and-a-half-month highs. \nThe spot price of gold was down 0.6 per cent at $US1,170.26 an ounce by 4.20 pm EDT (0620 Tuesday AEDT). In futures trading, US gold for December delivery on COMEX was down 0.9 per cent at $US1,172.80. \n\"Last week was all dollar-driven,\" Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS, said, describing the rally that took gold to its June highs. \n\"Stop after stop was triggered. A break of $US1,200-1,225 only would bring some fresh buying, otherwise (we'll see) a trading range of $US1,150-1,190,\" Nabavi added. \nSilver was down 1.6 per cent at $US15.79 an ounce. \nPlatinum eased 0.3 per cent to $US1,008 an ounce, while palladium slid 1.6 per cent to $US682 an ounce, after hitting an October 1 low at $US664.10. \nBASE METALS \nCopper has fallen after data showing a slowdown in China's economic growth revived fears about demand in the world's top metals consumer. \nBenchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange closed untraded in official rings but was last bid 1.5 per cent down at $US5,205 a tonne, as fresh worries over demand growth in China weighed on the metals complex. \nThe world's second largest economy grew 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than forecasted but down from 7.0 per cent in the previous three months. This marked the Chinese economy's slowest rate of expansion since the global financial crisis. \n\"People are realising that, despite all the cutbacks, we're not out of the woods yet,\" said Edward Meir of INTL FCStone. \n\"There's still a lot of metal around and a lot of production.\" \nAluminium closed 1.4 per cent down at $US1,549.50 a tonne. Zinc dipped 0.4 per cent to $US1,794, lead eased 1.1 per cent to $US1,791 and tin fell 0.5 per cent to $US15,950. \nNickel closed 2.0 per cent lower at $US10,380 a tonne. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Budget projections to be revised: Morrison AAP \nTreasurer Scott Morrison says the projection of a return to budget balance within four years will be revised by â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:32:03.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
