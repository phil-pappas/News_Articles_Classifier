Oil import prices were among the sharpest fallers, Customs said, even as crude purchases went up 8.8 percent. \nBeijing is trying to transform the country's economic model to a more sustainable one where consumers replace exports and state-led investment as the key driver of growth. \nBut the task is proving challenging. Expansion last year slowed to its lowest rate since 1990 and continues to soften despite policy supports including five interest rate cuts since November. \nThe International Monetary Fund last week warned that the country could be headed for a hard landing unless leaders get a grip on the current crisis. \nChinese demand for commodities has become a key driver of economic growth for many of the country's trade partners. \nHuge investments by Beijing in infrastructure, such as country-wide high speed rail networks, once drove a seemingly endless demand for raw materials. \nBut slowing growth has resulted in a global slide in commodity prices -- bad news for commodity-dependent supplier economies that have staked their future on constantly rising demand. \nSlipping economic figures have raised expectations at home and abroad that Beijing will take stronger stimulus measures. \nAt the weekend Premier Li Keqiang urged local authorities to accelerate provision of affordable housing, raising hopes that raw materials demand will rise. \nChina has also been hit by falling demand in some key markets for its manufactured goods, and September exports slipped by 1.1 percent to 1.30 trillion yuan, Customs said. \nBut that was an improvement on August's decline and significantly better than the 6 percent drop forecast in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News. \n\"There remain some obstacles facing China?s foreign trade growth,\" Huang said, adding that the monthly export decline had narrowed. \nIn a note, Capital Economics economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said that the \"stronger-than-expected export figures hint at warming foreign demand\". \nBut imports appeared to be weaker than expected in dollar terms, he added, suggesting \"domestic demand may have softened somewhat last month\". \nThe trade surplus for the month nearly doubled to 376.2 billion yuan, Customs said. \n\"We expect imports and exports situation in the fourth quarter will improve from the third quarter if no major contingent economic or political incidents happen,\" Huang said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:35:25.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
