Jesse Marlow Share on twitter by John Stensholt Private foreign exchange broker Pepperstone Group has made a bumper profit and delivered its two 30-something owners huge dividends, according to documents lodged with the corporate regulator.\nPepperstone made net profit of $24.4 million from about $60 million revenue in the 2015 financial year, a report lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission revealed.\nThat figured was down from a profit of $28.3 million from about the same revenue as achieved in 2014, due to Pepperstone ceasing taking on new Japanese customers as it did not have a licence from Japan's Financial Services Agency and the negative effects of the the Swiss National Bank stopping its intervention in the Swiss franc exchange rate in January.\nBut the company was still able to pay its co-founders Owen Kerr, a member of the BRW Rich List , and Joe Davenport, a combined dividend of $24 million, a year after the duo took $32 million in dividends.\nMr Kerr, 31, whose wealth was valued at $353 million this year, owns half of Pepperstone and Mr Davenport, 32 and a British national, the other half.\nThe pair have been concentrating on winning more business from Chinese customers and hope to benefit from the pending China free trade deal which it said would give the company unfettered access to the burgeoning Chinese middle-class market looking to diversify assets away from property.\nPepperstone's 2015 financial report said about 70 per cent of the company's revenue was derived from Asia, up slightly from 67 per cent a year earlier, compared with about 15 per cent for Oceania and the rest of the world respectively.\nThe financial report also revealed Pepperstone introduced Contract for Difference (CFDs) on major global share indices during the year. \"[The company is] anticipated to take market share from more established rival firms with little incremental expense to the Group and present continued avenues for growth in new markets,\" the report said about the CFDs.\n Mr Kerr and Mr Davenport founded Pepperstone in 2010. The duo won the Ernst and Young entrepreneur of the year award last year.\nMr Kerr was the youngest member of BRW's Rich List in 2015.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt", "http://www.brw.com.au/lists/rich-200/2015/"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:55:53.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
