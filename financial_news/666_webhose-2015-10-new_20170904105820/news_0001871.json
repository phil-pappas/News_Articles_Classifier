Quintiles scored highly in all criteria, and particularly so in ‘pioneering best practices’ and ‘addressing biopharma’s unmet needs’. “For example, Quintiles launched a dedicated medical devices unit in Asia Pacific in 2015 that leverages the expertise of Novella Clinical , a Quintiles company. It also introduced a custom-tailored set of solutions for Asia Pacific emerging biopharma. Both of these are fast-growing market sectors and ones in which government and industry are trying to build capabilities. Quintiles is well-positioned to support this growth.” Frost & Sullivan, a leading business research and consulting firm, also cited Quintiles’ continued expansion of services in Asia Pacific, particularly in Greater China, Japan and South Korea; and its use of innovative technologies to improve efficiency and quality. Quintiles President and Head of Asia Pacific Anand Tharmaratnam said: “This honor belongs to our 10,000 plus employees across Asia Pacific who work every day to improve our customers’ probability of success. I believe Asia is entering a new era – one marked by global leadership in biopharma R&D and by diffusion of Asian innovation to global markets. “With 60 percent of the world’s population, there is tremendous need in Asia Pacific for medicines that will deliver better value and improve patient outcomes. We’re very proud to receive this honor in recognition of our efforts to help achieve that.” Quintiles opened its first Asia Pacific office (Tokyo) in 1993 and this year is celebrating the 20th anniversary of Quintiles Singapore, its Asia Pacific regional headquarters.
