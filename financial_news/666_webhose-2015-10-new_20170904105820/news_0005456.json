While no name has officially been given to this grouping, it is tentatively known as Airlines for Europe (A4E), mirroring the US airline lobby group Airlines for America (A4A).\nPutting this in context, A4E’s five members carry 420 million passengers a year, compared with AEA, which has 25 members that carry nearly 300 million passengers annually. For the purposes of European lobbying, A4E has fewer voices and represents more of the traveling public.\n“AEA has always been in favor of a one-voice approach of the airlines towards policy makers and regulators. The [member airline] presidents therefore welcome the current initiative to create this voice. They have decided to closely monitor the discussions that are ongoing between several airlines,” AEA said in a statement, issued following its Oct. 16 presidents’ assembly in Antwerp.\n“A decision about the future of the Association of European Airlines will be taken by the presidents in due time. In this context the presidents have decided to approve the budget 2016 of the Association so that AEA can continue to support the airlines’ interests.”\nAEA’s member airlines comprise Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, airBaltic, Air France, Air Malta, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Cargolux, Croatia Airlines, DHL, Finnair, Icelandair, KLM, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, Luxair, Meridiana, SAS, Swiss, TAP Portugal, TAROM, TNT Airways, Turkish Airlines and Ukraine International Airlines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:18:35.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
