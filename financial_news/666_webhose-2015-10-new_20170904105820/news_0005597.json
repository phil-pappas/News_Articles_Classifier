The shares were sold at the very top of their indicative price range.\nAs reported by the Australian Financial Review's Street Talk, the deal was hotly contested by top-tier institutional shareholders prepared to pay a premium to get on the shareholder register with a buy-and-hold strategy. Fund managers are attracted by the defensive quality of the company's earnings, which are linked to Australia's $2 trillion superannuation pool, a sector forecast to hit $7 trillion over the next 20 years.\nAdvertisement Link Group, which administers wealth management services for self-managed superannuation funds and owns a share registry, added a third pillar to its business in December 2014 with the $170 million acquisition of super fund administration platform Superpartners.\nContango Asset Management chief investment officer George Boubouras called Link \"a very good company\" and said he expects the shares to trade strongly at listing. However he was less confident about it's medium-term performance.\n\"The deal was fully valued, with the final offer price representing a significant premium to the broader market and even other players in the sector,\" Mr Boubouras said.\n\"Link has a strong earnings growth profile out to financial year 2019, driven by synergies in consolidating their recent Superpartners acquisition. However, at a 23-times price-to-earnings multiple this growth is fully factored into the price, and perhaps the associated risks are not being factored in enough\".\nLink's Superpartners business makes money by clipping a flat fee based on the number of individual super accounts funds administer through the platform.\nConsolidation bill threat to growth There are about three super accounts for every working Australian, with roughly $200 billion in lost or forgotten accounts. Draft legislation released this month aims to combat that issue by making it easier for super funds to automatically consolidate members' accounts .\nThe push to stem the proliferation of accounts in the system, a move designed to save members from unintentionally paying double fees, could lead to a slower rate of revenue growth for Link.\n\"The risk is there could be more policy changes that encourage further consolidation of superannuation accounts,\" Mr Boubouras said.\nLink Group chief executive John McMurtrie dismissed the concern, saying there were already many free online tools made available by funds and the Australian Taxation Office for people who wished to consolidate their super accounts.\n\"Many super fund members do seek to have two or more accounts, often to acquire life insurance at very competitive rates,\" he said.\nMr McMurtrie also challenged the thinking behind the new policy.\n\"The average Australian has four bank accounts; why is the government fixated on superannuation members having one?\"\nExpectations of a smooth integration of Superpartners, and growth in that business, were key to the strong demand for the stock.\n\"Link Group's listing on the ASX will provide an excellent basis to cement our leadership position and grow our business,\" Mr McMurtrie said. \"Over the past three weeks we have met more than 200 institutional investors in key global markets ,and been most encouraged by the response to the Link Group story and our commitment to innovation and technology in servicing one of the largest retirement saving pools in the world.\"\nAustralianSuper, one of the five industry funds that previously owned Superpartners, made a $100 million cornerstone investment in the deal. That has been viewed by the market as a vote of confidence in Link's ability to turn around the profitability of the technology platform.\nRothschild was financial adviser on the float; Macquarie Capital, Citi, Deutsche Bank and UBS were joint lead managers. The forecast 2016 dividend yield is 2.4 per cent.\nMajority owner Pacific Equity Partners (PEP), which bought Link in a 2005 corporate carve-out, will retain a significant stake.\nPrior to this deal the biggest IPO year-to-date was private equity firm Bain Capital's $2.13 billion listing of accounting software provider MYOB in May . Demand for the MYOB float was also strong, and it jumped 6 per cent on debut. However, the share price quickly dwindled over the coming weeks and has not traded above the $3.65 offer price since. At Friday's close MYOB's shares were fetching $3.45.\nCorrection: The original version of this story incorrectly stated Pacific Equity Partners floated MYOB in May 2015. This has been corrected to reflect that MYOB was floated by Bain Capital.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/new-rules-to-speed-up-return-of-20-billion-in-forgotten-super-20150929-gjxd6c", "http://www.afr.com/street-talk/link-group-settles-at-top-of-ipos-class-of-2015-20151022-gkfod9"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:43:21.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
