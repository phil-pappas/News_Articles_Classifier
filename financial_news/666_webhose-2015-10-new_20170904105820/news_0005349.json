Photo: Phil Carrick\nMelbourne Cup Day looks set to come and go without a cut in the cash rate.\nReserve Bank board minutes released on Tuesday indicate that on one hand the bank is broadly happy with the way employment is growing, consumer spending is holding up and non-mining investment is picking up.\nOn the other, it isn't yet confident that the slowdown in housing will continue .\nThe economy is switching to service jobs that don't require as much investment. Photo: Rob Homer\nThe bank gives the impression it is delighted that housing prices in Sydney and Melbourne appear to have eased and is pleased at a \"modest decline\" in the growth of credit extended to housing investors.\nAdvertisement However, it notes wistfully that it's \"too early to be confident that these signs of slowing in housing price inflation would be sustained\".\nA cut in interest rates at its next meeting on November 3 might put at risk the gentle slowdown in the housing market, without necessarily being needed to boost the economy.\nAt almost every turn, the minutes suggest the economy is in better shape than it seems.\nWhat appeared to be weak economic growth in the June quarter probably reflected \"temporary, weather-related disruptions to resource exports\".\nStill weak non-mining investment is probably less of a drag on employment that it once would have been.\nThe economy is switching to service jobs that don't require as much investment.\nThe Reserve Bank certainly could cut rates.\nIts minutes say there's spare capacity in the economy, cost pressures are \"very low\" and inflation is expected to remain within its target band for one to two years.\nIt might well do it down the track, especially if the recoveries in employment and non-mining investment run out of steam. However, to do it now just when the housing market is cooling could give it a new head of steam.\nThe minutes were written before Westpac announced a lift in variable mortgage rates by 20 points.\nWhile that might be expected to push the case to cut the cash rate, other banks, so far, have not followed Westpac. Even if it was, it mightn't necessarily force the Reserve Bank to move.\nThe minutes suggest the hurdle for justifying a Melbourne Cup Day cut is quite high.\nPeter Martin is economics editor of The Age .\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660", "http://www.rba.gov.au/monetary-policy/rba-board-minutes/2015/2015-10-06.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:45.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
