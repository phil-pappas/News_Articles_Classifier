The paper is published by the central bank.\nMajor Chinese construction machinery maker Zoomlion Heavy Industry Co said last week it expects to report a loss in the third quarter due to the weakness in the yuan and a supply glut at home.\nCaterpillar Inc, the world's largest construction and mining machine company, also reported weakness in its Chinese business on Thursday as it forecast a drop in 2016 sales and profit.\n\"It is going to grow, we have to be there,\" Caterpillar's Chief Financial Officer Brad Halverson said of China. \"But China is soft and we don't see any big recovery in it next year.\"\nA breakdown of NBS data also pointed to deteriorating property markets in smaller cities where a glut of unsold houses suppressed prices.\nFirst-tier cities fared better, with Shenzhen being the top performer.\nPrices in Shenzhen were up 37.6 percent in September from a year earlier, compared with a 31.3 percent rise the previous month.\nShanghai prices rose 8.3 percent, quickening from August.\n(Reporting by Xiaoyi Shao and Nicholas Heath; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:01:00.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
