The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gave up 0.29 percent to 4,891.12. \nInvestors were poring over news that China's economy expanded in the third quarter at its slowest rate since early 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. \n\"European equities ... continue to struggle with deciphering the weak Chinese GDP figure yesterday and how much of a warning flag it should be for the rest of the global economy,\" said Jonathan Sudaria at London Capital Group on Tuesday. \n\"Should this be a case of bad news is good news, and expect the central banks to pump up equities in the near future, or does a more sinister path lie ahead -- such as the one put out by Citi recently that suggests China could drag everyone down into a global recession?\" \nThe US bank had warned late last week that there was a risk of a \"contagious slowdown\" from China and other emerging markets that \"increased the likelihood of a global recession\" next year. \nIn London, mining stocks fell for a second consecutive day on demand fears because the Asian powerhouse is a leading consumer of many commodities. \nBHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) sank 2.33 percent to 1,070.5 pence, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) shed 1.62 percent to 2,400.5 pence and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) lost 1.73 percent to 108.10 pence. \nChina also remained in focus after India's Tata Steel (BSE: TATASTEEL.BO - news ) axed about 1,200 jobs at two plants in Britain, blaming the move in part on cheap Chinese imports. \n- Xi seeking closer ties - \nThe Tata announcement coincided with the start of a four-day visit to Britain by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is aiming to build closer business ties. \nFrench and British media have reported that China has agreed to take a stake in French power giant EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) 's £25 billion (34-billion-euro) next-generation nuclear power project at Hinkley Point in Britain. \nChina is taking a 33.5-percent share in the construction of two reactors at Hinkley Point, southwestern England, in a deal signed by EDF with China General Nuclear Power Corporation and China National Nuclear Corporation, Les Echos newspaper said. \nEDF saw its share price inch ahead 0.15 percent to 17.245 euros in Paris. \nOn the downside in France, Credit Agricole (Swiss: ACA.SW - news ) 's share price sank 1.39 percent to 11.00 euros after the bank agreed to pay $800 million to settle charges it flouted US sanctions in Iran and other countries, a person familiar with the matter said overnight. \nThe settlement is part of a long-running US investigation of European banks for illicit dollar transactions with nations under US sanctions. \nIn Tuesday's foreign exchange deals, the euro rose to $1.1358 from $1.1322 late in New York on Monday before Thursday's interest rate call from the European Central Bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:19:10.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
