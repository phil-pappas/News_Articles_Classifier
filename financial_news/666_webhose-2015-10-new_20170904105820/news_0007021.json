The items that are excluded from headline results include acquisition related costs, one-off and acquisition related share based payment charges, amortisation and certain other non-recurring items. \nChairman and Chief Executive’s Statement \nNext 15 has made a strong start to the financial year with profits up over 30% and revenues up over 18%. These results have been driven by continued, strong, organic revenue growth in our North American business of 10.3%. However, we have also seen doubled profitability in Asia Pacific and the UK. In Asia Pacific this has been achieved by the moves to simplify the business. In the UK it follows a series of strategic acquisitions as well as margin gains within our existing agencies. \nThe Group reported a headline operating profit of £7.2m up from £5.5m and a headline profit before tax of £7.2m, compared with £5.4m in the prior period. We have benefitted from a significant reduction in our underlying tax rate to a sustainable rate, down to 23% from 30%, due to improvements in our UK business and the successful resolution of some historic tax queries. This has resulted in a 43% improvement in our headline diluted earnings per share to 7.3p. \nThe Group reported a statutory profit before tax of £4.2m compared with a statutory loss before tax of £4.2m in the prior period, while reported earnings per share were 3.9p (2014: loss 8.1p). \nLooking forward, the Group is well placed to meet its expectations and as such the Board has increased the interim dividend by 20% to 1.2p per share. \nRegional Headline Performance \nOur US businesses have continued to perform strongly, led by our Outcast, M Booth, Beyond and Blueshirt agencies. In total, our US revenues grew by 38% to £39.9m from £28.9m which equated to an organic growth rate of 10.3%. US operating profit was £8.4m compared with £6.7m in the comparable six months period. Operating margins have remained consistently strong at above 20% but were diluted by the acquisition of Story Worldwide which broke even during the six month period. The Group sees a similar performance from Story Worldwide in second half. As previously stated at the time of acquisition, our plan to improve margins will require some restructuring activity, as Story Worldwide moves to simplify its offering and increase revenue growth. This restructuring was begun in the period but we expect the business to remain in transition for the rest of this financial year. \nThe progress outside the US has continued since the end of the last full financial year. The UK business saw total revenue growth of 5% and an almost doubling in operating profit to £1.5m as the operating margin improved from 6.2% to 11.5%. This was the result of improved performances from both Bite and Lexis and the success of recent investments and acquisitions, including Agent3, Morar, Incredibull and Encore. \nThe simplification of the business in Asia has delivered ahead of expectations, with operating profit more than doubling to £0.8m and margins increasing from 6.0% to 13.2%. Trading from EMEA however has suffered from a soft macro-economic environment. The operations in EMEA are in the process of being simplified and during the period the Group’s operations in South Africa were transferred to a third party who will now act as a licensed partner to Text 100. In the short term the Group sees EMEA operating around break even while it streamlines these operations. \nContinued Investment \nThis has been an active period for business investment following the decision to raise money from investors at the start of the year. The Group acquired three new businesses in the UK in the period, with a combined consideration of £2.4m and spent £3.8m on the early buyout of non-controlling interests in former acquisitions (note 11). We are encouraged by their early contributions to the UK’s improved profitability. \nIndeed, the strong progress made by Morar, our recently acquired market research consultancy, has led to a decision to merge our existing Redshift research business into it. Morar’s CEO, Roger Perowne, will head the enlarged business and it will trade under the Morar name. The move reflects the Group’s desire to build a strong offering in the insight and research area over time. \nThe last area of investment of which shareholders should be aware is in relation to Agent3, which has developed an insight software platform for sales and marketing departments in large organisations. The Group has decided to increase Agent 3’s, investment in product development and sales support during the coming six months due to the rapid growth of the business in the last year. \nThe main benefits of all these investments should come in the next financial year. We continue to actively review other investment opportunities with a focus on our chosen areas of content, insight and technology. \nBalance Sheet and Net Debt \nThe Group raised a net £4.3m from shareholders in February 2015 to fund acquisitions and the early settlement of the earn-outs for Republic Publishing and Beyond. The Group generated cash flow of £8.7m from its trading operations during the six months to 31 July 2015 and ended the period with net debt of £8.9m. \nDividend \nThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 1.2p per share which is a 20% increase on the pro-forma interim dividend for last year. This will be paid to shareholders on 11 December 2015 who are registered on 13 November 2015. \nCurrent trading and Outlook \nAs stated earlier, the Group has made a good start to the financial year ending 31 January 2016. Current trading is encouraging with good activity levels across the Group and the benefit of recent acquisitions coming through. Despite increased investment, the Group is on track to meet expectations for the full year. \nNEXT FIFTEEN COMMUNICATIONS GROUP PLC \nHEADLINE RESULTS: INCOME STATEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:42:03.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
