Small businesses can really benefit from having this type of phone service, but because most small business owners are on tight budgets, it is important to really do one’s homework before making a final decision. Before you make your decision, you should check out reviews on various providers. Sites such as WhichVoIP.com, SoftwareAdvice.com and TopTenReviews.com contain thousands of reviews from users of business VoIP services , so you can typically find specific feedback on a provider that you are considering. Here are some additional questions that you need to ask before you sign-up: How Easy is it to Set Up and Manage the Business VoIP Service? \nThe last thing you want is a service that is going to require an engineering degree to be able to set up and manage. It is important to ask about system flexibility, and how easy it is to set up and then use and manage it on an ongoing basis. Even though the Internet is flexible and lets you have many services for small businesses, it doesn’t mean that every solution is going to be best for your business. How is Voice Quality Affected? \nBecause there are a multitude of VoIP providers, you are going to find that there are various ways in which voice transmission is handled and prioritized. The voice quality is determined by the hardware and software configuration used for the phone system, in addition to various network devices and setups. You need to make sure that the components of the solution are based on the latest industry standards, and that there will be no loss of voice quality for yourself or your employees when you are using broadband Internet. It is a good idea to ask about the equipment the various providers offer, as well as the specific software configuration, and of course how it will all interoperate with your existing equipment. After all, how else are you going to know if this is the right solution for your business? Are Mobile Devices Supported by the Service? \nYou need to know that you and your team members are going to be able to receive business calls at any time, even if you are not located in the office. Be sure to look at solutions that will let you send and receive calls via the company phone number, transfer calls to any business extensions (or mobile device) and voicemail boxes, access the company directory, see the call logs, manage your voicemail, update preferences, and more, without anyone actually having to be physically in the office.

There is no sense in getting a service that is not going to work for you in a year or two, so it is much better to find a solution that has the ability to scale and grow with your company. Find out about the VoIP services that use the cloud and that can offer new features, updated technology, etc. on a regular basis. Having to replace your system is only going to disrupt your business, and it can affect your bottom line. You also need to know that you will be able to take advantage of new features without having to replace the equipment you already have. Will Callers Get the Best First Impression of Your Business? \nOften, a phone call is a customer’s first experience with a business. You need to know that their experience is going to be a good one, and that they walk away with a great first impression of your business. Not all VoIP systems are going to give you that professional impression that you are aiming for, so be careful when choosing. Make sure that you have features such as an automated-attendant, that have until now been used only by larger corporations, so your customers have the best experience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:41:13.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
