Tanya Lake by Ben Smythe If you cast your mind back to July 1, for many people the balance of their self-managed superannuation fund was healthier than it is now. Apart from dealing with the daily volatility and uncertainty of investment markets, SMSF trustees are now faced with the possibility of potentially needing to sell down depressed assets to fund their minimum pension requirements this financial year.\nThe date July 1 is important when it comes to a number of superannuation laws. It is also the date you need to calculate your minimum pension requirements for the next 12 months for any existing pensions. Your opening balance for your pension is fixed at July 1 (essentially your closing balance as at June 30), and your age at July 1 will then determine what percentage of your balance you need to draw down that financial year.\nGetting this wrong (that is, failing to draw down your minimum pension) is not something you want to entertain in light of recent regulatory changes. Once your minimum pension is calculated at July 1 it is fixed for the year, and you can then choose to draw it out of your SMSF at any time over the next 12 months, say in 12 equal monthly instalments or in one hit at any time during the year.\nDuring the global financial crisis, with pension balances falling, the government introduced some temporary measures to reduce the minimum pension draw-down requirements. This was designed to ensure that members weren't forced to sell down assets (at a low price) to simply fund their minimum pension payment. While the fall in investment markets post-June this year is not close to those seen during the GFC, a fall of about 15 per cent is not insignificant.\nOptions So what are the options for SMSF members who are worried about drawing down an amount that is not necessarily reflective of their fund's current market value? The option of switching off your existing pension, converting it back to accumulation, and then starting a new pension is one option. This will allow you to start a new pension with a lower opening balance, which may mean you draw down less than you would have been required to by using the July 1 balance.\nHowever, before you implement this change, you need to make sure you get the process right, otherwise there could be some serious, untoward consequences.\nFirst, commuting, or stopping, an existing pension will require you to ensure you have drawn down a pro-rata amount of pension beforehand. For example, if you decide to stop your pension on October 31, you need to ensure you have taken out sufficient pension income equal to 123 out of 365 days (the period between July 1 and October 31). If you don't take a pro-rata pension payment before fully commuting, then you will breach the superannuation rules, and your fund will be deemed not to have been in pension phase.\n The paperwork will also be important. You are effectively stopping your pension at the end of one day and starting your new one at the beginning of the next. If you make mistakes you risk leaving the pension in accumulation phase, which will potentially mean tax to pay on income and the additional cost of obtaining an actuarial certificate. Of course, this might not be particularly detrimental to some members but obviously should be considered as part of the cost/benefit analysis of this exercise.\nThe other option to consider if you have not yet drawn down any pension income post July 1 is to actually commute or stop your existing pension at June 30 and start a new pension at a later date in the year. The downside is obviously that you will be in accumulation phase for that period but provided the income is not significant, and the reduced minimum pension requirement avoids the need to sell existing assets, then that could be a better option for preserving your SMSF pension balance.\nThe timing of starting a new pension gives you more options and flexibility because as trustee you decide when the pension starts from the SMSF. You can simply decide to start your pension on November 1 and use market value prices at that time to calculate the initial pension balance.\nWhile the future direction of investment markets is not something easily predicted, for those drawing down a pension there are some options to look at when trying to reduce your minimum pension requirements. The prospect of selling depressed assets to fund minimum pension requirements is something you want to avoid at all costs, as this loss of capital for a SMSF pension member will more than likely not be able to be recaptured.\nBen Smythe is the managing director of Smythe Financial Management and a founders of Eviser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:45:36.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
