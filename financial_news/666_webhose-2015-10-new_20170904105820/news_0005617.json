Photo: Rob Homer\nStrong growth in new lending to owner-occupiers is more than offsetting a slowdown in lending to property investors, as banks target customers borrowing to buy a home to live in.\nThe value of owner-occupied home loan approvals jumped 6.1 per cent in August, in contrast to a 0.4 per cent fall in the value of housing investor loans, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Friday.\nOverall, the value of new home loan approvals in the month increased 3.5 per cent, the figures showed. The number of loan approvals for owner-occupiers increased 2.9 per cent in the month, which is less than markets had expected.\nThe increase in loan approvals for owner-occupiers comes after banks have sought to entice this group of customers while tightening their lending policies for property investors in response to regulator concerns the market is overheating.\nAdvertisement \"We've seen a pick-up in the owner-occupier market, especially upgraders, at the expense of investor finance,\" ANZ economist David Cannington said.\nSince May this year, banks have unleashed various changes to slow investor lending, including raising interest rates, tightening loan criteria and forcing new borrowers to stump up bigger deposits.\nThis is being done in response to the banking regulators' demand that housing investor loan growth slow to less than 10 per cent a year.\nAt the same time, banks have cut interest rates for owner-occupiers, to less than 4 per cent in some cases.\nMr Cannington said that in the three months to August, once refinancing was excluded, new loan approvals for owner-occupiers had increased by 22 per cent. Over the same period, new investor lending had fallen 0.4 per cent, he said.\n\"It's showing that some of the changes that the lenders have made are having an impact on investor lending,\" Mr Cannington said.\nNew lending to owner-occupiers has increased by $2.5 billion in the past three months, compared with a $50 million decline in new lending to investors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:08:46.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
