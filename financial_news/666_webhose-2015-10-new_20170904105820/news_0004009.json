Both NMC and Al Noor are listed in London. \n\"NMC believes the financial rationale and strategic logic of the combination of our businesses is compelling, creating a Middle Eastern market leader in acute and post-acute care with a clear leading position in the highly attractive UAE market,\" NMC said in a statement on the London bourse. \n\"The combined group would be able to capture business opportunities and provide clinical services which are not readily available to the companies on a standalone basis.\" \nNMC is now required to either announce a firm intention to make an offer or withdraw its informal offer by Nov. 6, the statement from Al Noor said. \nMediclinic is a Johannesburg-listed private hospital group with operations in South Africa, Namibia, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. \nAbu Dhabi-based NMC, founded by billionaire Indian entrepreneur B.R. Shetty, is one of the largest private sector healthcare providers in the UAE and operates general and specialised hospitals, pharmacies and medical centres. \nAbu Dhabi-based Al Noor also provides healthcare through hospitals and clinics across the UAE.
