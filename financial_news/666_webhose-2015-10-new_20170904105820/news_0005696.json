Michelle Smith Share on twitter by Nassim Khadem The global plan to fight profit shifting is likely to \"supersede\" domestic laws introduced by former treasurer Joe Hockey to counter multinational tax evasion, according to the OECD's head of tax Pascal-Saint Amans.\nOn Monday night, Mr Saint-Amans released the final draft of the global plan aimed at ensuring multinationals such as Apple and Google are no longer able to get away with paying little, no or low tax on billion profits.\nKnown as Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), the plan follows two years of consultations with tens of thousands of stakeholders worldwide.\nThe OECD estimates about $US100 billion ($141.5 billion) to $US240 billion annually is lost due to an array of tax avoidance schemes devised by multinationals and their advisers that to date have exploited loopholes in international tax laws.\nIn an interview with Fairfax Media, Mr Saint-Amans dismissed concerns the plan, which was a central feature of the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane last year, would now result in global revenue wars.\nHe said 90 nations had already signed up, and the OECD would work with countries internationally in the coming months and years to ensure smooth implementation.\nMr Saint-Amans also believes by eliminating aggressive tax planning, countries will now shift their focus to making their tax settings more attractive for international investment, including lower company tax rates during the next decade.\nFinal BEPS plan could make Australia's laws redundant The BEPS plan involves a combination of changes to domestic laws in each country that signs up, as well as a multilateral instrument.\nThe plan states that a \"multilateral instrument is desirable and feasible\" and that \"negotiations for such an instrument should be convened quickly\".\nSome measures under the plan will be implemented during the next year, while other more-complicated measures – including the multilateral instrument – could take up to five years for governments to implement.\nMr Saint-Amans said there were \"minimum standards\" that had already been agreed to.\nTop United States Treasury official Robert Stack has been highly critical of Australia' and Britain's unilateral moves to fight profit shifting , saying it's bad policy and those governments are being driven by their own political motives.\nIn his final act as federal treasurer, Mr Hockey introduced new legislation to Parliament last month that boosts anti-avoidance tax laws . The laws, which apply from January, were initially expected to apply to 30 companies with annual global revenue of $1 billion or more, but will now affect 1000 companies.\nTax experts have warned that Australia's domestic changes are \"bad tax law\" and will result in revenue wars with other nations.\nMr Saint-Amans has previously noted that such unilateral moves are dangerous and go beyond the parameters of BEPS.\nHockey measures were not 'helpful' \"These measures were not helpful,\" Mr Saint-Amans said. \"... And may not happen to extent that they will be superseded by BEPS measures.\n\"BEPS is more consistent with what's been agreed internationally, than what Australia currently has.\n\"What do you do if you have existing domestic legislation is a matter for your government, but you might find that such domestic measures might not be useful any more.\"\nThe United States has previously been critical of some elements of the BEPS plan and stated it will not agree to any part that may cannibalise its tax base.\nMr Saint-Amans said the way the plan had been designed is that if one country is refusing to sign up, others are able to protect their tax bases, and in any case, the US was being co-operative now. The US had agreed to join in discussions on a multilateral instrument, he said.\n\"We don't expect any country not to implement,\" he said. \"The US wants part if it.\"\nNow it was about getting down to the \"nitty-gritty\" details and, down the track, ensuring countries make tax settings more attractive for investment and growth.\n\"It's really hard to know where we are in 10 years' time,\" Mr Saint-Amans said.\n\"It largely depends on the economic situation. I would, however say, that ... the [tax] rates [are] probably being lower than currently – around 10 per cent to 15 per cent for small countries and 20 per cent to 25 per cent for big countries. I think tax planning will be much less aggressive because of the work we have done.\"\nDigital economy, an economy 'unto itself' One of the most controversial parts of the plan relates to taxing the \"digital economy\".\nThe plan says that: \"Because the digital economy is increasingly becoming the economy itself, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes.\"\nBut there were \"key features\" that tax settings could address.\nMultinationals have been able to artificially reduce the taxes they pay by shifting profits to low-tax jurisdictions where little or no economic activity is performed. They've done this by claiming they have no physical \"permanent establishment\" (PE) given their businesses are online.\nThe plan says they may in fact now be deemed to have a PE. But it stops short of saying whether such a tax should be levied where the customer is and value is created (source), or the country where the product originated (residence).\nCompanies such as Rio Tinto have raised concerns with BEPS, saying there's a possibility of the Australian government having to forgo revenue from miners exporting to China .\nInstead, the plan gives the example of a company that has maintenance of a very large local warehouse that stores and delivers goods sold online to customers. Or where the sales force of a local subsidiary, or an online provider of advertising services, \"habitually plays the principal role in the conclusion of contracts\".\nFor example, Google's tax bill is only a fraction of its Australian profits, which don't count for more than $2 billion of income it earns through advertising locally on its lucrative search engine business .\nIt goes on to state, \"Given that these conclusions may evolve as the digital economy continues to develop, it is important to continue working on these issues and to monitor developments over time\". A detailed mandate will be developed next year, for implementation by 2020.\nEnhanced arbitration and inclusiveness the next step Mr Saint-Amans said the OECD would now shift its focus to helping countries implement all parts of the plan and in setting up a new arbitration system for resolving disputes between tax authorities, should there be any.\n\"You could say, there will be an enhanced arbitration process,\" he said.\nBut he dismissed public calls for company tax information to be reported publicly.\nInternationally, there's been pressure on governments to publicly release country-by-country breakdowns of taxes paid by multinationals.\nMr Saint-Amans has previously argued releasing such information could be misleading, and would jeopardise international agreement .\nHe said the OECD's challenge now was to make sure developing countries that had not already signed up, joined the implementation process within the next year.\n\"A big challenge is inclusiveness,\" he said. \"We need to make sure all countries benefit, including developing countries.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/google-paid-117m-tax-in-2014-but-says-theres-more-we-can-do-20150430-1mxbx7.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/oecd-tax-chief-hoses-tech-fears-20140220-3348o.html", "https://twitter.com/@NassimKhadem", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/joe-hockeys-multinational-crackdown-is-bad-tax-law-that-will-spark-global-revenue-wars-say-experts-20150916-gjnsds.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/g20/multinational-tax-details-to-be-kept-secret-20141114-11mse3.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/why-the-united-states-hates-britain-and-australias-google-tax-20150625-ghxj0n.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:05:51.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
