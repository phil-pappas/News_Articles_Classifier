The company's recent acquisition sets up above-average growth in 2016. Trading near fair value, an investment in STBA should produce compounded returns of ~11.8% over the next five years. \nAfter having its stock double since the beginning of 2013, S&T Bancorp (NASDAQ: STBA ) is hoping a recent acquisition will continue to add to the company's above-average returns. With roots dating back to 1902, STBA is a $6.2 billion asset bank holding company with 66 community banking locations (all but two in Pennsylvania), and $4.9 billion in deposits. \nSTBA is one in a small group of banks that escaped the financial crisis without reporting a loss, and an even smaller group that was profitable even after completing a merger just before the environment got hostile. A buy-at-any-price attitude got a lot of players into trouble during this period of time, but the bank was successful throughout by sticking to what it knows. And in my opinion, focused lending like this is a great attribute to have going into 2016. One of the most common banking trends out there right now is a consistent switch from residential to commercial loans, but although the benefits of these higher-yielding assets are fairly easy to comprehend, they come with more risk that requires deep knowledge and specialization to mitigate. And that's the exact type of deep knowledge STBA has. \n75% of today's loan balance is in commercial lines of credit, and while this ratio is subject to small changes, it's consistent with the portfolio composition reported over the past 10 years. Within this category the bank's largest exposure is to commercial real estate (42% of the gross loan portfolio - 33.9% of all assets), and this line is also STBA's largest source of organic growth (11.1% annualized growth in the recent quarter), though that's not to say it's the only line that's capable of adding to the loan portfolio. Consumer loans reported 11.3% annualized growth in third quarter, with the largest uptick coming from residential mortgages and home equity loans. \nThe bank has been growing organically, but also via acquisition. In March of this year, STBA completed the acquisition of Integrity Bancshares ( OTCQB:ITBC )in a deal valued at ~$172 million. The addition added $788.7 million to the loan portfolio net of a $14.8 million discount that should be accreted to interest income over the remaining contractual life of the loans. From year end , the bank's portfolio is up 28.9%, and YTD net interest income, which accounts for approximately 80% of all revenues, is 21.1% higher than the same period in 2014. \nVolume increases are a sure way to add to revenues, and they have been one of the only ways most banks have been successful in doing so with prevailing interest rates. But, it shouldn't be lost that STBA has been successfully fighting declining interest rates by doing what it can to also lower interest and provision expenses. Recent organic growth and the acquisition skew slightly the bank's medium-term growth profile, because between 2010-2013 the loan portfolio only increased 6.2% (in total), but that didn't stop net interest income after provision expenses from its steady upward climb. Interest revenues during this time did fall with asset yields, but provision expenses and interest income declined 64%, and when all was said and done, a portfolio only 6.2% larger than it was in 2010 was producing at a rate 12% greater four years later. And, more importantly, this trend sets up the future for higher returns. \nSTBA pays only 0.39% on all interest-bearing liabilities, and 19.3% of all assets are supported by non-interest-bearing deposit accounts. In addition, nonperforming loans are low at 0.48% of all loans, and allowances have them covered 2X over. The coverage ratio has come down recently, but the NPA ratio is consistent and in a very comfortable range. I mentioned earlier that commercial lending typically involves more risk, and it's worth noting how nonperforming loans fluctuated during the financial crisis. In 2009 , STBA's worst year, provision expenses quadrupled from the prior year's total (to $72 million) and net charge-offs were $55.5 million. To put this into perspective, $72 million was half of net interest income, but unlike a sweeping deterioration of all loans, STBA's problems were much more singular. $26.5 million of all charge-offs, for example, were related to one large industrial loan, and another $8.2 million was tied to three Florida lot development projects. As is the case, STBA's lending quality probably deserves more credit than I've already given it, and that's without including that today's practice is more regionally focused - the bank is now more strict when it comes to out-of-state lending. Valuation \nWith shares trading around $32.00 per share, the stock is valued at 16X this year's likely $2 per share in earnings and at ~14.5X post acquisition quarterly EPS. This current valuation is at a premium to most other banks in this space at 2.26X tangible book value. But it's safe to say that most of those other banks aren't capable of producing a 15.6% returns on tangible equity either. Looking forward, it's not hard to see STBA growing EPS in 2016 since the year will be without acquisition-related charges that have accumulated in 2015, and I think downside in earnings is protected by the high rate of returns on tangible assets (1.28%). Rates will continue to be a headwind for short-term growth, but the portfolio is picking up the pace, and there is a lot of value in STBA's low-cost deposit base. \nEven after increasing the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share (2.42% yield), the payout ratio is low at 36.5%, and that leaves a large amount of capital for the bank to reinvest. Based on the payout ratio and maintaining a 15% return on tangible equity (which is slightly lower than current returns), my calculations indicate that an investment in the bank is capable of compounding at an annual rate of 11.8% over the next five years (cumulative dividend payments of $5.89, and shares at $50 in 2020 based on 15X EPS of $3.34). \nBased on this, the bank isn't a screaming buy, but this is a high-quality financial, and I think STBA is capable of maintaining above-average returns as interest rates rise and additional assets are added. There are of course going to be off-years where earnings fluctuate, but my simple model has some built-in safety (lower return, higher dividend growth rate than in the past - which means less earnings growth, and I also started with this year's reported earnings - which include one-time merger-related charges). Bottom Line \nAt times looking far and wide helps uncover undervalued banks, but in this case we found a company that's trading closer to fair value. I like what I see and wouldn't want to sell shares if I was already holding, but without a discount I only have room for STBA in my old watch list - so I'm personally going to stay on the sidelines for now.
