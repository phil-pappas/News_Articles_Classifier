Since then, they have worked hard to reduce leverage and fortify their balance sheets.\nDefined as the proportion of a bank’s tier 1 capital ratio to its total assets, a leverage ratio measures the quality of bank’s assets. Basel III provides the internationally agreed standard, although a number of national authorities have opted for even stricter rules. The Basel III Capital Adequacy framework introduced a new ratio for controlling excess leverage. This measure expects banks to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3% at all times.\n\nCitigroup’s regulatory balance sheet ratios In 2Q15, Citigroup’s (C) tier 1 capital ratio was 12.5%, and its total capital ratio was 14.1%. These ratios improved from 10.6% and 11.4%, respectively, in 2Q14. Meanwhile, its leverage ratio improved from 5.82% in 2Q14 to 6.72% in 2Q15. This makes the bank’s assets less vulnerable to global downturns.\nCitigroup’s peers also reported their tier 1 capital ratios. JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) tier 1 capital ratio was 12.6%, Wells Fargo (WFC) reported a tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5%, and Bank of America’s (BAC) tier 1 capital ratio was 10.1%.\nInvestors seeking exposure to a portfolio of these banks could invest in the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF). Banks constitute ~50% of XLK.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Financials Pumped Up Ahead of 3Q15 Earnings Part 2 - Citigroup Performs in Line with the Financial Sector in 2015 Part 3 - What Wall Street Expects from Citigroup’s 3Q15 Earnings Citigroup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:04:15.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
