Priced at $16 a share, the stock opened at $16.39 before falling more than a percent and is now bouncing back again. Meanwhile, Albertsons ( ABS ) announced they would delay their IPO after seeing the market reaction to yesterday's surprise announcement from Walmart ( WMT ). Some reports suggest the grocery chain may try and reprice their IPO lower this evening and give it another try in the coming days.\nFBI and fantasy sports\nLast week news broke that an employee at one of the more popular daily fantasy football companies, Draft Kings, may have been involved in what amounts to an insider trading type scheme which netted him $350,000. Now the FBI is getting involved. According to a report in the New York Times , agents from the Boston field office have been contacting players on Draft Kings seeking information about accepting bets from players in states where the daily contests are prohibited.\nNetflix shares slide\nShares of Netflix ( NFLX ) are down, after reporting weaker than expected Q3 earnings yesterday. The streaming giant is blaming slow U.S. user growth on the payment system's switch to chip and pin credit cards. Netflix claims that it was unable to process cards of some users, which led to, â€œinvoluntary churn.\"\nNo tip for you! \nWhen you visit some of New York's most acclaimed restaurants, you may notice something is missing from the bill: the place to tip.
