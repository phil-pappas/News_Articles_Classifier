Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey ﻿\nDuring his brief and tumultuous period as Opposition Leader, Malcolm Turnbull attended a National Rugby League Grand Final with John Howard.\nThe ever-sagacious Howard offered the struggling Liberal leader some advice.\n\"Forget this mob,\" said Howard, or something to that effect, as he motioned to the well-heeled people surrounding them in the VIP stand.\nBack in Canberra, when Thursday's reform summit ended, the participants, even the grizzled Dave Oliver, emerged impressed at the new tone from the government. Anna Kucera He motioned across the pitch to the outer where the punters where eating meat pies, swilling beer and cursing the ref.\nThey were the people with whom he needed to connect, the ones he needed to talk to. They were the voters.\nTurnbull did not survive long enough to try and apply the wisdom but, in his second incarnation as leader, he is making an effort.\nOn Monday night, he attended the NRL's best and fairest award, the Dally M, at Sydney's Star Casino. The Sydney Morning Herald dubbed it \"Malcolm Turnbull's awkward night out\" as it recounted how he was disrespected by the oafish but popular Matty Johns, and how TV cameras panned to players rolling their eyes while the PM persisted with a scripted routine about the Rooster's loss to the Broncos the week before.\nAustralia's diplomatic mission had been in a tizz trying to get Abbott a flag but when Julie Bishop turned up to deputise for Malcolm Turnbull, she was swiftly invited by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Points for trying Nonetheless, the \"voters\" gave him points for trying with social media split 50-50 on how it all went.\nOn Friday, Turnbull was at Federation Square in Melbourne hamming it up on the eve of the AFL Grand Final.\nLeague fans weren't the only ones on Monday surprised to see Turnbull in their universe.\nYet these were the people from whom Abbott took his cues, the same people to whom he has returned in the wake of his ouster to defend his legacy, and the same people who have been fulminating about his demise as if it were the world's end. Justin McManus ​When Turnbull rang ACTU secretary Dave Oliver that day to invite him to Thursday's mini-jamboree on economic reform, it was the first time in more than two decades that a Liberal Prime Minister had reached out to the ACTU.\nHoward had a cool relationship with the ACTU on coming to power in 1996 and Tony Abbott cut them dead completely in 2013.\nOliver came to Canberra for Thursday's meeting, even if he was less than amused with the front page of that day's The Australian which featured new Employment Minister Michaelia Cash giving the union movement both barrels, branding it variously militant, fraudulent and dishonest.\n\"Happy to be here,\" said Oliver, \"but what's up with Margaret Thatcher\", he observed of the impeccably-coiffed Senator from Western Australia.\nIt is easy to get carried away, and some are, with how smooth the transition to Turnbull has been, yet in reality, Turnbull has yet to be tested. Twitter Thawing of relationships On Sunday last week in New York, there was a similar thawing of relationships. Abbott had been scheduled to be in New York for the United Nations General Assembly but, conspicuously, had not been invited to a lunch of 30 world leaders to discuss climate change in the lead-up to the Paris conference in December.\nThe invitees were deemed as those considered capable of influencing a global agreement. New Zealand's John Key was invited.\nAustralia's diplomatic mission had been in a tizz trying to get Abbott a flag but when Julie Bishop turned up to deputise for Malcolm Turnbull, she was swiftly invited by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\nBack in Canberra, when Thursday's reform summit ended , the participants, even the grizzled Oliver, emerged impressed at the new tone from the government.\n\"It's like fresh air,\" said one, who applauded the fact there could be disagreement without fear of repercussion, that there could be suggestions made without them being knocked off straight away for some juvenile political reason.\nBe it the bitter relationship between government and business which marked most of the previous Labor period, or the various hostilities between the Abbott government and anyone who crossed it, everyone seems relieved.\nThe last six years \"It's like, 'what was the last six years about?',\" mused one resources executive on Friday as he lumped Abbott with the dysfunction of the Gillard and Rudd period.\nNo one is naive enough to believe this will all end in agreement and happiness. As Treasurer Scott Morrison noted, the consensus on Thursday was broad but not particularly deep.\nEveryone agreed the nation faced challenges, that the economy needed to grow, that the country's AAA credit rating needed to be preserved, and the budget should be in surplus. But disagreement was widespread on how to best do all this.\nEventually, the government will have to make policy calls and there will be criticism.\nThe ACTU and the Australian Council of Social Services are unlikely to cheer a GST increase. But none of the key lobbies will be able to complain they were not consulted, and they are all on the record as agreeing with the aim, if not the method.\nEvery newly-elected prime minister promises to govern for those who did not vote for them as well as those who did. Turnbull is reaching out to all and sundry. Abbott's flaw was that he never could bring himself to do that.\nHis focus was too much on what he thought was the mainstream, the 2GB shock-jocks and the conservative columnists such as Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine. They speak to a demographic which Abbott mistook for middle Australia.\nThere was a classic case in point in July when the nation felt rather uncomfortable about the boorish West Coast Eagles fans booing Adam Goodes.\nEven when a distraught Goodes, indigenous leaders, Bill Shorten and Mike Baird and the AFL, made it plain that whatever the motive of the fans, it was hurtful and perceived to be racist, no mercy was shown.\nAbbott silent Abbott stayed largely silent that week while Bolt, Devine and Alan Jones attacked Goodes, saying he brought it on himself because he had called out a teenage girl for calling him an ape.\nCoalition pollster and strategist, Mark Textor, who was ostracised by Abbott and his office, summed up the disconnect on Twitter: \"Nothing says more about the reality marginalisation of shock jocks and news columnists than their misinterpretation of the decency of middle Australia over Goodes. Most want media-fuelled division to end.\"\nYet these were the people from whom Abbott took his cues, the same people to whom he has returned in the wake of his ouster to defend his legacy, and the same people who have been fulminating about his demise as if it were the world's end.\n\"Abbott wouldn't know middle Australia if it punched him in the face,\" said one of his Liberal Party detractors.\nIt is easy to get carried away, and some are, with how smooth the transition to Turnbull has been, yet in reality, Turnbull has yet to be tested.\nAs Howard likes to often Quote: , it was Harold McMillan, who in response to a question about what he most feared, said: \"Events, dear boy, events.\"\nSyria and the economy loom large.\nPhillip Coorey is the The Australian Financial Review's chief political correspondent", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:05:45.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
