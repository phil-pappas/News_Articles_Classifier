This cannot be in anyone’s interests. If that continues indefinitely we will crowd out the creativity, innovation and competition which should present the opportunities for growth in the future.” \nMs McDermott took over from Martin Wheatley at the head of the FCA this summer after his abrupt departure, amid concerns from the Treasury about his combative approach to some quarters of the financial industry. \nMeanwhile, the Lord Mayor, Alan Yarrow, who ends his one-year stint in the job next month, repeated his call for the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) to shoulder more responsibility for its own conduct, particularly in areas where the regulator is not setting out explicit rules. \n“I condemn those who put themselves before their clients, using their firms to feather their own nests with little risk to themselves. I have a message for those people: your days are numbered. The system is being changed to dig you out, and get you out. But at the same time, and in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, we need to acknowledge something. Regulators can only do so much.” \nMark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, pledged in June to end the “age of irresponsibility” that has seen a wave of scandals in the City, including attempts to rig the $5 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:06:58.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
