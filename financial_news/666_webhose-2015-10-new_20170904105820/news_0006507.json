The new TeamTrack tool provides team leaders and colleagues an updated and insightful dashboard to see at a glance the status of all payers and recipients. TeamTrack’s intuitive tools untangle the complexity of IRS compliance.\n“We’ve re-designed the layout, colors, and links to give the tax professional immediate knowledge,” Sharon Lindsey West, CEO of Track1099, said. “They can see what is yet to be done, where the process stands with both the IRS and the recipients, and which of their colleagues is responsible for each client.”\nClients can also be included to view and edit their own company information. TeamTrack provides them with clear communication on the status of their filings and reduces the workload of data entry and verification for accounting teams.\nDennis Najjar, founder of AccountingDepartment.com, uses TeamTrack to manage workflow and client communication. “For years, we anticipated the volume of 1099 work with dread each January. Finding Track1099 was like entering a whole new world,” Najjar said. “Now we include Track1099 in every client’s services and on every proposal because it is so important to our ability to stick to timelines and ensure data accuracy. We love it and can’t imagine life without it.”\nTrack1099’s cost-effective solutions enable accounting teams to work together easily and to better serve their clients during the stressful season of IRS reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:13:13.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
