But the central bank has signalled it wants to wait to see the impact of an expected Fed move before adjusting its own policy.\nThe bank left its main one-week repo rate unchanged at 7.5 percent for the eighth month in a row, as expected by all 15 economists in a Reuters poll.\nIt said it would maintain tight monetary policy in line with inflation expectations and that exchange rate movements were delaying an improvement in core indicators.\n\"Taking into account inflation expectations, pricing behaviour and the course of other factors affecting inflation, the tight monetary policy stance will be maintained,\" the bank said in a statement following its monetary policy meeting.\nIn previous statements it had referred to maintaining a \"cautious\" policy until there was a \"significant improvement in the inflation outlook\".\nDoubts over the outcome of next month's parliamentary election - the fourth national vote in less than two years - have taken a toll on the economy, with foreign investors staying on the sidelines and growth slowing.\nThe ruling AK Party is hoping to regain the single-party majority it lost at a previous election in June, although polls indicate it will struggle to do so.\nThe lira, little changed at 2.9055 against the dollar after the rate decision, has weakened some 20 percent this year but has rebounded off record lows on prospects of the Fed pushing its expected rate hike back to next year.\nOnce the U.S. central bank does raise rates, emerging markets such as Turkey are expected to follow suit to defend their currencies against a surging dollar.\nTurkey's central bank has faced sustained political pressure in the past to keep monetary policy loose, with President Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly calling for rate cuts and even equating high rates with treason.\nBut inflation remains stubbornly high, with the year-end headline figure seen at 8.25 percent, according to the central bank's latest survey. Consumer confidence has meanwhile slumped and the government this month cut its growth forecasts for the next three years.\nThe bank kept the overnight borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, the overnight lending rate at 10.75 percent and the primary dealers' overnight borrowing rate at 10.25 percent.
