The grapes sit for 100 to 120 days and lose 40 to 50% of their weight. The grapes that make Amarone (Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Oseleta) are picked in late September and early October, then placed in ventilated cellars to continue drying for the majority of the winter. This method dates back to early Roman times, around 500 A.D.\nThe mission of the Association of Amarone Families is to educate trade and consumers on the tradition and quality of this celebrated Italian wine, which received the prestigious DOCG appellation in Dec. 2009. This accolade is given only to the best wines of Italy.\nAbout Amarone Families\nTwelve historical producers of the celebrated Amarone wine (Allegrini, Begali, Brigaldara, Masi, Musella, Guerrieri Rizzard, Speri, Tedeschi, Tenuta Sant’Antonio, Tommasi, Venturini, Zenato) joined in the association “Amarone Families” in 2009, combining their rich tradition with exceptional craftsmanship and standards in winemaking. The association's goal, forged among the producers located on the green hills of the Valpolicella area just outside Verona, in the Veneto region of Italy, is to promote the tradition and quality of Amarone, one of the finest Italian reds, to international markets.
