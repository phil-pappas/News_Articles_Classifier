Facebook says an update it rolled out yesterday should have helped fix it. \nOne culprit: Videos’ audio kept playing in the background even after users exited the Facebook app. \n“This is similar to when you close a music app and want to keep listening to the music while you do other things, except in this case it was unintentional and nothing kept playing,” Facebook engineering manager Ari Grant wrote in a post Thursday. \nGrant also blamed the problem on “CPU spin” in the company’s network code, comparing it to a child constantly asking “are we there yet” during a trip. He said the repeated processing drained battery power, and that the updated app should “start making this better.” \nIn his post, Grant also apologized and reiterated the company’s statement last week — in response to speculation about the root of the issue — that Facebook’s location tracking wasn’t causing the battery drain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:02:48.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
