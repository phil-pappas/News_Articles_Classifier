Dittman’s latest white paper called, “Tax Considerations for Recognition and Rewards Programs” outlines the key concepts of taxation for these programs. It provides a resource for organizations to help clarify questions that often come up when planning an incentive or recognition program.\nImplementing these programs requires an awareness of the taxation associated with the rewards. Complex Federal and State regulations make it difficult to determine the exact requirements that would apply to every recognition initiative.\nSteve Cummins, Vice President of Business Operations at Dittman Incentive Marketing says, “HR professionals have many factors to consider when building an effective rewards programs. We hope that this white paper will help them to simplify their planning and implementation process. ”\nThe new white paper provides guidance to program planners in understanding general income tax guidelines that will increase the potential for a successful program and, more importantly, avoid unpleasant surprises for both the corporate sponsor and the program participants.\nThe full white paper can be downloaded here: http://bit.ly/Tax-White-Paper .
