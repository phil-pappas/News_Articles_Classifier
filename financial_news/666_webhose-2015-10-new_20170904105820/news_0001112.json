In its global business conference, General Motors (GM) reiterated its commitment to a 10% EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin in North America.\nThe chart below shows how GM’s North America margins have progressed over the last few years. The US (VOO), Mexico, and Canada comprise the North America market.\n\nAlthough GM’s margins have risen over the last few years, they are still lower than what Ford (F) makes in its North America operations.\nFiat Chrysler’s (FCAU) North America margins are currently much lower than its peers. However, FCAU is working to improve its margins in North America. Currently, Fiat Chrysler forms 2.2% of the First Trust US IPO ETF (FPX).\nGM’s plan GM outlined the following strategic priorities to increase its margins in North America:\nMaterial costs: Raw material costs, from steel to copper, have fallen steeply over the last six months. This is a possible tailwind for General Motors in achieving its targeted EBIT margins. However, falling commodity prices have taken their toll on earnings of commodity producers such as Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Sales performance: GM has seen growth in commercial sales for 22 consecutive months. The company expects its sales performance to further improve in the coming months. Moreover, a better sales mix should also aid the company’s margins. New models: GM is launching several new models in North America over the next two years. This should also aid in margin expansion because new models typically sell at a higher price without much discounting. Adjacent sales: GM is re-entering the medium truck business. The company believes that the new lineup of medium trucks would provide it with an “adjacent sale opportunity.” According to GM, the medium truck market is not very big by itself. However, by having medium trucks in its product portfolio, the company would have a “complete lineup of vehicles that the commercial fleet customer needs.” GM Financial: General Motors sees its financing arm as another possible source of margin expansion. In the next part, we’ll look at General Motors’ stance in the luxury car segment.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Must Read: How Does General Motors’ Future Look?
