Figures it released on Wednesday showed the loss on each 787 leaving the factory narrowed to about $15.5 million in the third quarter, continuing a narrowing this year and smaller than a $20 million loss many analysts had expected. \nThe improvement came as some analysts questioned whether Boeing would ever recover its full investment of more than $40 billion, and may have to take an accounting charge to write off some 787 costs.\nCore earnings for the quarter, which exclude some pension and other costs, rose 18 percent to $2.52 per share in the third quarter, helped by higher commercial aircraft deliveries and improvement in its defense business.\nOn that basis, Wall Street had expected $2.22 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe plane maker notched up its forecast for jet deliveries for the year to between 755 and 760, from 750 to 755, and said it now expects core earnings of between $7.95 and $8.15 per share, up from $7.70 to $7.90 a share previously. That is in line with analysts, who expected $8.06 per share, on average.\n\n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott in New York and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva, W Simon and Bill Rigby)\nCompany Earnings Boeing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:10:01.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
