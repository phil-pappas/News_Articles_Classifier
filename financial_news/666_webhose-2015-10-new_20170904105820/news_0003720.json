These reports gave some hope the Federal Reserve may actually raise interest rates this year, underpinning the U.S. currency.\nCommonwealth's Esiner, however, said any sustained gain in the dollar \"will come from a more defined increase in hopes for a December Fed rate hike.\" And that, he said, could come from a more hawkish Fed at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting or a solid uptick in payrolls for October and November.\nIn early New York trading, the euro was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1324, trimming its losses from a session low of to $1.1308, its weakest since Oct. 9. Against sterling, it fell 0.6 percent to 73.14 pence after dropping to a 3-1/2-week low of 73.05 pence.\nMany banks were expecting the euro to fall to parity with the dollar by the end of the year as the ECB pumps 60 billion euros into the economy each month. But since dipping below $1.05 in March, it has gained around 9 percent, adding to the deflationary pressures facing the euro zone.\nThe dollar index, meanwhile, on Monday rose 0.4 percent to 94.884.\nAfter this week's ECB meeting, currency traders' focus will turn to the Fed, which holds its policy meeting next week. Most expect the Fed to keep rates at record lows, while investors are split over whether \"lift-off\" will come at December's meeting or in 2016.\nInterest rate futures traders, however, are banking on the Fed raising rates in April next year, with a 55 percent chance, according to the CME Group FedWatch on Monday.
