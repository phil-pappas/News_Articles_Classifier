ADVERTISEMENT The four-week average, a better indicator as to where the job market is headed, dropped 2,250 to 265,000, the lowest level since Dec. 15, 1973.\nJob gains slowed in August and September — to 136,000 and 142,000, respectively — with energy sector employment hit by low oil prices and manufacturers facing higher costs on their exports because of the dollar's strength. \nDespite the slowdown, economists are optimistic the U.S. economy's underlying strength will help push up wages in early 2016 and move toward full employment by next summer. \nMeanwhile, consumer spending is in a holding pattern and confidence has shifted into neutral while the economy works through a slower patch fueled by global financial turmoil. \nBut even amid broader global uncertainty, businesses have opted not to shed their employees. \nThe labor market's fluctuations combined with a worldwide economic slowdown may give the Federal Reserve pause about whether to raise short-term interest rates by the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:56:43.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
