IBC also looked for another date but this proved unworkable. Traditionally the UAE government adds further days around national holidays leading to a loss in confirmed delegates; feedback indicates that this trend would continue for Martyrs’ Day. IBC continues to demonstrate its commitment to the region by announcing dates for its IBC Content Everywhere MENA 2016 event, to be held at the Madinat Jumeirah from 31 October – 2 November 2016. This event will follow the format of the successful January 2015 show and consist of a high quality exhibition and conference featuring local and international speakers.
