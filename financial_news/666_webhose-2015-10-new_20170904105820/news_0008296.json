The automaker wants to begin testing self-driving Volts late next year on its Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit.\nDuring the tests, GM employees will be able to reserve a Volt using a car-sharing app and then select a destination, the company said in a statement. The car's autonomous technology will take the Volt to a destination and park itself.\n\"The program will serve as a rapid-development laboratory to provide data and lessons to accelerate the company's technical capabilities in autonomous vehicles,\" GM said.\nTo fund the ambitious project, GM plans to cut $5.5 billion in manufacturing, purchasing, information technology and administrative costs over the next three years.\nShares closed up 2.2%. Mobileye ( MBLY ) shares climbed 3.2%.\nGM's autonomous-car effort comes as tech firms are looking to disrupt the auto industry. According to reports, Apple ( AAPL ) is developing an electric car with a target date of 2019.\nTesla Motors ( TSLA ) is developing its own autonomous features, also with Mobileye technology's help. In a note published in August, Morgan Stanley said that it sees Tesla dominating the autonomous-auto market.\nGoogle ( GOOGL ) started working on self-driving cars in 2009 and expects to have the vehicles ready in 2020. The ride-hailing startup Uber is working on driverless cars as well.\nMeanwhile, China search giant Baidu ( BIDU ) — which is allied with Uber — is working on its own autonomous technology and in March said that a car that drives itself but lets a human driver take control when needed would be out later this year.\nAlso Thursday, GM launched a car-sharing program in New York City. Eligible residents of the Ritz Plaza luxury apartment building will be able to use a GM-developed mobile app to reserve a vehicle and access parking in one of 200 garages in Manhattan run by Icon Parking Systems.\nGM said that it will introduce a similar program in another, as-yet-unnamed city in Q1.\nAmong other initiatives, GM unveiled an electric bike concept and confirmed its plans to jointly develop a fuel-cell vehicle with Honda ( HMC ) by 2020.\nAutomotive Industry General Motors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:38:10.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
