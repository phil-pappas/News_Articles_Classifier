Here are the 10 worst-performing utilities stocks in the third quarter, paired with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy or sell these stocks in the final quarter of the 2015.

The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nMarket Cap: $6 billion Year-to-date return: -20.1% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates FLUOR CORP as a Hold with a ratings score of C. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate FLUOR CORP (FLR) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed ? some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and notable return on equity. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including weak operating cash flow, poor profit margins and a generally disappointing performance in the stock itself. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500 and the Construction & Engineering industry. The net income increased by 90.9% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $77.79 million to $148.51 million. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.32, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Along with the favorable debt-to-equity ratio, the company maintains an adequate quick ratio of 1.15, which illustrates the ability to avoid short-term cash problems. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 8.7%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 8.4%. The declining revenue appears to have seeped down to the company's bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. The gross profit margin for FLUOR CORP is currently extremely low, coming in at 7.09%. It has decreased from the same quarter the previous year. Regardless of the weak results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 3.08% is above that of the industry average. Net operating cash flow has decreased to $164.91 million or 31.00% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing to the industry average, the firm's growth rate is much lower.
