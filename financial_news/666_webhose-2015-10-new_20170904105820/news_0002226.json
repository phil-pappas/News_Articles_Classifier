Photo: Louise Kennerley\nThe federal government's response to the financial system inquiry was always going to be about protecting consumers – and juggling competing vested interests – but it has squibbed it on the hard calls in some key areas.\nAustralia's banking system is dominated by four big banks, which creates concentration risk in the financial system. To this end most of the recommendations relating to the capital those banks must hold to keep them stable have already been adopted.\nBut in areas such as vertical integration, where there are inherent conflicts of interest, the government has steered clear. Indeed, its 31-page report doesn't even utter the words \"vertical integration\". Instead it prefers to try and tweak the conflicts of banks from the inside.\nIllustration: Rocco Fazzari\nAfter a series of financial planning scandals which laid bare the problems when banks also own wealth management businesses and control up to 80 per cent of financial planners, the government hopes to restore consumer confidence by introducing legislation to lift the education, ethical and professional standards of financial planners.\nAdvertisement Financial planners, who currently only need to attend a course for a few days to qualify as an adviser, will soon have to \"hold a degree, pass an exam, undertake continuous professional development, subscribe to a code of ethics and undertake a professional year\".\nThis, coupled with a move to tighten the definition of a financial planner by requiring an individual to be registered as a planner before offering advice, will have a profound impact.\nRequiring them to list their credentials and any misdemeanours, including breaches or banning orders on the national register, will also help.\nAnd likewise the move to develop legislation to allow ASIC to ban individuals from management within financial firms from operating in the industry should also be highlighted.\nTo date, financial advisers have taken all the heat. In the case of the Commonwealth Bank financial planning scandal, the managers who turned a blind eye to inappropriate advice or helped in the cover-up of alleged forgery and fraud have never been brought to account. Some are still there and some are working in senior positions in other financial institutions.\nMatthew Rowe, a senior director at Hood Sweeney and former chairman of the Financial Planning Association who has been pushing for change in the industry for seven years, said consumers would finally have truth in labelling that differentiates appropriately qualified professionals from the product flogger.\nThe Turnbull government has set its sights on mortgage brokers and stockbrokers, calling on the corporate regulator ASIC to review the effect of commissions. The move is long overdue and is likely to open a can of worms.\nSuper move is baffling But the decision not to ban super funds from direct borrowing is hard to fathom. Instead, it will ask the ATO to monitor the situation and report back in three years.\nGiven the exponential growth in leverage in super funds in the past five years and a simultaneous explosion in property spruikers and a heated property market, kicking the can down the road three years might prove unwise.\nIt explains why David Murray in his FSI report made it clear direct borrowing in super funds should be banned: \"Direct borrowing by superannuation funds could pose risks to the financial system if it is allowed to grow at high rates. It is also inconsistent with the objectives of superannuation to be a savings vehicle for retirement income.\"\nBut the success or otherwise of the government's reaction to this root-and-branch review of the financial system will depend on the implementation and the effectiveness of the regulator.\nPut simply, does ASIC have the right resources, structure and leadership? According to the findings of a Senate inquiry into the performance of ASIC, the answer is no.\nThe inquiry found that ASIC was too slow to act and too trusting of the big end of town.\nThe inquiry was triggered by ASIC's reaction to a CBA whistleblower, Jeff Morris, who tipped off the regulator about a scandal inside the bank and a cover-up. It took the regulator 16 months before launching an official investigation.\nIn response to the Senate inquiry, ASIC is in the middle of a capability review that is due by the end of the year. Against this backdrop, the government has agreed to support the recommendation to give ASIC the power to modify or ban dodgy financial products, as well as introduce new accountability obligations on product manufacturers.\nThis will improve product regulation and acknowledges the role of product providers as gatekeepers in the value chain. However, it requires \"detailed consultation with stakeholders\" to ensure the new powers don't stifle innovation of new financial products.\nGiven the litany of financial scandals and the number of dodgy financial products that have destroyed the lives of thousands of Australians in the past few years, these powers should be granted immediately.\nWith Australia boasting one of the largest pools of managed money in the world, the government has acknowledged the need to better protect consumers.\nIt has failed to tackle the elephant in the room: vertical integration which makes the outcome of the capability review into ASIC all the more important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:01:14.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
