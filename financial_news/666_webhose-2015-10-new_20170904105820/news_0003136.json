Toyota is working with U.S. officials after questions were raised about the prominent use of its vehicles by militant organizations in Syria, Iraq and Libya. (Militant website via AP, File) \n\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Toyota has spoken with U.S. officials about the prominent use of its vehicles by militants in Syria, Iraq and Libya.\nToyota trucks are conspicuous in extremist propaganda and are often what carry Islamic State group fighters to war, some with large caliber weapons affixed to truck beds.\nThe company says it prohibits sales to anyone who might modify them for paramilitary or terrorist activities.\nThere are procedures in place to prevent vehicles from being diverted for unauthorized military use, but Toyota says it's impossible to control channels through which vehicles may be misappropriated or resold by third parties.\nThe Treasury Department's Terrorism and Financial Intelligence wing monitors monetary transfers and the flow of goods that could aid militants, but the department declined to comment on any ongoing inquiry Wednesday.\nToyota", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:15:18.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
