The message in September was not to blame somebody.\"\n\"While U.S. shares have experienced a noteworthy correction, we do not believe the fundamentals that are relevant to the U.S. equity market have changed in any important way,\" Cooperman and Einhorn said. \"If and as this becomes recognized, the U.S. equity bull market should resume.\"\nOverall, Cooperman and Einhorn said eurozone and Japanese shares, with currency hedges, are attractive in an absolute sense relative to U.S. shares and relative to fixed-income alternatives.\n\"We entered the year 2015 believing the Japanese equity market (currency hedged) would outperform the U.S. and this has been the case,\" Omega said. \"We continue with this conclusion based on the following: A BOJ open-ended and large QE program with the opportunity to increase in size; Double-digit earnings growth and attractive valuation.\" (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:31:18.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
