Many analysts say growth may not rebound much in the current quarter if the pain from China's slowdown persists. \nData due on Thursday will show factory output fell for the third straight month in September, while Friday's inflation and consumption data will underscore the fragile state of Japan's recovery, according to analysts polled by Reuters. \n\"There's no doubt the economy is in pretty bad shape, so it would make sense for the BOJ to ease on Friday,\" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. \n\"The economy is lacking a driver of growth, so it's hard for the BOJ to argue that a broad uptrend in prices remains intact.\" \n(Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:19:15.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
