And to ferret out prices, you typically have to go door to door. That’s why thirty-one years after the Federal Trade Commission’s Funeral Rule intended to make funeral home pricing more transparent became law, consumer advocates are calling on the FTC to require funeral homes to post prices online.“Hiding prices prevents consumer shopping,” says Josh Slocum, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, which along with the Consumer Federation of America is pushing for the change, adding, “Who has the wherewithal on this day of grief?”The Alliance surveyed funeral home prices and disclosures in ten areas of the country, tracking down prices for 15 funeral homes in each area, including at least one part of a funeral home chain. Under the FTC Funeral Law, funeral homes are required to provide price information over the phone and an itemized price list in person. The Alliance found 16% of the 150 funeral homes failed to disclose prices on a website, in response to an email or in response to a phone call.One exception: California, where a newish law requires funeral homes to fully disclose pricing online or list the services they provide and indicate that the pricing list is available on request; 13 of the 15 surveyed California funeral homes disclosed prices on their Web sites. “Any funeral home with a Web site should be required to post their prices online,” says Slocum, adding that naysayers in other states should note that after complying with the new California law, “the California funeral industry didn’t slide into the San Andreas fault.”[caption id=\"attachment_12939\" align=\"\" width=\"780\"] Get a casket price list to see all your options; cheaper versions might not be on display.

Prices for the same funeral services within individual areas almost always varied by at least 100 percent and often varied by more than 200 percent. Direct cremation charges ranged from $455 to $3,390 in Seattle. Immediate burial charges ranged from $1,195 to $5,200 in Atlanta. And full-service funerals ranged in the District of Columbia ranged from $3,370 to $13,800.“As an advocate who’s researched prices for consumer services for decades, I was stunned by the price differences,” says Steve Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America.The FTC has a checklist you should take to compare to the one the funeral homes give you. One line item to watch out for—a basic services fee for the funeral director and staff –that’s a catch-all fee basically to walk in the door. Then there’s the pitch for a fancier (more expensive) casket for the deceased—even if it’s just for transporting the body from the funeral home to the crematorium. If the body is to be cremated, lower-priced alternative containers made of unfinished wood, pressed wood, fiberboard, or cardboard might be available but not on display.Slocum warns not to assume a funeral home affiliated with a large chain is cheaper a la McDonald’s or Walmart as it’s typically the opposite, although he says, “It’s true that most of the times chains are expensive; it’s not always true. There’s no quick and easy rule.”If your loved one dies at a hospital and you haven’t picked a funeral home in advance, ask the hospital to keep the body at the morgue until you’ve made a decision, Slocum says. If the death occurs at an assisted living facility or nursing home, they won’t be prepared to hold the deceased. So it’s best upon admission for a family member to check out funeral homes at that point if the patient hasn’t made prior arrangements. “Don’t treat this as a process that others can just set in motion,” Slocum says, adding, “You have a right to say “yes or no” to a certain funeral home, to things like embalming.”If you do run into problems, you can file a complaint with a state funeral regulatory board, and copy the Alliance . “The only way to prompt change is if consumers voice their dissatisfaction,” he says.", "external_links": ["http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0301-funeral-costs-and-pricing-checklist", "http://www.funerals.org/contact-us"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:12:33.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
