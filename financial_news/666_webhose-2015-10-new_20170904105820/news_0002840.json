British-listed Lloyds (not to be confused with the insurer) almost went to the wall during the global financial crisis and, like peers across the Atlantic, was bailed out by the government.\nAs was the case with the second-half 2014 results, continued improvements in the bank's operating (and financial) performance were again evident in the first-half 2015 numbers. The company reported a 2 per cent increase in income to £8.97 billion ($19 billion), and underlying profit growth of 19 per cent to £4.27 billion.\nNo doubt management's strategic initiatives have been a key part of the earnings turnaround, although some credit must also go to the better operating environment. In our view, it has been the combination of a streamlined business (service levels, risk management) model and a return to GDP growth in the 2-3 per cent range that has resulted in the continued positive growth in net lending.\nEncouragingly, the continued improvement in earnings has not come at the expense of asset quality. Impairment charges for the first half decreased by about 75 per cent to £179 million, continuing a trend of recent years. A de-risking of the balance sheet (a key driver of which was the divestment of spin-off TSB) has also increased the bank's CET1 ratio and return on equity to 13.3 per cent and 16.2 per cent respectively.\nWith the ship steadied, the British government is taking the opportunity to undertake an orderly sell-down of its stake. A remaining 12 per cent holding (compared with its initial 43 per cent) in Lloyds is set to go by \"[British] spring next year\". This includes a £2 billion share sale earmarked for British-based \"small investors\".\nKey changes have been made Meanwhile, the next phase of management's strategy over the next three years is to create \"the best\" customer experience, become \"simpler and more efficient\" and deliver \"sustainable growth\". It will be interesting to see whether the latter sees Lloyds reconsider higher risk markets or regions. The bank's medium-term strategy does, though, appear well suited to the current upward trajectory of the British economy.\nWhile management has unveiled further strategic initiatives to finetune Lloyds' business model, we believe most of the necessary structural changes have been made. Accordingly, we expect earnings and dividends will increase over the next several years, and we view the current valuation metrics (price-to-earnings multiple of 9 times, price to book value of 1.3 times and yield of 3 per cent) as compelling.\n The market, however, has yet to give Lloyds credit where credit is due, with sentiment towards the shares lukewarm. Much of this is probably due to the negative bias created by Lloyds being bailed out during the GFC and that it is still partially government owned. We believe the penny will drop sooner rather than later for the market of the value proposition here, with the pressure building the closer the government gets to selling its remaining shares.\nGreg Smith is the head of research at investment research and funds management house Fat Prophets.\nDisclosure: Interests associated with Fat Prophets declare a holding in China Mobile.\nFor a free trial of Fat Prophets' daily market commentary please click here .", "external_links": ["http://www.fatprophets.com.au/franked_dividends.aspx?ref=FinReview"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:09:39.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
