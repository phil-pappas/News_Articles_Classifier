He received a PhD in economics from Harvard University in 1995 and was assistant professor of economics and international affairs at Columbia University from 1995 to 1997 before returning to the Irish capital. The government will advise President Michael D. Higgins to make the formal appointment, it said in a statement.\nLane, also chair of the European Systemic Risk Board’s advisory scientific committee, was said on Oct. 15 to be one of two final candidates, alongside government official Robert Watt. He succeeds Patrick Honohan, who was plucked from TCD’s economics department in 2009 to restore the central bank’s credibility amid a real-estate and banking collapse.\nThe heads of the euro area’s 19 national central banks sit together with the 6-person Executive Board on the ECB’s Governing Council, which sets monetary policy for the currency bloc. Honohan plans to step down before the end of this year.\n“Professor Lane’s outstanding economic, financial and policy making record ideally position him to lead the central bank in the coming years,” Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in the statement.", "external_links": ["http://www.philiplane.org/cvPHILIPLANEapril2015.pdf\\"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:58:37.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
