Angus Mordant Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose It has been 10 years since the government gave most people the right to choose their own superannuation manager, but new research shows that 68 per cent of Australians stick with the default fund selected by their employer â€“ a statistic that hasn't budged since last year.\nInertia in default superannuation remains despite a swathe of new low-fee retail funds entering the market, and a growing number of younger workers claiming to be open to switching funds to get a better deal.\nING Direct, which offers no-frills low and zero-fee account options, is at the forefront of a push by the bank-backed super sector to use technology to win customers from non-profit industry funds that dominate the default super market.\n\"Australians are still charged far too much in super fees with many people paying $2000 a year,\" ING Direct executive director distribution Lisa Claes said.\nFinancial Services Council chief executive Sally Loane wants more people to switch out of default industry funds into low fee retail options. Louise Kennerley \"Switching to a low-fee fund so that money remains invested and earning compound interest could make a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars to an individual's retirement balance.\"\nAccording to the 2015 Your Super Future report released on Monday, 42 per cent of workers feel they do not know enough about how superannuation works or the different funds available to make informed decisions about it.\nIt showed 62 per cent of Australians feel there is not enough transparency around super fees.\nGen Y on the move A joint initiative of the Financial Services Council and ING Direct, the report is based on an annual survey of public attitudes to superannuation.\n\"For most Australians their superannuation is the second-largest asset, after their home, that they will ever have in their lifetime. Many people could be doing more to take control of their retirement by becoming better informed and more engaged with their super,\" Financial Services Council chief executive Sally Loane said.\nIt is a shift that is happening, albeit more slowly than Ms Loane would like.\nMore than one third of those surveyed this year said they were likely to consider switching funds, up from 19 per cent three years ago.\nGeneration Y respondents were the most likely to consider switching funds: to take advantage of lower fees, an easier switching process, or bundling with other financial services.\nAnd it is this technology savvy cohort that ING Direct has firmly in its sights.\n\"Funds need to become more transparent. People want an app so they can check on their super balance every day rather than waiting to receive their annual statement in the mail,\" Ms Claes said.\nThe Amsterdam based financial services giant ING Group opened its local arm in 1999 and quickly ate into the savings and mortgage books of Australia's traditional \"bricks and mortar\" banks.\nING Direct eyes bigger slice of super Now the online bank wants to replicate its recipe for success in the $2 trillion and growing superannuation sector.\nSince it launched a little over three years ago in mid-2012 ING Direct Living Super has signed up 38,000 members to grow from zero to $1.5 billion in funds under management.\nWith a market share of just 0.0015 per cent the fund is one of the smallest super funds in Australia, but it is also one of the fastest growing.\nIn calendar year 2014 ING Direct Living increased its customer base by 76.5 per cent, smashing an industry-wide trend that saw a median drop in fund membership of 1.4 per cent. A decline in member numbers among established funds was in part a reflection of the push to encourage people with multiple accounts to consolidate them.\nING Direct Living Super grew its funds under management by 116 per cent last calendar year, a rate of growth more than eight times stronger than the industry-wide median of 14 per cent.\n'Robo-advice' services Industry super funds have already responded to the increased competition from banks with improved online and mobile services, and more tipped to launch \"robo-advice\" platforms .\nMs Claes said ING Direct knows all too well its first-mover advantage would fade as other super fund providers catch on to the digital revolution.\nIn 2004, within five years of launching its branchless online savings accounts in 1999, ING Direct had 5.5 per cent of the total Australian household savings market. Over the intervening decade that market share slipped as all of its major incumbent competitors responded by launching their own low cost online savings accounts, but the value of the business keeps growing as the size of the total market expands.\nToday ING Direct has 3 per cent of both the domestic household savings and residential mortgage markets.\nThe Financial Services Council has campaigned in favour of a recommendation of last year's financial system inquiry for review of the Fair Work Commission process that oversees how default super funds are assigned through the modern award wage process, arguing that more competition is needed to reduce fees and improve outcomes for the majority of people who do not choose their own fund .\nMs Claes said ING Direct supports this push but was more focused on growing its market share by targeting individuals directly rather than through their employer.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:46:38.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
