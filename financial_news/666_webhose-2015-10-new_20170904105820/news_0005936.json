Frank Witter, now chairman of the Volkswagen Financial Services AG unit, has been nominated to replace Mr. Pötsch as CFO, the committee said.\nVolkswagen said earlier this week it had drawn up a plan to refit vehicles affected by the software that apparently allows them to dodge emissions standards. Further details on refitting will be released next week, the committee said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\n ", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/9PLzJF7bVTT", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-cfo-on-track-to-become-chairman-1443710224/?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:05:20.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
