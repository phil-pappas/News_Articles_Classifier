Photo: Bloomberg\nWarnings that a Chinese takeover of $9 billion NSW transmission network owner TransGrid could raise competition concerns have proven unfounded as top competition regulator Rod Sims revealed the ACCC has already examined the potential deal and decided it can proceed.\nBut the decision by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission not to investigate such a possible takeover further leaves unresolved the tricky issue of whether different Chinese state-owned companies may count as a single entity for antitrust purposes.\nSources observing the NSW government's privatisation process for TransGrid had pointed to potential competition issues with some of the four short-listed bidders. In particular, the consortium comprising Chinese government owned State Grid Corporation alongside Macquarie's infrastructure arm MIRA had been singled out as a possible concern, given the ownership by another China state entity, China Huaneng Group, of the Millmerran coal-fired plant in south-east Queensland.\nCombining the ownership of the important NSW-Queensland interconnector owned by TransGrid and the 850-megawatt Millmerran generator could pave the way for anti-competitive behaviour that could drive up power prices in that region, sources said.\nAdvertisement Ownership examined Mr Sims confirmed to Fairfax Media that the potential common ownership of those two assets had been the key issue examined by the regulator .\n\"We've taken advice on that and decided that we don't have concerns on that,\" Mr Sims said.\n\"Millmerran used to be in a strong position in relation to the interconnector, but it is not in quite the same position now. The technical advice we got from the AER [Australian Energy Regulator] convinced us that, in balance, there wasn't an issue there.\"\nMr Sims said production from other generators meant Millmerran didn't have as much of an impact on the market as it did five to seven years ago.\nHe said that the finding meant the ACCC didn't need to go on and determine whether the two Chinese state-owned companies, State Grid Corporation and China Huaneng, really should be regarded as part of the same entity.\n\"We looked as them as if that were the assumption but we didn't have to then wrestle to the ground whether indeed that was the case,\" Mr Sims said. \"It didn't come to that.\"\nA takeover of TransGrid by the State Grid/MIRA consortium, or by any other bid group with overseas interests, would still need approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board.\nHalliburton faces red light Mr Sims was speaking after the ACCC on Friday raised its second \"red light concern\" with a takeover in eight days, voicing worries with the $US34.6 billion ($48 billion) takeover of oil services major Baker Hughes by Halliburton .\nHe said the merger of the second- and third-largest oil services players had raised some \"very loud\" objections from the larger oil and gas producers in Australia, both foreign-owned and local.\n\"The big three would be the big two, so it is of serious competition concerns,\" Mr Sims said. \"It's fair to say there's been a lot of concern by the oil and gas companies in Australia.\"\nThe ACCC is to release its final decision on the Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal on December 17.\nMeanwhile, a one-week delay in the ACCC's ruling on Shell's $90 billion takeover of BG Group , now put off until November 19, has heightened speculation that that deal will hit further hurdles after the statement of issues released by the ACCC in September.\nBut Mr Sims said the delay was due to a particularly busy week scheduled for hearings on the east coast gas market inquiry, rather than any more substantive issue.\nA Shell spokesman said the oil giant remained \"confident\" that the BG takeover was \"good for the development of additional east coast gas supply\" and that Australian consumers would ultimately benefit.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/energy/electricity/competition-watchdog-lurks-as-potential-hurdle-in-transgrid-sale-process-20150923-gjtksk", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/acccs-rod-sims-threatens-100b-bgshell-gas-merger-20150917-gjp3ac", "http://www.afr.com/business/energy/oil/accc-raises-concerns-over-477b-halliburtons-baker-deal-20151023-gkh05b"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:43:07.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
