Turkish Airlines General Managers, Mr. Mehmet Akay from Mumbai and Mr. Ozer Guler from New Delhi, said, “We are delighted to be the airline partner of choice, for the VisitBritain – Shaandaar campaign. Britain is one of the most picturesque places in the world; an ideal romantic get-away with its scenic beauty, food and nightlife. Turkish Airlines flies daily to Britain from across 109 countries via Istanbul, with quick 3 hour connectivity. The Airline has one of the best services to offer to its business class travelers. Turkish Airlines flies to more countries than any other airline. Because of our superlative services we have been also chosen by Skytrax as “the Best Airline in Europe” for 5 years in a row. We would love the campaign winners to “Widen” their experience and make their travel unforgettable with Turkish Airlines”. VisitBritain’s Regional Manager for Asia Pacific & Middle East, Sumathi Ramanathan adds, “We are very pleased to be working with this movie and the fantastic star cast in it. We are honoured to have partnered with Dharma productions for this campaign. Britain is known for its lush countryside and picturesque locations and this opportunity helps us celebrate that and much more. We hope that this film is a blockbuster and encourages all the Indian travellers to come relive their Bollywood memories in Britain.” The lead actors of Shaandaar, Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, spoke about their experience filming Shaandaar and their time in Britain. Alia Bhatt said, “\"I love England, and it's one of my favourite holiday destinations. The shopping in London is fantastic. And there's so much to discover when you step out of the cities - from the very pretty Lake District to Leeds where we shot a lot of Shaandaar. My mom is British-born and it is where she began acting so it will always have a special place in my heart as well as in my family.” Shahid Kapoor added, 'I enjoy the UK very much. There's a wealth of history, dramatic scenery, sacred sites, legend and tradition all come together, and there's so much to discover when you step out of the cities.
