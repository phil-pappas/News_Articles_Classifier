Supplied Share on twitter by Shaun Drummond Eftpos is pushing ahead with its plan to claw back its dwindling market share, hiring US software company Bell ID to build its mobile payments and online security system to take on giants Visa and MasterCard.\nThis will allow consumers to make contactless debit payments using eftpos from their mobile devices by May 2016, most likely first at the big supermarkets Coles and Woolworths, two of its shareholders along with the banks.\nEftpos will also join the battleground over who owns the so-called \"token vault\", a behind-the-scenes system that allows for the authentication of mobile payments. It will sell the authentication service to banks and merchants in competition with Visa and MasterCard and the banks' systems.\n\"This new capability will enhance competition in the Australian mobile payments market and help eftpos meet the growing needs of this rapidly changing area of payments technology. It will also provide the Australian industry with the choice of a domestic, secure tokenisation service,\" said Bruce Mansfield, the managing director of eftpos.\nThe tokenisation service is a security feature using tokens (in effect another security number) based on the original eftpos card number. This token system gives added protection to consumers.\nVisa and MasterCard have been trying to persuade banks to store the security tokens with them rather than the banks doing it themselves, arguing that this is simpler and ultimately less costly for the industry. However, the banks would have to pay them extra fees for the service.\nApple Pay, which is still trying to get the banks to pay it part of their fees before it launches in Australia , would prefer to deal with just a few global token vaults rather than thousands of separate ones at banks and merchants.\nHost card emulation For debit transactions, eftpos will offer a single, Australian token vault for banks and merchants in Australia. However, it will use a system called host card emulation, which is not used by Apple. HCE, already used by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac, creates a digital copy of the card and stores its information in a data centre rather than on the card.\nGoogle, however, has included HCE in its latest operating system updates. It recently launched Android Pay, which it began offering for the first time in early September in the US.\n\"The tokenisation service will compete with others in the market and will also be available as a white label product,\" an eftpos spokesman said.\nBell ID is also behind the mobile payments of ANZ Bank (also an owner of eftpos), which its New Zealand arm began offering via its goMoney app in March.\nEftpos has lost market share to Visa and MasterCard. In the two years to June 30, 2014, it carried 2.4 billion debit transactions worth $139 billion, but this represented a 60 per cent share, down from 80 per cent. Eftpos' share of all card payments fell by 10 percentage points to 40 per cent in the same period.\nMuch of this was due to tap-and-go payments, which are now about 70 per cent of all Visa and MasterCard in-person transactions in Australia, as well as more people buying online. Offering payments on mobiles is particularly important to eftpos recovering some of this share because people will be able to choose eftpos on their devices. Eftpos contactless is now available on 5 million dual-network cards, but cardholders cannot choose it.\nHowever, paying with mobile devices has been slow to catch on. In May, banking research company RFi found 8 per cent of smartphone owners had used their phone instead of a card to make a contactless payment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DrummondShaun"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:06:45.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
