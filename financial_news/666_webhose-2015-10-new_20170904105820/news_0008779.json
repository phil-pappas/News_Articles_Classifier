He is joined in Singh Is Blinng by Prabhu Dheva, the director with whom he has made his biggest grosser ever, Rowdy Rathore, and Amy Jackson, and Lara Dutta. Singh Is Blinng is being pitched as a perfect family outing. Here Akshay Kumar chats with us on the eve of the release of his movie:\nHow has 2015 been for you?\nGrateful isn’t a humble enough word; I don’t think I have ever enjoyed a year full of releases as much as this one. Well, not for a while anyway. Every project that I have taken up recently, despite its achievement, has been delivered wholeheartedly from my side. When you are proud of your work, I think it shows.\nGuess there were always huge plans to make Singh Is Bliing a big release this Gandhi Jayanti?\nThat’s the plan! I know many people are waiting for the Rowdy Jodi to score again, but as always one can only pray; what will happen will happen. It’s a lovable film, everything about it is lovable, from the characters to the songs to the situations, it’s all about love, desperation & values. All I ask is that people bring their hearts and enjoy me being the ‘Mesmeriz-Singh’ (smiles).\nI am sure this film is again set to glorify the legend of Sikhs. How is that aspect explored in the film?\nWithout giving too much away, it is a film that glorifies everyone and everything, the good, the bad and the ugly are brought to life. I can tell you this, that I have played many-many characters in my time, but there is nothing quite like playing a true Punjabi Sikh boy. I feel at home, I feel a certain amount of protection when I walk on the sets wearing my ‘pug’ and I miss being in character since we have got back. There truly is something so special about playing a Singh!\nTalking of Singhs and Punjabis, how did Amy Jackson come into the film, especially since she is not even an Indian, leave aside being a Punjabi?\nAmy is the secret element behind the whole film. We didn’t want an Indian Hindi speaking actress for this role per se, let alone a Punjabi. The whole idea is that she doesn’t understand a word that I am saying. Hence the reason Lara is the savior of the film, as she is the one who translates and confuses everything for us. Lara has such a brilliant role that I am glad Amy can’t speak Hindi, as it just makes the whole misunderstanding business so much more genuine. Amy hasn’t had to play dumb in her role, she just had to play an even bigger version of herself, and she did it with grace and humor. I respect her for that.\nBy Joginder Tuteja\n 01, 2015 11:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:13:24.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
