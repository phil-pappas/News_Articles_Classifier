This is true. Some believe that the only way to compete might be to merge several players into a regional champion. This won’t happen. What’s more, it wouldn’t solve the problem even if it did. \nFrédéric Oudéa, chief executive of France’s Société Générale, argued in the Financial Times that a handful of “robust” US universal banks “are gaining market share abroad while strengthening their positions at home”. John McFarlane, the chairman of Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , suggested that the only way to fight back would be to combine the investment banking arms of the biggest European firms to create a regional champion. \nIt’s true that European banks are shedding jobs, selling off assets and nursing their frail balance sheets. On Thursday, Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) warned that it will make a €6.2bn loss in its third quarter because of writedowns and may cut its dividend this year for the first time since 1957. Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) is reportedly contemplating a “substantial” capital raising. These are not the actions of companies in rude health. \nMeanwhile, US banks are on the charge. Mr Oudéa points out that the top five US investment banks have increased their share of the global wholesale financial market from 48pc to 59pc over the last five years. \nThere are a number of reasons for this transatlantic divide in banking fortunes. Banks around the world were hit hard by the credit crunch . But the fallout in the US was shorter and sharper because the authorities there forced American banks to raise capital, shrink their balance sheets and start getting into shape for the new regulatory environment: many were compliant with Basel III the main international banking rulebook long before the deadline. \nEuropean banks, by contrast, have been allowed to stagger on, not least thanks to the European Central Bank’s efforts to keep the eurozone intact by flooding the region with cheap funding. New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) rules, some more strident than in the US, have been drawn up. But, because European consensus can take a while to develop, they’ve only recently been finalised and many have yet to be implemented. \nThe upshot is that, seven years on from the credit crunch, the nettle of European bank restructuring remains decidedly ungrasped. The Royal Bank of Scotland has dramatically scaled back its investment banking operations (mostly because it was in state-ownership and forced to by the Treasury); the Swiss banks, beholden to a particularly tough domestic regulator, have also got out of a few unprofitable business lines; and, erm, that’s about it. \nUS banks have also benefited from the post-crisis regulatory agenda. Different countries reacted to the credit crunch with different rules, resulting in what the consultancy Oliver Wyman has described as “regulatory Balkanisation”. International banks must now treat their operations in each country as separate entities with their own capital buffers and liquidity, which has effectively put the decades-long process of financial globalisation into reverse. \nThis is annoying for all banks. But it is least annoying for those banks with the biggest home markets. And the US, which in any given year is the source of somewhere between a half and two-thirds of global investment banking profits, is the largest of them all. US banks have turned their profitability into the economies of scale that allow them to compete on a global stage. \nNone of these trends will be reversed by attempts to create a pan-European investment banking champion. \nIn July next year, the US will introduce new rules for what it calls “foreign banking organisations”, requiring them to set up bank holding companies, comply with local leverage rules and pass certain liquidity tests. This will make it even harder for international firms however big they might be to compete in the El Dorado of investment banking. \nAnd, while it is true that the European Union has roughly the same economic clout as the US, its capital markets are still only about half the size (something that Lord Hill’s capital markets union , launched earlier this month, is attempting to solve). What’s more, the fees that banks earn for capital markets work in Europe are much lower than in the US. The global playing field won’t be level any time soon. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is unlikely that mergers will solve the other big problem facing most European banks: a lack of capital. Credit Suisse appears to be in the weakest position on this front, especially when it comes to common equity tier 1 capital (the most important kind). But UBS, the big French lenders and Deutsche Bank are all similarly afflicted. Merging two or more large banks with not enough capital merely creates a very large bank with not enough capital. \nDespite moves towards a banking union in Europe, the continent remains a patchwork of competing interests. The national restrictions on capital and liquidity are unlikely to be relaxed anytime soon. The picture is further complicated by the fact that two of the countries with the largest banks the UK and Switzerland aren’t part of the eurozone. \nTalk of a pan-European champion sounds like a riff on the long-running pleas for less regulation. It is a distraction from the real issue. As the Chinese proverb almost has it, the best time for European banks to get their houses in order and improve their capital positions was five or six years ago. The second best time is now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:04:49.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
