The vehicles include Tiguans, Passats, Golfs, Caddys and Amaroks. \nThe parent company is working on a technical solution, but it hasn't yet been revealed, says local general manager Tom Ruddenklau. \nGibson Sheat says when counting hundreds of cars produced by Audi and Skoda, companies owned by Volkswagen, more than 8000 cars in New Zealand may be affected. \nIt says Volkswagen is working on a \"fix\" for the cars fitted with the test-defeating device. \n\"However, there are concerns that the 'fix' could degrade certain performance characteristics of the affected vehicles, including horsepower and fuel efficiency. \n\"Affected car owners could be entitled to seek compensation for any increased fuel costs, depreciation of vehicle value, out of pocket expenses and costs associated with the recall and any future repairs that may be required.\" \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:48:47.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
