Loans sold in the preceding twelve months amounted to Rs. 12,969 crore. After adding back loans sold in the preceding 12 months, the growth in individual loan portfolio is 23%.

HDFC continues to service these loans and is entitled to the residual interest on the loans sold. The residual interest on the individual loans sold is 1.22% p.a. and is being accounted over the life of the loans and not on an upfront basis. Non-Performing Loans Gross non-performing loans as at September 30, 2015 amounted to Rs. 1,707 crore. This is equivalent to 0.71% of the loan portfolio (previous year – 0.69%). The non-performing loans of the individual portfolio stood at 0.53% while that of the non-individual portfolio stood at 1.12%. As per the National Housing Bank (NHB) norms, the Corporation is required to carry a total provision of Rs. 1,797 crore. The balance in the provision for contingencies account as at September 30, 2015 stood at Rs. 2,127 crore of which Rs. 518 crore is on account of non-performing loans and the balance Rs. 1,609 crore is in respect of general provisioning on standard loans and other provisions. This balance in the provision for contingencies is equivalent to 0.89% of the portfolio. Thus the Corporation carries an additional provision of Rs. 330 crore over the regulatory requirements.

As per regulatory norms, the minimum requirement for the Capital Adequacy Ratio and Tier I capital is 12% and 6% respectively. \nIn October 2015, the NHB recalibrated risk weights on individual housing loans, based on the loan amount and loan to value ratio, with the lowest risk weight being reduced to 35% compared to 50% earlier. The revised risk weights have not been applied in determining the above-mentioned capital adequacy ratio. If the revised risk weights were to be applied as at September 30, 2015, the reduction in risk weighted assets would be Rs. 15,472 crore and the capital adequacy ratio would stand at 17.4%, of which Tier I would be 13.8%. \nDISTRIBUTION NETWORK HDFC’s distribution network spans 392 outlets, which include 113 offices of HDFC’s distribution company, HDFC Sales Private Limited (HSPL).
