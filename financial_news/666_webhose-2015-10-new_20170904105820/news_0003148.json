Andrew Meares by Phillip Coorey John Kehoe The federal government is promoting the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership is just the first step towards a broader regional free-trade agreement while the US is promoting it as a crucial step in its rebalance to Asia to offset China's rising influence in the region.\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has labelled the agreement as \"a gigantic foundation stone for our future prosperity\" while the Labor opposition gave its in-principle support, subject to seeing the final detail.\nUS President Barack Obama faces a tough test progressing the TPP through Congress ahead of the November 2016 election, with labour-aligned Democrats worried about the deal's impact on blue-collar workers and Republican Senate Finance Committee chairman Orrin Hatch already criticising it as falling \"woefully short\" for America.\nThe Canadian government also faces fierce domestic political resistance to legislate the deal. Without the US ratifying the TPP, it would struggle to come into force.\nTrade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim nations, including Australia's Andrew Robb, sealed the biggest trade agreement in more than two decades which will capture 40 per cent of the global economy early Tuesday, prising open new markets for Australian services providers, manufacturers, farmers and investors.\nAustralian services providers in mining equipment, finance, education, engineering and logistics will be among the biggest winners from the lowering of trade barriers in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region which is forecast will have 3 billion middle-class consumers by 2030.\nThe standardisation of international rules for goods, services and investment in the bloc, as well as licence recognition and simply being allowed to operate in countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam, Mexico and Peru, will allow businesses to compete on a near level playing field with local firms for the first time.\nIn a surprise liberalisation on foreign investment, the threshold the Foreign Investment Review Board screens proposals will be quadrupled for investors from the 12 TPP countries to $1.094 billion, outside of sensitive sectors like media and telecommunications. Canadian pension funds and Malaysian property investors stand to gain.\n Equal access for rivals While Australian agricultural access to Japan and South Korea is, in some cases, better than that negotiated in the separate bilateral agreements, it also means Australia's rivals in New Zealand, Canada and the United States will now have equal access to these lucrative markets, as well as those in Malaysia and Singapore.\nAustralian dairy farmers will be able to sell more butter and cheese to the United States and Japan. Sugar growers scored only modest new access rights to the protected US market for the first time in 20 years, in the face of fierce lobbying by US sugar growers.\nNationals MPs Matt Canavan and George Christensen decried the sugar deal, which allowed only an extra 65,000 tonnes a year to be exported to the US, and did not rule out crossing the floor when the necessary legislation came before Parliament.\nLabor, which began negotiating the TPP when in government, was concerned at a push by the United States which would have driven up the price of some prescription medicines in Australia. The ALP also opposes the inclusion of an Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provision, as it does in all agreements because it enables foreign companies to challenges the decisions of Australian state and federal governments.\nBut Mr Robb stood firm during negotiations and Mr Turnbull assured there would be no impact on the price of medicine or the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\"It's not going to make drugs more expensive in Australia, whatsoever,\" Mr Turnbull said. Mr Robb said he negotiated safeguards for the ISDS \"to protect legitimate government regulation in the areas of health and environment\".\nFor example, tobacco companies which have been using the ISDS from a 1993 bilateral deal with Hong Kong to challenge the laws enforcing the plain packaging of cigarettes, would have no recourse through the TPP, he said.\nOpposition spokeswoman on trade, Penny Wong, said the assurances were welcome, but Labor would await the release of the detail before giving a firm commitment.\nChina 'cautious' over TPP Mr Robb said he hoped other nations would join the TPP. China was cautious but not hostile.\nA spokesperson for the Ministry of Commerce said: \"China hopes the TPP will mutually promote other regional free trade arrangements and will make a contribution to the development of trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific.\"\nIf it joined, China would be forced to adopt higher standards in such areas such as intellectual property protection and environmental regulations.\nThe TPP, if ratified by all nations, will cover Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam.\nThe official text will be finalised by officials before being released in the coming weeks. Canada is eager to publish details ahead of the election this month, to calm fears its dairy and automotive sectors will be hurt.\nCanada's opposition parties have left open the option to veto the TPP if they win the October 19 election.\nThe Canadian government has offered a multibillion assistance package for dairy farmers hurt by the modest opening up of imports of cheese, butter and milk powder from the US, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe agreement will enter into force 60 days after all 12 signatories have ratified it through their parliaments or whatever other domestic process is required.\nIf this has not happened within two years, it will enter into force 60 days after the two-year period, but only if six original signatories, which must account for 85 per cent of combined GDP of the 12 original signatories, have ratified the agreement.\nIf the US does not ratify, the TPP could collapse. It will definitely collapse if both the US and Canada hold out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:01:15.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
