While it's a glaring miss, Philip Tetlock, co-author of Superforecasting and co-leader of the Good Judgment Project, said the investment banks need not dismiss all their economists yet. \n\"The only way we can identify superforecasters is on the basis of hundreds of judgments they make over extended periods of time,\" said Tetlock. \"That's how you sort out the superforecasters from the not-so-good forecasters.\" \nThe Good Judgment Project is a multi-year forecasting study that Tetlock co-leads with his wife, Barbara Mellers. The project studies tens of thousands of ordinary volunteers -- including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer and a former ballroom dancer -- who are asked to forecast global events. Among them, some are far better than average at predicting the direction of events. Dubbed \" superforecasters \" by Tetlock, they do not rely on powerful computers or mathematical algorithms, but that smaller group in the aggregate continues to make better predictions than their benchmarks and intelligence analysts.

And making a short term score either in the stock market or at the roulette table in Las Vegas is one of them. One of the keys to being a superforecaster, said Tetlock, is knowing these limitations. \n\"You have to pick your battles wisely,\" said Tetlock. \"Superforecasters focus on problems where analytical effort pays off and they recognize that there are some categories of problems where there is so much irreducible uncertainty, effort is not going to pay off, so they don't invest very much.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:13:57.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
