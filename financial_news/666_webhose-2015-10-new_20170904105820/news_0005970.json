The rigging was making Libor “a joke again,” he said.\nThe e-mails were shown Wednesday to a jury in the trial of Anthony Allen and Anthony Conti, former Rabobank traders who are accused of taking part in a four-year scheme to manipulate Libor, which is the benchmark tied to more than $350 trillion of loans and securities.\nThey were presented by a defense attorney apparently to support an argument that the traders didn’t engage in a scheme to manipulate the benchmark but were doing their best in setting Libor. They’ve also argued that Libor became meaningless during the 2008 financial crisis.\nRobson and Takayuki Yagama, his Tokyo colleague, pleaded guilty to taking part in the same scheme, and agreed to cooperate with the U.S. government and testify at the trial.\nThe case is U.S. v. Allen, 14-cr-272, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:03:48.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
