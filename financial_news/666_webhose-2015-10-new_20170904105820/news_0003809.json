Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has undercut the racial relations efforts of President Barack Obama, calling for the United States to get a \"real black President\" to bridge divides.\nMr Murdoch, 84, caused a storm on social media with his contentious tweet, which was intended to promote the credentials of the conservative African American presidential candidate Ben Carson.\nMr Carson, a retired doctor, appeared on Mr Murdoch's Fox News channel alongside his wife on Wednesday.\n\"Ben and Candy Carson terrific,\" Mr Murdoch tweeted. \"What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide.\"\nBen and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.\n— Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) October 8, 2015\nAustralian-born Mr Murdoch is executive co-chairman of News Corp, owner of the The Wall Street Journal , The Australian , Melbourne's Herald Sun , 50 per cent of FOXTEL in Australia and a majority stake in online real estate advertising company REA Group.\n As the social media world responded with rage against Mr Murdoch's tweet, he defended it by promoting a New York magazine story about \"minority community disappointment\" with Mr Obama.\nIn the article, \"The Paradox of the First Black President\", the author writes : \"The price that Obama has had to pay — and, more important, that African-Americans have had to pay — is one of caution, moderation, and at times compromised policies: The first black president could do only so much, and say only so much, on behalf of other African-Americans.\"\nMr Obama is America's first African American president, but the nation appears to remain badly divided on racial issues. President Obama is the son of a black father and a white mother, leading some to question his authenticity as a black man.\nLike Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, Mr Carson is an outsider who has never held elected office and is a political novice. He was the first paediatric neurosurgeon to successfully separate twins conjoined at the head.\nMr Murdoch later apologised for the tweet, writing that he meant \"no offence\".\nApologies! No offence meant. Personally find both men charming.\n— Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) October 8, 2015\nMr Carson has shot to prominence to be second in the Republican opinion polls, amid widespread disenchantment with the political establishment.\nOnly two years ago, the doctor had no intention of running for office until he received widespread acclaim for publicly critiquing Barack Obama's healthcare insurance law, in the presence of the President.\nMr Murdoch has changed his tune after talking down Mr Carson's political qualifications in March.\n\"Wonderful character, up from Detroit ghetto, sadly seems political naif,\" he tweeted in March.\nRead 2 bks by famous neurosurgeon Ben Carson, running for president. Wonderful character, up from Detroit ghetto, sadly seems political naif\n— Rupert Murdoch (@rupertmurdoch) March 24, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/580504630343372801", "https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/652094791602319360", "https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/651924724960874497", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts", "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/paradox-of-the-first-black-president.html#", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:39:40.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
