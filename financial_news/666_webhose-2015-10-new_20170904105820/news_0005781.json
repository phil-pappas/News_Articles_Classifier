Can't afford to pay a high-priced financial advisor to set you straight? Podcasts are not just for comedians and true crime — listen to these five money podcasts to help you whip your finances into shape : 1. You Need a Budget \nThis may not come as a surprise to you, but most Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck. You Need a Budget is all about helping listeners slowly get out of debt and start making every dollar count. Making a budget is key, and not only does the podcast give you great advice, but the creator also made a software system for budgeting that anyone can use. Whether you choose to use their software or not, using YNAB as a motivational tool is very useful. Listening to other families making financial progress might inspire you to reexamine your own budget. \nGood for : Practical everyday budgeting advice and motivation. 2. Planet Money \nIt's great to learn how to manage your personal finances, but do you ever wonder why things are the way they are? To fully, truly understand why college costs so much, why our clothes come from Bangladesh, or why certain trends prevail in the modern economy, listen to Planet Money . Think of it as This American Life for your finances. With fascinating stories from a global perspective, the charismatic reporters at Planet Money manage to make unwieldy, abstract economic theories fun and easy to understand. \nGood for : Economics lessons and entertainment. 3. Money With Farnoosh Torabi \nThe wise and sharp Farnoosh Torabi is both a great financial adviser and a great interviewer. She also does specific advice episodes, such as a recent one in which she invited an expert to answer a listener's question on how to save for a baby. If you're diving in for the first time, you're in luck: this podcast is on five times a week, so there's a lot of back catalog. It might be hard to catch up, so scroll through and pick the episodes most relevant to you. \nGood for : Specific life planning and financial advice and recommendations to other financial gurus. 4. Stacking Benjamins \nJoe, the host of Stacking Benjamins , is a former financial planner. This helps considerably, because he does a great job of interviewing subjects who have gotten out of debt or have managed to build wealth. When you're not in the 1%, it sure seems really hard to do either of those, but listening to this podcast shows you that with careful planning and taking consistent baby steps, you can break the paycheck cycle, too. \nGood for : Personal finance stories and practical money advice. 5. Marketplace \nAre you a nerd for up-to-date financial intel? Marketplace is a great public radio podcast covering the major finance and business news of the day. Hear everything from stock ticker news, to announcements from big brands, to reports about housing and credit. Host Kai Ryssdal also brings experts onto the show for interviews. Also good is the lighter Marketplace Weekend podcast — perfect for listening while gardening on a lazy Sunday. \nGood for : Finance and business news and investment advice from experts. \nWhat are your favorite podcasts about money?
