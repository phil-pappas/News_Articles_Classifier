Nic Walker by Vesna Poljak Australia faces pressure to cut interest rates even if the domestic economy does not worsen, argues BNP Paribas' top foreign exchange strategist, because fellow commodity-bloc countries such as Norway and Canada are easing, risking leaving the Australian currency stranded atop its peers.\nThe Australian dollar has carved out new ground as a global middle-order currency after years of overachieving, joining Norway, Canada and New Zealand as Group of 10 economies that still command some yield, but are seeing this eroded through a reliance on rate cuts to stimulate slowing growth.\nPopulating the so-called bottom order are currencies such as the euro and Japanese yen, united by their ability to conduct monetary stimulus and rock bottom or negative interest rates.\nSteven Saywell, who is BNP Paribas' global head of foreign exchange, says China has changed the game with its readiness to devalue the yuan, setting off a chain of events not just in currencies but across bonds, commodities and equities too. Atop the G10 world sits US dollar and sterling, because the United States and the United Kingdom are both entering tightening cycles.\nMr Saywell said that pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates would intensify because of expectations that Canada and Norway have more to do. Regardless of what happens in the domestic economy, the case for a \"sympathy\" rate cut from the RBA will strengthen in the eyes of foreign investors who see significant similarities across the commodity economies. Canada and Norway have battled lower energy prices, while New Zealand has suffered through the collapse in dairy prices.\n\"If everyone is easing around you and you don't ease, that's a default hike,\" Mr Saywell said. He downgraded his view on Australia back in August when the People's Bank of China devalued the yuan in the face of a rallying US dollar.\n\"We are more bearish,\" Mr Saywell said. \"It's for all the commodity bloc. We think the renminbi is going to weaken and the Chinese will allow this to happen, this is going to put pressure on the commodity bloc generally and that includes Australia … I'd look at the RBA from a global perspective, not just what's going on here.\"\nRBA's more upbeat narrative The RBA has crafted a slightly more upbeat narrative on the Australian economy of late, as housing construction booms and the risk of rising unemployment is contained. It kept rates on hold at 2 per cent this week and the consensus of Australian economists is still that 2 per cent is the bottom. A minority of local economists share the view that the RBA has to cut rates 2016.\nMr Saywell argues that offshore observers of the Australian economy are not convinced it will be immune to the plight of other advanced commodity exporters. \"The perception is really quite bearish,\" he said. \"I would say the world does look at it as a bloc.\"\nThe course of global monetary policy for 2016 suggests that the battle for middle order currencies will be to avert a drop to the bottom order.\n\"Central banks that can ease are easing,\" Mr Saywell said.\nAs for the US and the UK, \"the next move's a hike and it's coming soon. Our view here is the Fed goes in March, but the UK is the really interesting one. I would argue there's more pressure on the Bank of England to hike than the Fed.\n\"The reason for this is they have a big similarity and a big difference. The big similarity is they both have very sharp falls in unemployment, the big difference here is the US has not yet seen wage inflation come through. The UK has. This means that the clock is ticking for the Bank of England where it's not ticking for the Fed.\"\nMarkets are not pricing in any hike for the BoE in 2016. BNP's view is that not only will BoE governor Mark Carney have to hike next year, but he may have to do it as soon as the first quarter.\n\"This raises the question, could the Bank of England go before the Fed?\"\nSleepless nights for policymakers Mr Saywell's optimistic expectations for sterling mean that £2.15 against the Australian dollar is a good entry point to capitalise on a return to the long-term trend of Australian dollar fetching between £2 and £3. \"As we go further and this cycle evolves we could go back to £2.50,\" he added.\nAgainst the US dollar, and if commodity prices stay the same, the Australian dollar should finish 2015 at US68¢. If there is a 20 per cent drop in commodity prices that points to the Australian dollar at US62.5¢.\nAs for China, BNP sees the yuan falling to around 6.80 to the US dollar in 12 months time, where one greenback buys 6.8 of the Chinese currency. That would represent a depreciation of only 10 per cent since August's drop.\n\"The reason they're doing this [devaluing] is they need to,\" he said. \"GDP is slowing, PMI [a measure of economic activity] is slowing and retail sales are slowing … What China is doing is allowing the currency to catch up to its neighbours\", which are more freely floated and have already depreciated against the US dollar.\nMr Saywell also sees the inflammatory rhetoric around China's currency strategy fading away because of the growing belief that what is in China's interest is also in the interest of most of the developed world.\n\"Now, China is causing sleepless nights for policymakers around the world from the US to Europe to Australia,\" he said. \"The US actually wants to see a Chinese recovery, which would help everybody.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:38:31.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
