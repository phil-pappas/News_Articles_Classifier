Brand X Pictures by Trish Power SMSF trustees can expect harsher fines from the 2015-16 year with administrative penalties of up to $10,800 per trustee (including corporate trustee) for a breach of the super rules.\nA SMSF trustee must run his or her super fund according to the superannuation rules. If a SMSF trustee breaks those super rules, financial penalties and other consequences may apply. When a SMSF trustee breaches certain super rules, the SMSF trustee can expect to be automatically hit with an administrative penalty ranging from $900, and up to $10,800, depending on the breach.\nAlthough the administrative penalty provisions imposing monetary fines have only been in place since July 2014, the government has already increased the size of the penalties for breaking the super rules, with some penalties increasing by hundreds of dollars.\nThe increase in the amount of the financial penalties, effective from 31 July 2015, relates to how the super laws stipulate the size of the financial penalties. For example, the penalty for breaching the borrowing rules within super is 60 penalty units. For the 2014-15 year, and also up to 30 July 2015, each penalty unit was worth $170. As a SMSF trustee, if you broke the super borrowing rules during the 2014-15 year, you could then be up for $10,200 as a financial penalty (60 times $170).\nEffective since 31 July 2015, the value of a penalty unit increased to $180, adding a further $600 to a fine based on 60 penalty units. Using the earlier example, as a SMSF trustee, if you broke the borrowing rules from August 2015 onwards, you can be fined $10,800 each for this same breach.\nAccording to the ATO, the value of a penalty unit will be increased every three years in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index, which means SMSF penalties will increase again from 1 July 2018.\nBad behaviour Administrative penalties apply to SMSF trustees for a long list of bad behaviour including:\n • failure to properly prepare financial accounts and statements (10 penalty units, or $1800 each)\n• failure to keep SMSF money separate from personal assets (20 penalty units, or $3600 each)\n• provision of loan to member or relative of members (60 penalty units, or $10,800 each)\n• failure to keep proper trustee minutes and records (10 penalty units, or $1800 each)\n• failure to sign the SMSF trustee declaration within 21 days of becoming a SMSF trustee (10 penalty units, or $1800).\nPersonal cost SMSF trustees need to be aware that the financial penalties cannot be paid from SMSF assets: instead the penalties are imposed on SMSF trustees directly and must be paid from personal savings.\nSince 1 July 2014, the ATO can also impose a \"rectification direction\" on a SMSF trustee, which requires the trustee to complete a specific action to fix the breach of the super rules within a specified timeframe. The third limb of the relatively new ATO powers involves mandatory SMSF trustee education. The ATO can issue an \"education direction\" forcing a SMSF trustee to attend an approved course within a specified timeframe.\nThe SMSF administrative penalties may seem hefty but the new regime of financial penalties and rectification and education orders is a more lenient approach than what was in place before July 2014.\nUntil 30 June 2014, the powers available to the ATO when punishing SMSF trustees, was limited and heavy-handed. A SMSF could potentially lose half of the fund's assets in the form of penalty tax, or the ATO could disqualify a person from acting as a SMSF trustee or the ATO could take a SMSF trustee to court which could mean a hefty fine or jail sentence. The hard-core penalty options are still available to the ATO, but since July 2014, the ATO can now also impose a range of financial penalties, or rectification or education orders.\nATO's approach In August 2015, ATO Commissioner for SMSFs, Kasey Macfarlane, spoke at a conference explaining how the ATO will impose the SMSF administrative and other penalties. Ms Macfarlane used the example of when a SMSF trustee lent SMSF money to a fund member or a relative of a fund member, which is a serious breach of the super rules.\nIn such an instance, where the SMSF trustee is a corporate trustee, the directors of the corporate trustee are \"jointly and severally liable to pay the penalty\" for the breach. According to Ms Macfarlane, what this means is that the ATO may collect the entire penalty amount from only one of the directors, or any of the directors, until the penalty is fully paid.\nIf the SMSF involved in the breach has individual trustees, then each trustee is required to pay the fine. For example, where a SMSF has breached the lending rules, and the SMSF has four individual trustees, then each of the four SMSF trustees is liable to pay a $10,800 fine, totalling $43,200. Again, noting that the penalty must be paid from personal savings, rather than SMSF assets.\nThe ATO may consider remitting the penalty taking into account the compliance history of the SMSF, and any rectification action by the SMSF trustees, and any other relevant circumstances. Ms Macfarlane warned however that as the ATO audits more SMSFs, she expects more SMSF administrative penalties to be imposed in the next 18 months, with requests for remission to be denied where non-compliance is serious, or the request relates to repeated compliance breaches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:06:30.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
