As required by the Exchange Act, the Rule generally requires, for nonexempt assets, that sponsors[2] retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk of any securitization and prohibits them from directly or indirectly hedging or transferring such retained credit risk. The Rule is meant to ensure that sponsors have “skin in the game \nExemption for Securitizations of Qualified Residential Mortgages \nHas a term shorter than 30 years; Has total points and fees that are not excessive; Has no risky features, such as negative amortization, interest-only or balloon payment features; Has adequate documentation of the borrowers income and assets; Has an annual percentage rate above a certain threshold; and Meets one of the following three characteristics: (1) the monthly loan payment, plus the borrower’s other debt payments, does not exceed 43 percent of the borrower \nNeither the QRM definition nor the QM definition incorporates a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio requirement or standards related to the borrowers credit history. When the Rule was passed, the agencies noted that they were aligning the QRM definition with the QM definition to minimize additional regulatory burdens and compliance costs and facilitate the return of private capital to the mortgage market. \nThe QRM exemption also requires that the depositor provide a certification stating that it has evaluated the effectiveness of its internal supervisory controls and determined that those controls are sufficient to ensure that all assets collateralizing the RMBS are QRMs. The evaluation and determination must be done, for each issuance of RMBS that relies on the QRM exemption, within 60 days of the cutoff date for the relevant securitization. The sponsor must then present a copy of the certification to potential investors prior to the sale of the RMBS. The certification must also be presented upon request to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, FDIC, OCC or SEC. \nRisk Retention Methods: Vertical, Horizontal or a Combination \nIf no exemption is available, the Rule requires that an eligible entity retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of any asset that the securitizer, through the issuance of a security, transfers, sells or conveys to a third party. “Credit risk” is (1) the risk of loss that could result from the failure of the borrower to make required payments on a timely basis or from the borrowers bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding; or (2) the effect that significant changes in the underlying credit quality of the asset or RMBS interest may have on the market value of the asset or the RMBS interest. \nCredit risk can be held either through an eligible vertical interest, an eligible horizontal residual interest or a combination of vertical and horizontal interests.[4] The percentage of any such interests must be determined as of the closing date of the securitization. \nAn “eligible vertical interest is defined as either (1) a single vertical security entitling the holder to the same percentage of amounts paid on each class; or (2) an interest in each class of RMBS interests constituting the same proportion of each class. \nAn “eligible horizontal residual interest is an interest in a single class or multiple classes that represents the most subordinate claim to payments of both principal and interest by the issuing entity (with the exception of any non-economic REMIC residual interest). Such horizontal interest must absorb any shortfalls in interest or principal before those shortfalls are allocated to any other classes. As opposed to vertical interests, where the 5 percent slice must be 5 percent of the aggregate interest of the issuer, the 5 percent for horizontal interests must be 5 percent of the fair value of all RMBS interests issued, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). \nIn lieu of retaining any or all of the eligible horizontal residual interest, the sponsor may also establish and fund an “eligible horizontal cash reserve account” (“reserve account) in an amount equal to the fair value of the eligible horizontal residual interest. Amounts in the reserve account, which are to be held in cash or cash equivalents, are to be used only to satisfy payments on RMBS interests on any payment date when the issuing entity has insufficient funds or to pay critical expenses of the trust on any payment date when the issuing entity has insufficient funds. The amounts in the reserve account must be held until all interests of the issuer are paid in full or until the issuer is dissolved. \nDisclosure Regarding Risk Retention Method \nWhether a sponsor chooses to retain the risk vertically or horizontally, it is required to disclose certain information prior to the sale of RMBS. Such disclosure requirements are more onerous for the retention of any eligible horizontal residual interest and require the disclosure of a sponsor \nParties Eligible to Hold Credit Risk \nThe retained credit risk may be wholly retained by a sponsor or one of a sponsor’s majority-owned or wholly-owned affiliates, and it may be partially retained by an originator. A “sponsor” is defined as “a person ” If there is more than one sponsor, it is the responsibility of each sponsor to a securitization to ensure that at least one of the sponsors or their affiliates retains the required credit risk. \nAny risk retention allocated to a majority-owned or wholly-owned affiliate of a sponsor or to an originator reduces the sponsor’s risk retention requirement proportionally. A “majority-owned affiliate”’s affiliate may hold. \nAn “originator”’s assets in the securitization divided by all assets in the securitization). Further, the originator must acquire the eligible interest from the sponsor at the closing and must retain the interest in the same manner and proportion as the sponsor. The originator must also comply with the same transfer and hedging restrictions as the sponsor. \nIf an originator retains risk, the sponsor has certain disclosure and monitoring responsibilities. A reasonable time prior to the sale of RMBS, the sponsor must disclose the originator holding the risk, the form, amount and nature of the risk held by such originator and the method of payment for the risk. Further, the sponsor is responsible for monitoring the originator and ensuring t \nWhile it is appealing that the Rule allows multiple parties to hold credit risk, ultimately it seems unlikely that originators will play a significant role in such retention on RMBS transactions, given the additional burdens (regulatory, valuation or otherwise), the general ease of selling the loan in its entirety and other reasons. \nHedging, Transfer and Financing Prohibitions \n’ \nIn practice, it may be difficult for entities with limited lifespans, such as hedge funds, to comply with these transfer and hedging restrictions. \n\nIn addition to the QRM exemption, certain other types of securitizations are exempted from the risk retention requirement. Exemptions most relevant to RMBS include the exemptions for: ations backed solely by seasoned loans; U.S. government securitizations; Foreign securitizations; Securitizations backed solely by community-focused residential mortgages (e.g., loans made through state housing agency programs); and Certain ” \nExemption for securitizations of seasoned loans \nSecuritizations that are backed solely by seasoned loans are exempted from the risk retention requirements. Under the Rule, a seasoned loan \n\nFurther, the Rule exempts certain securitizations insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government. First, securitizations in which Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or any successor to such entities acts as a sponsor and fully guarantees the timely payment on all RMBS interests issued are exempt from the risk retention requirement. However, the exemption only applies for so long as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and their successor are operating under conservatorship or receivership of the FHFA or with capital support of the U.S. government. Second, securitizations of residential, mult The securitization is not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933; No more than 10 percent by dollar value of all securitization interests are transferred to U.S. persons; No more than 25 percent of the assets for the securitization were acquired from an affiliate or branch of the sponsor organized or located in the U.S. \nObservations and Conclusions", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:30:58.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
