The ground rules have been put in place to ensure that come the end 2016, phase one of the electricity market would be launched,' she added. \nThe regional market rules also addresses the market design and phases for the regional market and specifies clearly the role of market participants and other stakeholders. \nSecretary General of WAPP, Siengui Apollinaire, who was elected in May, disclosed that his visit was aimed at meeting some Ghanaian partners of WAPP like GRIDCO, among others. \n'ERERA is a strategic partner of WAPP because it is the body that will regulate the electricity sector in our ECOWAS region. We discussed some issues concerning our work and I have also been given an approved document called the rule of the market,' he said. \nBy Nii Ogbamey Tetteh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:07:56.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
