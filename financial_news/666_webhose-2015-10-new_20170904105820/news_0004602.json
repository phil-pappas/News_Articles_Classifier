Resources and energy stocks in Europe took their cue from China's weakness and were among the biggest losers in early trading.\nIn bonds, the cautious mood made for slightly lower yields, while commodities prices fell - copper futures were down 1 percent and crude oil futures were down more then 1 percent.\n\"This is a response to the late sell-off in China,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London.\n\"It was reminiscent of the kind of heavy selling that we saw back in August when emerging market concerns were very high, which in turn weighed on sentiment in Europe,\" he said.\nIn early trading the FTSEuroFirst index of leading 300 European shares was down two thirds of one percent at 1,423 points. Pearson and Credit Suisse were the two biggest losers, down 14 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.\nGermany's DAX was down 0.2 percent, France's CAC 40 was down 0.5 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.3 percent.\nIn Asia MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.3 percent.\nIn Japan, the slowest growth in exports in over a year fuelled talk of recession but the prospect of more stimulus from the Bank of Japan lifted the Nikkei 225 by almost 2 percent to 18.554 points.\n($1 = 0.9534 Swiss francs) (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Jermey Gaunt; To read Reuters Global Investing Blog click here ; for the MacroScope Blog click on blogs.reuters.com/macroscope ; for Hedge Fund Blog Hub click on blogs.reuters.com/hedgehub )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:28:45.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
