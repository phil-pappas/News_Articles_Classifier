An October hike seems to be off the table,\" he added. \nOn Friday, Wall Street stocks climbed despite a report showing that the United States added just 142,000 jobs in September, well below expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.2 per cent higher. \nIn the local market, volumes are expected to be lower on account of a public holiday in NSW. \n\"Whether or not these gains can be sustained, we will have to see, but we should end higher,\" Mr Conway said. \nShares in mining stocks led the gains on Monday.

Commonwealth Bank was up $1.07 to $74.46, Westpac added 40 cents at $30.15, NAB gained 47 cents to $30.57 and ANZ rose 30 cents at $27.23. \nMeanwhile, data showed that services sector activity has risen for the fourth month in a row, helped by the falling Australian dollar and record low interest rates. \nKEY FACTS \n* At 1035 AEDT on Monday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 82 points, or 1.61 per cent, at 5,134 points. \n* The broader All Ordinaries index was up 78 points, or 1.53 per cent, at 5,167 points. \n* The December share price index futures contract was up 83 points at 5,114 points, with 10,248 contracts traded. \n* National turnover was 207.76 million securities worth $356.85 million. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Aust shares open higher AAP \nThe Australian share market has opened one per cent higher.
