He noted that 5 million to 6 million square feet of commercial space hit the market this year in Houston as rents trended down. \nAnother panelist, Kenneth Rosen, chairman of Rosen Consulting Group, said the energy belt has a \"digestive issue\" and warned investors to avoid Houston. \nThis week's oil-price spurt didn't seem to change panelists' dubious views on energy's impact. \nDallas-Fort Worth, which boasts a more diversified economy, replaced Houston as the top 2016 market by survey respondents, rising from fifth place in last year's survey. Austin was No. 2, the same as last year, as tech companies continued to draw job seekers. \n\"There's a shuffling of the deck in the top 10,\" said panelist Mary Ludgin, director of global investment research at Heitman, a real-estate investment management firm. Pointing to Dallas' rise to the top of the pack, she noted that it led the U.S. in job growth over the last five years, with some 480,000 new jobs. \nIn its report on emerging markets, the ULI noted that Dallas-Fort Worth's \"impressive employment growth\" is behind the area's rise to the top of this year's survey, supported by a \"business-friendly environment\" and relatively low cost of living. \nThe latest survey put New York at No. 15, Boston in 13th place and Washington D.C. and northern Virginia at Nos. 21 and 22, respectively. San Francisco was still in the top 10, at No. 8, but down from its third-place ranking in last year's survey. Another major gateway city, Los Angeles, was No. 10, followed by Raleigh-Durham, N.C., which made it into the top 10 last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:19:45.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
