Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index SPX, +0.13% members will likely report third-quarter profits that are down 4% — but that’s driven entirely by a 60% drop in profits for members of the S&P in the energy business, according to S&P Capital IQ. \nTake them out, and profits will actually rise by 3% or 4%, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Capital IQ.\nThis is exactly the opposite of what happened in the second half of 2009, the last time profits dropped for two straight quarters, says John Butters, senior earnings analyst at market-data firm FactSet. Back then, yes, financial companies’ profits dropped 27% in the second quarter and 15% in the third as Wall Street’s woes hurt everyone. But the rest of the S&P 500 saw profits drop 29%, followed by 21%. Big difference from now.\nAnd lest one conclude falling profits herald recession or a bear market, consider that the market jumped 29% from the June 30, 2009, (the end of the second quarter) through April 30, 2010. And that the recession ended in — drumroll, please — June 2009.\nYes, energy is terrible, and is pushing manufacturing-sensitive indicators to places we’d rather not see them go. The ISM manufacturing index, colloquially ( but not accurately ) thought to signal a recession in manufacturing if it goes below 50, was at 50.1 in September, and some regional manufacturing indices are worse. The strong dollar DXY, -0.08% is pushing down both export sales and the reported profit on what sales do happen — if you’re paid in euros EURUSD, +0.3257% , each translates into fewer dollars.\nSo this U.S. economy does have weak spots — one reason the Federal Reserve hasn’t raised interest rates yet (and why the proportion of energy and materials stocks reflected in an index fund is probably enough for most of us to play that anticipated, but hard-to-time, rebound). And despite Fed officials who continue to hint that rates will rise this year, they should wait for March. \nBut the economy’s strengths are greater.\nBegin with the pickup in consumer spending this year. Long the underperformer in this recovery, real consumer spending has risen at a 3.4% annual clip for the last five quarters. (Are we sure Jeb! hasn’t been elected yet? ) That’s driving 12% profit gains in consumer cyclicals this quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ, meaning positive news is coming (which may already be reflected in stock prices) from companies such as Disney DIS, +0.75% and UnderArmour UA, +1.01% .\nConsumer confidence and the Affordable Care Act are driving a 7% gain in health-care profits, and telecom profits are expected to rise 9.5%. So names like HCA HCA, -0.15% and Lifepoint Hospitals LPNT, +0.94% should do nicely, along with Polycom PLCM, +0.86% and Cisco Systems CSCO, +0.18% .\nWhen you go below the top corporate names, earnings news improves. Mid-cap companies will see profits jump 40% — no misprint — and small caps are set for a 18% gain, each after a big second-quarter drop, Capital IQ says. \nAnd remember, all of these gains come from the historically high corporate profits we’ve seen since the recession.\nSo, calm down. \nBond defaults may rise next year , but they’re at half of historic levels and the economy can absorb it. Pundits and brokers may throw click-bait faux hissy fits about junk-bond issuance declining, but the same sites spent years flacking Bill Gross’ arguments that the market has been too willing to buy junk and everything else. Both can’t be problems. \nProfits may grow more slowly thanks to oil, or even shrink a little this year, but by next spring comparisons in energy will be easy. Consensus forecasts call for energy-industry profits to be rising again by then, like corporate profits as a whole. The unemployment rate will be 4-point-something percent, and the Fed will raise the fed funds rate for the first time in a decade. \nThen someone will put out a report that this means disaster, just as people are putting out reports claiming Saudi Arabia won this year’s oil-price war. Markets are noisy. So?\nCredit tightening is supposed to happen in an improving economy, albeit one still straining fully to reclaim its health. And it is. Deal with it. Buy a car. Everyone else is. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:33:45.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
