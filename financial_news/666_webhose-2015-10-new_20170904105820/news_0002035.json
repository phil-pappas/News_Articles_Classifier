Being a high-minded media organization, we will avoid any of the obvious jokes that come with delivering fewer inches than advertised. Suffice it to say that Subway left many customers unsatisfied after it promised a sandwich a a true foot in length, only to disappoint inside the wrapper. \nThe lawsuit alleged deceptive marketing on the part of the company and included both 12-inch and 6-inch subs, the latter being a perfectly normal size and every bit as popular with the customers as footlongs. In fact many customers complain that the footlongs are too much to eat at one sitting and actually prefer the far more manageable 6-inch sub regardless of what you see on TV. \nUnfortunately for consumers, Subway’s problems aren’t unique or even all that uncommon in the marketplace. Companies pretty regularly try to mess around on the margins, knowing that while an inch here or a handful of chips there isn’t a big deal to an individual, it can actually make a huge difference when spread across the bottom line. That extra inch of bread (and sauce and cheese and lettuce) adds up.
