(NYSE: N), the industry’s leading provider of cloud -based financials / ERP and omnichannel commerce software suites, today announced that Secrid, the award winning designer and manufacturer of privacy protecting wallets, has implemented NetSuite to support its rapid business growth – having doubled sales year-over-year, expanded sales to 3,000 wholesalers and distributors, and grown to 12 warehouses in the last two years. NetSuite replaced a combination of Lightspeed and complex Excel spreadsheets, which the business had been built on, but could no longer cope with the volume of Secrid’s business and the complexity of its supply chain. Secrid is now depending on NetSuite to manage its mission-critical business operations including financials, order management, inventory management , assembly, demand planning, procure-to-pay, production control and shipping – all on one unified cloud business management platform. With NetSuite, Secrid is able to scale its business as it grows; gain the visibility into warehouse stock at each manufacturing stage for better cost control; and achieve a 360-degree view of customers for better customer support and service. In addition, NetSuite’s SuiteCloud Development Platform gives Secrid powerful customisation tools to tailor the system to its specific workflows and business needs. Unique in designing, sourcing materials and manufacturing in the Netherlands, Secrid ( www.secrid.com ) has a multi-site, multi-vendor manufacturing process, feeding online retail, direct and indirect trade sales to 3,000 wholesalers and distributors around the world. Yet, Secrid’s existing business systems could not support its rapid growth. The company struggled with separate systems for financials and sales orders, creating a lack of visibility into inventory across its 12 warehouses throughout the Netherlands and forcing personnel to manually move data. Two years ago, Secrid began a project to implement Odoo as a replacement for its existing system but terminated the project before going live due to issues with stability, data imports and spiralling implementation costs. Secrid then started to implement Infor LN, but grew concerned by the system’s potential and frustrated by costly configuration charges leading them to cancel the project two weeks before go live. After further research Secrid evaluated Sage, Exact/TradeCloud, SAP, ECi M1, Microsoft Dynamics and NetSuite. “We wanted a system with its roots in 2015, not the 1980’s, and one which put us in control,” said Paul van Diepen, COO. “We needed a platform for growth that would inspire us to do more with our systems. We could not afford to be restricted by our ERP system. It had to fit our business, not the other way round. We chose NetSuite for its flexibility, agility, and for the possibilities it offers us as we grow.” With NetSuite, Secrid is now able to deliver new ways of working with partners and free capacity to focus on its core business objectives. NetSuite’s cloud-based system with anytime, anywhere access lets Secrid’s suppliers access the system to give instant visibility into the supply chain. Additionally, NetSuite’s demand planning capabilities help to create weekly transfer orders between locations, while NetSuite’s Work Orders and Assembly functionality streamline production. After a rapid, two-month implementation by the Secrid team and Netherlands-based NetSuite Solution Provider, E–Litt, Secrid has achieved its planned process improvements and gained numerous benefits including: A single view of the truth – By uniting its business processes onto a single end-to-end platform, Secrid has gained transparency that has driven more cooperation between teams and streamlined its critical business processes. Executives now have real-time visibility into the entire business, which previously was impossible between their other software systems. Operational efficiency – Eliminating manual steps across all roles enable faster manufacturing, closing of books, completion of shipping and sales order processing. Scalability – Secrid can now provide instant access to NetSuite to its rapidly expanding network of suppliers for material orders and processing, improving visibility and efficiency across the entire supply chain. Improved customer service – NetSuite’s complete view of the business enables Secrid to implement case management to ensure it maintains consistently high levels of customer service as it continues to grow. Custom functionality – The NetSuite SuiteCloud Development Platform provides Secrid with the flexibility and agility to develop custom built solutions to meet current and future industry specific business needs. Untapped functionality – Secrid is already doing more with NetSuite than it expected in January 2015, having repeatedly identified additional useful functionality in the suite, which could simply be enabled to solve problems at hand. For example, Secrid is now trialling portal access to the system for their sales agents – to enable self-service. “I am always blown away by the possibilities of NetSuite. I ask myself ‘How do I solve this?’ and realise that I have options A,B,C & D, then just have to pick which is right for us. The flexible workflows blew us away – they helped us, as non-programmers, to do pretty advanced configurations, which help us work better. It is now more fun to work in our office – there is less of the boring stuff to do and that lets us grow. NetSuite is a beautiful platform,” said Thomas Boogert, ERP & ICT Manager for Secrid. Secrid will be joining NetSuite CEO Zach Nelson during the keynote at NetSuite’s Cloud Tour Europe in London today to share their incredible story of innovation and business growth.
