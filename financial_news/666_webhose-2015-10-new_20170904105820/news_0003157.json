Symphony did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nMany on Wall Street think of Symphony as a rival to Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, which provide messaging and information services for bankers, traders and investors. \nThose terminals can cost tens of thousands of dollars per year for each customer. \nSymphony is available to businesses with more than 50 users for $15 per user per month. Smaller businesses and individuals can use the tool for free. \nLast month, Symphony said it was working with News Corp (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) 's Dow Jones to offer news stories in its service and with McGraw Hill Financial (NYSE: MHFI - news ) to integrate data and analytics from its S&P Capital IQ product.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:53:01.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
