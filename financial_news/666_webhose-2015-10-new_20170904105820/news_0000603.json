Now they have experienced the Mara, wonder Mombasa, and the other places on our package. Now we would not push them to sell the destinations to their clients. \nPlans for Ghanaian airline market He said Kenya Airways has always had a wonderful relationship with Ghana. \n'We have special routes just for traders. Also we are trying to improve and expand more trader routes. We are also trying as much as possible to engage the corporates even more with the our new wonderful project - KQ Hot Deals - where we are encouraging more and more people especially our corporate clientele to book earlier so they can save on costs. That means that they can now expand their budget and make much more profits for themselves.' \nThe African vision Tourism is one of the important sectors of Kenya's economy and Kenya Airways (KQ), which is the national carrier, is to connect people from all over the world to Nairobi and other parts of Africa. \n'However, we are not only promoting destination Kenya but also destination Africa. KQ's key role is to continue giving reliable services so it can bring people from all over the world to experience the rich heritage of Africa.' \nNew routes Kenya Airways just started Hanoi from Nairobi but also connects from all other places. \n'Kenya is the home of African tourism. Beyond Kenya too, we have holiday packages to Zanzibar, Seychelles, Mauritius and so many African countries. Additionally, for those who would want to go outside Africa, we have Dubai, Hanoi and etc. \nKenya Airways is in partnership with the Kenya Tourist Board and Destination Kenya's marketing body called 'Magical' Kenya. 'A few weeks back, we brought Magical Kenya and KTB to Ghana and linked them to the Ghana Tourist Board so they can work together. If tourist authorities in the countries should promote their own destinations, we will partner them to further push it.' \nFounded in January 1977, the airline, whose main hub is the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, has 44 aircraft plus two which are on order. \nBy Samuel Boadi, Courtesy of Kenya Airways", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:02:46.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
