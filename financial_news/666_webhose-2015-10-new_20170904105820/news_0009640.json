Bloomberg by Jonathan Barrett An anticipated fall in iron ore prices is expected to heap pressure on Australia's precarious budget position that is already subjected to weak oil, base metal and, in some cases, declining rural commodity prices.\nA Department of Industry, Innovation and Science report expects recent iron ore price stability will soon give way to further declines in the price of the key steel making ingredient and crucial Australian export.\nThe Department's Resources and Energy Quarterly has forecast a 3 per cent decline in the iron ore (freight on board) price by the end of the calendar year, to $US51.\n\"The recent price stability is forecast to be temporary as ongoing increases in supply and the onset of winter in the Northern hemisphere, which affects construction, is expected to weigh down the price in the December quarter 2015,\" the September quarterly report said.\n\"For 2015 as a whole, the price is forecast to average $US53 (FOB), down 40 per cent on the average recorded in 2014.\"\nDespite trading at around one-third of the spot price reached during the boom – spot prices are higher than FOB, which do not include transport and loading costs – a recent lift in the iron ore price has helped many mines remain viable.\nThe report does forecast a price lift in 2017 to US$57.70 as demand increases and supply growth slows.\n\"Increasing supply, predominantly from Australia, is forecast to drive prices down in 2015 and 2016 in the seaborne market,\" the report said. \"Over the medium term prices are projected to rebound as higher cost producers exit the market and world steel production growth rebounds.\"\n George Cheveley, a London-based portfolio manager for Investec Asset Management, said the outlook for commodities was better than the \"bearish macro view\" that had led to a sell-down of resources stocks.\n\"US demand is okay without being as high as expected, while Europe is on an okay footing after a disappointing two or three years,\" Mr Cheveley said.\n\"Emerging markets again, while not great, are okay and even China isn't that bad, as we have seen improvements in the second half of the year. China is in fact much healthier than you might have thought.\"\nFalling coal prices have pushed the Reserve Bank of Australia's monthly commodity price index down to near 10-year lows , days before an interest rate decision.\nThe commodity index, which includes oil, base metals and rural commodities, fell 1 per cent in September, representing a third consecutive monthly decline. It is at the lowest level since June 2006 on SDR terms (Special Drawing Rights – an International Monetary Fund measure used by central banks).\nThe commodity price movements negatively affect the country's terms of trade – the ratio of export prices to import prices – which undermines income flowing to individuals, companies and Australian governments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:50:02.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
