We believe this is one of those moments that we’ll look back on as we evaluate the impact investing movement and the growing focus on business and investing as a force for good.When the US National Advisory Board on Impact Investing, on which I have the privilege to serve, issued its report – Private Capital, Public Good – more than a year ago, we zeroed in on a number of key policy changes that we believed could significantly increase the amount of capital available for socially responsible business. One of those policy changes centered around clarifying guidance issued by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) — which sets standards for private pension and health plans that protect investors’ money – to allow pension fund managers to consider social and environmental returns in addition to financial returns. Yesterday, the U.S. Department of Labor, led by Secretary Tom Perez, announced exactly that policy change . Pension Funds And Socially Responsible Investing: A (Very) Brief History The primary goal of ERISA is to protect investors’ money in private pension and health plans, and ERISA was enacted to ensure that managers of these funds strictly prioritize responsible growth of the assets they oversee. Millions of Americans rely on their retirement income to live, and creating a legal requirement of “fiduciary duty” from pension fund managers to their investors was a huge step forward to ensure the safety of the investors' nest eggs.There have been a few updates to ERISA over the years. The Department of Labor, which regulates ERISA, released guidance in 1994 that said that pension plans could consider economic, environmental and other concerns, so long as their investment choices were expected to provide the same level of risk and return as the alternatives. This opened up a door for pension funds to consider what we now call ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues when making decisions.However, in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis, the Department of Labor changed the guidance and said that plan managers could no longer make investment decisions based on any factor outside of the economic interest of the plan. This new guidance made pension managers wary of considering anything but financial return in their investment decisions, and it has kept a significant source of funds out of play for socially responsible investments. Pension Fund Managers Can Now Meet The Marketplace Yesterday, the Department of Labor issued new guidance that repeals the 2008 guidance and reinstates the 1994 guidance that allows, when all other factors are equal, fund managers to consider economic, environmental and other concerns in their investment decisions. In other words, social benefit can serve as a “tiebreaker” when evaluating two investment opportunities that present the same potential for financial return. As Secretary Perez said in his press conference, if an opportunity has the potential to produce a social benefit, that shouldn’t be a strike against it (as it was under the 2008 guidance).Why is this announcement such a big deal? First, private pension plans governed by ERISA manage about $8.4 trillion in assets—a market-moving amount of money. Second, we have seen what the power of a change in ERISA can do. In 1978, the Department of Labor relaxed the ERISA prohibition on pension fund investments into privately held companies that had been in place since the law was enacted. As a result, private pension fund investments into venture capital firms grew from $39 million in 1977 to $570 million in 1978 – more than a tenfold increase in one year. The change in ERISA effectively launched the industry, and pension funds today are actually the largest source of funding for venture capital.The announcement is also a big deal because it recognizes that our standards for investing have changed fairly dramatically over the past 10 years. As the preamble to the new guidance states, it is now accepted practice for fiduciaries to consider the long-term impacts of their investments on the environment and on society, in addition to the potential short-term financial returns.Of course, a change in guidance won’t move billions of dollars right away. There is much work to do to educate pension fund managers and their investors on the new opportunities to support socially responsible business. But, there is also now much more widely available data on the financial returns that are possible from a range of socially responsible investments. There are also more investment products available that have a track record of consistently delivering market-rate financial returns from socially responsible investments. This will be helpful as private pension managers consider their new options. Momentum Is Building Today’s ERISA announcement comes on the heels of another piece of guidance that will enable more capital to be directed toward socially responsible investments. Last month, the U.S. Treasury Department issued new guidelines for foundations that wish to make impact investments out of their endowments. Much like the ERISA guidance, the new language from Treasury clarifies that foundations may consider impact of an investment on their mission and their values. It also comes after some notable commitments from the private sector—from respected companies like BlackRock and Bain Capital to large foundations like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the McKnight Foundation.I salute the Department of Labor for its leadership in allowing the potential for significant new capital to flow to socially responsible investments. Its leadership is a great example of how government, recognizing it can’t solve all of our problems on its own, can remove barriers and provide incentives to the private sector to mobilize more capital toward social good.", "external_links": ["http://www.nabimpactinvesting.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/thomas-e-perez/best-interests-better-out_b_8357094.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:15:27.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
