Investors in a bond maturing Oct. 13 will receive similar terms, while other bondholders are being offered a share of a series of nine new bonds.\nThe group’s endorsement removes one of the last obstacles to Ukraine’s debt restructuring as new terms agreed after five months of negotiations are put to the vote on Oct. 14. The eastern-European nation’s bonds have rallied more than 20 cents on the dollar since a Franklin Templeton-led creditor group, which holds about half of the government’s notes, approved the terms in August. The deal has since been endorsed by money managers including from Pioneer Investments and Aberdeen Asset Management Plc.\n\"It’s a done deal,\" said Gintaras Shlizhyus, a Vienna-based strategist at Raiffeisen Bank International AG. \"The agreement on the shorter maturities has substantially decreased the possibility of holdouts.\"\nPassing the deal without holdouts will help the war-ravaged country meet its obligations under a $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan that requires a reduction to its external debt burden. The terms include a 20 percent writedown to the principal value of the bonds, higher average interest payments and warrants tied to gross domestic product growth.\nFor the bonds to be restructured, 75 percent of the investors need to vote in favor at next week’s meeting in which two thirds of the creditors are represented. If quorum isn’t met at a first meeting, a second meeting can be called after two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:06:31.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
