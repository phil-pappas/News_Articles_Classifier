Perkins loans expired in the Fall of 2014, but got a year-long reprieve by Congress. \nThe House of Representatives, where the GOP has a majority, actually gave Perkins a majority on Tuesday. But the Senate, where Republicans are also in control, did not go along. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee, has called for the program's shut down as part of an effort to simplify and streamline the Federal government’s student loan programs.
