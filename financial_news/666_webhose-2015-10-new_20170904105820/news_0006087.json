You are able to use a market which is massively oversupplied and drive the bargain down. Once you do that, it improves your profitability,\" co-chief financial officer V. Srikanth told reporters. \n\"We remain pretty constructive on refining.\" \nReliance shook off an impairment of 26.6 billion rupees ($410.9 million) in shale gas assets, offsetting it with the sale of its investment in a U.S. shale gas joint venture. \nThe company, which generates the bulk of its revenue from refining and petrochemicals, has been expanding into consumer businesses such as retail and telecoms to aid growth. It has spent more than $14 billion to date on telecoms alone, and is spreading into fashion, grocery and online banking. \nReliance's telecoms business is building India's biggest fourth-generation (4G) broadband network and plans a December launch for its Jio brand. \nIt said on Friday it had the network in place and had thousands of professionals testing the system, covering a million kilometres a day. \n\"We now have close to 10,000 testers in the field, and this is getting enhanced,\" said Anshuman Thakur, a former investment banker who joined Reliance to advise on telecoms strategy. \nThe company's retail division will also sell its own brand of 4G LTE smartphones under the brand name LYF, pronounced \"life\". \nReliance said it was in talks with five manufacturers to manufacture the phones, which would be priced \"from premium to affordable\", at as little as 4,000 rupees, and will eventually be made in India. \nCash-rich Reliance's entry into the crowded telecoms sector poses a potential threat for established players such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone's local unit. \nFor India's thriving e-commerce players, however, the arrival of 4G is expected to galvanise business. This includes a new generation of niche banks, including Reliance's own venture. \n\"All of the services we are offering, there are synergies, so we try and roll them out close together,\" said Thakur, referring to retail, banking and other services. \n($1 = 64.8550 Indian rupees)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:05:35.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
