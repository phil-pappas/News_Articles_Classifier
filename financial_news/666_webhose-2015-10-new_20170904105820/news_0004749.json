A branded email id like yourname@yourbusiness.com helps to create the right first impression of your business. A generic email id from a free, web-based email service may raise doubts about your credentials, while a branded email id conveys seriousness about your business. A branded email id with the right domain extension like .COM or .NET stands for credibility and reliability.\nThis is not the only reason. There are many more reasons for small businesses or Small Offices / Home Offices (SOHO) to choose branded email ids.\nEasy set up. In order to get started with a branded email id, all you need is a registered domain name. You do not need to have a website to get your branded email id enabled. This means you don’t have to worry about generating content or maintaining a full website.\nThere is near-unanimity amongst small businesses about branded email lending credibility to their business. Nevertheless, as many as 6 out of 10 (63%) of those without branded email are not even aware that they can get one even if they do not have a website for their company.\nSimple Migration . You may have been using a generic email id for years. However, migrating to a branded email id is simple. Most professional email service providers have easy tools and assistance to move old emails, folders, contacts and calendar entries to the new branded email platform. It is also possible to ensure that any emails coming to your generic email id are automatically forwarded to your branded email id. So you do not lose any emails, old or new.\nSecurity . It is common sense to not allow access to business data to those outside the company network. For example, when an employee leaves a company and the email service being used is a generic one, the employee may continue to get external emails that are meant for the company. Thus, posing the risk of confidential information falling into the wrong hands and perhaps, even losing potential business. With a business or professional email service, it is easy to centrally disable business email ids thereby minimizing the risk of data leakage.\nGreat start to online presence. Not only does a branded email id show the world that you are credible but it also is an easy way to start building your company’s online presence. Today the world is becoming increasingly reliant on the Internet. Thus, having an online presence has become a no brainer.\nChoosing the right domain name is a crucial part of getting a branded email id. The domain extension (i.e., what appears to the right of the dot, such as .COM or .NET) is as important to your business as the name of your brand, product or service that appears to the left of the dot. For more than two decades, .COM and .NET have been the domain extensions of choice because they have global recognition and stand for security, reliability and credibility.\nA simple and effective way to look professional in your prospective customers’ eyes is to use a branded email id. Moreover, using a branded email id also means that you are promoting your business or brand every time you send an email using that email id. It is additional brand viewership. So why pass up that chance? Get your branded email id today. And the first step is to register your .COM or .NET domain name.\nSanjay Bhatia, President, FICCI-CMSME\n 13, 2015 1:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:39:06.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
