The landmark case dates back to December 2012, when lawyer Richard Spoor filed a motion and supporting paperwork requesting class certification of more than 15 000 prospective class members, it reported. Matsolo said they would have several awareness campaigns during the court case. \"Today [Monday] we stood in front of the Johannesburg High Court to show solidarity and support for the mineworkers and their families. \"We are also hosting an exhibition... at the Methodist Church opposite the High Court in Johannesburg. There, we will have pictures of the miners who are suffering from this disease, which we took of them in their homes in the Eastern Cape. \"We also have a simulated mine which we hope will give viewers an idea of what it feels like to work underground and the dangerous conditions faced by mineworkers,\" Matsolo said. He said the exhibition would also play a recording of one of the miners who currently had difficulty breathing. Matsolo said they had incurred numerous challenges with the police and mining companies who had tried to take away their posters. He said complainants wanted civil damages for breaches of statutory, constitutional and common law duties by the gold mining companies.
