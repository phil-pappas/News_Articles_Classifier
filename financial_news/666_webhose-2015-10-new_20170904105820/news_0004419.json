Photo: Carla Gottgens\nIt's understandable that mum-and-dad shareholders get frustrated at this time of year as annual general meetings roll on and they witness executive underperformance often so richly rewarded.\nThe Myer annual report that on Monday revealed the previous chief executive, Bernie Brookes, walked away this year with $4.3 million is a case in point.\nTo the fair part of this final payout – $1.55 million – was a termination benefit but even if you ignore that amount his pay in 2015 included a 27 per cent jump in his base salary.\nNot only is Myer a company that has posted falling profits for years – in 2011 it earned $162.7 million against $77.5 million in 2015; the annual report tells us that in the current year it expects to earn less again – $64 million to $72 million.\nAdvertisement And this doesn't include the implementation costs associated with a large overhaul of the business.\nThere will be significant items associated with this transformation that will cost $35 million to $45 million, and about $100 million to $120 million in capital expenditure.\nSure, Brookes had to deal with some lean years in retail after the global financial crisis and a generally lacklustre retail environment but, even when pitched against others in Australian consumer discretionary space, Myer landed towards the bottom of the pack.\nThose shareholders who took part in Myer's initial public offering in 2009 at $4.10 a share must be scratching their heads as the shares trade near 90¢.\nAnd it's arguable that the nadir of Brookes' rein was the irrational and unsuccessful attempt to acquire David Jones as a means of bolstering flagging sales and profits.\nMyer simply did not adapt to the changing face of retail, and in particular failed to address the need to overhaul the traditional department store.\nNew chief executive Richard Umbers, who has the task of lifting Myer's performance, is paid less than Brookes.\nUmbers,who joined in March 2015, has a base salary of $1.2 million but is eligible for bonuses and received $1.5 million in total remuneration in 2015.\nUmbers has the opportunity to earn short-term incentive payments equivalent to 80 per cent of his fixed salary and long-term incentives equivalent to 90 per cent of his fixed salary – subject to shareholder approval.\nThe trouble with Brookes' package was his total remuneration was too heavily tilted to base pay.\nThe board noted in the annual report that it takes a considered approach to executive remuneration but is \"mindful that shareholder interests will not be served if the company becomes unable to attract or retain skilled executives\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:09:32.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
