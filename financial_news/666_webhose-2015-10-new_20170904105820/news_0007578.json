Shares of XOMA were up 43.7% on the announcement.\nPer the terms of the agreement, XOMA licensed the global development and commercialization rights to its anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) antibody program in its immuno-oncology portfolio to Novartis.\nNovartis will make an upfront fee of $37.0 million to XOMA. In addition, XOMA is eligible to receive milestone payments up to $480.0 million. XOMA is also entitled to receive royalties on product sales between mid-single digits and low double digits.\nIn exchange, Novartis will extend the maturity date on the approximate $13.5 million outstanding debt under the secured note agreement to Sep 30, 2020. The notes bear interest at the six-month LIBOR plus 2%.\nXOMA will reduce the royalty rate payable to it in connection with Novartis' clinical-stage anti-CD40 antibodies. XOMA expects liquidity of approximately $50.5 million from this deal, along with planned cost savings measures, both of which will fund operations through 2017.\nThe company still expects to begin its phase II program on XOMA 358 later this year. The candidate enjoys orphan drug designation in the U.S. for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism.\nWe remind investors that Novartis had undertaken a series of actions to reorganize its portfolio in 2014 in order to focus on its core businesses of pharmaceuticals, eye care and generics.\nMeanwhile, immune-oncology is gathering a lot of attention in recent times. On its second-quarter earnings call, Novartis stated that two new molecules in immuno-oncology have entered the clinic in solid tumors with four more progressing into the clinical phase later in 2015 and in 2016.\nXOMA currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Novartis carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked health care stocks are Abbott Laboratories ABT and Novo Nordisk A/S NVO. Both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
