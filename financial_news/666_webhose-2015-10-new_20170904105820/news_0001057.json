Photo: Andrew Meares Smart Investor Nov illustrations Andrew Meares by Stewart Oldfield There is a saying among old-timers that banks are a little like tea bags – you only find out what they are really like when they get into hot water.\nSo examining their circumstances today – when bad debts are at record lows, funding markets are open and unemployment is still at manageable levels – would seem to add little value.\nFor a perspective on how the major banks respond to more difficult times we need to look back to how they handled a crisis.\nWhile we have to go back more than two decades to examine a decent economic crisis in Australia, we only have to go back as far as the GFC to examine a local bank-centric one.\nWhile the banks have had to be gloriously tight-lipped about how they really fared during the GFC, as time has passed politicians of the day have been quite willing to spill the beans.\nFor instance, former treasurer Wayne Swan in his little-read book The Good Fight is very happy to confirm that as soon as conditions started to get hairy in the winter of 2008, the first thing the two Melbourne-based banks, ANZ and NAB, wanted to do was merge.\nIn hindsight it explains why the government felt it necessary to reaffirm its commitment to the four pillars banking policy in June 2008.\nSwan writes: “What isn’t widely known is that there was growing pressure in the winter of 2008 to see an end to this policy.\n “The ANZ and NAB, two of our big four banks, were very keen to join forces, which would have left us with just three giants.”\nBut it is about the machinations leading up to the announcement of the deposit and funding guarantee on October 12, 2008, where Swan’s writings should be the most chilling – at least for any bank investor who believes Australia’s financial system is impregnable.\nSwan writes: “These were uncertain times and people on the street were very unsettled. Electorate offices like mine were getting a stream of calls from constituents asking whether their savings were safe.\n“In the hours leading up to the announcement of the bank guarantee, Armaguard experienced its busiest weekend on record, as cash was moved out of banks into safety deposit boxes.\n“In one case, a single person moved $10 million out of their bank account. While these transactions weren’t widespread, this could have easily gotten out of hand had we not immediately stepped in to provide a safety blanket for all banks and credit unions, regardless of their size.\n“I received calls from right across the financial system and the business community urging the government to act. These were not just small players; they included the CEOs of major banks and top companies on the ASX.”\nIt was a similar story on September 19, 2008, when authorities introduced a temporary ban on short-selling.\n“It was reported that the decision was taken to placate Macquarie Bank, but the truth is there were many other organisations on the phone making a very similar case.”\nSwan also writes of the need to quickly expedite the takeover of St George Bank by Westpac and Bankwest by CBA.\nHe says that Bankwest was effectively “cut adrift” by its British parent HBOS, exposing an east coast expansion that had been based on overly aggressive lending.\nSwan writes: “It became clear that its expansion was based on what could generously be described as optimistic assumptions (loose lending standards, if we are being honest). Without a new owner big enough to support it, the bank was at grave risk, and any failure would prejudice the Australian financial system.”\nEvery person invested in the Australian banks should probably have a re-read of the government’s announcement of the funding guarantee on October 12, 2008 – the sense of uncertainty is still clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:11:19.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
