That's exactly what we want to offer them.\" \nThe properties, which offer 100 square metres of space, feature a \"Black Magic Wall\" that echoes the feature line of a car, a bespoke Swarovski chandelier, a glass table shaped like an S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) to represent a Mercedes S-class car , and silver-coloured furniture. \nThe one- and two-bedroom flats, which can be rented for two months at a time, will be available for £300 to £400 per night. \nNine similar apartments that are roughly 50 metres squared are set to open in Singapore in early 2016. Mercedes-Benz said it plans to rapidly expand the concept to other cities if the pilot is successful. \nThis is not the first time that the car company has tried its hand at out-of-car experiences.
