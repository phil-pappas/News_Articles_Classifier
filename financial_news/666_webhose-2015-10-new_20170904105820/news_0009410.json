Our College Q&A U.S.-Stock Funds Fall 8.2% in Quarter By now, you’ve probably heard of “smart beta” mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Some academic studies using backtests suggest that, yes, these new-age portfolios—in which stocks are weighted by rules or “factors” other than their market value, such as their dividends, value or low volatility—can outpace a straight index over extended periods—say, a full market cycle or two. But don’t expect outperformance every year.\nIn fact, the proliferation of smart-beta funds might be confusing more than helping investors. And if you are anything less than a true buy-and-hold investor, your smart-beta bets could fall well short of short-term expectations.\nHere are three things that investors should know to better navigate the fast-growing area that, according to money manager BlackRock Inc., BLK -0.28 % soaked up 25% of all flows into stock funds in 2014.\n1. ‘Factors’ have their moments Smart-beta fund returns can differ a lot in the short term. While backtests show that certain factors can add incremental return (say, one to two percentage points annualized) over an index over multidecade periods, anything can happen over a year or more.\nThis year, funds using a price-momentum factor (stocks whose prices have risen recently) and a “quality” factor (stocks exhibiting high return on invested capital) are doing relatively well. But funds based on dividend factors and value factors, such as low price/earnings or price/book value ratios, aren’t.\nA glance at a group of smart-beta ETFs with different factors offered by iShares along with two popular smart-beta mutual funds, Pimco RAE Fundamental Plus (PXTIX) and DoubleLine Shiller Enhanced CAPE Fund (DSEEX), shows dividend and value funds lagging behind quality and momentum funds for 2015 through Sept. 30. (See chart.)\nThe chart shows that three iShares dividend-focused smart-beta ETFs lost more than 6% for the year through September. The Pimco mutual fund, which weights stocks on sales, cash flow, book value and dividends, lost 11.85% for the period. By contrast, the S&P 500 was off 5.29%.\nENLARGE 2. There is short-term sector risk Investors surveying the field of smart-beta funds should understand that one sector can make or break a group of funds over the short term. In fact, one reason many dividend funds and value funds are lagging behind this year is because of their exposure to energy.\nThe iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) and iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV) have 10.5% and 17.9% of their portfolios, respectively, invested in energy. The S&P 500 index, in contrast, consists of about 7% energy.\nSimilarly, the Pimco fund reports an overweight in Chevron . CVX 3.52 % In fact, Exxon Mobil XOM 1.41 % is its largest stockholding, while Chevron is No. 6. Both stocks are big dividend payers, with Exxon yielding 3.8% and Chevron 5.4%. Exxon lost 17% for the year through September, while Chevron was off 27%.\nHowever, the Pimco fund has a good 10-year record, an 11.7% compounded annualized return for its first decade of existence through the end of June 2015 versus a 7.9% annualized return for the S&P 500. The fund’s recent stumble shows that investors may have to tolerate short-term sector risk to reap the longer-term rewards of individual factors.\nAnother strategy for managing short-term sector risk can be investing in several funds that focus on different factors. For example, investors may want to own a momentum or quality fund together with a value or dividend fund. There is no guarantee that the different factors will provide diversification, but value-factor funds often own sectors that have dropped while momentum-factor funds own sectors that are rising.\nProviders such as iShares have made it easy to combine factors in a single fund with such products as iShares FactorSelect MSCI USA ETF (LRGF), which focuses on value, quality and momentum, and tilts toward smaller companies in the large-cap and midcap universe. It was launched this spring and returned negative 5.7% cumulatively from May through the end of September, versus a loss of 7.1% for the S&P 500 over the same period.\n3. Active management creeps in This leads to the third thing investors should know about smart-beta funds: Active management and manager discretion can play part in a portfolio that uses multiple factors.\nFor example, iShares has also issued iShares Enhanced U.S. Large Cap ETF (IELG), which, though based on smart-beta factors, uses judgment from its managers in portfolio construction. According to information provided by iShares, this fund screens for stocks that score best on rankings for three smart-beta factors—quality, value and size. That part of the process is mechanical and rules-based.\nThen, however, the portfolio managers adjust the resulting portfolio to avoid sector, industry or stock overweights, and to ensure diversification. Also, an internal investment committee meets quarterly to monitor the allocations.\nBut does this manager discretion defeat the purpose of the rules-based approach? The managers may or may not add value, but, either way, investors are no longer making a pure bet on a backtested model that has identified historically successful factors.\nIn other words, you’re betting the index part of the index fund isn’t so “smart” on its own, after all.\nMr. Coumarianos is a writer in Laguna Hills, Calif.
