Advertising Print This Post \nDukascopy Bank SA has a void to fill after the departure of its Head of Institutional Sales in Europe and Asia, Artur Filipowicz, who has parted ways with the company to take a senior level role at SmarterFX, Finance Magnates has learned. \nMr. Filipowicz had been a mainstay at Dukascopy Bank since joining the group back in 2008. During this time he held two main roles with the company, first as its Senior Relationship Manager of Foreign Exchange (FX) Sales) – White Label & Custodian Banking and then as its Head of Institutional Sales in Europe and Asia, whilst being based out of Geneva. \nPrior to joining Dukascopy Bank in 2008, Mr. Filipowicz also held a number of roles at other organizations, including Thomson Reuters as its Financial Applications Specialist and BCA Research as its Business Development Associate, dating back to 2003. \nFollowing his departure from Dukascopy Bank however, Mr. Filipowicz has assumed the role of Partner and Managing Director of SmarterFX. SmarterFX is Geneva-based company that deals with FX funds for both private and institutional investors – the group’s focus is presently relegated to FX and precious metals markets. \nDukascopy Bank made headlines last month when it released its H1 profitability report for the period ending June 30, 2015. The annual report showed growing revenues, which is a departure from the year prior.
