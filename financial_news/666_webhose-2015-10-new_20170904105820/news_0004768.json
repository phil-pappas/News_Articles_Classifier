Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by James Eyers The Committee for Sydney will release a report on Monday that should accelerate discussion about ways governments can adjust policy settings to drive a thriving start-up ecosystem in Australia and help boost economic growth.\nThe Building the start-up ecosystem in NSW: from grants to collaboration report has been prepared with KPMG as part of the NSW government's financial services knowledge hub project. Generated from a survey of 75 start-ups followed by consultation with leaders of the venture capital and entrepreneur incubation scenes, the report will alarm bureaucrats.\nThis is because many entrepreneurs say the process for applying for various government grants is overly complex and lacks transparency. They also suggest Australia is slipping further behind countries like Britain, Israel and Singapore, which in the new digital economy will increasingly compete with Australia for talent and capital.\nThe Committee for Sydney's credibility as a voice for public policy reform has been boosted since its landmark report last October, Unlocking the potential: the fintech opportunity for Sydney , which led to the establishment of the fintech accelerator Stone & Chalk. The committee, which is chaired by Lucy Turnbull, studies changes to the NSW economy – driven by disruptive technology, demographics and consumer preferences – and seeks ways to manage them proactively and collaboratively. It believes a healthy start-up culture and ecosystem will be a prerequisite for successful city economies in the 21st century.\nKPMG consulted various tech accelerators and venture capital funds, including iAccelerate, Reinventure Group, H2 Ventures, the Tyro fintech hub, 25Fifteen and ATP Innovations, before finalising the recommendations.\n\"It is imperative that government support new business and the creation of new jobs to maintain our competitiveness,\" the report says.\nAnalysis must be precise Johanna Pitman, deputy chief executive of the Committee for Sydney, says the message that governments \"need to do more\" is often generalised but intervention in the start-up ecosystem can mean different things to different people. Therefore, analysis needs to be precise in its discussion on forms of intervention.\n Through this report, the committee has presented a palate of different policy levers and seeks to examine how each policy fits in an increasingly global market for information technology industries.\nA key message is the start-up community wants the federal and state governments to streamline application processes for existing grants and to deploy them more strategically to target emerging growth sectors of the economy. They also want policy makers to explore new tax incentives based on models that are proving successful abroad to attract more private capital to start-ups and build the ecosystem of innovation.\nThe Committee for Sydney's paper should be read with two other recent pieces of analysis that show the devastating potential impact on employment from technological disruption and the opportunity, given the contribution start-ups already play in generating jobs.\nIn June, the Committee for Economic Development of Australia's paper Australia's future workforce? found that half of the workforce aspired to self-employment, while, more alarmingly, the impact of technology across the economy could lead to 40 per cent of jobs disappearing in the next 15 years.\nHighest contribution Then in September, the office of the chief economist in the Department of Industry and Science released a research paper, The employment dynamics of Australian entrepreneurship , in partnership with the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It found young, small businesses between zero and five years old made the highest contribution to net job creation in Australia, at 40 per cent. Start-ups – firms aged zero to two years – were responsible for most of this growth. From 2006 to 2011 start-ups added 1.44 million jobs to the Australian economy, whereas firms aged three years or older shed about 400,000 jobs over the same period, the paper says.\nThese are solid foundations that the Committee for Sydney is urging governments to build on. KPMG's James Mabbott, who led the research for the report, says policy needs to deal with the entrepreneur and investor side. Both are necessary, given entrepreneurs take risk and build businesses but require capital and people willing to support their endeavours.\nMabbott says government grants should be matched with funds from angel investors, incubators and accelerators. \"Leveraging the capabilities and expertise of other investors in the start-up ecosystem increases the probability of greater return on investment due to external validation,\" the report says.\nEncouragingly, survey respondents say the federal government's Research and Development Tax Incentive program is working well. It had the highest take-up and start-ups say it is easy to access. But the federal government's Entrepreneurs Infrastructure Program and the NSW government's Innovate NSW had arduous application processes and were unnecessarily complex. The report calls for the terms and conditions of grants to be more clearly explained, timelines to be accelerated, programs to be better promoted and for transparency around eligibility and selection criteria to be boosted.\nWith the new Assistant Innovation Minister Wyatt Roy running a one-day policy hackathon in Sydney next weekend, run by start-up accelerator BlueChilli, perhaps applying customer-centric design principles to online application processes for start-up grants would be a fruitful challenge for participants.\nMoving ahead of Australia Pitman says the research makes it clear that other jurisdictions are moving ahead of Australia on innovation policy. One is Britain, which is encouraging others to invest in start-ups through tax concessions that are building the pools of capital to allow the ecosystem to thrive.\nBritain's Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), which is aimed at early-stage companies, and the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), which supports small high-risk trading companies, allow investors in start-ups to reduce their income tax liability. The SEIS allows half the cost of investment to be used to reduce tax liability in the year in which the investment is made, while the EIS provides a 30 per cent up-front tax write-off.\nIn an article published in The Australian Financial Review in September, federal MP David Coleman, a former tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist, said the government should scrap capital gains tax for small businesses to incentivise investment in start-ups. The industry thinks the government needs to go further than this and think more like Britain.\nAs venture capitalist Mark Carnegie observed last week, there are already capital gains tax exemptions for venture capitalists using a vehicle known as an early-stage venture capital limited partnership (ESVCLP).\nUp-front tax deductions But eliminating capital gains tax for all investors merely solves a tax problem in the future, given the capital gains tax liability occurs at the time shares in businesses are sold. Reinventure Group co-founder Danny Gilligan says up-front tax deductions on angel investments like the ones offered in Britain has far more impact.\nHe also proposes two tweaks to the ESVCLP legislation: enabling more \"widely held\" companies to adopt it as a vehicle for corporate venture capital; and clarification of \"eligible investments\" to ensure the emerging category of fintech isn't unduly caught up in excluded \"financial products\".\nAfter releasing the paper, the Committee of Sydney is pursuing three pieces of advocacy: pushing for SEIS and EIS-like schemes to be set up in Australia; seeking more accommodating visa rules for entrepreneurs; and advancing the take-up of science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects in high schools.\nGilligan agrees that special visas for talented entrepreneurs will increase the quality of Australia-based teams and businesses. He suggests Higher Education Contributions Scheme-style funding to support short-course technology retraining. He also reckons a cross-regulatory innovation group with representatives of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Taxation Office and the Privacy Commissioner could create fast-track, low-cost support for regulation of eligible start-ups.\nSimon Cant, of Reinventure Group, and Coleman will join a panel to discuss fintech venture capital and innovation at an event being hosted by The Australian Financial Review at Sydney's Stone & Chalk fintech hub on October 26, as part of StartupWeek Sydney .", "external_links": ["https://www.kpmg.com/AU/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/fintech-opportunity-sydney-oct-2014-full-report.pdf", "http://startupweeksydney.com.au/event/afr-and-reinventure-group-fintech-venture-capital-and-corporate-innovation/", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj", "http://www.industry.gov.au/Office-of-the-Chief-Economist/Research-Papers/Documents/2015-Research-Paper-4-The-employment-dynamics-of-Australian-entrepreneurship.pdf", "http://www.ceda.com.au/events/eventdetails/2015/06/s150618?EventCode=S150618"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:09:24.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
