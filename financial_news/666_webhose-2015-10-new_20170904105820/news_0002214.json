That's true enough in the broad view, but the detailed picture reveals more than a few backward steps, some by design and some inadvertent.\nOur favourite word processor, LibreOffice Writer, proved the point a couple of releases ago when its Windows version started corrupting automated cross-references, a pretty dire fault for those of us who cross refer intensively.\nWe've frequently lauded Writer, so justice demands that we report this coding faux pas. The bug has been reported by the user community via the publicly accessible defects database Bugzilla, so we're optimistic it will be remedied with priority. In the meantime, users can work around it by remaining on a version 3.x release, or using the Mac version if that's an option. It is for us, so our work hasn't been affected.\nThe lesson here is to be cautious about any business software upgrade. Take a backup of your stable system before rolling out new code. Better still, consider using a virtualised platform such as VMware, where you can snapshot an entire system in moments.\nMicrosoft brought the Start button back in Windows 10 after its decision to remove it in Windows 8 proved unpopular. Apple howlers No matter how exciting a new release may look, give it a thorough test run on a non-critical machine before unleashing it on your network.\nMac users have an unfair advantage in this department. Many applications, LibreOffice included, will happily coexist in several versions on the same computer. At install time, just accept the option to keep both versions. We're tapping this piece out using the latest iteration of Writer, but a known and trusted older model is in reserve for instant use if required.\nBut it's not just open-source software that regresses, and it's not only thanks to programming errors. Take Apple's sound recording app GarageBand. Until 2013, it included special tools for podcast recording, and it was so useful for that task that some folk invested in Mac hardware solely because of it.\nUntil 2013 Apple's GarageBand app included special tools for podcast recording, until it was suddenly dropped without explanation. Then Apple dropped podcast support from the product – no explanation, no beg your pardon – apparently never to return, and leaving a million podcasters in disbelief.\nAnd who knows what Apple was thinking when they redesigned their iPad Smart Cover to consist of three folding panels instead of the previous four. The older type folded into a rock steady stand and the new kind is decidedly less stable. If you miss the original design, the closest thing we've found in a quality product is the CaseCrown Omni, a slim polycarbonate unit at an affordable $US25 ($34) on Amazon.\nMicrosoft worse Apple's howlers pale beside Microsoft's bewildering decision to drop the Start button from Windows 8, a move they came to regret bitterly and that was famously reversed as part of Windows 10.\nYears back, we had Windows Me edition. Version 10 might well have been dubbed Windows Mea Culpa. Yet not all Redmond's backward steps have been retraced.\nThe average Word user employs a dozen to 15 program commands regularly, and in Office 2003 it was easy to gather them all into one toolbar. Try doing that with the post-2010 interface. Instead, modern Word users are doomed to a life of swapping tabs to reach the tools they need throughout the day.\nSome great ideas were lost and wait to be rediscovered.\nA lifetime ago, there was a simple pre-Windows office suite called First Choice. If you opened a dialogue box while creating a document, the box cleverly popped up in a part of the screen that was calculated to obscure as little text as possible. Instead of covering over your work, it politely stood aside. We've never seen that done so well since.\nWe also miss WordPerfect 6 for DOS's neat trick of flipping between a fully graphical interface and a simple text editor view. If you wanted to focus on your content without distractions, text mode was ideal. Somebody, bring this option back, please.\nPushing desktop apps into the cloud has also come at a cost. Planning our switch from locally networked to cloud-based accounting software earlier this year, we were unpleasantly surprised to find that the major cloud services offered far less flexibility in customised reporting and invoice layout than the local version of QuickBooks we used back in 1998.\nService providers explained that delivering full desktop functionality in the cloud isn't always easy.\nSometimes, great technology is like a favourite restaurant. Enjoy it all the more because it may not be there forever.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer with Cooper Mills. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:05:04.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
