James Alcock Share on twitter by Misa Han ﻿ Chaos and delays are ahead for 600,000 Sydneysiders when commuters return to work on Tuesday.\nSince Sunday, new bus timetables and routes have been in place to prepare for the construction of a light rail line on George Street in the CBD. The 12 kilometre new light rail line will run from Circular Quay to Randwick and Kingsford in the city's inner east.\nCommuters heading for the office after the long weekend have been advised to get to work ahead of the usual start time and leave earlier, or later, than usual over the next three to four weeks . And they'd better be prepared to stick with the new routine: construction won't be completed till April 2018.\nThe light rail line will cost the NSW government $2.1 billion and the City of Sydney is investing a further $220 million into the project.\nBut even on the long weekend the new arrangements proved baffling for some. Brianna Cunneen, a university student, organised for a group of friends to meet at Central to go to Bondi Beach on the Monday Labour Day holiday. She said finding information about how to get to Bondi was difficult.\n\"It was really hard, the buses I thought were going to Bondi now don't go up Elizabeth Street,\" she said.\nHowever, Ms Cunneen said the changes were worth it if it meant accommodating the light rail construction.\n\"It's frustrating but it might be we need to stop the cars on George Street, if we want the light rail.\"\n Ben Roysten, a builder who was working on Monday and using buses to get from his home in innner-city Glebe, said he was already late for work in Centennial Park, on the other side of town.\n\"I've been waiting for half an hour, it's s***. The information, they changed all the routes … and Google Maps hasn't been updated,\" he said.\nHe said the new light rail system was unlikely to improve his commute. \"Probably not, it's probably going to be just as busy,\" he said.\nA taxi driver, Pierre Chahound, said commuters were unlikely to catch taxis to get to work on Tuesday.\n\"Cab drivers are going to be badly affected by this chaotic reform,\" he said\nAnd light rail would not help long term. \"There is going to be less demand for taxis inside the CBD. People are going to catch the light rail from, say, Circular Quay to Haymarket and it's going to hurt taxi drivers.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydneys-george-street-light-rail-construction-commuters-urged-to-get-to-work-early-20151003-gk0ju5.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/sydneys-bus-overhaul-what-you-need-to-know-for-next-week-20150930-gjy2yx.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:01:08.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
