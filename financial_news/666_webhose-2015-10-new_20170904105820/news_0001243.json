Here's how \nSome of the most exciting investment stories come from foreign companies that can seem out of reach for many ordinary UK investors. \nHuge stock market listings of businesses like Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) and Alibaba, and the rise and rise of Apple (LSE: 0R2V.L - news ) to become the largest public company in the world, are reminders that huge growth is available beyond UK shores. \nGoogle is growing beyond its internet search business to become central in a host of futuristic technologies, such as robotics. Many investors will want to access its unique potential without making a large investment in US stock generally. \nFor DIY investors in Britain, the cost of buying foreign shares will depend greatly on their chosen investing platform. \nYou’ll first need to establish that your platform allows you to buy foreign shares. Some, such as Fidelity ShareNetwork and Bestinvest, will not. \nOthers limit the markets that they offer access to. Commonly excluded markets include China, Russia, India and Brazil. \nFor ordinary investors taking their first steps into holding foreign shares, the US is a natural place to start. \nNot only is it home to many of the high-profile companies they may want to invest in, but it also attracts companies from all regions of the world to list on its stock exchanges, giving investors a wide universe of global companies to choose from. \n= Dealing costs = \nIf your platform does give access to the markets you want, you need to establish the charges. \nThe total of what you pay will include some combination of: your platform’s usual trading charge; an extra percentage charge for trading in foreign shares; and an exchange rate charge for buying in the currency of the foreign country. \nThe exact split varies enormously between investment platforms. \nHargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , for example, charges its standard rates of between £5.95 and £11.95 per trade for foreign shares, but then adds on an extra 1.5pc charge to cover currency conversion on trades up to £25,000. The charge falls after that. \nFor example, if you wanted to buy 100 Facebook shares at current prices and exchange rate the cost in sterling, before charges, would be £6,022.29. \nAdding in Hargreaves’ £11.95 dealing fee and the 1.5pc extra currency charge, the cost would rise to £6,125.95 with charges totalling £103.66. \nAJ Bell Youinvest levels a foreign exchange charge of 1pc. \nOther platforms add a specific charge for foreign trades - £20 for developed markets in Europe and North America - or will charge different amounts depending on the country in question. \nFor less commonly traded stocks, the price can rise even further. \nDavid Hannis, director of stockbroker James Brearley & Sons, which provides services to the Frequent Trader platform, said: “The cost and ease of buying foreign shares comes down whether the stock is commonly traded. Where trades can be settled on Crest (BSE: CREST.BO - news ) (the UK electronic system for settling trades) it is reasonably straightforward but smaller stocks require a global custodian and extra cost.” \nFrequent Trader and Charles Stanley (LSE: CAY.L - news ) , for example, charge an extra £50 for global trades. \nThere are signs that a growth in foreign share trading by investors everywhere is driving down prices - fast. \nWe've reported previously about the launch in Britain of Holland-based broker Degiro, which offers incredibly low-cost dealing both in UK and overseas shares. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) claims these ultra-low costs - mere pennies to trade in big US firms' shares, for example - arise from the ciutting-edge trading technology it has borrowed from institutional investors. \nDegiro's services are relatively new and it does not yet offer an Isa. But if you are a regular trader in foreign-listed stocks is it a provider to watch. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of investment ideas \n= A cheaper way? = \nFor those who think they will trade foreign shares on a regular basis, it may be cheaper to hold foreign currency in their trading account in order to cut foreign exchange charges. \nSome platforms allow you to hold dollar accounts and once, TD Direct, allows up to nine currencies to be held. \nThe most cost-effective way to fund a foreign currency trading account is usually to use a specialist currency account from a foreign exchange firm such as Moneycorp. \nYou can fund this from you main bank account, switching to dollars and then funding your share dealing account. \n= Holding in an Isa or Sipp = \nYou can hold foreign shares in an Isa or Sipp, subject to certain rules, but there are potentially tax implications. \nThe tax you pay on foreign shares is complicated and you’ll probably need to claim tax relief through a self-assessment tax return to pay the least possible. \nDividends are subject to a “withholding tax” in the company’s home nation and the rates can be as high as 35pc. \nThe UK has struck “double taxation” agreements with many countries around the world to ensure taxpayers don’t pay twice on the same money. \nFor US and Canadian shares customers need to complete a tax declaration form - W-8BEN or NR301 - before they place a deal. Once this has been completed it is good for three years. \nIf there is an agreement with the home nation of the company you wish to buy shares in, you can potentially benefit from a lower rate of tax. \nA tax credit can be claimed via a self-assessment tax return to get back the foreign tax that has been taken. The value of the credit is limited, however, to either to the treaty rate or to the UK liability whichever is lower. \nFor money held in Isas or Sipps, it is not possible to claim foreign tax credit relief. This is because these wrappers cannot be declared on a tax return. \nSarah Hollowell, head of tax and trustee services at stockbrokers Killik & Co, said: “This tax is then effectively lost unless the taxpayer applies to the relevant country’s tax authorities for a foreign tax reclaim. \n“This can be an onerous task with each jurisdiction having its own requirements and doesn’t compensate the taxpayer for the full amount of tax.” \nYou do still get income tax relief on any gains made on foreign shares inside an Isa. It is not possible, however, to hold foreign currency in an Isa so you will have to use the costlier route of buying in sterling and paying conversion charges. \nThe Telegraph has launched its own DIY investment service, designed with simple pricing. The annual cost is capped at £300 for all your Isas and general investment account, but based on an annual fee of 0.3pc, making it good for first-time fund investors and those with large fund portfolios. Alongside this, our team of investment journalists will produce an ever-greater stream of analysis on investments, aiming to help savers make the right choices. \n• Find out more about Telegraph Investor \nTransfer to Telegraph Investor and we'll welcome you with up to £400 cashback.
