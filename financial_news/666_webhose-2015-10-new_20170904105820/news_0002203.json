FCA hires consultants to review its own effectiveness By Tim Wallace | Telegraph – 8 minutes ago 0.00 0.00 \nThe Financial Conduct Authority is hiring external consultants to review its governance and its risk controls on a regular basis, following a bungled media briefing last year \nThe City regulator has promised to review its own performance every year, and commission external auditors to check up on its progress, as part of a series of reforms in the wake of a bungled announcement of a review into the pensions market. \nIn March 2014 the Telegraph reported that the FCA’s then-enforcement boss Clive Adamson planned a review of the pensions market , which led to enormous swings in share prices in the sector as the regulator failed to follow up the press briefing with more detailed announcements. \nMr Adamson and media relations boss Zitah McMillan both lost their jobs later in the year , though the FCA insisted their departures were not related to the press briefings. \nFollowing criticism from MPs and its own chairman , the regulator has promised not to brief any media outlets on price-sensitive announcements ahead of their publication, except in very tightly controlled press conferences in the FCA’s offices, immediately prior to the announcements. \nThe FCA has also agreed to assess its own board’s structure and effectiveness each year. \n“The board agrees that as a matter of good corporate governance it is important that its effectiveness is regularly reviewed, and has agreed it will do so on an annual basis,” the FCA said. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has also “agreed to commission another externally facilitated effectiveness report and we have commissioned Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review to produce a review this year. We agree to publish the results”. \nThis will become a regular event: “The Board has further decided to commission an external review every other year, with an internal review taking place in alternate years.” \nThe City watchdog set up a new Risk and Compliance Oversight Division this year, and has hired consultants from Oliver Wyman to review its “suitability given the role and remit of the FCA”. \nIn addition, the regulator is drawing up a plan of its organisation to show which executives are responsible for which parts of the business, to make sure the FCA is subject to the same accountability as the firms it regulates those businesses also have to explain who is responsible for which bits of work, under the incoming Senior Managers' Regime . \nAndrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the treasury Select Committee that was critical of the FCA’s response to the pensions reports, welcomed the announcements. \n“The FCA made a serious error in March last year. By breaching its own listing rules, it created a false market in life insurance shares. In doing so it put its own statutory objectives at risk,” Mr Tyrie said. \n“The regulators should hold themselves to standards at least as high as those they require of the regulated community. The FCA’s standards have been poor, reflecting deep cultural problems in the regulator.” \nMeanwhile, the FCA said it would review the process of addressing small businesses' complaints over the way interest rate swaps were mis-sold . \nAlthough the regulator says it believes the process of assessing sales and providing compensation where it is required has worked well, there have been some complaints from customers who still feel mistreated. \nHowever, it will wait until legal action by some SMEs is complete before launching its next review. \nOther delays have also arisen around the FCA’s review of complaints that Royal Bank of Scotland’s global restructuring group mistreated small businesses. This review will now progress on an unspecified slower timetable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:57:12.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
