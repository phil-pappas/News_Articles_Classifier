However, there are still ways to save on home or car insurance - here's how: *Pay upfront Spreading the cost of car or home insurance over the year can take the pain out of an upfront lump sum payment. But insurers often charge around £80-90 extra if a policy is paid by instalments. If you can can afford to pay it in one go, it's worth it. *Don't pay to protect your no-claims bonus Drivers who build up a clean record of driving can then pay extra to protect their no-claims bonus. This means that even if they have an accident a discount is still applied. But in reality, the cost of insurance still goes up in the event of a claim (albeit by not as much) but for many people the saving is not worth the many years of paying for its protection. *Shop around Loyalty doesn't pay with insurance. In almost all cases, you will get a better deal as a new customer than remaining with the same provider year after year. *Dashboard camera You can spend as little as £20 on a camera that films the road in front while you are driving. Should you be involved in an accident, the footage can be used to prove that you were not at fault. In the age of crash-for-cash drivers the tool is set to become invaluable. Some drivers have already used the footage from gadgets to recoup excess and reinstate no-claims bonuses. *Avoid making small claims on your home insurance Making a claim on your home insurance can lead to an increased premium in the the following three years of up to 10 per cent. Factor in the cost of an excess and a payout for a smaller claim, such as a broken TV, quickly turns out to be a costly move in the long run. Often it's worth only using home insurance in the event of larger payouts, such as a flooding or a burglary. *Speed awareness courses won't cut insurance costs Drivers caught over the speed limit sometimes have the option to pay for a speed awareness course as an alternative to points and a fine. The course is a more expensive option but often sold as a way to save on insurance costs. However, as with making a claim, an offence will increase insurance costs regardless of the course. And many drivers will find that speed awareness course makes little difference to how insurers calculate policy costs.
