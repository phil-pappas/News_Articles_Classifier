During the third quarter, this segment’s revenues fell 2% to $17.3 billion. Net income, however, rose 62% to $4.3 billion due to lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate.\nWithin this segment, revenues of the Global Consumer Banking business fell 8% to $8.5 billion, while net income fell 11% to $1.7 billion. This segment was hit by sharp declines in revenues from North America and Asia.\nThe Institutional Clients Group was a lifesaver for the company as revenues in this segment rose 3% to $8.6 billion while net income rose 5% to $2.4 billion. Excluding the impact of credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, revenues from this segment declined 3% as banking revenues fell 7% and revenues from the markets and securities business fell 5%.\nInternational banking revenues were hit by lower investment banking activity and the impact of a stronger dollar, while they were slightly offset by strength in the treasury and trade solutions business. Market and securities services business was hit hard by fixed income trading revenues, which fell 16%, reflecting lower activity levels and a less favorable trading environment. Equity markets revenues, however, rose by 12% YoY (year-over-year) to $996 million.\nRevenues from the Citi Holdings business fell by 32% to $1.4 billion during the quarter, reflecting lower gains from asset sales as well as an overall winding down.\nCitigroup has a weight of 0.35% in the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF)(VFH). Wells Fargo (WFC), J.P. Morgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC) have weights of 8.7%, 8.1%, and 5.8%, respectively.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Citigroup’s 3Q15 Earnings Top Expectations Part 2 - Citigroup’s 3Q15 Earnings Rise on Lower Expenses Part 4 - Citigroup’s Profitability Boosted by Lower Expenses Citigroup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:06:28.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
