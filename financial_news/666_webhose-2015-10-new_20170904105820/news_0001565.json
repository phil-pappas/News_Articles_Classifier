Overall, Wall Street expectations are muted for this week's earnings reports. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) will buck that trend with strong results, if forecasts are accurate. Expectations are also high for earnings from American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL ), Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY ), General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) and Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ). \nThe heart of the third-quarter earnings reporting season has arrived, and results will come fast and furious this week. But overall, expectations are fairly muted.\nConsensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts call for declining earnings from many of the most prominent companies reporting this week. However, expectations are high for the results from Alphabet Inc, still more commonly known as Google.\nStrong earnings growth is also predicted for Eli Lilly and Verizon, accompanied by at least some growth in revenues. \nSome of the strongest year-over-year growth on the bottom line is anticipated this week from General Motors Company and American Airlines. Yet, in both cases, the top line is expected to have shrunk marginally.\nBelow is a quick look at what is expected from these and a peek at some of the week's other most prominent reports.\nRelated Link: 23 Stocks With Growth \"Cheaper Than Value\" \nAlphabet The company formerly known as Google will post earnings of $7.34 per share for its third quarter, if Estimize's consensus forecast is accurate. That would be up from $6.25 per share in the same period of last year. Note that Estimize underestimated earnings here in the previous period.\nThe 169 Estimize survey respondents see revenue for the three months that ended in September at about $15.21 billion. That would be up more than 13 percent from the year-ago quarter. Watch for Alphabet to report after Thursday's closing bell.\nAmerican Airlines When it shares its results first thing Friday, the consensus of 19 Estimize estimates is that this leading airline will show earnings of $2.66 per share. That would be up from $1.66 per share in the same period of last year. The consensus Wall Street earnings per share (EPS) estimate is up at $2.71.\nRevenue for the three months that ended in September will be less than 4 percent lower than a year ago to $10.86 billion, if Estimize is correct, though it overestimated revenue in the past few periods. Wall Street is a bit more pessimistic, with a $10.70 billion consensus forecast for the third quarter.\nEli Lilly When it shares its results early Thursday, the consensus of nine Estimize estimates is that this pharmaceutical titan will show earnings of $0.79 per share. That would be up from $0.66 per share in the same period of last year. It is also higher than the Wall Street estimate of $0.75.\nRevenue for the three months that ended in September will be more than 2 percent higher than a year ago to $5.00 billion, if Estimize is accurate. Wall Street is slightly less optimistic, with a $4.98 billion forecast. Note that they both underestimated revenue back in the second quarter.\nGM The third-quarter forecast for this Big 3 automaker calls for EPS to have risen from $0.97 in the year-ago period to $1.15, according to 33 Estimize respondents. Also, revenue is expected to have retreated less than 2 percent to $38.71 billion for the three months that ended in September.\nThe Wall Street forecast calls for $1.19 per share earnings and $38.78 billion in revenue for the quarter. Note that both Wall Street and Estimze have underestimated revenue in the past few quarters. GM is scheduled to release its results Wednesday before the regular trading session begins.\nVerizon In its report early Tuesday, this telecom giant is expected to report that its EPS came to $1.03 for the period that ended in September. That is a penny per share more than the Wall Street forecast, and up from the $0.89 per share Verizon posted in the year-ago period.\nThe consensus of 36 Estimize estimates has revenues at $32.87 billion for the third quarter, lower than Wall Street expectations for $32.94 billion. Both would be up from the $31.59 billion reported in last year's quarter, but note that Estimize overestimated revenue in the previous two quarters.\nRelated Link: 35 Stock Ideas Oppenheimer Analysts Love Right Now \nAnd Others As mentioned, Wall Street expectations are low for many companies scheduled to share their results this week.
