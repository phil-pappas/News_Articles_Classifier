The companies are settling without admitting wrongdoing, the NCUA said. \nBarclays said on Monday it will include a provision for the settlement in its third-quarter results. \n\"We are pleased that this matter is resolved,\" Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson said. \nThe NCUA said the settlements will bring to $2.2 billion its total recoveries from various banks in litigation over faulty mortgage bonds sold to corporate credit unions. The agency, which regulates and supervises federal credit unions, has sued numerous banks to recover losses caused by the collapse of credit unions during the financial crisis. \nThe agency had sued Barclays' U.S. unit Barclays Capital in 2012, accusing it of making false statements in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities sold to U.S. credit unions that later failed. \nMortgages backing the securities were much riskier than the offering documents stated, with a \"material percentage\" all but certain to become delinquent or default, the lawsuit said. \nWachovia was accused of similar practices in a 2011 lawsuit by the NCUA. \nThe lawsuits sought damages for violations of various state and federal securities laws. \nBanks that have already paid big settlements include JPMorgan Chase & Co (Xetra: 850628 - news ) , Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and Bank of America (Swiss: BAC.SW - news ) Corp. The NCUA said it continues to pursue lawsuits against others, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) . \nThe agency said on Monday it also has litigation pending against securities firms over alleged manipulation of interest rates and for failing to perform their duties as trustees for residential mortgage-backed trusts.
