The country is worth $19.7 trn, when combining its strength as a brand with GDP data. \n• The world's most powerful brands \nFast (Shanghai: 600391.SS - news ) -growing superpower China, which has previously threatened to knock the US off the top spot, has instead been rocked by the recent stock market turbulence and slowing economic growth. Its brand worth slipped 1pc to $6.3 trn, when compared to the previous year. \nThe UK comes in at fourth place, worth $3bn, a rise of 6pc from last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:29:20.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
