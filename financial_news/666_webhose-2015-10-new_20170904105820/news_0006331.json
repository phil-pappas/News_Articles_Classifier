It says the Code gives the impression that claims and cross-claims entered into between creditors and banks which are likely to benefit from insolvency or other forms of set-off are protected liabilities, which is inconsistent with the Order; and FMLC suggests that measures to implement the power to require the appointment of a temporary administrator under Article 29 of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) should take into account the widespread market practice of providing that the appointment of an administrator will constitute an event of default under financial contracts on market standard terms. FMLC suggests this because this outcome is contrary to the legislative intent of the BRRD and may lead to a significant degree of unintended market disruption if it were to clash with measures to prevent a crisis in respect of a systemically significant EU banking institution. \n© … Or, sign up using your email address » - hide : \nJD Supra provides users with access to its legal industry publishing services (the \"Service\") through ite \nUsers who opt in to receive emails may choose to no longer receive e-mail updates and newsletters by selecting the \"opt-out of future email\" option in the email they receive from JD Supra or in their JD Supra account management screen. \nJD Supra takes reasonable precautions to insure that user information is kept private.
