David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd When this year's biggest initial public offering, Link Group, hits the market on Tuesday one of the reasons for buying the stock will be the sweet deal it did with five union superannuation funds.\nA key factor in Link's future profitability growth is the earnings from a company called Superpartners, which was founded and owned by AustralianSuper, Cbus, HESTA, HOSTPLUS and MTAA Super.\nChanticleer understands that when the senior management of Link took over Superpartners they found a business with much more potential than they had first thought. The purchase gave Link huge-scale efficiencies in its super administration business. It added about 4.7 million accounts. This deal more than doubled the fund administration revenue of Link. All five industry funds signed new long-term contracts with Link.\nThe Link prospectus said Superpartners will deliver $292.7 million in fiscal 2016 taking total fund administration revenue to $560 million. It said fund administration has the highest revenue growth and highest profit growth of any business in the Link group of companies. The profit margin in 2016 is about 16.5 per cent.\nSuperpartners was started by the industry funds to build an administration system that would be cheaper and better than anything else available in the market.\nBut after almost a decade of trying to build a bespoke IT system, the five industry funds had to write it off.\nThe funds were paid an amount by Link but the exact terms and conditions are a mystery. Its shareholders spent about $500million only to have the system scrapped by Link.\nThis is not a high point in the history of industry funds in Australia. While industry funds have consistently delivered higher returns than the retail funds owned by the banks, they have tolerated conflicts of interest that did not serve the interests of their members.\n Superpartners has an equity investment in each of the five industry funds. But each year as its losses escalated the owners did not take action.\nOne extraordinary number that is not in the Link prospectus is the $8 million paid to consultants Booz & Co (now Strategy&) to provide the Superpartners board with advice on how to rescue the IT project.\nThat money was consumed in the dying days of Superpartners ownership and will go down as a cost of doing business.\nFrequent-flyer myths The decision by Woolworths to scrap its loyalty coalition partnership with Qantas should help bust some of the myths surrounding frequent-flyer programs.\nChanticleer has been hearing complaints for some time from senior executives at major companies with shared loyalty programs involving airlines.\nThe most common complaint was about the rising level of frustration among their customers about how difficult it has become to redeem frequent-flyer points.\nAnother complaint was about the constantly changing terms and conditions of frequent-flyer programs. For example, several pointed to the different redemption rights attached to Qantas points redeemed domestically compared to those redeemed internationally. The senior executives questioned the wisdom of handing over their brand equity to airlines while having to pay for the privilege. The relationship was seen to be too much in favour of the airline.\nIndustry figures familiar with many aviation coalition loyalty programs told Chanticleer the frequent-flyer schemes are deliberately designed to achieve three things: breakage of the points, profit margin for the frequent-flyer program and making it as difficult as possible to redeem points. That combination sounds like a flashing red light for Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims.\nIt is really true $1 equals one point? What is the actual redemption value for the average customer with loyalty aviation points?\nThe new Woolworths loyalty program is an interesting case study because the head of supermarkets, Brad Banducci, told the company's director of loyalty and customer data, Ingrid Maes, to start from scratch.\nShe built a loyalty program untainted by past relationships. It was informed by market research by boutique research agency Catalyst. The research found 68 per cent of customers favoured dollars off their shop and only 9 per cent favoured frequent-flyer points, while 75 per cent said they wanted offers tailored to their needs.\nHalf of Woolworths' nine million Everyday Rewards cardholders were not earning air mile points because they had not linked their rewards cards to Qantas' Frequent Flyer scheme. Of those who had linked their cards, only 20 per cent had redeemed points for flights in the past 12 months.\nSome of the conclusions that can be drawn from the survey results is that for the typical Woolworths shopper frequent flyer schemes are too complicated, lacking in value and extremely hard to redeem the apparent face value.\nIt would be wrong to blame Qantas for issuing points that are never redeemed.\nAlso, Qantas does not have a monopoly on marketing a loyalty program that is hard to monetise. A recent loyalty coalition between the Coles FlyBuys program and Etihad apparently requires the shopper to spend about $458 a week for 52 weeks before being able to obtain a return flight. That is extraordinary when you consider the average shopper spends about $100 a week.\nSingaporeans get governance Singapore Power, which owns 31 per cent of Victoria's primary electricity network AusNet Services, is showing signs of understanding the meaning of good corporate governance.\nThree months after the debacle at the company's annual general meeting when independent director Tony Ianello was arbitrarily sacked, Singapore Power is suddenly supporting the appointment of an independent chairman.\nIanello was widely seen to have been punished for standing up to Singapore Power over the contentious question of whether or not AusNet should participate in the bidding for the NSW poles and wires transmission assets.\nChairman Ng Kee Choe, who was appointed to the AusNet board by Singapore Power, told Monday's general meeting that he will not be seeking re-election at next year's annual meeting.\n\"I had indicated to the board some time ago my intention not to seek re-election and this morning, I advised the board that I will not seek re-election,\" Ng told the meeting, which was called to approve the issue of shares pursuant to a dividend reinvestment plan.\n\"I have served the board for close to 10 years and my decision to retire is part of the board renewal process.\"\nNg's decision to leave was accompanied by a comment from him that the new chairman \"should\" be an independent director.\nSingapore Power later put out a statement which was a little ambiguous on that point.\n\"We have previously shared with the board our view that the company should adhere to best practice, and embark on an international search for any board replacements including Mr Ng's successor as chairman,\" Singapore Power said.\n\"We expect Mr Ng's successor, independent or otherwise, to be someone with an appropriate background who is able to engage all shareholders, and lead the company in creating value for all shareholders.\"\nSingapore Power used the statement to restate its position in relation to the poles and wires.\n\"It is incorrect to suggest that Singapore Power voted against the general share issuance mandate resolution at that AGM to prevent AusNet from participating in the TransGrid opportunity,\" the company said.\nNo matter what Singapore Power says it would seem that AusNet's second largest shareholder, State Grid of China, is one of the favourites to buy the NSW poles and wires.\nAt the AusNet meeting in July, State Grid threw its votes behind Singapore Power in order to sack Ianello.\nHFT and dark pools There were few if any surprises in the regulator's review of high-frequency trading and dark pools.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission concluded that current levels of HFT and dark liquidity are not adversely affecting the function of the Australian market.\nThe level of HFT has stayed steady at about 27 per cent of total turnover and predatory trading does not appear to be excessive.\nNot surprisingly there is about 10 times more HFT on the ASX platform called Centre Point than on the Ch-X platform.\nThe difference is explained by the relative size of the two markets.\nASIC said estimated that the gross trading revenue of HFT traders in equity markets was $110 million to $180 million in aggregate in the 12 months to March 2015.\nThis works out at a cost of 0.7 to 1.1 basis points to other users of the market which ASIC said was \"material but substantially less than other figures suggested by some, and less than some other costs in the market\">\nTo put it in perspective average bid-offer spreads are 13 basis points.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:58.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
