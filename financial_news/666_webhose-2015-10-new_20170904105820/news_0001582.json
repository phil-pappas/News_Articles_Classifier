That's a discount of more than 50% to the shares' book value, which seems very cheap. \nHowever, Japan Post does have a big problem: growth. \nPostal volumes are declining steadily, while earnings at the group's insurance and banking operations -- which generated 95% of pre-tax profits last year -- are stagnant. \nMost of Japan's largest banks also trade at a big discount to book value. \nOn this basis, the Japan Post pricing looks attractive, but not outrageously cheap, in my view. \nDon't undervalue the assets \nInvestors who read the Royal Mail share prospectus before the IPO soon realised that the value of £200m of surplus London property was not reflected in the proposed IPO price. This made the shares a clear bargain. \nThe City also used concerns about the need for Royal Mail to modernise and reform its operations to help justify a lower valuation. \nSimilar factors may help to suppress the valuation for Japan Post. In addition to a 24,000-strong branch network, Japan Post's bank division has Y206tn (£1.1tn) of financial assets, mostly Japanese government bonds. \nThese generate the majority of the bank's profits, but returns could be much higher if the bank diversified out of sovereign bonds and into shares and other riskier assets. Lending is also restricted by competition rules. \nPotential investors may be persuaded to pay more in the IPO if they believe the bank will be allowed to reform its lending and investment policies to increase returns. \nTo maximise returns, I believe the Japanese government needs to clarify these issues ahead of the IPO. \nTake a long view \nEven more than Royal Mail, Japan Post is part of the fabric of Japanese society. \nThere's no doubt at all in my view that whatever happens, the flotation will trigger some criticism. I suspect that short-term volatility in the shares of the newly-floated companies is also likely. \nThose in charge of the IPO need to be as transparent as possible about future plans before the sale. Afterwards, they need to develop a very thick skin and focus on the long term. \nThe success of a privatisation this large will be measured over years or even decades, not months. \nShould you invest in mail? \nI suspect the Japan Post IPO will be good value for shareholders who are able to buy in at the offer price. \nUnfortunately for UK investors, getting involved in the IPO from here is likely to be very difficult. \nHowever, there are also attractive shares trading at a discount to their book value in the UK markets.
