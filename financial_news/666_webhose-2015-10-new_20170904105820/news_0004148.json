The studios argued that songs such as Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" are not covered by federal copyright law, but they have been protected in common law by states including New York. The settlement follows a similar deal in June with satellite radio giant Sirius XM, which agreed to pay $210 million.\nPandora's decision to mend ties with the music industry could open up the possibility of direct deals for international expansion or new products, said Stifel analyst John Egbert, in a note to investors.\nPandora Media Inc. has had to contend with rival Apple Music, which launched this summer. Despite the competition, the company said listener hours grew 3 percent to 5.14 billion from last year's third quarter.\nThe Oakland, California, company posted a third-quarter loss of $85.9 million. While revenue rose 30 percent to $311.6 million, it still came up short of Wall Street forecasts.\nThe stock fell, $5.17 to $14.02 in premarket trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:57:23.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
