Damian White Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Three federal Labor frontbenchers are looking to switch seats before the next federal election as a product of widespread upheaval caused by the redistribution of electorates in NSW.\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen, shadow infrastructure minister Anthony Albanese and shadow agriculture minister Joel Fitzgibbon are all eyeing neighbouring seats after a draft decision of the Australian Electoral Commission to abolish Mr Fitzgibbon's Hunter Valley seat and make significant changes to the boundaries of other electorates across the state.\nMr Bowen's western Sydney seat of McMahon has been rendered marginal and approaches have been made to Chris Hayes, who holds the neighbouring seat of Fowler, to move aside.\nMr Hayes is believed to be reluctant to shift, more so given he significantly improved Labor's hold on Fowler at the last election in the face of a national swing against the ALP.\nAnthony Albanese, who holds the inner western Sydney seat of Grayndler, now lives in the neighbouring seat of Barton. Alex Ellinghausen Also, Mr Hayes was forced to shift from Werriwa to Fowler before the 2010 election to make way for Laurie Ferguson who lost his seat in the last NSW redistribution. Sources said Mr Ferguson is telling colleagues he will retire at the next election but the Left controls his seat and Mr Hayes, from the Right, would not be able to move back.\nFurther complicating matters is that the NSW branch of the Health Services Union is looking to reaffiliate with Labor and the Right faction. Mr Hayes' brother, Gerard, is the union's state secretary and poor treatment of his brother may jeopardise the reaffiliation and impact the Right's numbers.\nAlbanese now lives in Barton Closer to the city, Mr Albanese, who holds the inner-western, Sydney seat of Grayndler, now has his home and office in the neighbouring seat of Barton after the draft redistribution.\nShadow Treasurer Chris Bowen's western Sydney seat of McMahon has been rendered marginal. Andrew Meares Barton had been previously held by Labor's Robert McClelland but fell to the Liberal's Nickolas Varvaris at the 2013 election.\nThe redistribution has rendered it a notional Labor seat. Grayndler is still a relatively safe Labor seat as well and Mr Albanese has the numbers in the branches of both electorates to win pre-selection.\nBut given he now lives in Barton, he, like others, is awaiting the outcome of the AEC's final decision on the redistribution due in February. However, people are preparing to move in anticipation that the final redistribution will not change much, if at all, from the draft.\nIn the Hunter Valley, Mr Fitzgibbon's seat of Hunter was abolished and the name given to the nearby seat of Charlton, held by Labor's Pat Conroy. Under a deal being pushed by Mr Fitzgibbon and his Right faction, Mr Fitzgibbon would move into Mr Conroy's seat and Mr Conroy would shift to the neighbouring seat of Shortland, held by Labor's Jill Hall. Although Ms Hall has made no such announcement, sources say she is expected to retire at the next election.\nSources said Mr Conroy is resisting moving. He cancelled an overseas trip on the weekend to stay home and sort the matter out. He believes Mr Fitzgibbon should move to nearby Paterson. It is held by Liberal MP Bob Baldwin but has become marginal after the redistribution.\nHowever, Mr Conroy, from the Left, could agree to make way for Mr Fitzgibbon and move to Shortland, but only if the Right agrees to play clean and not try to disrupt Mr Albanese moving to Barton.\nWhile Mr Albanese has the numbers to win pre-selection in Barton and does not intend to be part of any deal, one source warned the Right could \"kick up a stink\" in the build-up to the election.\nOne MP, unimpressed with the musical chairs, said it was a bad sign for people to be bailing out of marginal seats, especially in Western Sydney, just because Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:01:59.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
