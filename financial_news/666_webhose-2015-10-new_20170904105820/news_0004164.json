Analyst Highlights Media Role for Peace in Liberia Blog Researchers at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) are taking steps to strengthen relationships with leading experts on development in China, as part of an overall strategy to generate high quality research and knowledge in partnership, with those at the heart of change in global development. China is stepping up its engagement in global development, with President Xi Jinping pledging billions of dollars in aid and investments at last month's UN Summit, and playing a leadership role in the launch of two major new financial institutions, the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development (BRICS) Bank, which will be based in Shanghai. President Xi's visit to the UK this week signifies the growing importance of the UK-China relationship, and top of agenda will be discussions on how the two countries can work together on global issues such as climate change and tackling poverty. Earlier this year IDS, launched the Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development, to build on its work in both China and other rising powers such as India and Brazil, and a Sustainability Hub in Beijing as part of the STEPS Centre. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Development Research Center of the State Council of the People's Republic of China (DRC), and later this week, IDS will be receiving a delegation of researchers from the DRC to further discuss mutual research interests and build an agenda for strengthened cooperation. IDS has been invited to become a Founding Member of the new Silk Road Think Tank Network (SiLKS), which will be launched in Madrid at the end of this month. IDS is also due to launch a partnership with the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences on adapting health and welfare systems to a context of rapid change. IDS Director, Professor Melissa Leach said: \"Rising powers such as China have an increasingly important role to play as we move into a new era of global development defined by the Global Goals for sustainable development and a new climate change agreement due to be agreed later in the year. At IDS, our work on rising powers and global development provides a unique body of evidence around lessons learnt from countries such as China, India and Brazil's own rapid development, their contribution to others' development through South-South Cooperation and their influence on global governance, development finance and technological innovation.\" IDS is at the heart of global research hubs which are already collaborating with colleagues in China, other rising powers such as India and Brazil as well as in Africa to generate new evidence and practical policy guidance to address complex global challenges. Key areas of research focus are currently: Agriculture Development finance and new financial institutions Energy and sustainability Restructuring global governance -- Notes to Editors: Countries like China and India, which have experienced rapid economic growth over the last 40 years, are hailed by economists, such as recent Nobel Prize winner Angus Deaton, as development success stories. They are also become increasingly committed to supporting development in other countries through their own aid programmes and international initiatives such as the recently launched Asia Infrastructure Investment Development Bank, led by China and to which the UK has committed $3.1 billion. However, China, India, Brazil and others still considering themselves as \"developing\" and continue experience high levels of extreme poverty, rising levels of inequality and significant environmental challenges. The Institute of Development Studies (IDS) is a leading global institution for development research, teaching and learning, and impact and communications, based at the University of Sussex. Our vision is a world in which poverty does not exist, social justice prevails and economic growth is focused on improving human wellbeing. We believe that research knowledge can drive the change that must happen in order for this vision to be realised. See www.ids.ac.uk for more information. The Centre for Rising Powers and Global Development was launched in Beijing in April 2015, and builds on the work of the DFID-funded Rising Powers in International Development programme. CRPD conducts and facilitates research on the impact of the BRICS and other rapidly-changing and increasingly influential middle-income countries on low-income countries, the need for the restructuring of global development institutions and global public goods, such as the environment, food, and health, and the future of Development Studies. See www.rising-powers.org for more information. The STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement centre uniting development studies with science and technology studies. Our cross-cutting work covers agriculture & food; energy & climate change; health & disease and water & sanitation. See http://steps-centre.org/about/global/steps-china/ for more information on the China Sustainability Hub. The Development Research Center of the State Council (DRC) is a policy research and consulting institution directly under the State Council, the central government of the People's Republic of China. Its major function is to conduct advanced research on the overall, comprehensive, strategic and long-term issues in the economic and social development, as well as relevant key and hot problems related to reform and opening up and provide policy options and consulting advice to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council.
