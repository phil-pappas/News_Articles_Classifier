Relate/PCI specifically addresses the problem of ensuring that customer private data is not inadvertently used in testing or development or exposed to malicious entities. The product helps companies seeking PCI certification ensure compliance with sections 3, 6, 7, 8, and 11 of the PCI standards by using security access controls, fingerprinting, and data masking technologies. “PCI DSS compliance can't be achieved with just one policy or technology. Relate/PCI is one powerful piece of the larger puzzle,” says Andrew Mould, Managing Partner at Ascert. “Many of our customers are very large financial institutions that need to ensure that they are using every possible means to secure private customer information. Relate/PCI helps them to do that by adding security controls and data masking technology for sensitive information; while ensuring data integrity for use in analyzing production data for various test and troubleshooting activities.”\nThe product also supports the intelligent extract of data from production data using the same masking technology to ensure representative, but compliant, test files for use in systems and performance testing. The Relate/PCI Edition employs fail-safe protocols to eliminate accidental use of customer private information in test systems and ensure that data security is not compromised by malicious entities. Additionally, the smart fingerprinting feature allows differentiation within a file between sensitive and non-sensitive data, providing finer resolution and greater confidence to file integrity checks.\nTo find out more about Ascertified, VersaTest, and Relate products, visit the Ascert web site or contact a local Ascert office.\nAbout Ascert:\nAscert is recognized as a leading provider of premier testing software solutions.
