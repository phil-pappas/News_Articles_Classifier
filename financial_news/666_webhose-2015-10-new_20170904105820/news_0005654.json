If the warrant issue price of Rs 14 is taken into account, the premium over the capital market regulator’s formula would be 25 per cent, they added.\nOn NCDs, the filing said 5,000 debentures of face value of Rs one crore each due in March 2017, for cash at par aggregating to Rs 5,000 crore carry an annual coupon rate of 1.43 per cent.\nFor each NCD, 7300 warrants have been allocated.\n“The maximum dilution that could take place in future, assuming that all the warrants are converted into equity shares of the Corporation at the warrant exercise price, would be up to 2.20 per cent of the expanded equity share capital of the Corporation,” the filing said.\nNCDs and warrants have been allocated only to domestic QIBs, it added.\nThe issuance of warrants and NCDs were managed by Kotak Mahindra Capital, Axis Bank, Axis Capital, Citigroup, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, ICICI Securities, IDFC Securities, IndusInd Bank and JM Financial.\nFirst Published on October 01, 2015 11:07 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:46:22.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
