Getty Images Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Joe Aston It's a stunning Sydney morning, but at Fratelli Paradiso I'm slumped wretchedly at the very same table I was bestrewed across barely eight hours previously. I dare swallow only a few mouthfuls of breakfast. Mopping burning brow with trembling wrist, the sapphire crystal face of my Tag Heuer Monza Calibre 36 is coated with a vinicultured dew.\nI'd go back to bed if I could, but Dad's expecting us for lunch, and the run down to his place takes at least two hours. Anyhow, from this intensity of physical and psychic pain, only an anaesthetist could wrest sleep.\nJourney's Don't Stop Believin' billows up Challis Avenue several seconds ahead of my sister Madeline. Never one for a low-key entrance, she is holding a rock concert in my Range Rover. Maddie pulls up outside FP, its footpath diners regarding me (and this locomotive Allphones Arena) askance, my high-speed getaway foiled when her boyfriend, Dylan, can't figure out how to unlock the back passenger door. In the fullness of humiliating time, I prise open the deafening chariot and haul myself in, as noxious tendrils of stomach gases lick the roof of my mouth.\nRoad trip to Nowra The first thing I do is pull rank and install myself as DJ, cueing Beach House's new album, Depression Cherry . We float down the coast, on semi-aniline Cirrus leather, to dreamy pop, stopping only in Berry for armpits full of Saint Andrieu rosé (\"the best rosé you'll ever buy,\" claims our wine merchant, Justin Lill. \"Good enough to make you cry!\") and nerve-settling schooners at the Great Southern.\nDad had emailed us the previous evening. \"I'm looking forward to being with you all tomorrow. I've bought plenty of refreshments so don't bother stopping on the way down [our disobedience has continued into adulthood]. Lunch will comprise fresh sandwiches and fruits. Dinner will be a tender veal stroganoff with gluten-free pasta and a side salad. Rod [his brother] will be joining us for afternoon salutations and dinner. We'll have a good wake for Nanny Pat in style. Yours in anticipation.\"\nI've buried the lead here: Dad's (and Rod's) mother had passed away the previous morning, so her grandchildren can't wait to give her son a hug – which is the first thing we do, in his driveway. He is stoic for his kidlets. Then he steps away and beholds the Rangie.\nDad meets the Rangie \"This Daddio, is the new Vogue Special Edition Sports Diesel V6 Hybrid. Fuel efficiency of the V6; power of the V8.\" Admiration is unmistakable on my father's kind, seamed face.\nWhile Dad prepares the sandwiches and fruits, Dylan and I sneak off to the North Nowra Tavern for a few bets on the Caulfield Guineas and the Stakes at Randwick. \"It's a day for favourites,\" Dylan predicts. Naturally, it turns out to be a day for despised outsiders. I lose my shirt.\nAnd those sandwiches! The Bakers Delight loaf of thin-sliced wholemeal cut lovingly into triangular quarters, smeared generously with Lurpak butter, and enfolding honeyed ham and pre-sliced cheese. Just as I remembered them. Visions of piano lessons, the depthless mundanity of the school library and enfeebling afternoon hunger (Mum padlocked the pantry – her budgetary prerogatives left us with nothing edible in reach bar the jar of self-raising flour). The Saint Andrieu doesn't make us cry, but sharing this time with Dad, I oscillate between fearful melancholy and soaring comfort.\nA safe bet My old man is an eccentric cat – always has been. When he retired two years ago, he asked me what he should do with his superannuation lump sum. I suggested a spread of conservative managed funds. \"Oh no, that's dangerous,\" he submitted, instead buying 21 soft drink vending machines and a mint 1999 Mercedes-Benz E240 he's named Warren, cleans regularly with a microfibre cloth, but rarely drives. The workhorse of his garage is the Hyundai van he calls his \"steel tent\". It fits a mattress in the back, and Dad has an irrational aversion to flying.\nThe Coke machines are the kind I haven't seen since the first Back to the Future instalment – the one set in 1955. In the steel tent, Dad orbits greater Nowra in low gear, hunting for the cheapest slab of the black doctor (and the occasional sixer of Cream soda or Sunkist), and lugs leaden bags of gold coins to his credit union. At 62, a budding entrepreneur.\nAnd his stroganoff is simply outstanding. I eat three servings, to the fascinated revulsion of the entire table. And we toast my Nanny Pat. Several times. And I think to myself: what a good son he was, my Daddio. Not a bad Dad either.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjoeaston", "https://plus.google.com/+JoeAston"], "published": "2015-10-16T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:05:39.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
