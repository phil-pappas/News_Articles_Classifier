Joe Heider, ChFC and founder of Cirrus Wealth Management, notes that \"poor credit can negatively impact your monthly cash flow, but it can also profoundly impact your life by preventing you from getting the job that you want.\" So the cost of poor credit isn't just measured in dollars and cents -- it's measured in your quality of life as well. \nThe Biggest Cost Will Be Your Interest Rates \nSure, you probably know in some abstract sense that having bad credit means you're going to be paying more in interest. But just how much more? Rakesh Gupta, a professor at Adelphi University's Robert B. Willumstad School of Business, points out that the better interest rates on a credit card hover around 12%. For $10,000 of an unpaid balance, that's $1,200 a year in interest alone -- but it jumps up to $2,900 once you get into the penalty APR range. And again, that's just the interest.

The problem is that \"lots of people pay only the minimum payment.\" This means that you're effectively paying for small purchases over a period of 20 years or more. That's more than just the interest payment that year. \"It quickly turns into tens of thousands of dollars,\" he said. \nSo what do you do? You negotiate a low interest rate . Negotiating the principal down is virtually impossible when it comes to the original creditor. But you still can negotiate the interest rate down, especially if you have been taking steps to improve your credit. \"If your credit score has improved and they won't give you a better rate, start looking for a new card,\" Gupta says. There are some minor negative effects to your credit score from switching cards, but they can easily be offset by the positive impact (a lower credit utilization rate, for example). More importantly, it's going to save you thousands of dollars. \nHeider says that negotiating a lower rate might be easier than you think. He says that once your credit starts improving, you should expect a lot of offers at introductory rates that will put whatever your credit card company is giving you now to shame. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:34:05.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
