Daniel_Kraus by Jacquie Hayes I'm looking forward to car prices in Australia coming down. Not that they haven't already in real terms.\nI was reminded of this during a recent family holiday in Bora Bora. We were on a boat at the time, circumnavigating the dramatic peaks of the French Polynesian island, when my eight-year-old son asked me how the cars motoring along the road that rings it got to be there.\nNot without a great deal of expense, I might have answered, given that cars, like everything else on Bora Bora, have to be imported from far away.\nPenalty of being remote Luxury boats make more sense than luxury cars in Bora Bora. Getty Images It's a notion we Australians, in our own island nation, understand all too well. The layers of import, transport and tax costs lumped on goods arriving from offshore are the penalty of being remote.\nAs far as cars are concerned, the most onerous cost Australians face is the home-grown tax on luxury models.\nIf sense prevails, when 2017 rolls around that tax – applied at 33 per cent on vehicles above the hardly luxurious price of $68,184 – will go away as the last of the Australian car manufacturers it was designed to protect close their doors.\nEven before Toyota, Holden and Ford were on the chopping block, former Treasury head Ken Henry's 2010 tax review recommended abolishing the luxury car tax.\n Doing so could hardly be perceived as the government looking after its rich mates, given so many of the cars hit by the tax are bought because they've got seven seats – think of the Toyota Prado – and families want to drive to Ayers Rock.\nForce price competition There's no guarantee the tax will go away, however. In fact, the authorities have been exploring changing legislation to allow parallel imports of cars, which is another way to force price competition on local car dealerships.\nGrey imports, as they're also known, would allow private buyers to bring in new or used cars from offshore rather than via a manufacturer's official distribution system.\nThe idea is to create a freer marker and force dealerships to lower their prices. But this assumes that cars here really are overpriced and that offshore cars are always cheaper, and this is not necessarily the case.\nPotential buyers who think they've found a bargain in the United Kingdom, for example, need to be aware that they're probably not comparing like products. Australia has the most highly specified cars in the world.\nNever standard in other markets Unveiling BMW's new 7-Series flagship sedan in Australia in August, managing director Marc Werner made a big deal of the fact it has more features that come as standard than in any other market in the world.\nMercedes-Benz spokesman David McCarthy says the standard equipment fitted in cars here is never standard in other markets.\n\"You can't compare an $80,000 C-Class here to one in the UK without specification-matching it,\" he says. \"The first part of any global comparison needs to be, 'let's match the specification with another right-hand-drive market'.\"\nDifferent regulations apply to left- and right-hand-drive cars.\n\"If [buyers] think they can get a [comparable] C-Class out of the US for $30,000 … it's got seats in it, that's about it,\" McCarthy says.\nA worthwhile exercise? Even then, the risks are many, and the costs and complications of importing privately should have many wondering if the exercise is really worthwhile.\nIt may be hard to determine, for example, if a vehicle has been stolen, if it's been involved in a serious accident or whether it's still under finance in its country of origin. In the case of a recall, buyers outside the relevant market may be lucky to find out about it. Even then, they may end up with a car in which the navigation equipment and radio don't work, and featuring cooling systems and tow kits that are not designed or calibrated for Australian conditions.\nUltimately, few people could come out ahead. McCarthy says his company has crunched the numbers and importing independently starts to make sense only on cars sold for more than $150,000.\n\"Under that figure, there's really nothing in it,\" he says. \"The people at the top end of town could benefit, but you're talking about a couple of thousand cars a year in a market of just over a million [cars sold].\"\nAffordability high But are cars really that expensive here? Research from Commsec suggests not. It shows new-car affordability here is at a 38-year high thanks to strong competition and record-low interest rates.\nMcCarthy says Mercedes-Benz's just-released C63, which is priced at $154,900 (including taxes and import duty), is probably worth half what its \"grandson\", the C36, sold for 20 years ago.\n\"The C36 was introduced to Australia in 1996 for $155,000,\" he says. \"Twenty years on, we are introducing a car that has twice the power, is twice as good, and is laden with life-saving technology. In 1996 dollars, it probably costs about $70,000 so it's effectively half the price, and that's even before you take into account average weekly earnings.\"\nSixty-four brands sell cars in Australia, today considered the most competitive car market in the world. We're buying more cars than ever before and automotive companies are vying for a larger percentage of the 1.1 million annual sales.\nGrowing success Prestige brands – on whose cars buyers pay the highest luxury taxes – are doing better than most. They're doing so well, in fact, that the growing success of their annual sales has the global car industry referring to Australia as \"Treasure Island\".\nAccording to the latest year-to-date sales figures from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Lamborghini was up 361 per cent, Ferrari 75 per cent, Porsche 65 per cent and McLaren 53 per cent.\nMcCarthy maintains that the margins car manufacturers work on are pretty tight.\n\"If you want to call a return-on-sales figure of 5 to 6 per cent excessive, go ahead,\" he says. \"There are lots of other industries operating on much bigger margins than that.\"\nIntroducing grey imports won't change the market, but it could have a whole lot of unintended consequences.\nIf the government really wants cheaper cars, stroke of a pen, guys: drop the luxury car tax. Remove it and the need for grey imports will evaporate.\nThey make about as much sense anyway as a high-rise on Bora Bora.", "external_links": ["https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Luxury-car-tax-rate-and-thresholds/", "http://www.industry.gov.au/industry/IndustrySectors/automotive/Pages/default.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-08T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:42:10.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
