Photo: AP\nThe US dropped insider-trading charges against Michael Steinberg, a former fund manager at SAC Capital Advisors who was convicted by a federal jury, in the latest fallout from a major appeals court ruling that made such prosecutions more difficult.\nThe government also abandoned charges against six people who pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors, US Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement Thursday. Prosecutors have now dismissed or lost on appeal 14 of 87 convictions won during a six-year crackdown on insider trading.\nThe decision follows the US Supreme Court's refusal this month to review the appeals-court ruling, which overturned the convictions of two fund managers.\n\"Based on legal developments subsequent to the defendant's guilty plea, the government has concluded that further prosecution would not be in the interests of justice,\" prosecutors wrote in a memo to US District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan.\nThe dismissal caps a 3 1/2-year ordeal for Steinberg, who was the longest-serving employee at SAC Capital to be convicted in the US probe of insider trading. Steinberg, who handled technology, media and telecommunications stocks at SAC Capital's Sigma Capital Management unit, was found guilty in 2013 of an insider scheme involving tech stocks that garnered more than $US1.8 million in profits. He was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison.\nSAC pleaded guilty in 2013 and paid a record $US1.8 billion fine to resolve US claims over insider trading. It changed its name to Point72 Asset Management LP and agreed to manage only founder Steven Cohen's money. Cohen wasn't charged with wrongdoing.\n\"We are pleased that the ordeal for Mike Steinberg and his family is over,\" Mark Herr, a spokesman for Point72, said in a statement.\nThe December appeals court ruling overturned convictions of fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. Once the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, Steinberg renewed his request to have his case tossed, arguing his conviction was based on essentially the same evidence.\n\"Michael Steinberg did not commit any crime and is an innocent man,\" his lawyer, Barry Berke, said in an email. \"We hope that his vindication will receive as much attention as his wrongful prosecution.\"\nAmong those who had their cases dropped were Spyridon \"Sam\" Adondakis, a Level Global Investors LP analyst who worked for Chiasson; Jon Horvath, who worked for Steinberg at SAC; and Jesse Tortora, who worked for Newman at Diamondback Capital Management LLC.\nThe three were part of a group of analysts and insiders at technology companies who socialised and were accused of funnelling tips about technology companies to their fund manager bosses.\nThe group also included Danny Kuo, who worked at wealth-management company Whittier Trust Co; Sandeep \"Sandy\" Goyal, a Neuberger Berman analyst who once worked at Dell and Hyung Lim, a former Altera Corp executive. Prosecutors dropped their cases as well.\nIt's rare, but not unprecedented, for prosecutors to abandon charges against cooperators who have pleaded guilty, after they drop a case against the chief target. Sullivan must still formally dismiss the cases.\n\"This was obviously the right and just decision,\" Steven Peikin, a lawyer for Horvath, said in a telephone interview.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday dropped its civil lawsuit against five of six cooperators, Diamondback and Level Global.\nThe appeals court ruling was a blow to Bharara, who targeted fund managers, corporate insiders and consultants. The decision raised the bar for prosecutions stemming from information passed by a corporate insider to a friend, relative or business associate.\nIn the December 10 ruling tossing the fund managers' convictions, the appeals court said that, to be found guilty of insider trading, defendants must know their tips came from someone who not only had a duty to keep the information secret but also got a benefit for leaking it.\nThe case is US v. Steinberg, 14-2141, US Second Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:04:23.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
