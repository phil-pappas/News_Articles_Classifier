KMB were up 0.4% on Oct 23, following reports that the consumer products giant is in advanced talks to acquire the diaper unit of Hypermarcas SA, the biggest producer of personal care goods in Brazil, as per Reuters. Though the financial details are not known now, the deal could be announced in the coming days.\nSão Paulo-based Hypermarcas had hired Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Banco Bradesco BBI to find alternatives for the diaper unit, per reports. Apart from Kimberly-Clark, Hypermarcas had also offered the unit to a group of companies that included Chile's Empresas CMPC SA, Procter & Gamble Co PG and Svenska Cellulosa SCA AB.\nHypermarcas reportedly wants to exit the diaper unit due to a lack of scale, brand recognition and the rising cost of imported materials for the product amid a sharp drop in Brazil's currency. All these reasons have been deteriorating the performance of the unit lately.\nOn the other hand, we note that Kimberly-Clark’s diaper segment has been witnessing lower market share and higher competitive promotional activity. Kimberly-Clark’s Huggies diapers are competing with Procter & Gamble’s cheaper Luvs and upscale Pampers offerings. It is also noted that parents are shifting away from Huggies and buying either less expensive or premium diaper offerings. This is hurting the company’s market share. Therefore, if the deal materializes, it would help boost Kimberly-Clark’s diaper business.\nOverall, Kimberly-Clark’s profits have been aided by its cost saving initiatives and continued product innovation. The company also achieved higher organic sales on the back of volume growth and better pricing in the last few consecutive quarters.\nRecently, Kimberly-Clark posted better-than-expected results for the third quarter of 2015 and raised the low end of its previous guidance range for full-year adjusted earnings and organic sales growth, despite currency headwinds.\nAdjusted earnings of $1.51 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 by 1.3% and increased 0.7% from the year-ago figure of $1.50 per share. Sales of $4.72 billion in the third quarter easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion by 1.5%. However, it declined 6.7% from the prior-year quarter due to foreign currency headwinds. Excluding the aforementioned headwinds, organic sales grew 5% from the prior-year quarter, mainly driven by volume gain of 5%.\nKimberly-Clark has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nBetter-ranked stocks in the consumer staples sector include Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. OLLI and Flower Foods, Inc. FLO. Both of them hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days .
