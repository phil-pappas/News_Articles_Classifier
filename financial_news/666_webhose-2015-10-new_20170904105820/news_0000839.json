Comments such as \"Kenya is broke\", \"Kenya has too much debt\", \"the Kenyan economy is on its knees\", \"Kenya can't feed itself\" have dominated our conversations. As we made these comments, we appeared to forget the world sees us as one of the fastest growing economies. And while we have every right to express ourselves on issues facing the country, we must be careful not to drive away potential investors while at it. We have a duty to safeguard our reputation as the largest and most competitive economy in the region. This is because we need this reputation intact to be able to remain in this position and grow. We have our challenges which I will address below, but we can't face these challenges while we are engaged in a negative gear. We should engage a positive attitude that can help us sit back and engage the forward gear. Kenya is now middle-income economy with a GDP of US$53.3 billion with GDP per capita at US$1,246. And is one of the African economies that can boast a diversified and balanced economy. Recently, we learnt we are the third fastest growing economy in the world and the largest non-mineral driven economy in Sub-Saharan Africa. So, what is ailing our economy? Why are we not able to meet all our needs on time? In my opinion, and which I believe is shared by many Kenyans, corruption, wastage of public resources and lack of proper priorities are some of the things that are ailing our economy. Of course, we have those that we can't control such as the state of the global economy, public debts that are maturing and low collection of taxes. Also, we are involved in putting in place key capital projects that are taking up a lot of resources and whose benefits are not immediate. But these projects are key to development of the country and thus we cannot do without them. Kenya has over the years lost billions of shillings through corrupt deals denying the country the much needed money for delivery of development and services. Many have escaped punishments as multi-billion scandals remain unsolved to date - some stretching to decades. Corruption is a cancer that it threatening to kill Kenya through the loss of public funds, and must therefore be tackled with all that can be employed. No individual, regardless of their position in government including the President, should be allowed to misuse or steal public funds. Similarly, corruption seems to have been devolved as reports from most counties point to a feeding frenzy despite the annual audit queries to check this blatant looting of the public purse. There is hardly a county assembly left that has not seen a stand-off over looting in some form or other. Surely, this is not the covenant we as leaders made with the Kenyan voter! Getting to the other issue straining our economy, there is nothing that annoys Kenyans than revelations of misappropriation or wastage of their taxes. Kenyans are a hardworking lot and deserve to have every coin that they give as tax utilised well. It is therefore understandable when those on Twitter express their outrage whether the wastage is reported at the national or the county level. The outrage is that of citizenry that is tired of seeing their country being run down through unnecessary and at times selfish spending by their leaders. Strict and prudent public finance management is critical and key to ensuring economic growth in the country. It is therefore critical that all those in public offices take every measure to ensuring that public resources are well utilised. We must also tighten the law to control unnecessary expenditures such as multiple benchmarking trips abroad that have no measurable benefit. The law must be tightened to ensure those who abuse privileges that come with being in a public office are surcharged for whatever can be proven to be wastage. The other thing that is ailing our economy and which we must deal with urgently is aligning our priorities to our development goals. This can only be tackled if we carry out a social-economic audit to establish if we are really spending for growth or consumption. A social-economic audit will also help us establish whether the governance structure we have in place is affordable and sustainable in the long-run. It will also help us establish whether we have a bloated public service and what we can do to make it lean and affordable. This will help us deal with the ever ballooning wage bill that is eating up almost 60 per cent of our revenues annually. This has in the process left us with little money to use for development and this is not sustainable. We must prioritise development as this is the only way that we will grow the economy and as a result create the much needed employment opportunities. Development will also make us more competitive globally and make us a destination for investment. The writer is a political and communications consultant.
