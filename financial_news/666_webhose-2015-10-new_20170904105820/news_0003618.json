( GM - Get Report ) stock is gaining 1.52% to $35.96 in afternoon trading on Friday after the United Auto Workers union chose the Detroit automaker for the next round of bargaining after workers ratified the new contract with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) yesterday.\nThe previous four-year contract between GM and UAW was extended on September 14.\nAdditionally, GM announced it will eliminate a shift and about 500 jobs at the Lake Orion plant near Detroit, Reuters reports.\n\nThe plant produces the Buick Verano and the Chevrolet Sonic, two small vehicles whose sales have had double-digit drops this year as lower gasoline prices increase demand for larger cars.\nThe Lake Orion plant will add the electric vehicle Bolt to its production, while production of the Verano is expected to move to China late next year, a source told Reuters .\nLake Orion workers will have the opportunity to transfer to the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, where the company will nearly double the workforce to 2,800 people and add a second shift by next year, a GM spokeswoman told Reuters .\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings team rates GENERAL MOTORS CO as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:\nWe rate GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, notable return on equity, good cash flow from operations and growth in earnings per share. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had generally high debt management risk by most measures that we evaluated.\nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows:\nThe stock has not only risen over the past year, it has done so at a faster pace than the S&P 500, reflecting the earnings growth and other positive factors similar to those we have cited here. Looking ahead, unless broad bear market conditions prevail, we still see more upside potential for this stock, despite the fact that it has already risen over the past year. Current return on equity exceeded its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of strength within the company. In comparison to the other companies in the Automobiles industry and the overall market, GENERAL MOTORS CO's return on equity significantly exceeds that of the industry average and is above that of the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 204.04% to $3,308.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, GENERAL MOTORS CO has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 8.68%. Regardless of the drop in revenue, the company managed to outperform against the industry average of 7.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 1.0%. The declining revenue has not hurt the company's bottom line, with increasing earnings per share. GENERAL MOTORS CO's earnings per share improvement from the most recent quarter was slightly positive. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, GENERAL MOTORS CO reported lower earnings of $1.64 versus $2.35 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.55 versus $1.64).
