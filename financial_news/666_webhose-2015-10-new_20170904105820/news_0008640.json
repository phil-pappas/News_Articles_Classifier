Photo: Dallas Kilponen\nA pilot program allowing taxpayers to self-assess by giving big four accounting firms –rather than Australian Taxation Office officers – the ability to sign off on their information has been successful and could be rolled out more widely, the tax authority says.\nThe ATO has run a pilot – the external compliance assurance process (ECAP) – that has allowed a sample of companies, with annual turnover of between $100 million and $5 billion, the choice of using a registered company auditor or the ATO to clarify factual matters identified by the ATO.\nBetween January 2014 and January 2015, they were used to \"reconcile and agree factual data in the financial and tax accounts of large businesses\", not undertake an audit, the ATO said.\nThe pilot involved 56 taxpayers and assured about $1.1 billion in income, deductions and tax losses, the ATO said.\nAdvertisement Based on the feedback of the companies and auditors that participated, the ATO said it had been a success and could be rolled out for companies earning less than $100 million turnover.\n\"The pilot proved that these approaches can offer an enhanced client experience, reduce red tape, offer clients greater control over their business compliance obligations while providing certainty to clients more quickly,\" the ATO said.\nResource pressure Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan has repeatedly said that ECAP is not an audit, but several people, including former ATO staff, have been highly critical of allowing big four firms, which, for decades, have been the architects of tax minimisation schemes, to conduct such assessments of taxpayer information.\nNevertheless, the ATO appears to be in favour of extending the project.\nIt said a review of the pilot yielded great results.\n\"Our assessment is that the appropriate use of agreed upon procedures provides an option for a more efficient use of our resources,\" the agency said.\nThe ATO has been under pressure after thousands of job cuts in recent years . It will face more cuts in the coming year.\nA steering group – made up of ATO staff and auditing professional bodies – was established for the pilot period and provided advice and guidance, the ATO said.\n\"ECAP reports from auditors were of a high standard and integrity checking found excellent record and file keeping practices,\" the ATO said.\nOn average, an ECAP was completed in 87 days and an ATO review in 93 days, it said.\nConflicts of interest However, the process has been criticised by ATO staff who say it's like \"Caesar investigating Caesar\", or \"giving the keys to the vault to the thieves\" .\nAt a Senate economics references committee hearing in April, Mr Jordan said it was possible that the timing of having big four firms involved might have been off.\nPwC recently came under fire for tax schemes devised between 2002 and 2010 that had become known as the Luxembourg Leaks scandal.\n\"Maybe the time is not right for an ECAP program,\" Mr Jordan said in testimony at the April hearing. \"It is something we think is good and it is something that we think is efficient, but perhaps the timing in the community is just not right for it.\"\nOne ATO staff member pointed out how, in light of PwC's role as the architect of Luxembourg schemes , it seemed \"incredulous that the ATO would: a) continue to hire them as consultants; and b) continue to consider ECAP an ethically sound proposition\".\nAnd former​ ATO officer Martin Locke has criticised the move to self-regulation under ECAP, saying it could result in serious conflicts of interest .\nFewer fishing expeditions However, the ATO said \"several taxpayers\" had commented that the ECAP had rid the process of the \"ATO fishing net approach and zeros in on the specific issue clearly, giving taxpayers certainty of the ATO's concern\".\nIt was also more cost-effective for the ATO and could be rolled out for companies earning less than $100 million turnover, as well as those earning more.\n\"Broadening ECAP to smaller companies appears feasible based on [the] current operation of financial report and audit requirements and feedback,\" the ATO said.\n\"From our perspective, the process used in the pilot has potential to deliver a cost-effective assurance, particularly with regard to the lower consequence population.\"\nIn terms of companies earning more than $5 billion in turnover, the ATO said it would have \"limited potential due to the issues experienced in that sector being more likely to require law interpretation rather than examination of factual matters\".\n\"However there is potential for inclusion of ECAP in relation to the overall tailored compliance engagement approach for all Public Groups & International taxpayers,\" it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:17:44.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
