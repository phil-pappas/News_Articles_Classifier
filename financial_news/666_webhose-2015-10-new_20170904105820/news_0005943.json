Ian Waldie by Shaun Drummond Patrick Commins Clancy Yeates Bank investors are confident the big four will use their market power to protect profits and shareholder returns by pushing the costs of higher bank capital onto customers.\nAhead of a week when the major banks are expected to report combined earnings of about $30 billion this financial year, fund managers dismissed comments from the banking regulator that they should lower expectations.\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres last Friday said that rules that have forced banks to hold more capital have made them safer and as such investors should \"require marginally less return\".\nFund managers told The Australian Financial Review that while \"in theory\" they agreed with Mr Byres, they would not be rushing out to sell their bank shares.\n\"It makes sense in financial theory, but when you combine that with a very strong oligopoly, I don't know the elegant financial theory works out in practice,\" Aurora Funds Management portfolio manager Hugh Dive said.\n\"I've been observing banks for a long time and they have been extraordinarily effective in passing costs on through to customers because of the oligopoly structure.\"\nThe debate about whether customers or shareholders should bear the cost of policies intended to strengthen the banks' resilience against potential financial shocks intensified last week.\nANZ Banking Group, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank of Australia all followed the shock move by Westpac Banking Group to raise variable home loan rates, in an attempt to offset some of the drag on their returns from tougher capital rules, which dampen profitability.\n The increases, which have ranged from 0.15 percentage points for CBA to 0.2 percentage points for Westpac, are likely to boost the big four's combined earnings by about $1 billion.\nThe Coalition has defended the banks' commercial imperative to raise rates, while also criticising the actions. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the level of rate rises was not sufficiently justified and Treasurer Scott Morrison highlighted the \"handsome\" returns banks make. Opposition leader Bill Shorten grabbed the opportunity to claim the Coalition was \"soft on banks\".\nThe return on equity of the big four is between 14 and 18 per cent, while the regionals is between 9 and 11 per cent, according to Bell Potter bank analyst TS Lim.\nWatermark Funds Management analyst Omkar Joshi​ said lower returns were unlikely and noted that Westpac had committed to an ROE above 15 per cent. \"The banks are wedded to higher returns and have made it very clear they will keep returns where they are,\" he said. \"And that is at the expense of the customer.\"\n\"You're never happy to take a lower return as an investor in any company. Obviously if management tries to maintain returns for shareholders at the expense of customers then that is a positive for shareholders. But you don't want to just go and gouge customers, there needs to be some sort of balance.\"\nRecord Profits Customers may have more grounds to complain this week as NAB, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is predicted to report profits of $6.26 billion, while ANZ Bank's profit is tipped to hit $7.29 billion on Thursday.\nBank profit margins and any signs of worsening bad debts will be in the spotlight of the full-year result announcements. While the rate hikes or \"repricing\" will not impact on the banks' upcoming results, the market is likely to scrutinise how bank lending margins are faring in the face of fierce competition in home lending.\n\"For the major banks, we see mortgage repricing as essential to restoring profitability and preserving dividends per share,\" Citi analyst Craig Williams said in a note.\nNAB and ANZ executives are also likely to face questions over the extent to which banks can sustain the sector's highly prized dividends by passing on higher capital costs when they deliver full-year results to the market.\nGeorge Boubouras, chief investment officer at Contango Asset Management, said the lowering of returns was \"a very reasonable assumption to have\" but remained confident dividends would continue to grow.\n\"The total return won't be like the last couple of decades,\" he said. \"There will be lower earnings growth and a larger proportion will come from income, which works into the super fund change in demand over that period.\"\nMr Boubouras said Westpac's ROE target was \"ambitious\". \"The regionals and the majors – the ROEs are going to converge – and therefore there is upside in the ROE in the decade ahead at the regionals,\" he said.\nArgo Investments managing director Jason Beddow said returns may be buffeted by future capital raisings, but said banks would continue to protect profitability by raising interest rates.\n\"The banks are going to remain very profitable – you have a unique global structure in Australia.\"\nThe moves to increase interest rates have come as net interest margins – a gauge of funding costs compared with the price of loans – are being pressured by fierce competition in institutional lending and the discount mortgage market until earlier this year.\nBell Potter's Mr Lim forecasts ANZ's net interest margin would be squeezed to 2 per cent – from 2.13 per cent a year ago – mainly due to pressure in its international arm.\nCredit quality is also set to be a key focus for ANZ. In August, it posted an increase in provisions for bad loans, which have been at historic lows, boosting the bottom line.\nNAB will also provide the market with further details on its plan to spin off Clydesdale Bank in Britain to shareholders by the end of the year.\nWestpac will also formally report its profits on November 2. However, it pre-announced full-year earnings of $7.8 billion when it launched a $3.5 billion capital raising this month.\nEarnings growth would also be in the spotlight at Macquarie after it this month upgraded its earnings guidance for the six months ended September 30, as it announced the $8.2 billion acquisition of ANZ's Esanda dealer finance division.\nMacquarie flagged that interim profit would climb 55 per cent on the same period last year, suggesting a circa $1.05 billion result. Underscoring the better than expected result is the bringing forward of a performance fee from an asset sale and favourable trading conditions in financial markets.\n\"With first-half 2016 [results] pre-announced, a key focus will be the reliance on performance fees and lumpy items,\" Matthew Davison, a senior research analyst at Martin Currie, said.\n\"The market will be anticipating further guidance upgrades later in the year, so this result should offer clues as to what might sustain the trend. The resilience of the commodity trading revenues and further M&A growth might be important in offsetting fewer one-off gains moving into 2017. The CAF (corporate asset finance) division and Asian equities are other areas of optimism.\"\nThe Esanda dealer finance purchase sits within the CAF unit.\nMacquarie expects the interim dividend to be $1.60 per share franked at 40 per cent, up from $1.30 per share in the same period a year earlier.\nAnalysts expect Macquarie will book a record full-year result of $2 billion, surpassing the $1.8 billion profit posted in 2008.\nNAB has flagged it will leave its dividend unchanged at 99c a share, while ANZ is also expected to leave the dividend unchanged, market estimates cited by Mr Lim show.\nCommonwealth Bank, which, unlike rivals, operates on a June financial year, reported record full-year profits of $9.14 billion in August.\nWith Joyce Moullakis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:32:34.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
