The S&P 500 Utilities Index rose 4.4% for the three-month period, ending Sept. 30, while the broader S&P 500 fell 6.9% -- its worst quarterly performance in four years -- as a result of the quarter's choppy markets. \nThat said, the sector had some clear losers. Here are the 10 worst-performing utilities stocks in the third quarter, paired with TheStreet Ratings to let you know if you should buy or sell these stocks in the final quarter of the 2015. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings.

Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nMarket Cap: $48.2 billion Year-to-date return: 1.9% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates DUKE ENERGY CORP as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate DUKE ENERGY CORP (DUK) a BUY. This is driven by a number of strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its good cash flow from operations and expanding profit margins. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Net operating cash flow has increased to $1,439.00 million or 15.48% when compared to the same quarter last year. Despite an increase in cash flow, DUKE ENERGY CORP's average is still marginally south of the industry average growth rate of 22.16%. 36.82% is the gross profit margin for DUKE ENERGY CORP which we consider to be strong. Regardless of DUK's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 9.71% trails the industry average. DUKE ENERGY CORP's earnings per share declined by 14.7% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has suffered a declining pattern of earnings per share over the past year. However, we anticipate this trend reversing over the coming year. During the past fiscal year, DUKE ENERGY CORP reported lower earnings of $3.46 versus $3.63 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($4.65 versus $3.46). DUK, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 0.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 2.1%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. Even though the current debt-to-equity ratio is 1.04, it is still below the industry average, suggesting that this level of debt is acceptable within the Electric Utilities industry. Even though the debt-to-equity ratio shows mixed results, the company's quick ratio of 0.29 is very low and demonstrates very weak liquidity.
