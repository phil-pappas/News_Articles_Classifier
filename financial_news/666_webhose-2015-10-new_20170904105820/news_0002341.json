Getty Images Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Call me a cheapskate but I am booking an economy Jetstar flight from Byron Bay. I am delighted to find an $85 fare – only to be infuriated by the $8.50 credit card charge.\nThis comes after realising that every time I paid in Australian dollars rather than in euros on my credit card during a trip to Europe, Commonwealth Bank charged me an extra 3 per cent on top of any other fee. This is supposedly to cover the bank's currency risk, I am informed. I suspect it's because most consumers don't realise they are being hit and that banks can get away with it. Grrr.\nGiven my spending on the trip, of course – not to mention the decline in the Australian dollar – this is rather like worrying about losing the Band-Aid off my cut finger while ignoring a missing toe.\nBut little things do matter to consumers and voters. Often, to an irrational degree. And small grievances can have more immediate impact in politics than much larger policy or structural issues.\nAFR generic westpac banking atm interest rates 15th October 2015 photo by louise kennerley afr Louise Kennerley Ban on credit card surcharges That's why there will be so much applause for the decision to phase in a ban on excessive credit card surcharges as part of the government response to the financial services inquiry . That will certainly attract far more attention than other decisions likely to have a much greater long term impact on family budgets. It is just that these effects are far less easy to see or to clearly measure in terms of costs.\nThat's because in financial services, the link between often complicated wording and the direct impact on people's money is particularly difficult to appreciate.\nTake the decision to back APRA's determination for banks to increase the risk weighting and the capital held against residential mortgages.\n As Malcolm Turnbull said firmly, ensuring the stability of Australia's major financial institutions is critical to the stability of the whole economy. Quite true. Just as it is true APRA had little choice but to insist on new capital requirements and risk weightings due to the increasing toughness in international banking standards as part of the Basel rules. Australian banks can't stand against global trends.\nWhether this extra level of capital protection would actually make much difference in a full-blown financial crisis is far more dubious. The stability of banks is also likely to face even bigger challenges from technology shifts and the power of disruption over the next decade.\nBut the government message sounds reassuring for now. And phrasing the issue in terms of safety and strength sells much better politically than the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pointing out this translates into higher interest rates in practice.\nCost of capital rises That's because the new rules inevitably raise the cost of capital for Australian banks , leading to the financial logic of increased interest rates to protect bank margins.\nThere may be an argument over just how much of a rise is justified (see Westpac's 20 basis points v the politicians' mutterings). Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull insist these are \"commercial decisions\" for the banks.\nYet the added cost means the banks' reaction taking some of the costs back in pricing was entirely predictable. The other big banks are, for now, content to let Westpac be the political lighting rod for criticism while making their own moves on rates a little later.\nBut even this politely muted debate about who ends up paying for increasing the cost of bank capital (YOU!) looks positively plain spoken compared the interminable arguments over superannuation.\nPool of pension money Compulsory super has transformed Australia's system into one of the world's largest and most successful pools of pension money. It also features plenty of examples of financial gaps, excessive fees and lousy financial advice eating away returns.\nMorrison says the primary purpose of the superannuation is to ensure that when Australians reach retirement age, they will not be reliant on welfare in the shape of the pension. But on current indications, the great majority of retirees will still be dependent on supplementing their super savings with at least a part pension from the government for decades to come. That's certainly true when the super guarantee remains fixed at 9.25 per cent rather than any higher.\nChanging that equation would require a major shift of approach when even minor changes to super always come with significant unintended consequences.\nWill it help to \"enshrine the objective of the superannuation system in legislation … to help align policy settings, industry initiative and community expectations\"? Perhaps at the margin given the degree of community confusion about super.\nThe real test is still going to be specific policies affecting complex tax arrangements, available concessions, the interaction with the pension, amounts able to be withdrawn as lump sums, available and affordable retirement products like annuities and the quality of financial advice. Such changes are mostly still a work in progress. That's the hard part to deliver.\nModest steps The government has announced modest steps in some areas, including a belated attempt to improve minimum qualifications for advisers and tightened financial eligibility for part pensions.\nBut its most urgent priority for super seems to ensuring one third of the union backed industry fund directors, including the chairman, must be independent rather than the current 50-50 split between union and employer representatives. This may be a natural evolution of good corporate governance for a maturing system.\nIt still conveniently ignores the superior track record of most industry funds over retail funds for similar balanced products. There are various reasons behind this and the difference has been diminishing as retail funds reduce fees for more standardised MySuper products.\nBut it's all very complicated to measure. No wonder most people prefer to focus on credit card fees and worry about super later – often too late.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:07:35.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
