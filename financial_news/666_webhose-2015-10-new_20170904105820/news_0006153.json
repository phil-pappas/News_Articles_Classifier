Brendon Thorne by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Intellectual property law firm Xenith IP's initial public offering has been re-priced higher as it prepares to raise $55.1 million for its listing, as revealed by Street Talk Online on Sunday.\nBroker CBA Equities will run Xenith's institutional books on Monday morning, seeking bids at $2.15 to $2.72 a share or 15-to19-times forecast 2016 financial year profit.\nCBA increased the top of the range late last week, after accepting bids through the broker firm offer and as institutional feedback started rolling in. The top of the range was initially $2.58 or 18-times profit.\nWhile the price increase was a bullish sign, it was the sort of move that irks fundies.

Wellard has been pitched to fund managers as a logistics business rather than a traditional agricultural stock, and the response from domestic institutions has been solid.\n The deal comes hot on the heels of Australia and China signing a free trade deal and more recently the signing of a deal to allow Australia to export live beef cattle to the country .", "external_links": ["http://www.queenslandcountrylife.com.au/news/agriculture/cattle/beef/historic-live-export-deal-with-china/2738238.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-25T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:05:02.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
