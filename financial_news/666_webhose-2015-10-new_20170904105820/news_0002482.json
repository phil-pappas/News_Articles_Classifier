Highbridge Chief Executive Officer Scott Kapnick and other members of management will own the bulk of the business while JPMorgan will retain a minority stake, the person said.\nBig U.S. banks have been selling private-equity and hedge-fund assets following regulatory changes that restrict their ability to invest in such businesses. Highbridge represents a small part of New York-based JPMorgan’s alternative-asset holdings and the lender thinks it could grow faster as an independent unit, the person said.\nJPMorgan bought a majority stake in Highbridge in 2004 for more than $1.3 billion and increased its ownership over the next five years. Highbridge deploys multiple investment strategies, including convertible bond arbitrage, credit, global macro, long-short equity and statistical arbitrage. It also runs traditional investment products.\nKapnick didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. Robert Carosella, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment.\nJPMorgan will retain the firm’s $6 billion hedge-fund business, which will keep its Highbridge branding, the person said. The Wall Street Journal reported JPMorgan’s plans earlier Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:22:26.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
