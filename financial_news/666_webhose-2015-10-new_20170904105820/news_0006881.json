The Nasdaq-listed company is set for inclusion in the MSCI China Index, which Morgan Stanley says will more accurately reflect the \"New China\" Photo: Nelson Ching\nThe inclusion of US-listed Chinese companies on the MSCI China index will allow investors to profit from China's changing economy, Morgan Stanley says.\nThe MSCI China index, a major offshore China equity index covering non-A share stocks is set to add Wall Street-listed Chinese companies including Baidu, Alibaba and Netease in two stages in November and May.\nThis provides investors with an opportunity to invest in an index that more accurately reflects China's economic development compared to its peer the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, Morgan Stanley research led by China equity strategist Laura Wang said.\n\"We have long argued that China's private household consumption/services spending may be understated by the official data, and that it has played a much bigger role as an economic growth driver than the market and many investors may have realised,\" Ms Wang said.\nAdvertisement \"Total household consumption's weight in China's total GDP could be as high as 47 per cent in 2013 versus the 36 per cent suggested by the official data, representing a potential $US1.9 trillion understatement.\"\nOutperformance of some sectors This view was supported by the outperformance of the so-called \"New China\" sectors on the sharemarket compared to the general MSCI China since 2008-09, dovetailing with Morgan Stanley's analysis of when China's household consumption share started to rise.\nBy comparison, the HSCEI is more than 70 per cent weighted in financials with no tech stocks.\n\"IT, one of the fastest-growing sectors in China, with higher valuation and earnings growth prospects, has zero representation in HSCEI, while in MSCI China, we estimate that its index weight will grow to 23 per cent from the current approximately 14 per cent once the second stage of ADR [American Depository Receipts] inclusion is complete,\" Ms Wang said.\nOnce the two stages are completed, Morgan Stanley estimates the 18 companies due for inclusion on the MSCI China will bump up the overall earnings-per-share growth rate by almost 20 per cent, from 8.6 per cent to 10.2 per cent in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:28:54.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
