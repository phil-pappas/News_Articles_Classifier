In addition to deployment in new pipelines, leak detection systems are rapidly being used in aging pipelines. Across the globe, the average age of pipelines is 30 years, while some pipelines are as old as 100 years. Aging pipelines, being more prone to corrosion, possess greater risk of leakage, and thus demand use of better leak detection systems. On account of strict regulations and high compensations in case of hydrocarbon spills, aging pipelines are propelling the demand for pipeline leak detection across the globe. \nDespite strict regulations governing pipeline leak detection systems, globally, the incidents of oil & gas pipeline leaks have witnessed a steady rise. Leakage in pipelines can occur due to various reasons such as natural damage, aging, weather conditions, corrosion, tampering, etc. Oil & gas pipeline leakage incidents prove to be extremely adverse not only for the environment, but also for operating companies which are liable to pay hefty amounts in the form of damages and compensation in case of any accidents. In view of these after effects of oil & gas pipeline leakages, governments of various countries have formulated regulations and guidelines, which specify dedicated methods for oil & gas pipeline leak detection, which companies are required to abide with. These standards have made deployment and maintenance of leak detection systems a compulsion, thereby fueling growth in oil & gas pipeline leak detection market. \nGlobal Oil & Gas Pipeline Leak Detection Market Forecast & Opportunities, 2020 discusses the following aspects of oil & gas pipeline leak detection market across the globe: Utilization of Internet of Things in Pipeline Leak Detection Introduction of Hydraulic Leak Detection Systems for Oil & Gas Pipelines Uniting Complimentary Leak Detection Methods Crude Oil Prices Influencing Investments in Pipeline Infrastructure Formation of Join Industry Project (JIP) Natural Gas Pipeline Infrastructure Leading the Market Research & Development in Pipeline Leak Detection Process Advancement in Intelligent Pigging Technology \nKey Topics Covered:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:16:29.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
