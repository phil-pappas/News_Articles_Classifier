Yes, we are an agrarian country where 60% of our population depend directly or indirectly on agriculture. Our farmers are our backbone, they devote their whole life to meet our food demands and meet their livelihood expenses. Hence it would not be wrong to call them the lifeline of our nation. The dedicated efforts of a farmer is worthy of praise as they grow and nurture the crops as a human child irrespective of the extreme conditions the face. However, it is ironic that with such efforts one is still leading a remorseful life. The condition of an Indian farmer is not hidden. We blindside the situation assuming that we are not directly affected by it. In India, every 30 minutes, a farmer commits suicide. For the past few decades, farmer suicides have been increasing at an alarming rate due to which they now constitute less than a quarter of India's population. As per the latest census, farmers committed suicide at a rate of 16.3 per 100,000 farmers. This was slightly higher than the 15.7 per 100,000 farmers who had committed suicide in 2001.All these numbers should have been enough for heads to turn in this matter, yet there seems to be a little effect to make their lives better that has compelled the farmers to take such measures. Poverty, debt and climatic changes are some factors which add to their agonies. The farmers rely heavily on the monsoons each year and a drought-like situation deprives them of the harvest, despite their hard labour and money on materials like fertilizer and seeds.The current status of Indian farmers demand a number of reforms to make their life happier and healthier. Innovative Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd. acknowledges the ongoing efforts of the government in reforming the condition of the farmers and believes that utmost attention needs to be given to their problems. Still a lot is needed to be done in changing the perspective of the people that farming is not a dead occupation so that more and more can join the sector and the problems that these people face can get the long awaited attention. There is growth and prosperity in this sector along with the most important aspect, the feeling of pride in serving and feeding the nation.Innovative Financial Advisors Pvt. Ltd believes that only with the prosperity of the farmers as a nation. We need to make sure that the condition of the nation's farmers improve in the near future.
