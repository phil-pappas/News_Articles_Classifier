And according to one technician, there's more trouble ahead for the financials sector, but not because of earnings. \nRead More JPMorgan slashes Q3 growth estimates \n\nTodd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com said as the 10-year Treasury yield falls lower, financial stocks will likely follow. \n\n\n\"Interest rates, in my opinion, are acting as a leading indicator,\" Gordon said Wednesday on CNBC's \" Power Lunch .\" \"Financials are starting to heed the warning that bond yields are giving us. I think financials trade lower.\" \nGordon said Goldman Sachs , which is scheduled to report earnings Thursday, could break below a key support level of $171, which may be a troubling sign for other bank stocks. \nRead More Bank of America earnings, revenues beat expectations \n\nHowever, Andrew Burkly of Oppenheimer said he sees banks approaching a bottom.\n\"We've kind of gone through this ebb and flow with the banks and the financials over the past couple years where when rates start to creep down and expectations start to fall, the banks start to underperform,\" Burkly said. \"There may be a little bit more pressure but we think we're probably a little bit closer to a floor.\" \nWhile banks will face more challenges from low interest rates and trading revenue, Burkly said he expects third-quarter earnings will be adequate.\n\"Analysts have been taking their numbers down pretty aggressively over the past couple months as rate expectations have been pushed out,\" he said Wednesday. \"I expect some pretty decent results from the overall group\"\nBank of America and Wells Fargo posted third-quarter earnings this week that beat expectations. Citigroup is also scheduled to report results before the bell Thursday. \n\nWant to be a part of the Trading Nation ?
