For a landlord, the site has longevity as the banks only tend to open five days a week. On the other hand, a retail shop is a seven-day business, meaning more wear and tear on the property.\nNormally, banks can pay from $1.5 million per annum to $2.5 million per annum for their flagship branches in Sydney's CBD.\nKnight Frank's senior director of retail leasing, Alex Alamsyah, said banks were known to always transform; sometimes downsizing or consolidating and closing branches for various reasons including cost-savings, but, at other times, expanding and opening new flagship branches in prime CBD sites.\nAdvertisement He said while landlords would prefer banks and the telcos over fashion brands because of the covenant, they were also happy to have a \"bank of the future\" to attract visitors and other tenants.\nMr Alamsyah said banks were fashioning themselves as cool \"go to\" destinations.\n\"People want a bank that feels more like a retailer. For example, global bank BNP Paribas in Paris, Barclays in London and Citibank in New York City are experimenting with bank branches that have chic lounges and edgy design that resemble the cool sleekness of an Apple store,\" Mr Alamsyah said.\n\"Another example is Banco Bradesco, one of Brazil's largest banks. At its Sao Paulo branch, there is a robot to greet and guide consumers into the bank, which has interactive banking tables, a lounge area and giant touchscreen banking walls.\"\nIn the heart of the Sydney CBD, it is understood banks are attacking every major development project in George Street and Pitt Street. This includes the Commonwealth Bank moving to 200 George Street, which is owned by Mirvac and AMP Capital; Bankwest opening at 254 George Street opposite Suncorp Bank; Westpac opening at 99 Pitt Street opposite Citibank and National Australia Bank; and HSBC and NAB signing at 333 George Street, which is owned by Charter Hall, for an opening in 2016-17.\nMajor banks are also looking at 275 George Street, which is owned by LaSalle, and 280 George Street, owned by Toga/Far East.\nHowever, Mr Alamsyah declined to comment on those projects.\nThe inflow of cash and investors from China has also attracted banks. China Construction Bank, ICBC and Bank of China are all looking for prime sites in the Sydney CBD.\nMr Alamsyah, said the most sought-after Sydney CBD sites by banks were in George Street (between Margaret and Hunter streets and King Street and Martin Place) as most of the major banks had flagship branches in this precinct.\nFrom a national perspective, Knight Frank's director of retail leasing, Michael Hanscomb, said that in major CBDs, banks were exiting large flagship heritage sites.\nPrime examples are Commonwealth Bank at 5 Martin Place in Sydney and Westpac at 33 Queen Street in Brisbane.\n\"Modern banking in Australia is now electronic and their range is typically from 200 to 600 square metres.\" Mr Hanscomb said.\n\"Banks are wanting to commit to prime corner flagship sites, often mall-front locations and there is always a new strategy from the major banks to secure a CBD branch in a CBD growth area\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:36:56.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
