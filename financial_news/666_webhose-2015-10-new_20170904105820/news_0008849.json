Just weeks after the release of Windows 10, a sparkling makeover of Microsoft's veteran operating system, Apple fans are downloading El Capitan, the latest iteration of its OS X system. Both camps have reason to smile.\nWhile Windows 10 was a rescue mission, saving an OS that had lost its way and the confidence of its own users, El Capitan refines an already elegant way to organise and operate a desktop or notebook computer. Our favourite new feature is Split View, which needs some work but is still an outstanding innovation that will find its way into MS Windows before long.\nHow often have you worked on a document, perhaps a report, and you've wanted to keep another file, say a spreadsheet, side by side at all times? As Monty Python would say, these are the two documents you want to work with, and the two documents you want to work with are these. But with conventional windows, if you duck out to check a website or react to an email, your neat arrangement of working files is often lost. Computers just don't understand the concept of \"I want these items to stay here, and stay together.\" Well, El Capitan does.\nSplit view In Split View, the monitor performs as two independent screens and each of two apps grabs one screen for itself. Supplied OS X has long featured full screen mode, where an application stakes out the entire monitor. In Split View, the monitor performs as two independent screens and each of two apps grabs one screen for itself. Swipe away from that screen and both of them go. Switch back to it and both return, exactly as they were. It's a feature we've been craving ever since windowed computing arrived.\nSplit View isn't perfect, yet. It can be hard to know which application has focus at any time. Apple needs to add some visual indicator of which panel is live. With most apps, the menu bar auto-hides in split mode, and we want the option to keep it permanently on view. And we would love the ability to split a screen more than two ways. But as a first attempt, it's outstanding.\nWe mentioned recently that the Notes app on iPhones and iPads has been beefed up to challenge high-end note takers like OneNote and Evernote. The same enhancements have now hit the desktop so that Notes can store, display and search rich content like text, maps and other graphics and material clipped from the web, all synchronised between devices via Apple's iCloud service.\nAt the micro level, Apple has polished its operating environment in several neat ways. On those massive 27-inch-high resolution monitors, it can be hard to locate the mouse cursor and many of us give it a wiggle to help spot it. Do that now and the cursor momentarily enlarges, making it really easy to find.\niOS and OS X now work better together with El Capitan. Who hasn't been frustrated, and even embarrassed, when their computer has started squawking because a video file has loaded in a browser window that's now in the background? Who hasn't rummaged around their desktop trying to find where the noise is coming from? Now, from any Safari browser window, you can locate and silence a noisy tab.\nKeep pics together logically The photo app also gets a makeover. We really appreciate its new ability to batch edit titles and other information for your pictures. The problem with the hundreds of happy snaps we take is that they end up in a sea of images, as lost as if we hadn't taken them in the first place.\nSure, Apple tries to organise them as best it can, but it can't know that this bunch of pics records Billy's birthday. At last, it's easy to select a set of images and tag them all in one move.\nWhat pleases us most about Windows 10 and OS X El Capitan is their witness to the fact that the tech giants are listening to users, at least when it comes to developing their operating systems.\nBeing able to split a screen, keep better notes, find a lost cursor, silence a noisy web page and label precious pictures all add real value to Apple's OS and, even better, El Capitan is a free upgrade.\nIt would all be in vain, however, if the update over-stressed and slowed your hardware. But our experience, including on older gear, confirms Apple's claim that El Capitan runs a little faster, if anything.\nPeter Moon is a technology lawyer with Cooper Mills. peter.moon@coopermills.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:08:59.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
