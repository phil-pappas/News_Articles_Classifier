Domain name traders certainly think so and hope Australia's business community agrees.\nIf you don't act fast, you could risk losing your domain name to someone else,\nDavid Lye, founder, Netfleet Australia's regulatory body for domain names, .au Domain Administration (auDA), recently announced its 2015 Names Policy Panel proposal that individuals and entities should be allowed to register domain names directly under .au (for example www.abc.au ).\nThis new domain name option has not been possible before.\nAdvertisement Under the proposal, domains ending with com.au, net.au etc would remain available.\n\"The main reason the panel has recommended this change is that direct registrations would create more options,\" says Derek Whitehead, adjunct professor at Swinburne University of Technology and the panel chairman.\n\"They include names that are shorter, more appealing and more memorable. \"They would make the domain name system simpler and easier to use.\"\nDavid Lye,founder of domain name trading platform Netfleet, which turns over $1.6 million a year, , says it is important businesses understand this change is on the table.\nIf the proposal is adopted, Australia will join countries including New Zealand and Britain , which have already embraced national domains.\n\"It is a significant one [change],\" Lye says. \"If it does happen, and it's looking more likely that it will happen, it will be the biggest shake-up to Australia since domain names were first adopted.\"\nLye says it is likely existing .com and .com.au domain holders will get six months to register for a comparable .au domain.\n\"Then a land-rush period will start,\" he says\n\"If you don't act fast [once the change comes into effect], you could risk losing your domain name to someone else, which could put you in the position of having to buy it back at an extremely high cost so it's vital for businesses to be aware so that they can protect themselves.\"\nOpening up a new world of domain names will be viewed as both opportunity and threat to small businesses, according to experts.\n\"If you are a SME owner you may feel annoyed that you are almost forced to do it, it's another cost,\" Lye says.\nBut it is also a rare opportunity to buy domain names previously unavailable, and perhaps ditch more long-winded names.\nLye's advice – if this proposal is adopted – is to register for the appropriate .au to protect your business from rivals or domain investors.\n\"There are 3 million registered [domains] in Australia today ... and it's likely a lot of people will love this opportunity to save essentially four letters from their web addresses.\"\nRevenue raising Lamb Agency managing director Greg Nelson is less glowing. He sees this proposal as a revenue-raising exercise.\n\"Gone are the days when you needed to secure every flavour and typo of your domain, for example lambagency.com.au, lambagency.com, lambagency.id,\" says the Brisbane-based digital agency boss.\n\"You are wasting money if you are still doing this so I don't see this move as being an additional 'internet tax' for SMEs and, if anything, the problem is going to be for the regulator to set this up as a credible domain.\n\"Within Australia, .com.au is seen as more credible and relevant than .com. And nobody uses .net.au, even though it was a relatively common domain name used 15 years ago.\"\nIf .au becomes an option it will need to provide a value offering not currently provided by .com.au.\n\"Like a certain level of certification or whether it is an Australian-owned business... 'Buy Australian. Shop DOT AU'.\n\"They can't just add yet another domain into the mix just because they can.\"\nBut Sydney business owner Dale Beaumont, founder of Business Blueprint, says this has to happen because Australia is running out of suitable names available to business owners.\n\"Stories like a local Melbourne dry-cleaner trying to secure the name melbournedrycleaners.com.au and finding it is already taken by another national business are common,\" Beaumont says.\nOne challenge ahead will be re-educating consumers to type in the new shorter domain name.\n\"Typing in .com.au or .com is hardwired in the way we search today so I think .au is a good thing because it is the best chance we have to push the reset button and free up some domain names for these small businesses.\n\"What I would like to see is Australia Post or the big banks or big brands like Virgin really get behind it if it comes off because my only concern is that the big businesses driving the change [to consumer habits], the small businesses will struggle to get critical take-up and we may see another case of the [poorly embraced] .net.au.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:35:26.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
