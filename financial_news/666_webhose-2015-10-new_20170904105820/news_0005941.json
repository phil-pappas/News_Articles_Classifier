ERIN JONASSON Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten A 2012 research paper from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on the relationship between superannuation fund size and performance found that in the not-for-profit sector larger super funds had superior gross investment returns, lower investment expenses and lower operating costs.\nAs a result, the regulator concluded that \"fund members are likely to benefit from further industry consolidation in the not-for-profit sector\".\nThe number of industry funds has declined since then, but the pace of consolidation has hardly been dramatic. Between June 2012 and June 2015 the number of industry funds has fallen to 43 from 56 â€“ still far too many for a $433 billion sector.\nIn theory, the rate at which funds head to the altar should accelerate as a result of APRA's prudential standards. Since July 2013, APRA has had a so-called scale test in its supervisory armory. Under the test, super funds must be able to demonstrate that their members are not disadvantaged by insufficient scale when it comes to assets and membership.\nDon't hold your breath But don't hold your breath for a raft of mergers. While APRA will no doubt be asking some tough questions of smaller funds, determining that a super scheme is failing to act in the best interests of members because it is too small could take months, even years. Presumably if APRA did decide that a small fund was failing to optimise returns on behalf of members, trustees would first be given the opportunity to improve performance by looking for outsourcing or partnering opportunities.\nSmall funds that are unviable in the long term, however, would be doing their members a disservice by waiting for APRA to step in.\nThe longer funds wait, the more difficult it might become for them to merge with the industry's big players and provide their members meaningful benefits of scale.\n With the tailwinds of compounding interest behind them, the super industry's largest players are going to get bigger, faster, opening up an even wider gap between them and retirement schemes at the bottom of the scale ladder.\nLet's pick two big funds out of a hat.\nWhen AustralianSuper has $100 billion of assets under management in the not-too-distant future, how willing will it really be to merge with a $3 billion fund that is struggling to deliver its members decent returns?\nCbus, with $30 billion of assets, receives $2.6 billion of gross inflows every year. Merging with a $3 billion fund even now would provide less than two years worth of inflows.\nUnreasonable expectations While it is true that there will be a place in the super universe for small, niche, high performance players, it can only be hoped that those that do not fit into this category are thinking carefully about their future.\nIt is not unreasonable to expect that performance gaps between big and small will start to widen as large funds use their scale to drive down investment costs by negotiating better deals or taking investment management inhouse. Last year Cbus reduced its investment management expense ratio to 0.63 per cent from 0.77 per cent, according to its most recent annual report, and aims to lower that figure by another 25 per cent over the next two to three years.\nBy 2018 AustralianSuper aims to manage about $35 billion of assets internally, with cost savings to members of $140 million a year.\nSome schemes might find their challenges compounded by the government's program of sweeping up money in lost member accounts to the Australian Tax Office. The balance threshold for transferals to the ATO will rise from $2000 to $4000 in December this year and to $6000 in December 2016.\nThen there is the issue of retirement products. While having a single one-size-fits-all default product in the accumulation phase might be appropriate, this is probably less the case in the pension phase. Older members might need more tailored, flexible solutions that take into account their age, account balance, health and other assets. This will require significant expertise, unless such products can be found on a shelf.\nFor the sake of their members, funds should not be waiting for APRA to demand they walk up the aisle. If they do, they might be doing their members even more of a disservice.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:41:58.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
