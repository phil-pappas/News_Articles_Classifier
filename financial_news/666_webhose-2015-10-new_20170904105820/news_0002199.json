Ryan Stuart Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Max Mason The American visitor I'm about to meet for lunch has a few surprises in his background. At the age of 40, Jared Grusd has already worked in senior positions at technology behemoths Google, AOL and Spotify. He's now the new chief executive of Huffington Post , something that, after a gap of 15 years, has brought him to Australia again – where it turns out he has seven cousins.\nI had made the reservation at Cafe Sydney, with its breathtaking views, two days earlier when the city had experienced a little tease of summer with temperatures above 25 degrees, so I'm mildly disappointed when there's no space for the two of us to sit outside on the terrace.\nI check for Grusd as soon as I arrive – I've only seen photos of him so far – but I'm early. Our table turns out to be near the windows and my envy of those outside diners subsides somewhat when I see we will still have an immaculate view of Sydney's greatest landmarks, the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.\nGrusd arrives just a few minutes later. He's been working out of Huffington Post 's new Australian operations in Circular Quay. The restaurant isn't full yet but there's already a lively atmosphere from the hum of talk and movement as people settle in to enjoy their lunch.\nArianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post, has always had clout. Here, in 2011, Huffington, second from the right, is photographed with writer and director, Nora Ephron, TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, and media critic Jay Rosen. Huffington Post launched in Australia in August, in a joint venture with Fairfax Media. Getty Images Grusd, last in Sydney as a 25 year old, has already enjoyed the rare opportunity to see some of his cousins. He admits a full-on career is in part why it has been so long between family visits.\n\"I've been working hard, travelling hard, married, kids, a lot of things happening at the same time over that span of time.\"\nNow he's taken over one of the most well-known brands in online media. I ask him about the future of journalism, and the criticism his publication has received for not paying contributors.\n\"I think a lot of the debate around that globally has waned over the past three years,\" he replies without hesitation. \"And part [of that] is because we've seen the rise of platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn and others, where people are publishing content.\"\nJared Grusd talks over lunch at Cafe Sydney about the way platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn will change the way we consume audio, video - and journalism. Ryan Stuart Powerful voices He notes that Huffington Post now pays all its journalists and staff, but still, he agrees, there is a new model for content creation. \"There's a whole world of people who have voices and narratives that resonate [and] should be told and, umm, who aren't journalists per se, who don't even aspire to be journalists, but have something important they want to get across. And I think creating a platform for those voices to be heard is extraordinarily powerful.\"\nHuffington Post launched in Australia in August, partnering with Fairfax Media – publisher of AFR Weekend – in a 51 to 49 per cent joint venture.\nI realise we've been talking for more than 20 minutes and haven't ordered anything. I ask: \"is there anything you don't eat?\" – Grusd smiles: \"You know the answer to that question has changed in the last three weeks.\nArianna Huffington, here with AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, invited HuffPost CEO candidate Jared Grusd to her home for lunch - and made him talk about his values and personal philosophies. Bloomberg \"It was by accident, really,\" he continues. \"I just eat everything. Meat, poultry, whatever, and then I realised that maybe for the first time ever in my life I'd gone a week without eating any kind of meat, just by sheer coincidence, and then I thought to myself: what would happen if I extended it for two weeks, and then a third week? Then I was almost doing a mini-experiment on myself.\"\nHe still eats fish – so he's an accidental pescatarian. And he notes he has been feeling better.\nI recount how I have started eating less red meat because of a family history of cancer. Grusd absent-mindedly brings his hand into a fist and knocks twice on the table. \"I kind of feel like there's a lot of randomness to the world,\" he responds to my inquisitive look.\nThe waiter, attentive but not invasive, has seen we've put down our menus. We order two salads, one with heirloom tomato, Shaw River mozzarella and basil; the second with cos salad, radicchio, pistachio, mint, pomegranate and labne. As well, we order a grilled octopus appetiser, all to share.\nDon't call him a lawyer Work, combined with jet lag and the desire to go for a run later mean Grusd passes on wine. I order risotto, and Grusd, happy to take a recommendation, asks the waiter, \"Trout or the swordfish?\"\n\"The trout, and we're serving medium,\" replies the waiter. \"Sure. However the chef prefers it,\" Grusd responds in a relaxed fashion.\nThe restaurant is filling out, suits chatter over lunch, there is a buzz of voices and chuckles.\nGrusd was trained in law at the University of Chicago, but don't call him a lawyer; he also holds a bachelor of arts from the University of Pennsylvania and, four years after attaining his law degree, capped it all off with a master of business administration at Columbia Business School.\n\"What I found happening is early on my career, I was working on really fantastic large-scale technology deals – global billion-dollar deals. I was learning a lot, growing a lot and taking it all in, but from a from a psychological and cultural perspective, what I realised is people, like, typecast you,\" he says.\n\"The way I solved that kind of issue is I applied to business school, to get an MBA, and for me it wasn't necessarily about, like, learning more, it was in part to say, like, please stop calling me a lawyer because I now have the same degree that you – investment banker, you – private equity guy or you – business person, has.\"\nGrusd, at this stage, is barely a week into his new job at Huffington Post based in New York, where he has lived since college, but he knows the publication well, having worked closely on the deal for AOL when it purchased Arianna Huffington's brainchild in 2011 for $US315 million.\n\"When I was deciding to take the job or not, I had lunch with Arianna in her apartment and it was, like [from her], 'let's not talk about the job or the Huffington Post at all; let's just talk about philosophy. Not Immanuel Kant versus René Descartes, but just about where the world's going, values, division, what's motivating you at this stage of your career – a broader-view conversation because I feel we both need to be in complete alignment'.\"\nWho's getting the top media jobs The conversation clearly ended well.\nOur first course arrives and to my horror, the octopus I've ordered comes with chorizo sausage. It's delicious but Grusd stays well clear of it. Pomegranate adds a fresh fruity flavour to the first salad, but we agree that the mozzarella, moist and tasty, together with the fresh tomatoes, is the trump dish.\nGrusd's career trajectory is indicative of a new trend in journalism. With a technology and start-up background – you can see it clearly in the way he talks passionately about disruption and adaptation, moving his hands around – he's an example of how media companies are looking to position themselves for change. Grusd's friend and former Google colleague, Jon Steinberg, with whom he started a business called Shake, was previously president of BuzzFeed. He is now the North America chief executive of DailyMail.com .\nEntering the media landscape has evolved to a point where it is not so capital intensive, allowing a proliferation of publishers and content creators, Grusd says. Social media platforms such as Facebook are a powerful tool for journalists, and tech companies are pushing more into the content space, allowing journalists to publish on their platforms.\nHowever, Grusd warned that publishers need to be careful. Facebook has a lot of power because it controls audience and while it uses its power benevolently for now, it could be \"dangerous\" to publishers and marketers.\n\"It's not clear which way they're [Facebook, LinkedIn] going, but what is clear is that those platforms will play a very dominant role in terms of how journalism in particular, but I think content more broadly – video, music, audio, gets distributed and consumed.\nCracking the code \"The real question is how do publishers and marketers figure out how to build their brand's scale and create a business model in a world that's defined by these big platforms, and I think there is a road but no one has really cracked that code on how to nail that.\"\nGrusd says he has come to realise people's willingness to put capital into investments helps dictate who will be able to innovate.\nMoney is being funnelled into Silicon Valley by venture and private capital firms who are funding the companies, without the pressure of having to deliver on revenue or profit, with the idea that down the road it will grow big enough to monetise, Grusd says. The challenge for traditional media, which often have shareholders to account for, is how to evolve the business, he says.\n\"I think the people who are running the traditional companies, Fairfax included, are extraordinarily bright, progressive-thinking people. It's just, like, the cards they're dealt are different than the cards the entrepreneurs at Silicon Valley are dealt. So they're somewhat more constrained.\"\nOur mains arrive. Grusd has the tandoori trout, which comes with a fried onion bhaji and a soft yoghurt-based raita, which he says tastes excellent. My risotto is with spring greens, pea, herbs and a dash of lemon that adds a bit of a bite.\nIt turns out that, like myself, Grusd is an American citizen, but not born there – we bond over the commonality. Grusd was born in South Africa and, at age one, moved to the United States where he grew up in Los Angeles. His mother has a twin sister, who sought greener pastures and opted for Sydney instead.\nHow Australia changed Grusd Grusd notes that his last visit to Sydney heralded the beginning of a big change in perspective for him. \"When I was here 15 years ago, one of my cousins took me to Manly Beach. With fish and chips. I looked at the beach and I saw something that I've never seen before, which was, like, a triathlon.\n\"At that point of time, I'm, like, 'you know what? I really have to get into that sport'. The most defining experience I've had in Australia was just seeing that triathlon, because over the last 15 years, I've gotten super into triathlon.\" He's since done two Ironman triathlons, one in Florida and the other in Arizona, and about a dozen half-Ironmans across the United States.\nGrusd refers back to when I mentioned cancer, and his knock on the table. \"We had a couple of deaths in our family this summer. Hopefully I'm a long ways away from it but I think at a certain point you realise you're not young any more. I don't think I'm old, but I do realise I have kids to look out for, I have a wife who depends on me. Every job is stressful, so I'm not complaining about the level of stress in my job, but life is hard, it's not easy, so you have to treat yourself well.\"\nGrusd has a genuine interest in getting to know the man across the table. I tell him about how my family owned a newspaper in Towanda, Pennsylvania during the US civil war. \"Really?\" he instantly responds.\"My wife went to a camp in Towanda, for eight years, eight summers.\"\nSomehow it has been more than two hours; the majority of Cafe Sydney's patrons have gone back to work. We cap off our lunch with coffee – Grusd a skim cappuccino and myself a piccolo.\nDespite being jet lagged, the warmth in his voice when talking about his wife and three young daughters is obvious and he's visibly more energetic as we leave the restaurant and he shows me photos of his girls, who at that very moment are dancing in his living room – his wife has just sent him pictures.\nWork-life balance is tough, he admits, but he has concentrated on being present in his daughters' lives. \"I'm an assistant to the assistant coach of my daughter's soccer team. I would never miss a game,\" he says, noting that's a change in his life.\n\"When I was single, before I had kids, I never took any vacations, just work and work and work. It was just the way I was wired. And now I still work equally hard, but I will try and take, like, periodic breaks to make sure I have enough experiences with my kids and life as well.\n\"I think that's a challenge that everyone has in today's world.\"\nCafe Sydney – 5, 31 Alfred St, Sydney, 2000\n2 bottles, sparkling Antipodes water, $29\n1 grilled octopus (with spicy sausage, smoked eggplant, lemon and parsley), $26\n1 salad with labne, cos, radicchio, pomegranate, pistachio and mint, $23\n1 salad with tomato, mozzarella, basil, Cuor d'Ulivo and sea salt, $26\n1 tandoori trout with saffron cucumber, coconut, onion bhaji and raita, $39\n1 risotto with spring greens, peas, taleggio, soft herbs and lemon, $36\n1 piccolo latte, $4.50\n1 cappuccino $4.50\nTotal (with GST and tip), $206", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Maxepmason", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/110501760785352454451/posts"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:04:09.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
