The entire leadership team has to be recognized at the table,\" said Issa. He said McCarthy and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana told Boehner he needed to do things differently.\nBut Issa said no one questions Boehner's motives or his commitment to the institution.\nIn addition to duties leading the House, the speaker is second in line for the president, after the vice president . \n \n\nMore From CNBC \nTop News and Analysis Latest News Video Personal Finance  \nPolitics & Government Legislative Branch Darrell Issa House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy Paul Ryan Daniel Webster John Boehner", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:56:55.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
