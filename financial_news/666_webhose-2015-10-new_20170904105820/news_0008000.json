Treasuries, but the exit from European government bond markets is one of the most concrete examples of the investment banking cuts that its chief executive had said would be needed. \nNew Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam said on Wednesday that the bank would need to raise 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.16 billion) from investors, slim down its investment bank and cut jobs. \nHis announcement came hours before Switzerland's central bank outlined tough new capital requirements for Credit Suisse and its rival UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) and Credit Suisse to protect the economy from a major banking collapse. \nOn Thursday, Britain's government debt issuance agency announced that Credit Suisse was resigning as a primary dealer in British government bonds, effective from the end of Friday -- the first dealer to give up its role since State Street in December 2011. \nA Credit Suisse spokesman subsequently said the company was also resigning all other European primary dealer roles, and would give up market-making activity too -- a move Credit Suisse had been privately considering for some time. \nNo information on specific job losses was immediately available. \nRobert Stheeman, chief executive of the UK Debt Management Office, had previously said increased regulation had reduced liquidity in the British government bond market, increasing the risk of bond auctions failing to attract enough demand.
