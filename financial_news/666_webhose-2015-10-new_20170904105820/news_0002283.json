The awards scheme will be replicated in Ghana next year to recognise and celebrate Ghanaian women who have had positive impact on the society. \nGBA member institutions work in 135 countries to build innovative, comprehensive programs that provide women entrepreneurs with vital access to capital, markets, education and training.
