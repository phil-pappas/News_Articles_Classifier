However, with shortfalls on direct tax collection and disinvestment, the windfall from indirect tax collection will get offset, says Nomura in a research note. \"While indirect tax collections have been buoyant, we expect them to largely compensate for the potential shortfalls in direct taxes and disinvestment targets. On Monday, the government also announced that it expects a 5%-7% shortfall in direct tax collections about Rs50,000 crore or 0.4% of GDP. As such, we do not expect any fiscal space to open up to spend above budgeted amounts,\" Nomura said. During the April-August period, direct tax collection grew 8.5% against the budgeted target of 16.1%. Weak disinvestment receipts of Rs12,800 crore over this period against the budgeted target of Rs69,500 crore for FY16. In addition, government spending has already accelerated (up 8.8% during April-August versus budgeted growth of 8.1%), led by higher public spending on infrastructure, particularly roads, rural and urban development, reflecting the government’s effort to front-load spending to kick-start growth, Nomura said.
