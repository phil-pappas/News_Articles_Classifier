German stocks gain on business confidence AFP â€“ 41 minutes ago View Photo \n\nFrankfurt pushed higher on Germany's better-than-expected business confidence, while European markets overall were flat as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of a US monetary policy meeting this week. \nLondon's benchmark FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip companies added 0.05 percent to stand at 6,447.55 points in afternoon trading. \nIn the eurozone, the Paris CAC 40 shed 0.28 percent compared with Friday's close to 4,909.64 points. \nOn the upside, Frankfurt's DAX 30 rose 0.59 percent to 10,858.07 after a top survey showed that German business confidence dropped less than expected during October. \nBefore the weekend, the region's markets had rallied on expectations of further economic stimulus for the eurozone, and after China slashed interest rates to counter the slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy. \n\"The DAX fared better than its UK cousin this morning, lifted by a slightly better than expected, if still falling, German Ifo business climate figure,\" said analyst Connor Campbell at trading firm Spreadex. \nGerman business confidence dipped only slightly in October, as Europe's biggest economy continues to shrug off various challenges, including the Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) scandal, the leading economic think tank Ifo said Monday. \nThe Ifo institute's closely-watched business climate index slipped to 108.2 points in October from 108.5 points in September, Ifo said in a statement, a much shallower drop than analysts had expected. \nFor its survey, Ifo quizzes businesses about their current business environment and the outlook for the next six months. \nThe sub-index measuring current business fell to 112.6 points, its lowest level since March, but the outlook sub-index rose to 103.8 points, the institute said. \n- Waiting for the Fed - \nUS stocks opened little-changed Monday as the market paused ahead of major corporate earnings and a Federal Reserve two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday. \nFive minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had nudged up 0.04 percent to 17,653.78 points \nMeanwhile, the broad-based S&P 500 slipped 0.09 percent to 2,073.23, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.03 percent at 5,030.16. \nAt its meeting the Fed is expected to again put off raising interest rates, but it could make clearer how soon a rate hike could come. \n\"This is the Fed?s last chance to convince the markets that a rate hike is coming this year, therefore December, assuming of course that it still intends to do so,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency trading outfit Oanda. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen has repeatedly said this year that an increase in the interest rate, near zero since 2008, was likely by year-end. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) repeated the prediction on September 24, while as usual stressing that the move would be \"data-dependent.\" \nBut since Yellen last spoke US economic data has come in weaker than expected, especially the numbers on the September jobs market released on October 2. \nThe Fed funds rate level has a huge impact on global interest rates and speculation on an increase has spurred months of greater volatility in markets worldwide. \nElsewhere, Asian stock markets on Monday welcomed China's latest cut in interest rates, but analysts warned the move indicates further weakness in the world's number two economy. \nWhile Friday's move -- the sixth reduction since November -- realised hopes for further monetary easing, Premier Li Keqiang tempered the mood by indicating China's economy could grow less than seven percent this year. \nOn Friday the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points and lowered the reserve ratio requirement -- the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve. \nAsian equities powered higher in early trade Monday but the gains were tempered later on, with Hong Kong and Sydney retreating. \nShanghai ended 0.50 percent higher but Hong Kong finished 0.15 percent down. \nTokyo closed up 0.65 percent, having been more than one percent higher at one point, while Seoul closed 0.38 percent stronger. \nSydney, where several firms with close business ties to China are listed, eased 0.07 percent. \nIn foreign exchange activity on Monday, the European single currency edged up to $1.1020 from $1.1016 late on Friday in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:37:48.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
