Jesse Marlow by Clancy Yeates Joyce Moullakis The big four are expected to chalk up combined earnings of about $30 billion this financial year as headline profits benefit from very few loans going sour.\nBank profit margins and any signs of worsening bad debts will be in the spotlight this week as two of the country's largest banks deliver their full-year results only days after raising interest rates.\nHowever, National Australia Bank and ANZ Bank executives are likely to face questions over the extent to which banks can sustain highly prized dividends by passing on higher capital costs when they deliver full-year results to the market.\nNAB, which unveils its results on Wednesday, is predicted to report profits of $6.26 billion, market estimates say, while the ANZ Bank profit is tipped to hit $7.29 billion on Thursday.\nMacquarie Group reports interim earnings on Friday. Investors and analysts will be keen to quiz chief executive Nicholas Moore about how anticipated record profits will be sustained.\nIn the last two weeks, NAB, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have all increased their home loan rates in an attempt to offset some of the drag on their returns from tougher capital rules, which dampen profitability.\nThe increases, which have ranged from 0.15 percentage points for CBA to 0.2 percentage points for Westpac, are likely to boost the big four's combined earnings by about $1 billion.\nWhile the rate hikes or \"repricing\" will not impact on the banks' upcoming results, the market is likely to scrutinise how bank lending margins are faring in the face of fierce competition in home lending.\n \"For the major banks, we see mortgage repricing as essential to restoring profitability and preserving dividends per share,\" Citi analyst Craig Williams said in a note.\nThe moves to increase interest rates have come as net interest margins – a gauge of funding costs compared with the price of loans – are being pressured by fierce competition in institutional lending and the discount mortgage market until earlier this year.\nBell Potter analyst T S Lim forecast ANZ's net interest margin would be squeezed to 2 per cent – from 2.13 per cent a year ago – because of mainly pressure in its international arm.\nCredit quality is also set to be a key focus for ANZ. In August, it posted an increase in provisions for bad loans, which have been at historic lows, boosting the bottom line.\nNAB will also provide the market with further details on its plan to spin off Clydesdale Bank in Britain to shareholders by the end of the year.\nWestpac will also formally report its profits on November 2. However, it pre-announced full-year earnings of $7.8 billion when it launched a $3.5 billion capital raising this month.\nEarnings growth would also be in the spotlight at Macquarie after it this month upgraded its earnings guidance for the six months ended September 30, as it announced the $8.2 billion acquisition of ANZ's Esanda dealer finance division.\nMacquarie flagged that interim profit would climb 55 per cent on the same period last year, suggesting a circa $1.05 billion result. Underscoring the better than expected result is the bringing forward of a performance fee from an asset sale and favourable trading conditions in financial markets.\n\"With first-half 2016 [results] pre-announced, a key focus will be the reliance on performance fees and lumpy items,\" Matthew Davison, a senior research analyst at Martin Currie, said.\n\"The market will be anticipating further guidance upgrades later in the year, so this result should offer clues as to what might sustain the trend. The resilience of the commodity trading revenues and further M&A growth might be important in offsetting fewer one-off gains moving into 2017. The CAF (corporate asset finance) division and Asian equities are other areas of optimism.\"\nThe Esanda dealer finance purchase sits within the CAF unit.\nMacquarie expects the interim dividend to be $1.60 per share franked at 40 per cent, up from $1.30 per share in the same period a year earlier.\nAnalysts expect Macquarie will book a record full-year result of $2 billion, surpassing the $1.8 billion profit posted in 2008.\nNAB has flagged it will leave its dividend unchanged at 99c a share, while ANZ is also expected to leave the dividend unchanged, market estimates cited by Mr Lim show.\nCommonwealth Bank, which, unlike rivals, operates on a June financial year, reported record full-year profits of $9.14 billion in August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:04:06.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
