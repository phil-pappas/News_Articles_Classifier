Owura Sarfo said the partnership will totally overhaul the ECG. He indicated that the REOI which has been publicized in the local and international media is a demonstration of government’s commitment to engaging in a transparent and competitive process to attract and select a proven private partner to operate ECG through a concession agreement. \nIng. Sarfo, dispelled fears a greater number of ECG workers would be retrenched under the partnership arrangement. “We are fortunate to have a situation where ECG is not overstaffed unlike other organisations where, if a general reform is being done you find out that they are overstaffed right from the beginning and you have to lay off staff. In the case of ECG it is not the case, therefore, we do not see any retrenchment.” \nHe added that there may be people in the company who on their own may take a decision not to work for the new concessionaire and emphasized that arrangements will be put in place to address that “but currently, we don’t have a retrenchment programme because ECG is not overstaffed.” \nMiDA is therefore urging local companies especially to take up the challenge by quickly submitting their letters of interest to partner the ECG in the transformation agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:53:51.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
