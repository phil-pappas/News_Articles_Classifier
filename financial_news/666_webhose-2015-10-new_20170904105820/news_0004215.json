Technical issues had delayed LME price feeds earlier in the session.\nShanghai zinc gained 2.3 percent to 14,140 yuan ($2,227) a tonne.\nTraders noted mine supply had already been set to shrink given the closure of MMG's huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland this year.\n\"Zinc should outperform the other metals now,\" said one trader in Singapore.\nLME metals rallied in zinc's tailwind. LME lead, which is often mined alongside zinc, jumped 1.7 percent. LME copper climbed 1.2 percent to $5,183 a tonne, while nickel and aluminium also rose between half a percent and one percent.\nMetals were also buttressed after minutes of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting led investors to further pare bets that the central bank will hike interest rates this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve thought the economy was close to warranting an interest rate hike in September but policymakers wanted firmer evidence a global economic slowdown was not knocking America off course. nL1N128230\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin\n($1 = 6.3500 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Richard Pullin )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:07:19.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
