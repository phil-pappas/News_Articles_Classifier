Two thirds of John Lewis’ customers use both online and stores to inform their shopping trip. \nAndy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said click and collect continued to be the fastest growing channel for the company, despite the introduction of a £2 charge for orders under £30. \nMr Street said the new strategy had “performed exactly as planned some people are paying the charge because they like the convenience, some are trading up to make bigger orders and some are saying that they won’t make that order now but we have no way of tracking if they make the purchase later on”. \nMr Street was speaking as John Lewis unveiled its third annual “how we shop, live and look” report into shopping habits. \nThe report revealed that technology was creeping into every area of our lives, including how we sleep, relax and eat. \nThe retailer said the Nutribullet was the top technology item on customers’ wishlists as the craze for juicing continues, closely followed by Spiralizers, which turn vegetables such as courgettes into spaghetti-like strands and are endorsed by clean eating chefs like Hemsley & Hemsley and Ella Woodward. \nMeanwhile, sales of Fitbit fitness gadgets rose by 240pc along with an 11pc rise in sports equipment. \n“I don’t think the gadgets are a fad,” Mr Street said. “Over the longer term people are trying to live healthier lies, they are trying to cut out smoking and eat better. The measuring of their health might be a fad, but broader healthier living is here to stay.” \nMr Street said that the capital was “categorically the most health aware” region with Dyson air humidifiers being a big seller due to concerns about air pollution. However elsewhere, Newcastle was the biggest region for the sale of GoPros while weighing scales were top sellers in Solihull. The company revealed that it sold 87 Fitbits in Kingston for every 7 in Cardiff. \nHowever, the increase of technology, specifically Kindle, has come at the expense of bookcases, a staple of peoples’ living rooms. Mr Street said it was the most dismaying trend in the 43-page research report. \n“I was surprised by the decline in bookcases because historically the first thing you bought for your flat was a bookcase, I had a bookcase before I had a television. But people have less printed materials, so it makes eminent sense. It’s also driven by many more of our customers being in urban flats with less space.” \nTechnology items have also pushed off traditional wedding gift items , such as crystal stem glasses and formal silver tableware, with a 13pc increase in couples requesting Sonos and Bose Bluetooth speakers. However, John Lewis, which sold enough wedding bunting last year to stretch 50 times around St Pauls, said crockery is remains a top giftlist item seller, although one eccentric couple did request a crossbow. \nJohn Lewis also recorded a 170pc increase in Christening items which it put down to Princess Charlottes’ celebrations in July. The Royal occasion was the only event Mr Street credited with being directly related to a spike in sales, while celebrities such as David Beckham accentuated longer term trends. \nMenswear was dominated by a 75pc increase in navy and charcoal suits last year with men become increasingly style conscious. As a result, John Lewis said that men spent on average 6pc more than women on clothes this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:10:04.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
