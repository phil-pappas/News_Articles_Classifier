For that, participants must be able to drive a wedge between the price they charge and what it costs them to make, sell and service their product.And as Michael Porter argued in Competitive Advantage , even if an industry does have high profit potential, it makes the most sense to invest in a company that has a competitive advantage -- the ability to do well what's needed to take market share from rivals and generate superior returns.Sadly the $67 billion acquisition of [entity display=\"EMC\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"emc\" ticker=\"EMC\" exchange=\"NYSE\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1441\"]EMC[/entity] that Dell proposed on October 12 fails both the profit potential and competitive advantage tests. Its focus on commodity hardware dooms it to make very little profit. They sell to enterprises that are shifting much of their work to the cloud and thus will purchase less of this hardware at the lowest possible price with no vendor loyalty.The storage hardware industry in which EMC plays is huge -- IDC predicted that enterprises would spend over $40 billion on storage hardware in 2015.The problem is that the profits from that business are falling because the high price and high cost of owning disk drives -- the way EMC makes most of its money -- create a price umbrella under which aggressive new entrants can cut price to gain market share.The new entrants offer a variety of technical solutions including companies like Pure Storage with its all-flash arrays -- a market in which EMC's XtremIO holds the lead, according to Gartner -- and Nimble Storage -- which offers hybrids of flash and traditional disk storage.And investment in these startups has been soaring -- in 2014, they raised $1.62 billion in funding up 25% from 2013. Moreover, between 2010 and the first half of 2015, venture capitalists invested over $6 billion into 96 storage startups, according to CB Insights . These include Nutanix, Primary Data, Tintri, SimpliVity, Virident Systems, Maginatics, and [entity display=\"Box\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"box\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102487\"]Box[/entity][caption id=\"attachment_38deb17b33d64889a46c6d09ca1d6eea\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] A sign with an EMC logo stands on the company's corporate campus, Monday, Oct. 12, 2015, in Hopkinton, Mass.

Publicly-traded cloud purveyors generated over $25 billion in market capitalization in 2008, $180 billion in May 2015, a figure expected to soar to $500 billion in 2020, at a 22.6% compound annual growth rate, according to Bessemer Venture Partners .But companies do need to buy some storage hardware to build a private cloud for regulatory applications. As Ash Ashutosh, CEO of Actifio, a maker of software that boosts storage productivity, explained in an October 15 interview, \"Companies say I want to buy 100 terabytes of data, put the contract out to bid to nine vendors, and pick the cheapest.\"Dell wants EMC for its storage hardware -- arguing that customers want to buy all their hardware -- e.g., servers and storage -- from a single vendor.But what Dell wants to deliver is the opposite of what customers want to buy. Said Ashutosh, \"I was just at a Gartner conference in Las Vegas and 800 CIOs were saying that they want freedom by tapping the public cloud.\"This brings us to the question of competitive advantage -- which comes from two generic strategies, according to Porter:\nLow cost producer -- charging a lower price than any other competitor and making higher margins by using purchase scale and other methods to lower your costs way below your price; or t Differentiation -- charging a higher price than rivals because you give customers benefits for which they are willing to pay a premium and keep your costs below that price. To be fair, Dell -- when it was a leader in the PC industry in the 1990s -- had mastered the art of taking cost out of the supply chain and charging higher prices because it customized PCs for its corporate customers.So it was able to earn a profit in an industry with inherently low profit potential.But a review of Dell's most recent financial information reveals that it is shrinking and losing money. According to the New York Times , Dell lost a whopping $768 million on sales that fell 6.8% to $27.5 billion in the first half of 2015.Nevertheless, it is conceivable that Dell -- which will take on about $50 billion in debt to finance this deal -- could cut out so much cost that it could become a low cost producer.Unfortunately, I do not see an opportunity for sufficient cost cutting to enable Dell to sell servers and storage hardware at the lowest price of any of its rivals and then push its costs well-below that price.That's because upstart storage companies save customers so much money with their lower prices. Moreover, venture investors have subsidized these upstarts' losses so they can gain market share fast, boost revenues above $100 million and go public.Pure Storage -- which went public earlier this month -- is a case in point.Pure is growing much faster than EMC -- its storage business gained 2% -- though it’s losing lots of money in the process. It hit $174 million in revenue in its fiscal 2015 (ending January 31), more than four times the $43 million in revenue it reported for 2014, according to its prospectus .But Pure’s 2015 net loss was a whopping $193 million more than double its 2014 loss of $79 million. And its sales and engineering productivity are not high enough for it to earn a profit yet.Nimble Storage -- which went public in 2013 -- is trying to become profitable by gaining a bigger share of its customers' wallets and through scale economies as it grows.But that path to profitability is slow.A more profitable strategy for players in the storage business may be to offer a software platform on commodity hardware using what Ashutosh calls a \"land and expand\" strategy -- meaning that a company tries the software in a pilot, and once it works expands its use across the company.Actifio uses Land and Expand. \"We are the foundation for 58 service providers including Amazon AWS and Google. We offer data as infrastructure and we are independent of specific vendor's hardware.\"I don't know if Actifio is making money but this strategy sounds plausible.EMC and Dell are not growing while smaller rivals are booming. The one-stop-shop strategy that Dell envisions is at odds with what enterprises want. Moreover, by selling server and storage hardware, the combined companies will be focusing on a big industry with at best slim margins.And I just don't see Dell or EMC winning through a low cost producer or differentiation strategy.If the Dell/EMC deal closes, perhaps one day Michael Dell will be able to prove me wrong.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/38deb17b33d64889a46c6d09ca1d6eea/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://marketrealist.com/2015/09/wave-startups-hit-data-storage-space/", "http://www.clearslide.com/view/mail?iID=UGVYTY42F2KZHXLV54B7", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/business/in-a-flurry-of-deals-the-beginning-of-the-end.html?hpw&rref=business&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=well-region&region=bottom-well&WT.nav=bottom-well&_r=1", "http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=193", "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474432/000119312515334446/d895532ds1a.htm"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:18:49.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
