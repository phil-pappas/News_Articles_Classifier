PUBLISHED: 09:58, Mon, Oct 5, 2015 | UPDATED: 12:50, Mon, Oct 5, 2015 GETTY The Tories promised £4bn of Lloyds shares would be sold to the public \nShares will be made available to retail investors next year with a 5 per cent discount off their market price, George Osborne announced today. But the smaller than expected sale means that demand is now far expected to outstrip supply. The Government today said people buying less than £1,000 worth of stock would be prioritised. Investors will also be awarded a bonus share for every 10 purchased if they hold their investment for more than a year - capped at £200 per investor.The Tories promised that up to £4bn worth of shares would be made available to the public if they were voted back into power. But less than six months after the election, Mr Osborne has disappointed by signalling that around £2bn would be made available.

Around £15bn has already been sold off to faceless private banks and huge investment companies to reduce the taxpayer's holding in the bank to below 12 per cent.The Government pumped more than £20 billion into Lloyds in a bid to prop up the bank at the height of the financial crisis.Now almost all of the taxpayer's £20bn stake in the bank is set to be sold - at a discount - to fat cat institutional investors.Speaking on ITV1's Good Morning Britain, Mr Osborne today said: \"We are selling Lloyds shares to members of the public, people watching this programme, small investors, people who are going to have a chance to get something back having put all that money in under the last Labour government.\" \nThe sale is expected to be particularly popular among small investors, especially as dividends from the bank look set to increase . \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\"‘Wild horses couldn’t drag investors away from this share sale, especially given the discounted price and the dividend stream Lloyds is expected to start churning out. \"Pensioners in particular are likely to respond to a trusted high street brand with a decent yield when interest rates are so low.\" \nHe added: \"Lloyds used to be a dividend giant in the FTSE 100 before the financial crisis and now, after years in the wilderness, the bank has started to pay a dividend again and is expected to yield 3.5 per cent this year and 5 per cent in 2016.\" \nInvestors who apply for Lloyds shares within an ISA or Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) will be able to shield payouts from income tax, and profits will be free from capital gains tax too. \nMore details about the share sale are expected to be made in the coming months, with interested investors able to sign up for email alerts here .
