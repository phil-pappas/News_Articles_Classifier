The RBI has lowered policy rates by 1.25 per cent so far in 2015.\nBMI Research said that banks have been lowering their deposit rates since September 2014, and it expects declines in lending rates to follow due to the reduction in repo rate and ample liquidity within the banking system.\n 07, 2015 8:02 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:32:08.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
