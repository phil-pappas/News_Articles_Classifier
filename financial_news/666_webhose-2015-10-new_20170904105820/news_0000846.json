ADVERTISEMENT “The committee’s overwhelming approval of the STRR Act today is a positive step forward for our Nation’s transportation system and our economy,” Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) said in statement after the Thursday vote, even as he readied another temporary infrastructure patch. \n“I look forward to House action on the bill and going to conference with the Senate as soon as possible,” Shuster continued. \nGOP leaders said Friday that the three-week highway funding package could come up for a vote on the floor of the House as early as Tuesday, which give the Senate two days to take up the patch before the scheduled expiration of the current transportation funding law. \nThe measure does not include any new money, because lawmakers included enough money in three-month transportation bill that was approved in July to last until the end of the year in case they needed more time to finish work on a multiyear fix. The earlier patch is scheduled to expire Thursday, necessitating the new measure that is now being introduced in the House. \nCongress has not passed a transportation funding bill that last longer than two years since 2005, much to the chagrin of infrastructure advocates in Washington. \nPresident Obama has also decried the number of temporary patches, which transportation advocates say hamstring state governments who are working on long-term construction projects. But the White House signaled Friday that Obama will sign the latest temporary road funding patch. \n“The unfortunate reality is Congress will need to pass another short-term” measure, White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters Friday afternoon. \nThe Senate has already passed a bill that includes three years of guaranteed highway funding in July, and lawmakers in the upper chamber have said they expect to be able to get a multi-year highway bill to Obama’s desk by Thanksgiving. \n\"Both the Senate and the House bills have many similarities that will allow for a very short conference period,\" Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement after the House panel's vote. \n\"With this milestone, Congress should be able to send a bill to the president’s desk by Thanksgiving,\" Inhofe continued. \"This will allow for our nation to avoid the Highway Trust Fund hitting a dangerously low level, which DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx warned would significantly affect the 2016 construction season.” \nThe Department of Transportation has warned that it will have to stop making payments to states and local governments for infrastructure projects in November if Congress does not reach an agreement. \nThe text of the temporary highway funding legislation can be read here .
