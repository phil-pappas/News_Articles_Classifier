The festival itself has not been cancelled or suspended, with certain roads opened up in the Sandton CBD to help ease traffic pressure in the area. The M1 south has been closed from the Buccleuch interchange where the N1, N3 and M1 meet, with traffic diverted down the two national highways. The city warned of heavy traffic pressure, especially from Fourways, Linbro Park and Midrand. The M1 north has been closed from the Athol Oaklands off-ramp, with traffic diverted onto arterial and surrounding roads. The concrete Grayston bridge remained open to traffic to crossover the highway. Pointsmen have also been deployed at the Rivonia N1 off-ramp to help manage the expected heavy traffic. Tau said the city had made available free bus services on Thursday via the Gautrain buses, Metrobus, and Putco, and had increased capacity on the Gautrain to help alleviate traffic. On Wednesday, construction company Murray & Roberts, responsible for the construction of the scaffolding, said in a statement there was still no clarity on the cause. Its directors and CEO had gone to the scene, with the immediate priority ensuring those affected were taken care of.
