The project run by Silas, Garland of Peace, has come under the scanner of the agency which will see whether any bribes were paid through it, they said, adding that all funds which came to the project and other cultural activities of Silas would also be probed. Sources said a company run by the son of M S Chaliam, another Railway officer facing CBI probe in the case, has also come under the probe of the agency.\nIllegal payoffs\nCBI suspects private catering companies could have paid illegal remittances to the officer through the company run by his son for alleged favours shown to them for supplying inferior quality of packaged drinking water on premium trains.\nThe sources clarified that both the angles were at the initial stage of probe, which would be investigated in depth to arrive at any logical conclusion. CBI has registered a case against Chaliam, Silas and seven private companies -- RK Associates Pvt Ltd, Satyam Caterers Pvt Ltd, Ambuj Hotel and Real Estate, PK Associates Pvt Ltd, Sunsine Pvt Ltd, Brandavan Food Product and Food World -- under the provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:45:43.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
