Bricks and mortar branches introduced banking correspondents, ATMs, Internet banking, payment gateways, etc. An age of banking revolution has come to the country, and there is hardly any family in the country which is outside the purview of banking,” he said.\nHailing the banking sector for popularising insurance and pension facilities, Jaitley said, “The banks are also helping the unorganised sectors under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. Under the scheme, which started a week back, more than 61 lakh families, who are new entrepreneurs, got Rs 35,000 crore.”\nThe IDFC Bank, he said, which will a combination of bricks and mortar and Internet banking, would reach out to people in villages, and will not only provide benefits to the rural people, but also help create jobs.\n 19, 2015 7:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:14:07.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
