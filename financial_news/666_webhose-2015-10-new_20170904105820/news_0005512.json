Louie Douvis by Dominic White Directors at Nine Entertainment Co have made informal approaches to potential candidates for one of the toughest roles in Australian media – succeeding David Gyngell, the best-known executive in television.\nThe board of the free-to-air television and digital business has begun to discuss succession planning for its next chief executive amid rising expectations that Mr Gyngell will not seek to renew his contract when it expires at the end of 2016.\nMr Gyngell, who is widely credited with saving Nine from financial collapse in 2012 and bringing it back to the sharemarket a year later, must give the board notice next month if he plans to leave when his contract expires.\nHe is understood to have no plans to walk away from Nine altogether and is expected to retain a board seat or advisory role.\nOne of those believed to have been approached is Gordon Ballantyne, who quit this month as Telstra retail group executive after five years with the business.\nOther executives that could be targeted include Anthony Fitzgerald, chief executive of Foxtel's Multi-Channel Network, Ian Audsley, the chief executive of Prime Media, former News Corp Australia chief Kim Williams and former Seven West Media chief financial officer Peter Lewis.\nNine's well-regarded chief operating officer and chief financial officer Simon Kelly would be among the internal names considered. Nine declined to comment.\nStarting in a good place Mr Gyngell's eventual successor will inherit a company with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, thanks in part to the $640 million disposal of its Nine Live ticketing and events business in April.\nBut they will also take over the company at a time of dizzying change with digital overseas players – led by US video streaming giant Netflix – causing investors to question the long-term future of traditional, linear free-to-air television.\nNine has invested in its own subscription video-on-demand service, Stan, with Fairfax Media, owner of The Australian Financial Review .\nNine shares closed at $1.62 on Friday, down from their $2.05 listing price in December 2013. They have performed better over that period than its closest rival Seven West Media, which still has print assets.\nMr Gyngell has deep links to Nine dating back to his father Bruce Gyngell, the first man on Australian television, who was a trusted lieutenant of Frank Packer at Channel Nine.\nLike his father before him, Mr Gyngell walked out on Nine – in his case Frank's son Kerry, whom he considered a second father – only to return to the company in 2007 when it was under private equity ownership.\nHe earned a $10 million shares bonus from Nine's initial public offering late last year – escrowed for three years – with the ­potential to earn $10 million a year if he hit all his targets.\nMr Gyngell has forged a reputation as a trusted, approachable and well-liked businessman, which is unusual in the catty world of television.\nHe made headlines for the wrong reasons in May 2014 when he brawled in public with his long-time friend James Packer.\nMr Gyngell has two young children with his wife Leila McKinnon, the Channel Nine TV presenter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:09:27.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
