PUBLISHED: 17:47, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:06, Mon, Oct 12, 2015 GETTY Boiler breakdown is more likely to happen when the weather gets colder \nIt typically costs £344 to repair a broken down boiler, according to comparison site Gocompare.com.But the bill could easily run much higher, with around one in ten homes that has had boiler problems in recent years paying more than £1,000. To make it worse, the cost is most likely to come when the weather is coldest, in January or December - at the same time that households are typically at their most cash-strapped after paying for seasonal gifts and celebrations. Only in three homes would be able to afford to pay a boiler breakdown if they had to now, with many having to put the cost on credit card, found Gocompare.com. Homeowners may have cover for emergency boiler or central heating repairs under their home buildings insurance - but systems that have not been serviced in the previous 12 months are usually excluded. Some standard insurance policies also exclude boiler breakdown, and it must be purchased as an add-on.
