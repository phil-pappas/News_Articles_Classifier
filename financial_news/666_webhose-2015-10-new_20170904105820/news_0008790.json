The crux of the dispute is how to value them while adjusting for the impact of several currency devaluations and hyperinflation. \nBondholders claim they are worth $5bn, but the administration of president Ollanta Humala is only offering compensation using an adjustment methodology that offers a fraction of this. Gramercy estimates that the government’s offered payout will at most amount to $24m. Mr Pretel reckons he is owed $5m, but says the Peruvian state now wants to pay him less than 30 cents. \n“While we strongly prefer a consensual resolution, Peru should not mistake our commitment to a pragmatic and constructive dialogue as a lack of resolve,” says James Taylor, a   Gramercy. \nThe hedge fund is openly threatening to seek redress through a US-Peruvian free trade agreement , and is stepping up an information campaign and backing bondholder groups to put pressure on the government. \nThe Peruvian Land Reform Bondholders Association, a local lobbying organisation, attempted to stage a protest at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank’s annual meeting, which was held in Lima this week, but say they were denied a permit to do so. \n“[The bondholders association] and its members will observe rule of law and not engage in peaceful protests,” the group’s representative Ramón Remolina said in a statement. “We only wish that the government obeyed the legitimate rulings of its courts and honoured our right to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.” \nGramercy has held a big chunk of the land bonds for many years, after snapping them up on the market for esoteric long-defaulted debt, like North Korean or Cuban loans. But it has shied away from calling publicly for repayment — until recently. The reason for its new, vocal approach is fresh concerns over a 2013 Constitutional Tribunal ruling on the bonds. \nOver the decades, a series of governments have baulked at the cost of paying the bonds, preferring to defer the issue to future administrations. Two years ago the Constitutional Tribunal reaffirmed an earlier ruling that the government had to repay the bondholders at an adjusted value — but crucially   calculate its own methodology, which was announced in January 2014. \nAllegations of irregularities around the decision spurred bondholders like Mr Pretel and Gramercy to renew their push for a fairer deal. \n“Unfortunately, it is just one part of what appears to be a grand scheme by the Humala administration to evade this decades-old debt,” Mr Taylor says. \nSenior Peruvian officials are unconcerned, and say the old debts are being dealt with “unquestioningly” under the country’s laws. One government official said the timing for the ruckus was a strategy to tarnish Peru’s reputation during the IMF and World Bank meeting. \nBut Carlos Mesía, a former magistrate of the Constitutional Court at the time of the decision, indicates bondholders have cause to feel aggrieved. \n”There was no legal norm that established how to update the price of the bonds, so the tribunal needed to establish a criteria. But that criteria did not really respect the previous sentence regarding the adjusted value,” he says. \nBondholders argue that Peru could exchange the old defaulted land debts   giving Peru plenty of time to repay creditors and only add modestly to the state’s overall indebtedness. \nThe question is whether Gramercy has any chance of compelling the Peruvian government to do so — either through the courts or through public embarrassment. The asset manager says it is considering lodging   the Andean country under the US-Peru Free Trade Agreement, which entered into force in 2009. But local and international lawyers give this avenue little chance of success, and the government appears unconcerned. \n“The truth is there has never been much willingness from any Peruvian government to pay these bonds,” says Geoffrey Cannock, an economist with Apoyo Consultoría in Lima. “They have rather had legal battles over them, than actually pay them.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
