I welcome the court's decision, and the signal that it sends to multinationals operating in Australia.\n\"The tentacles of multinational corporations like Chevron must pay tax wherever they unfurl.\"\nInternational Transport Workers' Federation president Paddy Crumlin said the $322 million fine should serve as a warning to Chevron and other corporations.\n\"The scheme rejected today was for $2.5 billion in high interest related party debt,\" Mr Crumlin said. \"The ATO is now examining a similar $35 billion Chevron tax scheme. In light of this decision, this audit is now the most important the ATO has ever undertaken.\"\nHe said because LNG exports were expected to triple in the next few years, it was \"critical that tax authorities and governments take a very close look at how Chevron structures its' tax arrangements\".\n\"Billions of dollars of tax revenue could be lost to the Australian people unless the government takes an aggressive approach to major tax minimisers like Chevron,\" Mr Crumlin said.\nComment has been sought from Chevron.\nMore to come\nwith Marianna Papadakis", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/ato-alleges-complex-chevron-scheme-slashed-tax-bill-by-258m-20141008-113696.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/chevron-parents-leave-ato-an-orphan-20150517-gh3i0z.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:03:40.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
