Peter Bennetts Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby\nThe building had good bones. That's how Will Walker, who led the renovation of Macquarie's 50 Martin Place headquarters in Sydney, sums up the 87-year-old landmark.\nWhen Walker, the banking group's global head of business services, first walked through it in November 2011, it didn't take him long to realise that the structure, completed in 1928, would lend itself well to a modern conversion.\nThe basic design of the former Government Savings Bank of NSW was good. The task ahead would be to restore the building back to what it had been, rather than turn it into something different.\nA sense of community is embodied within the interior of 50 Martin Place. Brett Boardman Photography \"We had a look at the building and saw that it has some good bones,\" he recalls. \"The design challenge was to remove things, not put them back.\"\nFor those bones had been obscured by reconstructive surgery over the intervening years as different generations of bankers and workers shaped the building to their needs. The atrium that originally - and cleverly - had fed light from roof to ground floor was blocked in the 1980s with the creation of a plant room on level one. The high, airy ceilings on the office floors had been lowered to fit in large airconditioning ducts; pipes and infrastructure pock-marked the once-simple and elegant design, inside and out.\n\"The floors were quite significantly different to how they are today,\" Walker says. \"But what we did recognise very quickly was the building itself had the type of raw bones that we really liked, which was this consideration of open atrium, connected floor space, side core – those areas that meant we could build a community .\"\nThe Johnson Pilton Walker-led renovation added a two-floor stainless steel canopy on top of the 10-level building, widened the central atrium and installed a common staircase – designed by architects Bligh Voller Nield - to connect floors internally in the void.\nThe grand hallway ceiling looking to Castlereagh Street. Peter Bennetts Two circular glass lifts take visitors directly from the ground-floor banking chamber – carefully restored by previous owner Commonwealth Bank of Australia in neo-classical style prior to Macquarie's acquisition – up, past the open working floors of the building, to the new top floors under the dome.\nIn early July, 50 Martin Place won the top NSW prize for commercial architecture , the Sir Arthur G. Stephenson Award.\nProperty-industry veteran Walker is a no-small-talk, brusque Brit. It sounds odd to hear him talk about something as fuzzy as \"community\" within the heritage building. But as the head of Macquarie's real estate team, he has responsibility for getting its physical assets around the world to not just accommodate the group's 14,000 staff but to help them work better together, keep motivated, productive and – in an era of ever-improving technology – to connect them as seamlessly as possible.\nIt's a challenge workplaces and employers the world over are grappling with.\nThe glass lifts Macquarie installed to take clients from the ground-floor banking chamber to the top levels won Elevator World’s Project of the Year, New Construction category award, 2015. Brett Boardman Photography Air of content Back to the bones. Designed in an era when offices depended on ventilation and natural light to work, the building with a side-located - rather than central - core of services like lifts offered a great template. Widening the atrium by 50 per cent increased the natural light flowing into the building and the air circulating throughout it.\n\"There's lots of natural light coming down through the building,\" says Walker's colleague Michael Silman. \"And the air itself actually flows through the building and back up through the central atrium again.\"\nBetter technology permitted them to replace the 1980s airconditioning ducts, which required massive ceiling voids, with water-based chilled beams that took up much less space. A light well in the northern end of the building that had been filled with airconditioning plant infrastructure was opened up again.\nThe ground-floor banking chamber. Peter Bennetts \"You get two ends of light – you get light in the atrium and then at this northern light well as well,\" Walker says.\nMacquarie, which purchased the building in July 2012 from CBA (which took over the Government Savings Bank during the Great Depression), completed its $100 million-plus refurbishment just over two years later, in September 2014.\nWalker says it's hard to say whether the bank saved money by adapting the existing building rather than flattening it and starting again. But architect Richard Johnson, whose firm JPW oversaw the renovation, argues there were clear benefits in doing it this way.\n\"The embodied energy in this original building is huge, in terms of the energy used to produce the original materials,\" Johnson says. \"If you scrapped that and started again … you could put the most efficient current, contemporary building in its place, and it would take you 30 years in savings from a badly performing to a prime-performing building just to recoup the embodied energy in the materials.\"\nJPW widened the central atrium by cutting the floor plates back from the granite-clad internal supporting columns. They stripped the columns and painted them white, leaving them exposed, skeleton-like, in the void that visitors whizz past in the glass lift.\n\"That's part of the adaptive reuse of the heritage – to keep as much of the heritage fabric as possible,\" Johnson says. \"In the fullness of time, if somebody wanted to put those walls back, it could be done.\n\"So we didn't want to demolish any structure; [but] keep the bones of the building intact.\"\nThe central atrium is filled with light and features one of Macquarie's signature staircases, designed to enhance a sense of connection and community.
