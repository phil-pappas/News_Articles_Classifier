Alibaba said it’s paying a 30 percent premium to Thursday’s closing price in New York. The deal values the whole company at $4.2 billion based on the number of outstanding shares as of Dec. 31.\nBuying Youku Tudou, China’s most popular video-streaming website, would let Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma deliver U.S. films and drama series to more than a third of the population.\nYouku, which has risen 15 percent this year, climbed 4.9 percent to $20.43 on Thursday. Alibaba advanced 4.7 percent to $71.78.\nMa toured California in October 2014, looking for content to beam to Chinese consumers.\nLike Alibaba, Youku is zeroing in on U.S. studios for programming. The company, which mostly streams professionally produced content rather than amateur videos, plans to collaborate with U.S. entertainment producers to create content that could be watched on its website, Chairman Victor Koo said in an Oct. 27 interview in Hong Kong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:29:48.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
