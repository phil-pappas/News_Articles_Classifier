The data gave hope the Federal Reserve may actually raise rates this year, underpinning the U.S. currency.\nCommonwealth Foreign Exchange Chief Market Analyst Omer Esiner, however, said any sustained gain in the dollar \"will come from a more defined increase in hopes for a December Fed rate hike.\" That, he said, could come from a more hawkish Fed at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting or a solid uptick in payrolls for October and November.\nIn late trading, the euro was 0.2 percent lower at $1.1322 , from a 10-day trough of $1.1307. Against sterling, it fell 0.7 percent to 73.22 pence after dropping to a four-week low of 73.04 pence.\nMany banks were expecting the euro to fall to parity with the dollar by the end of the year as the ECB pumps 60 billion euros into the economy each month. But since dipping below $1.05 in March, it has gained 9 percent, adding to deflationary pressures in the euro zone.\nThe dollar index, meanwhile, on Monday rose 0.3 percent to 94.952.\nAfter this week's ECB meeting, the focus will turn to the Fed, which holds its policy meeting next week. Interest rate futures traders are banking on the Fed raising rates in March next year, with a 52 percent chance, according to the CME Group FedWatch on Monday.\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams, a voting member of the FOMC, said on Monday the U.S. economy has good momentum, and despite strong headwinds from overseas that are holding down inflation, the Fed should start raising rates in the \"near future.\" (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London ; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:25:09.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
