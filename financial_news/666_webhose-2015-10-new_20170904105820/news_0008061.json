Photo: Jim Rice\nQantas Airways is unlikely to take a financial hit from any changes to regulation surrounding credit card surcharges because it could wrap the current booking fees into its base fares just as it did with its previous fuel surcharges, says Macquarie Equities analyst Sam Dobson.\nOn Tuesday, the federal government accepted the recommendations of David Murray's Financial System Inquiry to clamp down on surcharges on credit and other card transactions, saying they should only reflect the cost of the transaction.\nMore than 5000 of the 6500 final submissions to the Murray inquiry were on surcharging. This was prompted by a Change.org campaign by Gold Coast businessman Klaus Bartosch .\nQantas charges booking fees of $2.50 to $30 per passenger for each booking, depending on the payment method, in a move that bankers suspect helps to cover the cost of providing frequent flyer points to its loyalty program members .\nLow-cost carrier Jetstar, which only offers Qantas points on fare bundles at an extra cost to the customer, charges $8.50 to $12.50 per passenger per flight for bookings on credit cards and debit cards other than its cobranded Mastercard. At present, the total cost for a return trip from Sydney to Melbourne on its lowest fare is about $175. Payment surcharges are $17 on that trip, or 9.7 per cent. Rival Virgin Australia charges $7.70 per person per booking for payment via credit or debit card on domestic flights.\nAdvertisement A move to lower those fees could result in a significant revenue hit for the airlines, but Mr Dobson said he believed they would instead raise fares to compensate for the loss of those fees.\n\"I think you would likely see the same type of thing we have seen as the fuel surcharges,\" he said, referring to their removal earlier this year on all but Qantas frequent flyer redemption tickets . \"Any surcharges in place at the moment would be wrapped up in the fare. Ultimately the price that people are paying is the total price including the surcharge. That is the clearing price and that is important.\"\nThe questions over credit card fees also come as Woolworths is considering whether to end its longstanding relationship with Qantas Loyalty. The exact amount of revenue Qantas Loyalty receives from Woolworths has never been disclosed, but it is possible it could represent at least 10 per cent of the $1.369 billion of billings reported by the Qantas Loyalty program in the last financial year.\n\"In terms of the overall billings Woolies will be a material part of that,\" Mr Dobson said. But he said the overall financial impact on the frequent flyer program earnings from losing Woolworths shouldn't be \"too significant\".\nQantas has been adding new earnings streams to its loyalty arm, such as analytics and tailored marketing, to help reduce its dependence on the core frequent flyer program as it looks to continue to grow earnings at a double-digit rate .\nQantas Loyalty reported a 10 per cent rise in underlying earnings before interest and tax to a record $315 million in the last financial year. The profit rise was double the 4.8 per cent growth rate in its core billings to the airline, credit card partners and retailers like Woolworths from the purchase of frequent flyer points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:13:14.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
