But the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has long been wary of deals where the top three players are cut to two, says Allan Fels, a former chairman of the commission.\nAdvertisement \"This deal will not have an easy ride through the ACCC,\" said Fels. \"The battle between second and third position often stimulates competition more generally in the market... In this case it's not clear there is a lot of surrounding competition, and therefore it could be that a cosy duopoly emerges.\"\nWith brands including Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught, SABMiller is Australia's biggest brewer with around 38 per cent market share. It's followed closely by Kirin Holdings, which claims 32 per cent of the market with its stable of beers including local favourites XXXX and Toohey's.\n\"No easy ride\": Former ACCC chairman Allan Fels. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nAfter AB InBev, which has 8.5 per cent of the local beer market with brands such as Corona and Becks, the next biggest brewer, privately owned Coopers Brewery, has just a 3.6 per cent share.\nBrewing opposition \"If there is evidence that the No. 3 is likely to grow and be an effective competitive constraint against the big two, then that would suggest that there could be concerns,\" said one competition lawyer, who asked not to be identified.\nThe merger is expected to have repercussions for the rest of the global beer industry, particularly in the United States where the two companies would own about 70 per cent of the beer market unless they sell off some assets.\nAnalysts say the combined group might also have to sell interests in China, where SABMiller's CR Snow joint venture with China Resources Enterprise is the market leader.\nTo get the deal over the line, the beer giants may even have to get rid of Snow, the best-selling beer on the planet, they say.\n\"It's conceivable that the merger is blocked internationally,\" said Fels, who was chairman of the ACCC until 2003 and is now an economics professor at the University of Melbourne.\n\"But if it's not, if it sails through overseas but is blocked here, they'd have to consider calling off this part of the transaction.\"\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:25:56.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
