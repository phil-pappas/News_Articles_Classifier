Jessica Shapiro by Joanna Mather New laws stating the purpose of superannuation must disavow the accumulation of excessive wealth, a leading industry body says.\nThe government's response to the financial system inquiry includes a pledge to answer calls for an overarching objective for super to be written into legislation.\nThe consensus view is that the dominant purpose should be to provide income in retirement but the challenge is to come up with a precise phrase.\nAssociation of Superannuation Funds of Australia chief executive Pauline Vamos said the purpose of super should be to \"enable all Australians to be financially confident in retirement\".\n\"Its measure of success is that the majority of retirees are not reliant on any pension, and that their super balance provides them with enough to have a comfortable standard of living,\" she said.\n\"Accumulation of excessive wealth in the concessionally taxed superannuation environment is not the purpose of the superannuation system.\"\nOf course, one person's \"comfortable\" standard of living is another's opulency and still another's pauperism.\nASFA's benchmarks suggest a couple who own a home require an annual income fo $34,051 a year for a \"modest\" retirement and $58,784 to be \"comfortable\".\n Lack of clarity The final report of the inquiry headed by former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray said the lack of clarity around the objective of super was contributing to \"ad hoc and short-term\" policy-making in the retirement income arena.\n\"The inquiry believes the purpose of the superannuation system is to provide an individual with an income in retirement,\" it said.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison said that was a good starting point.\n\"[The Murray report makes it clear that] superannuation is there to ensure that when Australians reach retirement age they will not be reliant on welfare payments, in the form of the pension,\" he said.\n\"T​hat​ provides an excellent starting point as to how we might then go and prepare wording that might form part of legislation.\"\nShadow treasurer Chris Bowen has already put forward a proposed phrase.\n\"Our superannuation system should ensure that as many Australians as possible have access to the resources for a dignified retirement without recourse to the full age pension.\"\nWeigh on national finances At $45.7 billion a year, the age pension makes up about 31 per cent of government spending on welfare. But the generous tax concessions attached to super contributions also weigh on national finances.\n\"We know that superannuation earnings concessions are growing at more than four times the rate of the aged pension,\" Mr Bowen said in August.\n\"The rate of growth in these tax concessions are set to dwarf the increase in the age pension over the next four years.\"\nMoney going into super is taxed at 15 per cent, as are earnings in the accumulation phase. Once the age of retirement is reached, the money is tax free. This is among the factors that give rise to concerns about the use of super for estate planning.\nActuaries Institute chief executive David Bell said the super objective should include an indication of how much Australia wants to spend on tax concessions and the pension.\nIt should also be specific what proportion of retirees above a certain age or ages should be on a full or part-pension, he said.\n\"The mission for superannuation should be defined as the delivery of reasonable retirement expectations in a reliable fashion,\" he said.\n\"What is considered to be a reasonable level of retirement income will vary for different groups of people, and its cost needs to be affordable and considered to be equitable.\"", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/10oct/whatis_super_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:55:20.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
