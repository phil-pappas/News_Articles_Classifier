As it is the dividend yield, now close to 3%, is helping support the stock near current levels, he said. \n\nWal-Mart  WMT data by YCharts \n\nCramer said \"there's no question\" Amazon ( AMZN - Get Report ) is putting competitive pressure on Wal-Mart , especially now that it is offering prompt delivery, at times even same-day delivery. \nMust Read: Elon Musk's Tesla Gets Dinged Again on Model X Concerns \nConsumers don't want to order online and pick things up in the store, which is part of Wal-Mart's online strategy, Cramer said.
