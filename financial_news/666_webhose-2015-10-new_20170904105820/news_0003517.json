The sources declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the matter.\nChinese President Xi Jinping is due to visit London next week, where UK officials hope to attract Chinese investment and win concessions for British firms - including banks - in mainland markets.\nHowever, it is unclear how much real impact the extended hours would have on investor sentiment in the near term.\nOffshore markets in Hong Kong - the largest centre of CNH trade - have struggled in the aftermath of a surprise devaluation of the yuan in August. That left investors worried that economic growth was slowing down faster than previously thought and that other devaluations may follow.\nAt the same time, most foreign investors are unable to access the onshore forex market, limiting hedging and arbitrage opportunities.\n\"Most foreign market players in New York and London still don't have direct access to the market,\" said Chew of HSBC.\n\"It is more a forward-looking measure that facilitates future trading when China further opens up capital account.\" (Reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Additional reporting by Lu Jianxin and by Michelle Chen in HONG KONG; Writing by Pete Sweeney; Editing by Miral Fahmy and Neil Fullick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:19:08.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
