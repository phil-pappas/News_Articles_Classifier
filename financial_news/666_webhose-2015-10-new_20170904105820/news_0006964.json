Plus, heavy snow in July caused a power outage at Cadia. \nGold production at Telfer in Western Australia was lower in the quarter due to a planned mill shutdown, while gold production at Lihir in PNG dipped compared to the June quarter following high maintenance activity. \nThe company received $US1,128 an ounce on average, down from $US1,193 in the June quarter, though a lower Australian dollar helped to improve prices in local currency terms. \nThe company has maintained its full year gold production guidance range, which indicates a rise of up to seven per cent. \nShares in Newcrest dropped 75 cents, or 5.05 per cent, to $14.11. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Newcrest shares down after output fall AAP \nNewcrest Mining shares have fallen five per cent as the gold miner's quarterly production fell, in part due to â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:43:46.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
