For GM, it's a chance to prove that a diesel engine can save fuel -- legally.\nThe new Canyon, and its twin, the Chevrolet Colorado, have been selling briskly as part of GM's strategy to create additional product segments in the truck category, where the automaker earns the bulk of its profit.\n\nSince late August, GM shares have been trending upward, rising in value about 12%. The current price of just more than $33 is roughly equal to the initial public offering price from late 2010.\nTightening fuel-efficiency regulations compels GM and other automakers to develop high-mileage fuel choices as alternatives to gasoline such as electric, gas-electric hybrids and diesel. Naturally, the alternatives must comply with emissions and all other regulations.\nThe Canyon's turbodiesel -- which averaged just less than 33 miles per gallon of diesel fuel during a trip along the Hudson River from Manhattan to Duchess County -- is just such an alternative. The diesel Canyon, which also is available with either a 2.5-liter four-cylinder or 3.6-liter six cylinder gasoline engine, was responsive and smooth, if somewhat noisy.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency hasn't yet issued official mileage ratings for the new engine. But the gasoline equivalents average roughly 25 miles per gallon of fuel, depending on city or highway, two or four-wheel-drive and size of engine.\nI asked Jeff Luke, executive chief engineer for GM trucks, if the latest uproar surrounding VW on the subject of diesels had made him wary or nervous about the possibility of getting tripped up on regulations, even inadvertently.\n\"Not at all,\" Luke said. \"We check and double check.\"\nGM's 2.8-liter diesel is equipped with a special reservoir for urea (a substance similar to ammonia) that removes nitrogen oxide pollutants that are prevalent in diesel emissions. VW's diesels purported to meet emission standards without a urea reservoir, which adds cost and must be refilled every 7,500 miles or so.\nIn case an owner is delinquent about refilling Canyon's urea reservoir, a dashboard display will flash a warning. Then the vehicle's speed will be progressively limited until it's not driveable. Clearly, GM is taking pains not to avoid regulatory censure of the type that's engulfing VW.\nGM's new diesel engine, imported from a plant in Thailand, was introduced during a promotional campaign to bring more attention to the GMC division -- one of the four in the U.S., along with Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac, that survived the automaker's bankruptcy and reorganization. GMC brand promises a premium and design-oriented flavor to several truck and crossover models at a slightly higher price point than Chevrolet.\n \n \n \n \n \nDoron Levin is the host of \"In the Driver Seat\" on SiriusXM, Insight 121, which is broadcast on Saturday at noon, repeating at 9 a.m. on Sunday.\n\nThe writer has no financial interest in the aforementioned companies. \nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:19:39.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
