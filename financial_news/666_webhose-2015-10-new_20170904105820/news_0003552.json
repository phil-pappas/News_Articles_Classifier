The BoE on Thursday voted 8-1 to maintain rates at 0.50% and its asset purchase programme at £375bn, as expected by analysts, citing weak inflation, low wages, potential risks from a slowdown in emerging markets. \nThe meeting minutes revealed policymaker Ian McCafferty again voted for an interest rate increase of 25 basis points. \nAnalysts were mixed in their predictions for an interest rate rise with some saying February 2016 while others suggesting the BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) might hold off until late 2016 or early 2017. \nThe European Central Bank also published the account of its 2-3 September meeting, which revealed the Governing Council reiterated that it would consider extending the asset purchase programme past September 2016 if needed. The central bank said it would monitor risks closely including weak commodity prices, the euro exchange rate appreciation, lower-than-expected economic growth, subdued inflation and a slowdown in emerging economies. \nThe minutes from the Fed's 16-17 September meeting showed that the central bank was close to raising interest rates but the risks of China's economic slowdown hurting US growth stopped them. Policymakers said that a rate hike \"might be near\" but they would need to monitor developments. \n\"[It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's] divided between members who see the health of the domestic economy and continued improvements in labor markets as decisive and warranting a near-term rate hike and those who remain concerned about the prospects for inflation returning to target and the implications of not reaching that target for the ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations, amid risks that economic activity could be derailed by developments abroad,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said. \nBarclays believes the next rate hike will be in March next year following weak jobs data. \nTurning to Friday's agenda, Fed officials Dennis Lockhart and Charles Evans are due to speak and any clues on the timing of an interest rate increase will be closely monitored. \nUS wholesale inventory and sales data is also set for release at 1500 BST. Wholesale trade sales are forecast to drop 0.4% in August compared to a month ago, while inventories are expected to be flat. \nUK trade data at 0930 BST is expected to show the deficit narrowed in August. Analysts predict goods and services deficit of £2.15bn in August, down from £3.37bn the previous month when the UK imported more than it exported. \nCompany-wise, Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) climbed as the UK government cut its stake by a further 1% to just under 11% after it emerged that the finance ministry will sell at least £2bn worth of shares to private retail investors in spring next year. \nVedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) jumped after posting a rise in first half production across most of its commodities, as it said net debt at the end of the quarter is expected to be below $8bn and expressed confidence that it will meet its covenants as at the end of September. \nOther mining stocks including Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) were higher as gold, silver and copper prices rose. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,043.68 +0.44% FTSE 100 6,404.36 +0.46% FTSE 250 17,131.06 +0.75% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 128.45p +6.46% Anglo American (AAL) 708.60p +4.59% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,594.00p +4.18% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,179.50p +3.01% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 725.00p +2.91% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 592.50p +2.51% Mondi (MNDI) 1,492.00p +2.47% Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (RIO) 2,576.00p +2.22% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,018.00p +1.70% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 348.00p +1.46% FTSE 100 - Fallers Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 720.50p -2.50% easyJet (EZJ) 1,682.00p -1.29% National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) (NG.) 924.60p -1.08% Carnival (CCL) 3,312.00p -0.69% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,435.00p -0.65% AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,136.00p -0.59% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 556.00p -0.54% HSBC Holdings (HKSE: 0005.HK - news ) (HSBA) 527.90p -0.30% Whitbread (WTB) 4,754.00p -0.29% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,238.00p -0.24% FTSE 250 - Risers Petrofac Ltd.
