Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by Robert Harley Leading diversified real estate investment trust Stockland is being offered stakes in apartment projects as traditional finance evaporates for \"mid-tier developers\".\nStockland chief executive Mark Steinert told his first-quarter update that the banks had \"really tightened\" their lending criteria, becoming very selective about the borrower, the level of equity and the capacity of the builder.\n\"It is an interesting opportunity for us,\" he said. \"One thing we can bring to the table is equity. If we can get high enough internal rates of return we will participate.\"\nIn September, The Australian Financial Review reported that Stockland was making a small but significant investment in two Metro Property Development projects in Brisbane .\nOverall, Stockland finished the quarter with 1557 deposits, which is down on the same quarter last year due to the weakness in Perth and delays in Sydney, but is enough to keep the group on track for 6000 sales of residential lots this year.\nMr Steinert said the strong housing markets in Sydney and inner Melbourne would moderate with a \"more normalised level of growth\".\n\"â€‹Sydney house prices will be flat to up 3 per cent,\" he said. \"There will not be across-the-board declines but there will be some pockets where you will see a pullback in inner-city markets that have gone hard and have lots of supply.\"\nMr Steinert said Brisbane was showing improvement, Melbourne growth corridors remained sound, and Perth continued to slow.\n Perth sales have held up better than expected based on previous downturns. But Mr Steinert surprised analysts by saying the proportion of deposits being cancelled had risen above the normal 15 per cent to near 20 per cent, partly due to title delays but also due to finance knock-backs as the circumstances of buyers changed.\nMr Steinert said Stockland was \"well placed for these conditions\" with active projects in \"high-demand, low-supply\" corridors, with a \"clear affordability advantage\" and a \"reputation for creating desirable, liveable\" communities.\n\"Our new projects continue to strengthen our returns with operating profit margins over 14 per cent,\" he said.\nMr Steinert noted the warnings about higher supply and lower population growth. \"The oversupply is largely in apartments, not in detached houses.\n\"And yes, population growth has reduced, down to 1.4 per cent, and that lower growth is factored into our demand. Even if growth falls to 1.2 per cent, it still gives Australia the highest growth in the developed world.\n\"It is not the environment where you see wholesale reductions in house prices.\"\nMr Steinert said Stockland had kept construction costs relatively flat in the eastern states, up 1 per cent in NSW, and in Western Australia costs were falling for 2016 and 2017 projects.\nCLSA analyst Sholto Maconochie said the result was solid. \"Stockland reaffirmed full year 2016 guidance, which we believe should be at the top end.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-10-26T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:07:06.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
