Oriental Bank of Commerce had 382 such accounts with non-performing assets of Rs 3,877.44 crore at the end of last financial year.\n\nAs far as UCO Bank is concerned, it had 594 such accounts with outstanding amount of Rs 3,677.08 crore.\n\nIn 75 per cent of such cases, a finance ministry official said, banks have initiated action under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (Sarfaesi) Act.\n\nWilful defaulters constitute about 22 per cent of the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of state-owned banks.\n\nGross NPAs of the public sector banks rose to Rs 2.67 lakh crore at the end of March 2015 as against Rs 2.40 lakh crore a year ago.\n\nIn order to check incidences of wilful default, RBI has tightened the norms and made it clear that promoter of the defaulting company cannot escape from his responsibility even if he is not a whole time director.\n\nAs per earlier guidelines, a bank couldn't label a non-whole-time director of a company as a wilful defaulter unless there was conclusive evidence that the individual was aware of the wilful default by the company and had not objected to it.\n\nA wilful default occurs when a defaulting borrower doesn't honour an obligation, despite having the capacity to pay, or siphoning off funds and disposing of assets without the knowledge of the bank, according to RBI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:28.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
