A lioness in more ways than one. Kristian Sibast by Michael Schulman \"I am so terribly sorry,\" said the woman in a black blazer and leopard-print heels, hovering over Grace Jones. \"There's no way that I can have you keep doing this interview here.\"\nJones looked up incredulously and said, \"What?\" She was in the lounge room of the spa at the Mandarin Oriental, New York, wearing a towel wrapped around her head and a terry robe, a half-drunk mimosa in one hand.\nSmiling a frozen smile, the hotel employee continued. \"This area is for spa guests who are having ... \"\n\"I am a spa guest!\"\nA Bond girl and Warhol muse, Grace Jones is an ageless icon to this day. SMH \"Of course, Ms Jones, I know. But people who are having treatments ... \"\n\"So can we put a robe on him and get him a treatment?\" Jones said, referring to her interviewer, who she had ushered into the spa 15 minutes earlier, having checked out of her room upstairs.\nThe answer was no: hotel policy. Nevertheless, the woman was quickly learning what decades of agents, photographers, album producers, tour managers and lovers already knew: Nobody tells Grace Jones what to do.\n\"You're so corporate,\" she said, looking the woman up and down. \"I would hate having your job. You want to work for me?\"\nGrace Jones dominated the 1980s club scene with songs that became legends, such as Pull up the Bumper and Walking in the Rain. Edwina Pickles Awakened a lioness The hotel staff, realising they had awakened a lioness, swiftly rustled up an empty room on the 39th floor, where Jones ordered a bottle of champagne and fresh orange juice.\nUndisturbed at last, and still in her bathrobe, she settled on to a twin bed to discuss her singular career as a style icon, disco queen, avant-garde rocker, Bond girl, provocateur and sphinx, all chronicled in her new autobiography, published on September 29.\nThe title is I'll Never Write My Memoirs , a lyric from her 1981 song Art Groupie . Why the about-face?\nJones became an ultimate diva when she slapped talk show host Russell Harty on air for turning his back on her to question the other guest. smh \"I'm allowed to change my mind, you know,\" she said with a grin.\nFor fans who have relished her contradictory pronouncements, reinventions (though she hates the word) and blasphemies over the years, the book contains a bounty of hedonistic flashbacks from a woman whose greatest achievement has been remaining her defiantly idiosyncratic self.\nFrom her breakout as a model in Paris in the early 1970s, where her roommates were Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange, her predatory, androgynous style subverted notions of race and gender. Embraced as a modern Josephine Baker, she relocated to New York and became a ribald disco sensation at Studio 54 and a habitue of Andy Warhol's Factory.\nWhen disco turned tacky, she abandoned it for reggae-inflected new wave rock, sung in her signature deadpan purr. Between albums, she played off her savage persona in movies like Vamp , Conan the Destroyer and the Bond film A View to a Kill .\nUnmistakable look But it was her unmistakable look that cemented her place in pop culture: flattop hair and Egyptian-cyborg outfits, when she wasn't nude, often refracted through the lens of French photographer Jean-Paul Goude, with whom she shared a collaboration and volatile romance.\nThe memoir does not skimp on diva antics, like the time she smacked the British talk-show host Russell Harty live on television because he was paying more attention to another guest, or the time she was barred from a Grammy after-party and left the building screaming at the top of her lungs.\nNor does she hold back on her tempestuous love affairs. Her relationship with Dolph Lundgren, the Swedish security guard she helped transform into a big-screen hunk, ended after she showed up at his hotel room in Los Angeles waving a gun. Her marriage to a Turkish man in the 1990s broke up, she writes, after he held two butcher knives to her throat during a fight. They never divorced because she lost track of his whereabouts.\nAs if to burnish her over-the-top reputation, the book even contains a copy of her tour rider, which requires that her green room be furnished with two dozen oysters on ice, unopened because \"Grace does her own shucking\".\nBut the memoir's deepest revelations have to do with her repressive childhood in Jamaica, where she was born in May 1951 â€“ or so she says; some reports have her born earlier. As part of a prominent family of clergy in the Pentecostal church, she and her five siblings were raised under strict religious supervision.\nHer parents moved to upstate New York when she was small and left the children under the authority of their step-grandfather, Peart, known as Mas P, whom Jones describes as a \"ferocious disciplinarian\". For minor infractions, like doing a handstand in a dress, she would be whipped with a leather belt.\nShe coped through fantasy, the only thing she could control. \"Grace lived in her own world, created her own space, created her own imaginative games,\" her brother Noel Jones, a church pastor in California, said.\nImperious stare The young Grace imagined Mas P's imperious stare as an \"all-seeing eye\", following her even to the gully where she played after school. It wasn't until years later, while taking lessons with the acting teacher Warren Robertson, that she realised she had unconsciously adopted Mas P's glare in photo shoots and performances, turning the \"all-seeing eye\" back out on to the world.\nShe followed her parents to Syracuse as an adolescent and began the process of liberating herself. She lived as a nudist for a month, took mind-opening acid trips and worked as a go-go dancer with a whip, simultaneously aping her abuser and defying him.\n\"I'm always rebelling,\" she said at the hotel. \"I don't think I'll ever stop.\"\nJones likes to say that she exists in several time zones at once, but most of the time you can find her in London or Jamaica. She had come to New York to headline the Afropunk Fest in Brooklyn, where she performed at Commodore Barry Park two nights in a row.\nAt both concerts, a billowing curtain fell away to reveal Jones covered head to toe in tribal body paint (a look Keith Haring created for her in the 1980s), wearing a feathered headdress adorned with a gold skull and a corset that ended just below her exposed breasts.\nDonning a series of outrageous costumes, she sang raspy, raunchy versions of her hits, including the double-entendre-laden Pull Up to the Bumper , which was accompanied by a blast of bubbles. She performed her entire final song, Slave to the Rhythm , while hula hooping topless, betraying nothing of her 60-something years. \"I never remember how old I am,\" she said. \"I'm 5000 years old.\"\nIf her mostly young spectators saw traces of pop music's current crop of exhibitionists, they were not alone. Her name and her envelope-pushing influence are now commonplace in descriptions of such mass-marketed misfits as Miley Cyrus, Amber Rose and Nicki Minaj.\nNot impressed But Jones is not impressed.\n\"They make it so obvious,\" she said at the Mandarin. \"But they don't quite have the conviction. It's always someone styling them, for example. It's not coming from them.\n\"People say, 'Well, you should be flattered\" And I'm like, 'No, I'm not'. Because my whole view is being unique and finding yourself, from your own suffering or your own upbringing or your own happiness. For me, it's all piggybacking.\"\nWhat about Lady Gaga?\n\"She is obsessed!\" Jones said, laughing dismissively. \"She's been trying to get me to work with her forever. She's even gone to my brother in LA to get him to try to talk me into it.\"\n(The brother, Noel, said later he was never approached by Lady Gaga, but that he was friends with someone in her \"inner circle\" and they discussed the idea of a collaboration.)\nJones said: \"I basically said, 'Bring me something. Don't just take something from me. If you want me to work with you, then come with an idea. Come with music. Dazzle me.' People said, 'Do you know how much money you can make working with her, collaborating with her?' It's never been about the money. And the fame, believe me, it's a double-edged sword.\"\nCriticises young pop stars In her memoir, she similarly criticises the generation of young pop stars who \"play the pioneer without taking the actual risk\".\nWith pride bordering on paranoia, she writes: \"I have been so copied by those people who have made fortunes that people assume I am that rich. But I did things for the excitement, the dare, the fact that it was new, not for the money. And too many times I was the first, not the beneficiary.\"\nShe names names, writing: \"There's a lot of that around at the moment. Be like Sasha Fierce. Be like Miley Cyrus. Be like Rihanna. Be like Lady Gaga. Be like Rita Ora and Sia. Be like Madonna. I cannot be like them, except to the extent that they are already being like me.\"\nWorking with such megastars, she insists, would benefit them more than her. Not that she has gone out of her way to avoid the limelight. She tours frequently, though her appearances in New York are rare. During her shows at Afropunk, images of her hula hooping flooded Instagram, signalling a wave of new-found appreciation from fans who were born long after disco died.\nStill, she has been slow to release new material. Disillusioned by the music industry, she took a long break between albums, starting in 1989. She was largely absent from the public eye in the 1990s, making money by appearing at corporate parties, where she would, say, pop out of a cake for a high fee.\nIn 2008, she released her first new record in 19 years, Hurricane , in the first sign of a resurgence. In 2012, she performed her hula-hooping number â€“ more fully clothed â€“ at the Queen's diamond jubilee. She is working on a new Africa-themed album called She and starring in a coming documentary for BBC Films.\nA new beau Meanwhile, she is planning to build a house on her grandfather's land in Jamaica, and has a new beau there, a Rastafarian she met through a friend. She was travelling in New York with her son with Goude, , Paulo, a tall, dreadlocked musician who tours as her percussionist, and her granddaughter Athena, a pale six-year-old with fiery red hair.\n\"Any time I see a redhead, I go, 'Was your granny black?'\" she said, chuckling.\nIf she does not share Madonna's penchant for inserting herself into trends, more often contemporary pop culture finds her. Last autumn, Goude published an internet-rocking photo shoot of Kim Kardashian in Paper magazine, including an anatomically impossible image of Kardashian balancing a champagne glass on her derriere.\nThe photo was Goude's homage to himself: A similar pose appears in his 1981 book Jungle Fever , which also includes his most famous â€“ and infamous â€“ portraits of Jones. The cover image depicted Jones in a cage, naked and baring her teeth like a tigress.\nWhen Jones saw the Kardashian photos, she had some words for her former collaborator. \"I said, 'Darling, what the hell were you thinking?'\" she recalled. \"I just asked him, 'Why did you do that?'\"\nThe reason, she suggested, was Goude's desire to make a splash in the United States after the controversy he and Jones caused in the 1980s.\n\"When we got attacked for me in the cage on the cover of his book and certain things, America basically didn't understand him as an artist,\" she said. \"They thought of it as negative. I was attacked by the feminist groups. All this interference into art, you know?\"\nRacial undertones In the online frenzy that the Kardashian photos ignited, some observers questioned the racial undertones of the originals. What did it mean to have a white man photographing black women crawling in a cage, or enhancing their buttocks to cartoonish proportions? Was it objectifying? Exoticising? Who was really in control?\nJones insisted that the photos were simply the product of her and Goude's intensely personal connection. \"We really were art soul mates,\" she said. \"We totally understood each other and were not afraid just to go for it. There was no fear. And if he was afraid, I made sure I wasn't afraid.\"\nIn any case, it is hard to imagine that Jones ever had anything less than total control over her image, which projects an almost superhuman self-possession. Though she was an object of fascination for designers (Issey Miyake), photographers (Helmut Newton) and artists (Haring), she does not consider herself a mere muse.\n\"As much as I was a muse, they were also muses for me,\" she said.\nShe poured a second round of mimosas. Her irritation from the spa incident had melted into free-roaming, if opinionated, chattiness, covering everything from Kanye West, who she says copied a video idea from her â€“ \"When I see him, honestly, I'm going to get in his face\" â€“ to her concept for a line of discontinued merchandise, though the details are sketchy.\n\"I hate that, when they discontinue something that's really good,\" she said, perhaps stumbling on to a metaphor for her own sporadic place in pop culture. \"I don't know, man, it's so weird. If something is really good, why do you want to discontinue it?\"\nSomeone knocked on the door. She had been talking for nearly two hours, and Paulo and Athena were waiting by the hotel pool.\nJones eyed the half-full bottle of Laurent-Perrier. \"Do you think we can take the champagne to the pool, or are they going to have some corporate law about it?\" She grabbed it anyway and headed for the door.\n\"Well, let's see. Let them try to stop me.\"\nNew York Times\nI'll Never Write my Memoirs , by Grace Jones and Paul Morley, published by Simon and Schuster, was released on September 29.\nâ€‹", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0XLzIswI2s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpWo15Jc2JQ", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc1IphRx1pk", "http://books.simonandschuster.com/Ill-Never-Write-My-Memoirs/Grace-Jones/9781476765075", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyOS08gaw_c"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:06:12.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
