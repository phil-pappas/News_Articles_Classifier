For the fiscal year the operation met its key targets of tonnes milled, recoveries and head grades, whilst falling short of the total copper and gold metal production guidance. \nIt has been a year of significant progress for Rambler, most notably with the results of the pre-feasibility engineering study and economic assessment ('PFS') aimed to integrate the Lower Footwall Zone ('LFZ') mineral resource into the life of mine plan for the Ming Mine. The results of this defined a staged, low capital strategy for the optimisation of the existing infrastructure allowing the operation to run at full capacity of 1,250 metric tonnes per day by 2018. Importantly it has also extended the life of Ming Mine from 6 to 21 years. As a Canadian producer, we continue to advance and develop other opportunities within the region and benefit from not only working in one of the safest jurisdictions in the world, but also from selling our commodities in US dollars whilst most of our costs remain in Canadian Dollars.
