As outlined in Budget 2016, a minimum improvement of 0.6% of GDP in the structural deficit is required to comply with the rules of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Department of Finance is projecting an improvement in Ireland’s structural balance of 0.8% next year. \n\nIn July, the European Council in its Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs), stated that Ireland should “achieve a fiscal adjustment of 0.6% of GDP towards the medium-term objective in 2016”. Budget 2016 was formulated on this basis. \n\nThe Department of Finance looks forward to the IFAC Fiscal Assessment Report on the Budget later this year. The report is an important element of Ireland’s new budgetary process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:12:34.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
