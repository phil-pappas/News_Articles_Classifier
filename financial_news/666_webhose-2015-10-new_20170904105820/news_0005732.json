I am talking about  Walmart   ( WMT - Get Report ) and its hideous news about how poorly it is really doing.\nMust Read: 10 Stocks Billionaire David Einhorn Is Buying \nFirst, I have disliked Walmart, the store chain, for ages. Why? Because it is a total drag to shop at, a depressing experience. When I go, I feel I am stepping back in time to when going to the store was a huge waste of your time and a totally unpleasant experience. Go to one, see what I mean. Now go to any of the quality retailers, a  Home Depot   ( HD ) , a  Target  ( TGT - Get Report ) , a  Costco   ( COST ) , it's night and day! The oldest rule in investing is don't own something you don't like. Who in heck can like Wal-Mart other than those who virtually have no choice, and as the economy improves more and more people have a choice.\nSecond, I have heard over and over that Walmart, with a stock that's been a hideous performer, down another 8% today and 28% for the year, was always a quarter or two from turning around. Nope, nothing. Just floundering. In November 2013, Walmart picked the very young Doug McMillon as CEO -- he turns 50 on Saturday, happy birthday, Doug -- and I thought he would be a breath of fresh air. He took over Feb. 1, 2014, when the stock was at $77. He made a lot of the right noises and the stock subsequently soared to $90 on Jan. 8 of this year. But then on Feb. 19, McMillon revealed that all was not well at the house of Walmart and that starting in April new employees would be getting $9 an hour and by next February all employees would be getting $10.\nWhen I heard the report, I was astonished that the wages were so pitiful. That's because the real success stories of retail, the Costcos and the  Starbucks   ( SBUX )  and  Chipotles  ( CMG ) , find employees and pay them more than anyone in retail. They offer bountiful benefits. Chipotle's got 19-year-old kids running stores and getting stock options and perks and generating remarkable returns for the company. Starbucks is sending people to college, for heaven's sake. (Target, Costco and Starbucks are part of TheStreet's  Action Alerts PLUS  portfolio.)\nCostco? I once asked CEO Jim Sinegal the secret of that incredibly successful chain's profitability, and he told me it was pretty darned simple: His company pays its workers more than anyone else and offers better benefits than any retailer. Workers start at about 15% more than Walmart, but that doesn't tell the story at all. Long-term employees can make double or even triple what Wal-Mart workers earn and Costco offers unbelievable benefits. Go to its website and you will see the full array of health care offered and I can tell you it is better than what you get unless you are in the C suite and it costs you far less per employee.\nWhen I asked Sinegal how he could compete with stores like Walmart, he said it was simple: He has very little turnover because he treats employees so well. That enables him to have incredibly low training costs while other retailers that pay much less devote as much as 30% of their expenses to training people. Loyal people equal loyal customers, he said. But turnover and training? They drive people away even if you have lower prices. That's the Walmart way.\nAnd how has this largesse done for the shareholders of Costco, Starbucks and Chipotle vs. Walmart for the last decade?\nWalmart's stock has moved from $46 to $61. Costco's stock has journeyed from $43 to $150. Starbucks stock has rocketed from $13 to $59. And Chipotle? It wasn't public for all 10 years, but the stock's traveled from $29 to $716 since 2006.\nBut that's not the end of Walmart's bush status. This morning McMillon came on  Squawk Box  and he was pretty darned sanguine about his company. He didn't talk about the possibility that profits could fall 6% to 12% over the next two years. He didn't discuss that sales were looking pretty darned flat or that he has underinvested in tech to the point where billions and billions will have to be spent to keep up with the brick-and-mortar industry as well as  Amazon   ( AMZN ) . He laughed when Joe Kernen said he should be called McMillions, not McMillon. Maybe it should be McThousands now. (Amazon is part of TheStreet's  Growth Seeker  portfolio.)\nHe is either the greatest poker player in the world or a man who suffers from a serious case of lack of judgment.\nI come from a retail background. My parents were in retail. My mom worked at Lit's, my pop Gimbels. They both went under.\nMy father then built a business of selling boxes and bags to retailers in the Philadelphia area. He kept all his receipts for years and years. When I recently went over them, I was shocked at how many of them from 10 and 20 years ago had disappeared and those from the last decade had either ceased to do business or ceased to exist.\nRetail is not a given. Today, when it dropped the bomb, Walmart announced a $20 billion buyback. How stupid is that? The one thing Walmart has going for it --what my father's customers didn't have -- is its balance sheet. Why bother to buy a share back until you have figured it out, come up with a winning strategy, address the core issues? What's the point?\nTo me, this is a moment where we must all understand that when retail goes into a tailspin, it is mighty hard to pull out of, whether it be  Sears   ( SHLD )  or  Gap   ( GPS )  or Montgomery Ward or Kmart or Woolworth or Grants, for that matter.\nWalmart's got a great history going for it. The store does have everyday low prices and lots of buying power. It does have millions of customers. But customers are being stolen from each aisle: Hardware? Home Depot. Food? Costco and  Kroger   ( KR ) . Hard goods?  Best Buy   ( BBY )  and Amazon and Costco. Clothes? Target. I could go on and on: There's someone carving up Walmart's customers every single day.\nI heard value managers chattering all day that you are getting your chance to buy a high-quality retailer on the cheap, ahead of a huge buyback that yields 3.2%. I say, \"Have you been to one?\" Have you gone to one and been steered by the greeter toward washing machines when you wanted cargo pants, as I have? Have you seen their selections? Have you strolled the aisles? It's the world's largest advertisement for Amazon.\nSo, be my guest. I would rather wait to see if Walmart can turn this battleship around. You will need at least two if not three quarters to see.\nOnly then can we make an informed decision. You can't possibly do it now.\nAt the time of publication, Action Alerts PLUS, which Cramer co-manages as a charitable trust, was long TGT, COST and SBUX.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:36:47.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
