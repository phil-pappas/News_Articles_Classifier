That has become the Zuma administration’s default position in delaying having to sort out contentious issues, and it was Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande’s first port of call this week when he was pressed to explain how universities would fund the shortfall if they were forced to cap fee increases for next year at 6%.\nBut task teams can only be helpful in finding medium-to long-term answers to intractable problems such as SA’s tertiary funding crisis, and even then they cannot perform miracles. Solutions to immediate problems, such as the fact that most of SA’s universities have budgeted for student fee increases of 10% or more, but have now been told they will be lucky to get 6%, require leadership.\nIf Mr Nzimande had proposed a reduction in the proposed fee increase and offered to fund the difference from his departmental budget, his intervention may have been workable. Yet he did no such thing, offering only vague \"assistance\". Nor could he.\nAs Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene made clear in comments on the medium-term budget policy statement he delivered in Parliament on Wednesday, there are already too many demands on the fiscus and no scope for ad hoc supplementary allocations based on the whim of a pressured politician scrambling for cover.\nMr Nzimande spoke of a \"reprieve\" for protesting students — one they immediately rejected — and of the need for the task team, which was in fact established in June, to look into the funding matter in the long term. But there was no hint at a reprieve for those at the sharp end of the stick, the university management who have less than three months to perform the financial miracle neither the minister nor his task team are either prepared to take on or are capable of producing.\nThe issue of sustainable long-term university funding has in any event already been \"looked into\". Although it was called a committee, the task team in question was established by Mr Nzimande with precisely the same terms of reference he now wants rehashed. Chaired by the man who was to go on to become deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, the committee reported back two years ago.\nIts key findings and recommendations were that SA’s universities were chronically underfunded in relation to the teaching and research demands that are placed on them, that state grants would have to almost double for their capital investment and operational costs to be covered adequately, and that the National Student Financial Aid Scheme was hopelessly inadequate and dysfunctional.\nBut it did not require a committee then, nor a task team now, to tell us that. The problems have been clear for years; what has been missing is the political will to take the hard decisions required to find solutions. Government university subsidies have grown 7.7% over the past three years, and Mr Nene said on Wednesday that this figure is budgeted to drop to an average of 5.7% over the next few years. That compares with an education inflation rate of more than 10% in SA and globally.\nWhile funding of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme has trebled over the past few years, it still falls well short of demand, a situation that has been exacerbated by Mr Nzimande’s insistence that universities increase enrolments sharply every year, and the establishment of two new universities. And until recently, the scheme was so poorly administered that it struggled to recoup funds from graduates, reducing the loan pool for current students.\nSomething had to give, and now that it has, no task team or appeal to the private sector to ride to the rescue is going to fix things. Mr Nzimande is about to learn that governance is about more than just power.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:22:53.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
