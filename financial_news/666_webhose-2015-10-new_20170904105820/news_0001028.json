The central bank indicated further increases will follow.\nPolicy makers, led by bank President Rodrigo Vergara, raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3.25 percent Thursday, as forecast by 19 of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The others expected the bank to keep rates on hold. It was the first increase in more than four years.\nVergara told Bloomberg this month that Chile’s “ultra expansive” monetary policy was coming to an end. A drop in commodity prices and the prospect of higher borrowing costs in the U.S. have led to a decline in emerging market currencies and pushed the Chilean peso to its weakest level in more than a decade last month. The consequent jump in import costs has kept inflation above or at the upper limit of the target range for the past 18 months, the longest period since 2008.\n“The future trajectory of rates envisages additional adjustments to ensure convergence to the inflation target,” the central bank said in a statement accompanying the decision. The pace of increases “will depend on the new information.”\nConsumer prices rose 4.6 percent from the year earlier in September, compared with the 4.9 percent median estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg and the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range.\nVergara said in an interview on Oct. 2 that the bank is standing by its estimate of three quarter-point increases over the next year. Still, monetary policy will remain expansive, he said, with the benchmark rate remaining below the neutral level of 4.5 percent to 5 percent.\nThe central bank wants to keep monetary stimulus as economic growth remains subdued. On Oct. 5, Finance Minister Rodrigo Valdes cut 2015’s growth forecast to 2.25 percent, from the previous estimate of 2.5 percent in June and from the 3.6 percent estimated in this year’s budget.\nOn the same day, the central bank said that the Imacec index, a proxy for gross domestic product, rose 1.1 percent in August from a year earlier, compared with the 2 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nEconomists now expect Chile’s economy to expand 2 percent this year, little changed on last year, according to a central bank survey released Tuesday. That is down from the 2.6 percent forecast in June and 2.8 percent in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:17:59.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
