He said an Assistant Commissioner of Police was inquiring into the incident and on receiving his report, strict action would be taken against the “concerned persons.”\n“As alleged by the foreign national if there was any kind of abuse and harassment by the crowd as well as local police, definitely the Bangalore city police will take the matter very seriously,” he said.\nPatil said if police had forced the couple to give an apology, “it is a serious matter”.\nHe said according to preliminary inquiry, the foreign nationals were having lunch at a hotel and noticing the tatoo on his leg, some people around objected to it, which led to a commotion and police were informed about it.\n“What has happened in the police station will be enquired into…,” he said.\nThe incident occurred on Saturday when Matt Keith, a law student at Deakin University, and his girlfriend Emily were at a restaurant here and a group of people took objection to Keith having a tattoo of the goddess, Yellamma, on his shin. He also has large Ganesha tatoo on his back.\nThe couple said that as they were in the restaurant, some people there started photographing them. One of them approached them and objected to Keith having a tattoo of the goddess.\nThey said more people soon joined them. Some policemen came to the spot and took them to Ashok Nagar police station, where they were forced to write an apology letter.\n“….what we originally thought would be a quiet bite to eat turned into a vicious assault by members of the BJP right wing political party. These men are held with high esteem in Karnataka, with police bending backwards to please them. This meant that Matt and I were victims of being illegally detained,” the couple said.\n“Matt and I found ourselves sitting in Ashoknagar Police station accused of ‘intentionally spreading hatred’. We repeatedly asked to leave, but were detained, although we were told we had not violated any criminal law,” they added.\nA local BJP leader allegedly involved in the incident said the area is surrounded by slums and they were concerned about the couple’s safety as they were flaunting the tattoo So “we called the police”, he said.\n“We requested police to ask them to cover their body so it is good for them, as well as for us. It is also not their fault, but of those who are guiding them during their stay here,” Ramesh Yadav said.\nClaiming that no one forced the foreigners to write an apology letter, he said the person accompanying them insisted on it, requesting them not to file a complaint.\nHe also said no threat was held out to the couple and they had called the police during the incident, adding it was all recorded on CCTV cameras.\n“My forced letter of apology that I had to write before I could leave the police station at Ashok Nagar. I should not have to apologise for what is on my skin and be put in a traumatising situation where it is apparently acceptable to be harassed, threatened and mobbed,” Keith posted on his Facebook page.\nHe said, “Tolerance, understanding and equality is what we live by. I respect India and Hinduism completely. That’s why I spent 35 hours getting a massive Ganesha put on my back and four hours getting the Goddess of the lowest rung of Indian society (Yellamma) on the only bit of space I had left on my body.”\n“Because my spiritual journey is my decision, as are the markings on my body. I do not deserve to be victimised and have to physically defend myself and my girlfriend every day,” he said.\n 19, 2015 4:56 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:36:25.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
