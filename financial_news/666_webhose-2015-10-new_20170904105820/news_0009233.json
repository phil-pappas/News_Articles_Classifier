Recent sharp commodity price falls are expected to take a heavy toll on these economies.\nBut data used for the IIAG survey ends in 2014 and would not have fully captured the end of the commodities super-cycle, McGrath said.\n\"But we certainly are seeing the resource-rich countries deteriorate in sustainable economic opportunity,\" she said, adding that 11 of Africa's 16 commodity exporting countries had seen a worsening in that category.\nThe report did highlight some positive trends, noting improvements in infrastructure across the continent, thanks to better telephone and IT systems, as well as air transport.\nIvory Coast - Africa's largest cocoa producer - tops the list of the ten biggest improvers over the past four years following a decade of political turmoil and civil war.\nOthers to move up are Zimbabwe, Senegal, Kenya, Togo, Morocco, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Madagascar and Tunisia. Together, they represent almost a quarter of Africa's population.\nIvory Coast now ranks 35th on the infrastructure front, well above Africa's largest economy Nigeria which stands 39th on the list, below Burundi, Cameroon and Djibouti.\n(Reporting by Karin Strohecker; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:39:51.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
