Interest on bank loans in the country on the average are currently going for between 25 and 35 percent. \nHowever pressure has been mounting on the financial sector, especially commercial banks not to increase their interest rates weeks after the Bank of Ghana increased its monetary policy rate citing inflationary pressures and uncertainties within the foreign exchange market as the main reasons for the increment. \nManaging Director of HFC Bank Robert Le-Hunte was optimistic the lending rates will drop after a while. \n'There is a formula for which banks work out their minimum lending rate and that formula is handed over from the central bank so therefore when the BoG sends a signal to increase the rate it automatically raises.' \nHFC Bank this year donated over GHÂ¢340,000 to 14 institutions as part of the bank's corporate social responsibility contribution to society. \nSome of the institutions that benefited are Ghana Blind Union, Ridge Hospital, and the Accident Centre of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana Hearts Foundation, Catholic Action for Street Children and Help Age Ghana, Bonwire Anglican Primary school, among others. \n- Citifmonline Business & Finance Follow Us Life will teach you great lessons through human beings.lt is only God who will not betray you.
