PUBLISHED: 11:13, Fri, Oct 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:40, Fri, Oct 2, 2015 GETTY Samsung has denied TVs have been designed to cheat energy tests \nOther big television brands may have also used the ‘defeat devices’ to trick official tests prompting the European Commission to consider banning their use altogether. \nSamsung has been forced to deny it scammed authorities in Europe after data from researchers ComplianTV showed televisions burn through half the amount of energy when being officially tested than when operated by a consumer. \nThe technology giant said the 'motion lighting' setting that causes the discrepancy is a standard default mode aimed at creating energy efficiency at home and in tests, but can be switched off. \nA separate report by the Swedish Energy Agency found the models of a different - but unnamed TV manufacturer - managed to recognise when being tested to adjust screen brightness Related articles Volkswagen scandal: Nearly 1.2million cars in BRITAIN affected by... \nThe allegations mirror that of the Volkswagen scandal which saw 11million cars worldwide fitted with emissions cheat devices which sensed when tests were being carried out and gave lower readings. \nIn a statement Samsung said: \"We firmly reject the accusation that one of our TV settings has been designed to deliver a misleading power performance in regulatory lab tests. \n\"Motion lighting is not a setting that only activates during compliance testing. On the contrary, it is a default setting which works both in the lab and at home. \n\"It is a standard out-of-the-box feature which is automatically switched on when the customer takes delivery of their TV, and remains on whenever the customer chooses to watch their TV in Standard viewing mode.\" GETTY Samsung is one of the biggest TV manufacturers in the world \nThe firm added: \"The motion lighting setting is a part of a range of features we have developed to help reduce the environmental impact of our TV technology. We are immensely proud of these technologies and look forward to innovating further in this area.” \nEurope has said it will investigate all claims of malpractice, as the emissions scandal that has engulfed Volkswagen threatens to spill outside of the car industry. \nThe carmaker has now taken 4,000 cars in Britain off the market and said that around 1.2million cars in the UK are fitted with the rogue devices.
