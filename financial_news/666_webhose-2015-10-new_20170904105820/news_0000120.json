Osinbajo made the promise after inspecting Solar power stands mounted at a Trade Fair by the Department of International Development (DFID) as a follow up to the agreement signed between Nigeria and the UK for massive solar power in Nigeria. According to him, Nigeria will no longer watch as millions of its citizens, especially the rural poor, find it difficult to access electricity. \"This is the time to jump in and we are all set to do that. \"This is very exciting for us and of cause Grant (Mr Shapps - UK Minister of State for International Development) has been extremely supportive not only encouraging everyone and pushing and bolding everyone but I think that in providing all of the support and the various suppliers and all of the various people who have been working on solar power for so long. \"We are really excited to be here and I am sure that in the next one year when you hear about us it will be quite a story to tell. \"Nigeria will be the place where all of the example will be set for the rest of Africa. We are really looking forward to.\" The vice president described the trade fair as \"really inspirational for us when we look at the share enormity of what we have to deal with\". He said that no fewer than 96 million homes in the country required power. \"I am speaking of Nigeria alone and they have no access to power at the moment. I just have to look in round again and see what is possible. I think we really have to go and go very quickly. \"I think that every day means that we actually can do cheaper solar power and the technology appears to be getting better by the minute; we can't afford to wait until it is cheaper.\" In an interview, the Executive Secretary/CEO, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Mrs Uju Hassan -Baba, stressed the need for the country to explore opportunities for alternative sources of power to augment the low production level and make power accessible to Nigerians. \"Renewable energy is the only way to go because if we are going to wait for connection to the grid then it means that thousands of Nigerians in the rural areas will not have access to electricity, children will not be able to do their homework, entrepreneurs will not be able to start up. \"Definitely, you have heard the Vice President, Nigeria is squarely on board in this campaign to light up Africa and the NIPC will definitely facilitate any investments that are coming into Nigeria to ensure that the regulations and incentives will be reviewed to support the light up Africa campaign.\" The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Federal Government of Nigeria and the UK had on Thursday entered into a partnership agreement to provide cheap solar power to the citizens at a ceremony in the Facebook Headquarters in London.
