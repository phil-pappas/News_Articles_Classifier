Louie Douvis by James Eyers Westpac Banking Corp is planning to lift its dividend next year despite the regulatory headwinds battering the banking sector, which have forced the bank to raise $3.5 billion in new capital.\nWith the sustainability of bank dividends the focus of several analyst reports in recent weeks, Westpac said on Wednesday there would be no change to its dividend approach.\nAnnouncing preliminary full-year results to coincide with the capital raising, the bank said it would pay a fully-franked, 94¢ cent final dividend, up 1¢ on the interim dividend and 2¢ higher than the final dividend for the 2014 year.\n\"We are sticking with our current dividend approach of seeking to steadily increase dividends, within the context of a sustainable payout ratio,\" chief executive Brian Hartzer told analysts on a conference call.\nMorgan Stanley analyst Richard Wiles highlighted the rising dividend, the strong margin in the second half and the home loan repricing – the bank said it would raise its standard variable rate by of 0.20 percentage points for both property investors and owner-occupiers – as being \"positive for the full-year 2016 earnings outlook\".\nEnd of the war The end of the war between the banks for deposit funding allowed Westpac to expand its closely watched net interest margin; this was 7 basis points higher in Westpac's retail and business bank on improved deposit spreads. \"Deposit repricing more than offset competition across mortgages and business lending,\" said chief financial officer Peter King.\nMacquarie analyst Brendan Carrig said the strong net interest margin result allowed the bank to exceed expectations. The bank's decision to reprice its entire mortgage portfolio from November 20 would \"provide further margin tailwinds throughout 2016\", Mr Carrig added, although there was a risk that if the rest of the sector did not follow the move that Westpac \"could see very subdued levels of loan growth and higher levels of customer churn.\"\n The unaudited full-year results for 2015 reported a cash profit up 3 per cent to $7.82 billion, and up 7 per cent in the second half, with interest income growing by 6 per cent for the year. There was a pick up in business lending and growth in volumes in the institutional bank although spreads remained under pressure.\nThe increase in capital issued during the year helped push the return on equity down 57 basis points to 15.8 per cent, but this remains above the 15 per cent ROE target, which Mr Hartzer recommitted to.\nLoan impairment charges Loan impairment charges were higher but this reflected lower benefits from asset quality improvements reported in previous years and Mr King said \"improving asset quality continues to be a feature of our performance\". The proportion of stressed assets remains below 1 per cent, with mortgage and credit card delinquencies declining as low interest rates helped customer pay down debt.\nHowever, the bank did increase overlays against the mining sector. \"We have continued to keep a close eye on this sector,\" Mr King said. \"Over the last 6 months, we have seen a couple of facilities fall into stress but it is not expected to be a material source of loss.\"\nExpenses up 5 per cent due to investment including higher software amortisation and impairment adding 1 per cent to full-year expenses growth. \"This run rate [is] a little higher than what we like and we have productivity initiatives underway that are bringing cost growth down to between 2 per cent and 3 per cent,\" said Mr King.\nWestpac shares will not trade again until next Monday as the institutional entitlement is conducted this week.\nMoody's said Westpac was now well-positioned to meet any future increases in capital requirements through organic capital generation and, as needed, usage of its dividend reinvestment plans.\nThe $3.5 billion capital raising follows its $2 billion raising announced at the half-year results in May. Since then, Commonwealth Bank has raised $5.5 billion and ANZ Banking Group has raised $3 billion after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority said banks would need to raise more equity against mortgages, a recommendation of the financial system inquiry. National Australia Bank raised $5.5 billion in May.\nMr Hartzer said the raising was prompted by domestic and offshore shareholders \"telling us they would prefer certainty and they would favour some sort of rights issue rather than progressive DRP underwrites.\" He also said that with expectations growing that a raising would accompany the full-year results on November 2, \"these expectations tend to create volatility and we want to minimise that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:06:03.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
