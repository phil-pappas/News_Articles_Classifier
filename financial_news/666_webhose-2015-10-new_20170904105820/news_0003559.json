The sector as a whole is very competitive,\" Mr Nicholson said. \n\"It will be losing even more money off its fixed line products, which have already been a big money loser.\" \nThe ACCC ruling is a slight modification on the watchdog's interim ruling in June for a 9.6 per cent price cut, but still represents a significant reduction. \nMr Sims said prices should be falling due to lower expenditures, falling cost of capital and the migration to the NBN. \n\"These more than offset upward pressures from a shrinking fixed line market,\" he said. \nThe 9.4 per cent price cut will be in force until June 2019. \nThe ACCC's final decision also covers connection and disconnection charges. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Internet bills may drop after ACCC ruling AAP \nAustralians could be paying less for their phone and internet from next month after Telstra was ordered to cut â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:59:54.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
