The transaction is subject to shareholder approval of both companies, along with customary regulatory closing conditions, and is expected to be completed by early 2016.\nBy combining the companies' products, talent and information assets, the new company will have an improved ability to deliver what the media industry have long been asking for â€“ a comprehensive cross-platform measurement system that accounts for all the ways in which content is consumed.\nIndustry Support for the comScore and Rentrak Merger\nContent Owner Support\n\"The combination of these two solid, complementary companies with experienced research leadership is a positive development as the advertising industry confronts the formidable task of building the analytical infrastructure required in the increasingly complex media environment.\"\nDavid Poltrack, CRO, CBS Corporation\n\"Competition in the measurement space offers the opportunity to foster greater innovation among all the players. The introduction of a new measurement service which would offer a different way to crack the cross-platform code would be enormously beneficial to the entire media industry and can't come too soon.\"\nAlan Wurtzel, President of Research and Media Development, NBC Universal\n\"Measurement of viewing needs to evolve quickly to match the rapid pace of change in our industry. We look forward to seeing how the combination of comScore and Rentrak is able to solve some of the longstanding challenges of measuring content in an unduplicated fashion across time and media platforms.\"\nLisa Heimann, VP of Multiplatform Research, ABC\n\"This merger is welcome news, as the industry needs speedier progress and increased innovation in cross platform measurement. Consumers are watching TV on every screen and platform, and we all need measurement to catch up.\"\nColleen Fahey Rush, EVP and Chief Research Officer, Viacom\n\"This merger represents a huge advancement for TV and cross-platform measurement. Project Blueprint helped make the industry's first syndicated cross-platform measurement service a reality. By augmenting that work with tens of millions of set-top boxes and more granular reporting from Rentrak, this is a meaningful step forward to closing the measurement gap.\"\nArtie Bulgrin, SVP of Global Research and Analytics, ESPN\n\"The increasingly complex media environment has created an ongoing measurement challenge that demands constant innovation to keep pace with the evolving multiplatform consumer. The combination of Rentrak's set-top box data and comScore's digital expertise offers exciting possibilities for the advancement of cross-platform measurement in our industry.\"\nRobin Garfield, SVP of Research and Scheduling, CNN\n\"With the continued progression of consumer behavior across multiple screens, distribution services and platforms, it's a priority for Turner to support improved cross-platform measurement tools, with the goal being better ad sales, marketing and programming insights. The Rentrak and comScore merger offers greatly needed competition and is a significant step forward for the measurement capabilities of our industry.\"\nHoward Shimmel, CRO, Turner Broadcasting\n\"Traditional television ratings don't account for all the viewing that's happening across screens today, meaning that a new approach to cross-platform audience measurement is needed. We welcome developments, such as the merger of comScore and Rentrak that will put pressure on the industry to catch up with real viewing behavior.\"\nChris Ryan, VP Sales Research, Scripps Networks\n\"As we meet viewers' desires to consume content whenever and wherever they want we need more precise and holistic cross-platform measurement offerings to match.

We're optimistic that the merger between comScore and Rentrak will accelerate the pace of innovation.\"\nJeff Levick, CRO, Spotify\nAdvertiser & Agency Support\n\"Increasingly fragmented viewership of TV requires a cross-device system built on big data that can deliver precision planning, buying and evaluation of media. This means better accounting for the valuable viewing that happens on long-tail networks, in local markets, and across digital platforms. We applaud the merger of comScore and Rentrak as a major step toward realizing this vision.\"\nIrwin Gotlieb, Global Chairman, GroupM\n\"A siloed media planning and buying environment not only produces less efficient media spend but also prevents measurement of basic KPIs like unduplicated reach and frequency.

Certainly, this is a field undergoing significant pressure to innovate in response to quickly evolving consumer content consumption habits. It is the proliferation of measurement options available to the industry that will help breed much needed innovation.\"\nJane Clarke, CEO, Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement\n\"The merger between comScore and Rentrak signals an important step forward to address the measurement mandate: a call for investment in common GRP and ROI metrics across all platforms, from time shifted viewing to mobile. It's very encouraging to see investment in innovation for speed to solution to advance insight for advertisers, who lack the time and resources to stitch together their own data management platforms. The industry has much to gain from these partnerships.\"\nGayle Fuguitt, President and CEO, Advertising Research Foundation\n\"Amongst the top issues I hear about when speaking to Smart Data Marketers is how media innovation has outpaced available measurement offerings.
