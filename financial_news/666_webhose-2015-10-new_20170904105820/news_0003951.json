They both believed it was more than capable of looking after their family’s finances. \nBut like millions of other families in the wake of the financial crisis, the Hinch family ran into difficulties and had to borrow money from Halifax to pay off credit card debts. \nThe couple already had a mortgage on a part-repayment basis, and in 2008 they took out a number of further advances over different terms to repay what they owed. \nFor eases’ sake, Cheryl asked for the repayments to be scheduled to end along with the interest-only part of her mortgage in 2014. \nThis was with the exception of a £47,000 chunk of her £105,000 mortgage, which she wanted to be extended until till 2020. \nCheryl very quickly sensed that something was very wrong when she received a statement of the key facts which said her mortgage would end in 2020. She immediately questioned it, but the adviser she spoke to reassured her that everything was as it should be. The statement would only show the longest term, even if there were shorter ones, she explained. \nShe accepted this, but then in 2010, her suspicions were reignited when she visited Halifax because some of the fixed terms were coming to an end. \nThe mortgage adviser confirmed her worst fears. Her entire mortgage had been extended until 2020 - a full six years longer than she'd anticipated. As a result, despite having made £40-a-month overpayments, her balance had not reduced as expected. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was then explained that the internal system which was used to administer their mortgage account was only capable of having one term for all further advances. This means extending just one chunk of her mortgage would never have been possible - despite her being told otherwise. As such, when a new further advance was taken over a different term, all their existing further advances began operating over the new, longer term. \nShe was furious and wanted to complain, but was told that as she had signed a legal agreement, there was nothing that could be done. Cheryl accepted this, but it turned out to be a decision she would later regret. She said: “I just thought the bank is the bank and you can’t argue with them. I thought what they said was the final word so I just walked away.” \nIt was only this year, when she explained her situation to a separate mortgage adviser, that she was urged to make a complaint against Halifax. \nHalifax quickly admitted it had made a mistake and offered the Hinch family £13,000 in compensation. But by this point Cheryl’s trust in Halifax had completely gone up in smoke. How could she be sure the compensation was fair? \nThe offer was accompanied by hundreds of pages of documents, jam packed with complex calculations and jargon-filled language. Unsurprisingly, it left the Hinches feeling completely bamboozled. \nShe took the case to the Financial Ombudsman, but they rejected it on grounds that she’d known about the problem since 2010 twice the length of its three year window during which claims can be made. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) when Telegraph Money employed the help of qualified actuaries - who are trained to be able to make sense of the numbers they couldn't understand Halifax's fiendishly complicated explanation. \nAlan Higham, an actuary and founder of pensionschamp.com, said:”This is a terribly complex situation which is very hard to piece together. \n“The bank’s complaint letters are woeful in their clarity. It isn’t entirely clear to me how much this lady has borrowed, or what she has repaid.” \nA spokesman from Halifax said: “In reviewing the account we can see a number of separate further advances after the original mortgage was taken out. The previous calculations accompanying them were correct up until the term amendment in March 2010. \n“It is part of the sales process that the Mortgage Adviser should have clearly made the Hinch’s aware of the consequence of trying to take a new further advance over a different term. However, as we are unable to reconstruct conversations that occurred between them and the Mortgage Adviser we agree it is possible they were not made aware of how the term would be affected and therefore, we have taken reasonable steps to try to reconstruct the account, in line with their expectations.\" \nAfter Telegraph Money asked Halifax to explain how the pay out had been calculated it then admitted it had made yet more errors. It offered the Hinches more than a third more in compensation this time £19,308.20. \nIt said: “Due to the fact that we had made further errors with the calculations, we offered the Hinch’s £1,000.00 for their distress and inconvenience, which they have now accepted.” \nSome weeks later Cheryl received a surprised call from the Ombudsman. He explained that it had “found something” which meant it might be able to take on her case after all. \nThis week it confirmed her case has been reopened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:47:18.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
