Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Ben Potter The $118 billion Future Fund moved some of its cash into new hedge funds in the September quarter, as the fund's managers continued to avoid risk in choppy markets.\nThe national sovereign wealth fund also switched about $1.5 billion from emerging market global equities to developed market equities during the three months to 30 September.\nSeparately, the federal government made its first contribution of $1.01 billion to the Medical Research Future Fund established by former treasurer Joe Hockey during the quarter.\nThe Medical Research Future Fund is managed by the Future Fund, chaired by former Howard government treasurer Peter Costello. Mr Costello set up the Future Fund in 2006 as a bulwark against future Commonwealth liabilities.\nThe Future Fund's return over the three months to 30 September was just 0.5 per cent – down from 15.4 per cent in the year to June 30 – as nervousness over the US Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates and financial volatility in China hammered financial markets.\nBut a 2008 financial crisis decision to buy distressed debt paid off for the national sovereign wealth fund. The debt has stabilised and been reallocated from \"alternative assets\" to the debt securities portfolio.\nDebt securities increased to $15 billion or 12.7 per cent of the Future Fund's assets from $11.5 billion at 30 June, although total exposure didn't change much.\nThe Future Fund took $5.2 billion out of cash and ploughed about half of that into three global \"macro\" hedge funds.\n Macro hedge funds aim to profit from anomalies in credit, equity or currency markets to make a return regardless of whether markets go up or down.\n\"If we can identify a manager that we think can add value without relying on markets, that's valuable to the fund,\" managing director David Neal said.\nThe net increase in the \"alternative assets portfolio\" after moving into these new hedge funds and moving out the distressed debt was just $600 million.\nThe other half of the cash redeployed was used to hedge against a fall of US4¢ in the Australian dollar during the quarter, which increased the exposure to US dollar denominated risk assets such as private equity, debt and equity.\n\"What we had to do is to take some portfolio action just to stand still,\" Mr Neal said. He expected the strategy to remain risk-averse and stable.\nEmerging market equities fell to 7.9 per cent of the total portfolio from 9.4 per cent, and developed market equities rose to 18.8 per cent from 17.6 per cent.\n\"We formed the view that that the risk level rises a fair bit in emerging markets relative to developed markets,\" Mr Neal said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:12:24.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
