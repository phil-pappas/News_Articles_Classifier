Demo contractor convicted in Philadelphia building collapse By: The Associated Press October 19, 2015 4:48 pm 0 \nPHILADELPHIA â€” A demolition contractor charged in the deaths of six people buried in debris from a building collapse was found guilty Monday of involuntary manslaughter. \nA jury convicted Griffin Campbell of six counts of involuntary manslaughter, rejecting the third-degree murder charges sought by prosecutors. \nCampbell had described himself as a scapegoat for the architect overseeing the blocklong demolition project. \nHowever, prosecutors say he controlled the worksite and lied after the collapse about how the demolition was being conducted. \nThey say he caused a towering brick wall to collapse on an adjacent thrift store as he cut corners on the job in June 2013. One woman found alive after hours in the rubble lost her legs. \nCampbell was also convicted of aggravated assault and risking a catastrophe for the ordeal inflicted on the survivors. His lawyer tried to shift the blame to building owner Richard Basciano, project architect Plato Marinakos and others. Basciano had wanted the wall down quickly so he could redevelop the shabby properties, which he had owned for years. \nProsecutors said the building was unstable because Campbell had gutted the support beams and joists to sell them for salvage. The side wall adjacent to the thrift store should have been taken down by hand while the thrift store was closed, prosecution experts said.
