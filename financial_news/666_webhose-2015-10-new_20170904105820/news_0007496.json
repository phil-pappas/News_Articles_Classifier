As a highly globalised bank, this hit HSBC harder than any of its rivals. \nIn Chancellor George Osborne's emergency Budget earlier this year, he said he would cut back the levy and introduce an 8pc corporation tax surcharge on UK profits instead - a move aimed at encouraging HSBC to stay. \n\"The UK’s made some changes to the tax framework which we think are positive to the structure of taxing banks in the UK,\" Mr Flint said after the changes were announced. But he warned that while the change \"comes into the mix, it is not determinative\" . \nHSBC is due to make a decision on whether to relocate from the UK by the end of the year. \nHSBC declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:40:32.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
