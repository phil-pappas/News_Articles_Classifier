Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Human Rights Commissioner Gillian Triggs has called for sweeping law reform that would require companies to take responsibility for human rights breaches in the same manner as governments.\nIn her latest intervention in offshore detention policy, Ms Triggs said Australia was explicitly breaching human rights law with its boat turn-backs and activities on Nauru and Manus Island.\nBut given that the government was effectively able to operate with impunity, the companies doing its bidding should be held responsible.\n\"It has become more important than ever that the corporations and businesses that are complicit in carrying out illegal government policies should themselves bear responsibility for breaching human rights laws,\" Ms Triggs said when she delivered the Monash Law Faculty Annual Costello Lecture on 30 September.\nThe comments will be seen as a reference to Broadspectrum, formerly Transfield Services, which has the contract to operate Australia's offshore detention centres.\nMs Triggs has previously condemned the government's decision to renew the contract even though a Senate committee inquiry, which was highly critical of conditions within the camp on Nauru.\n\"The idea that [Transfield Services] should be granted another five-year contract in these circumstances is something that clearly needs to be reconsidered in light of the findings of the select committee,\" Ms Triggs told the ABC in early September.\nShe told the Monash Law Faculty that \"some countries adopt policies that explicitly breach human rights law, such as Australia's 'stop the boats' and off-shore detention policies.\n Although the state under international law is legally responsible for breaches of human rights, it is, for all practical purposes, immune from legal processes; in short it can frequently act with impunity.\"\nHuman rights activists have targeted Broadspectrum/Transfield over its involvement in offshore detention, a campaign that the company's chairman, Diane Smith-Gander, has described as \"misplaced\" .\nMs Triggs said some corporates had greater turnover than small countries, yet they bore no responsibility for human rights.\n\"Despite the economic power of companies, it remains true that the law has not yet caught up,\" she said.\n\"It is the sovereign state and its government that bears the legal duty for human rights compliance, not the company, despite the fact that often business wields greater power and influence over the communities in which they operate and have a genuine capacity to protect the human rights of the people whose lives they affect at a practical level.\n\"In the Commission's view, such economic power and capacity of the private business sector brings legal and ethical responsibility and opportunity to protect and promote human rights.\"\nBusiness and human rights The Australian Human Rights Commission has made business and human rights a strategic priority.\nFor the most part, the commission's investigation and conciliation services deal with discrimination claims in employment. \"Good\" businesses were reviewing their supply chains and even developing human rights policies, Ms Triggs said.\nIn her speech she cited several examples of the broader interplay of law and ethics.\nThese included health superannuation fund HESTA's decision to divest from what was then known as Transfield because of the long-term financial risks associated with detention centres.\nAnd ride-sharing service Uber was forced to offer free fares in response to a social media storm over extra charges for those trying to get out of Sydney CBD after the Martin Place siege.\n\"Businesses increasingly recognise the economic argument that to achieve sustained financial success, they must meet standards of good governance, transparency and ethical practices within the communities in which they operate,\" Ms Triggs said.\n\"Indeed, it is the commitment to the wellbeing of all stakeholders, employees, consumers, and shareholders that separates firms from their competition.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:54:02.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
