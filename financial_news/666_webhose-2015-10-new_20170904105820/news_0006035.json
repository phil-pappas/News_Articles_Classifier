The transaction will be financed with cash and a note issued to Novogratz, shrinking its dividend-paying share count by roughly 13 percent.\nThe company's share price climbed 5.7 percent on Tuesday to $5.75 after falling more than 5 percent in after-hours trading on Monday as news spread that Fortress would close the fund and Novogratz would leave at an unspecified time.\nThe global macro fund, which made bets on currencies, interest rates and stocks, had $2.3 billion in assets at the end of the second quarter, less than a third of its tally eight years ago.\nThe fund was launched in 2002 and reached a peak of $8 billion in assets in 2007, the year Fortress listed its shares.\nThe current figure makes up about 3 percent of Fortress' $72 billion in assets, not including redemption requests that investors put in as performance suffered this year.\nIts contribution to earnings has been relatively small, Fortress said, noting that it accounted for roughly 2 percent in pre-tax distributable earnings in the last 12 months through the end of the second quarter.\nNovogratz, 50, said it was a tough decision to close down the fund, but acknowledged the fund's heavy losses this year. \"I do not believe the current environment is conducive to achieving our best results,\" he said.\nThe fund's loss widened to 17 percent at the end of September, far more than the average global macro fund which is off roughly 0.64 percent this year, data from Hedge Fund Research show.\nFortress reshuffled Novogratz's team several times this year and in the last weeks a number of employees left the firm.
