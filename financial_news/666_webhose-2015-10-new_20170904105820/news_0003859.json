Net income rose 51% to $4.3 billion, indicating a payoff from Corbat's efforts to turn around a company that was hammered in the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nCitigroup eventually took $45 billion in government bailouts, and has since grappled with low interest rates and regulatory issues including a probe of currency-market rigging.\n\nTotal revenue fell 5% to $18.7 billion, Citigroup said, and it had an effective tax rate of 30%, down 11 percentage points from a year earlier. Operating expenses dropped 18% to $10.7 billion, driven mostly by lower legal bills. \nMust Read: Wells Fargo Earnings Amped Up by $9 Billion GE Capital Deal \nThe New York bank's shares dropped 6.1% to $50.72 this year through Wednesday, a better performance than both the KBW Bank Index, which fell 6.7%, and the S&P 500 Financials Index, which declined 7.5%.\n\nCitigroup is positioned to deliver on a \"longer-term goal of strengthening its global presence in consumer and corporate lending while returning meaningful levels of capital to shareholders,\" S&P Capital IQ analyst Erik Oja said in a note to clients before earnings were announced. He has a \"buy\" rating on the stock and a 12-month price target of $65.\nOja predicted that legal expenses would moderate this year, leading to total costs of about 65% of core revenue, significantly below last year's 75% and in line with comparable rivals. \"Further settlements may occur,\" he noted, \"but we think they will be well below amounts paid in previous years.\"\nCheck Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:35:51.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
