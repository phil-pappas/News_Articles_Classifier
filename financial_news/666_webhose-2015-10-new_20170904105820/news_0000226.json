Purchasers would choose delivery destinations and would also be involved in overseeing quality controls.\nKone said the GNI had contacted U.S. traders Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, Swiss firms ECOM Trading and Barry Callebaut, France's Cemoi and Singapore's Olam International.\n\"We ... signal our agreement on all of your submitted propositions,\" Cargill Cocoa and Chocolate's West Africa General Manager Lionel Soulard wrote in a response to GNI seen by Reuters.\nThe positions of the other companies concerning the proposal were not immediately known.\nIn an attempt to circumscribe the boycott, the CCC said last month that it would resell at a discount to international buyers around 200,000 tonnes of 2015/16 beans purchased by domestic operators. However, many wary buyers continued to stay away.\nThe 2015/16 cocoa marketing season opened in Ivory Coast on Thursday.\n(Writing by Joe Bavier, editing by David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:37:32.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
