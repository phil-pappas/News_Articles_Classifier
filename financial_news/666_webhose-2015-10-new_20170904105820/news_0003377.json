In July it reduced its 2015 nickel production target to 78,000-82,000 tonnes from a previous estimate of 80,000-86,000 tonnes.\nNickel, even more so than copper and zinc, has underperformed for Glencore.\nThe nickel division saw a 25-percent drop in revenue in the first half compared with 12 percent and 8 percent declines for copper and zinc respectively.\nCopper prices rebounded from six-year lows in September after Glencore said it would suspend copper operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia for 18 months, removing 400,000 tonnes from the supply pool.\nLast Friday, zinc galloped 10-percent higher - its single biggest one-day gain in at least a decade - after Glencore said it was eliminating 500,000 tonnes of zinc production, or 4 percent of global supply.\n\"The move in copper and zinc suggest Glencore may be looking at doing the same in nickel,\" said Australia and New Zealand commodities analyst Daniel Hynes.\nAs it wrestles with ways to cut $30 billion in debt by a third, Glencore has shown it can be ruthless in jettisoning unwanted nickel assets.\nIn June it sold the mothballed Cosmos nickel mine for A$24.5 million, a fraction of the A$3.1 billion Xstrata had spent in 2008 to acquire its then owner Jubilee Mines.
