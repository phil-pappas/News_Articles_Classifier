Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter by Ben Potter Celebrity economist Thomas Piketty got his diagnosis of inequality wrong, and his remedy too, Citigroup vice-chairman and former Obama administration Office of Management and Budget chief Peter Orszag says.\nThe French economist became a sensation in 2013 for his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century . The book argued that excessive returns on capital concentrated wealth and caused social and economic instability. He recommended punitive taxes on the rich to fix the problem.\nBut Mr Orszag said a recent study by him and Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, found that housing and land mostly drove returns on capital faster than wages over three decades to 1999.\nContrary to Professor Piketty and popular wisdom, overall returns on productive capital – or capital invested by business firms – increased only slightly from 1970 to 1990.\n\"That is a much different story [than] 'all the greedy capitalists are taking your wages',\" Mr Orszag – in Sydney for Citigroup's Australia and New Zealand investment conference – told The Australian Financial Review .\nTwo other recent studies found the main cause of rising wage inequality appeared to be inequality between firms rather than inequality between individual workers – the \"rocketship\" company effect.\nIn the 1960s, the top 10 per cent of US-listed firms with revenues of more than $US500 million had returns on invested capital of more than 20 per cent (excluding goodwill), Mr Orszag said.\nBy 2014, the returns of the top 10 per cent had been above 100 per cent for half a decade.\n Most 'rocketship' firms are IT or healthcare The overwhelming majority of rocketship firms in recent decades have been information technology companies such as Google, Apple and Facebook, or healthcare – mostly pharmaceutical – firms.\nThese findings are independent of differences in educational attainment – another popular culprit for inequality. A business analyst at a rocketship firm typically earns a lot more than a business analyst at a non-rocketship firm, Mr Orszag said.\nEconomic theory suggests that super returns should be competed away as new firms clamour to enter these unusually lucrative markets.\nBut super returns are sticky over time. Mr Orszag said 85 per cent of the firms earnings more than 25 per cent on invested capital in 2003 were still doing so in 2013.\nCautioning that these findings are tentative and much more work has to be done, Mr Orszag said a remedy may lie in asking if \"network effects\" enjoyed by tech firms, or strong intellectual property protections enjoyed by pharmaceutical companies, have raised barriers to entry to unsustainable levels.\nIf so, the answer might be tougher competition policy enforcement or a lowering of IP protections, not the punitive income and wealth taxes recommended by Professor Piketty for the rich.\nBut such policy remedies raise tricky questions. Companies such as Microsoft, Google and Facebook built their dominant market positions by creating better products for consumers to enjoy. Policymakers should be reluctant to weaken incentives for doing that.\nPharmaceutical companies argue they need high returns to create lifesaving drugs and pay for the failures, and politicians have little to gain by risking being blamed for a lack of new wonder drugs.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:01:53.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
