Mining stocks surge and global indices rally after China rate cut By Tara Cunningham | Telegraph – 37 minutes ago 731.50 +8.0000 \nCommodity stocks jumped after China cut its benchmark interest rate, while FTSE 100 hits a two-month high \nUK-listed miners surged after China cut its benchmark interest rate in its latest attempt to ease monetary policy as it grapples with slowing economic growth. \nCopper leapt by as much as 1.5pc following the announcement, sending international miner Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) to the top of the FTSE 100. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) jumped by 9.3pc to 128p. \nThe sector, which has been left battered by a recent sell off in commodities, rose in tandem. BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) added 4pc to 621p, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) advanced 4pc, Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGY - news ) was 3.2pc higher and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) was 3.3pc better. \nMid cap stocks Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) and Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) also jumped 6.9pc and 4.2pc respectively. Glencore one-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nThe FTSE 100 also turned higher, rising by as much as 1.75pc to touch a two-month high of 6,487.89. \nEuropean shares also joined the rally with German DAX up 2.8pc, the CAC in Paris 2.6pc higher and the Spanish IBEX climbing 1.8pc. * China cuts interest rates as policymakers step up stimulus efforts \nEarlier in the morning, European bourses continued to rally following comments made by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Thursday, when he suggested the central bank could pump up its quantitative easing programme as early as December. \nTraders and investors said the cut added to perceptions that the post-crisis, central-bank-fuelled market rally was here to stay. Comments by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi on Thursday pointed to potentially more policy easing in future. \nAlastair McCaig, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “European equities maintained their bullish momentum from yesterday, comforted by further proof that the ECB is sticking with Mario Draghi’s mantra of ‘whatever it takes’. \n“Although there might well be some debate as to the direct benefits of a change to already record-low interest rates, this once again proves that under Mario Draghi the ECB is acting rather than just venting rhetoric.” DAZ one-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) Overnight, Asian stocks jumped , with the Nikkei up 2.1pc and the Shanghai Composite Index 1.3pc higher.
