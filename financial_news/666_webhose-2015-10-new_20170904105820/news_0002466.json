Eddie Jim Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Business has blamed the rigidity of the industrial relations system for the failure of a single employer to sign up to an agreement between the nation's largest union and South Australian employers that traded off penalty rates for higher wages.\nWhile hyped as a breakthrough when announced in March this year, Business SA and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association said not one small or medium-sized business had signed the template agreement.\nUnder the deal, penalty rates paid from 9am to 5pm on Saturdays, and Thursday and Friday nights, would be scrapped. Penalty rates for employees working 9am to 5pm on Sunday would be halved to 50 per cent but remain at double time for other hours worked on Sunday.\nAs compensation, workers would get an immediate 8 per cent increase in their base salaries followed by guaranteed pay rises.\nBusiness SA chief executive Nigel McBride said \"less than 10\" businesses individually assessed the agreement and none believed it would deliver sufficient labour cost reductions to justify transferring to the new arrangements.\nMr McBride said the deal had been a \"fair compromise within the constraints of the Fair Work compliance regime\", including the need to show that workers would be better off overall.\nSystem 'straitjacket' \"Our reservation was always that it would be within what we believe is the straitjacket of the current system which doesn't allow real flexibility,\" he said.\n Gerard Dwyer, the SDA's national secretary, said the refusal of employers to back the agreement showed their long-running campaign about penalty rates was driven by a desire to cut the pay of workers.\n\"It's not the constraints of the current system,\" he said. \"It's the constraints through which the business community is looking at it. They just want to cut penalty rates and cut people's take-home pay.\"\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has advanced the case for lower penalty rates and promised any change would be taken to the next election.\nMr Turnbull, who has left open a trade-off of tax credits in return for lower rates of pay on weekends, has told Parliament that whatever the government decided to do, it would be mindful that people had to be better off in net terms.\nMr Dwyer said the refusal of employers to sign up to the template agreement made Mr Turnbull's comments \"completely hollow\".\n\"[He says] there's got to be a win-win and something that's a fair outcome for employees as well as business,\" Mr Dwyer said.\n\"This is an example akin to what Turnbull's commentary has been. What it shows is business isn't interested in that commentary. It might suit his political purposes. But if they have a look at it and all walk away as they have done, it just exposes the real agenda.\"\nMr McBride said businesses decided there were not adequate savings given the cost and time involved, as well as the risk they would be subject to attacks from other unions if they backed the agreement.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:41:52.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
