By Lisa Johnson Mandell - Yahoo US Real Estate | Yahoo Finance UK – 4 hours ago Print \nBeverly Hills’ steel and glass “salad spinner” house, as local wags have dubbed the bowl-shaped mansion, seems to have some type of centrifugal force that sucks in celebrities. At the beginning of the year, Justin Bieber took out a short-term lease on the place for the widely reported price $59,000 (£38k) per month. More recently, pro basketball brothers Markieff and Marcus Morris checked in and out in six days, the Los Angeles Times reported . \nThe nightly fee for the Ed Niles-designed house is $5,500 to $6,000 (£3.5k-£3.8k). In February, rapper Meek Mill threw a Grammy after-party there – reportedly against the landlord’s express directive . About 1,000 people showed up, and the place was trashed . The landlord sued the rapper as well as guests/“trespassers” including Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Chris Brown and Khloe Kardashian. \nThe Beverly Hills home centers on a circular outdoor courtyard, surrounded by walls of tempered glass with steel ribs. \nAnother view of the courtyard. \nThe Morris brothers stopped in for a week or so before they reported to training camp, the Times said. Markieff plays for the Phoenix Suns, Marcus for the Detroit Pistons. The Times said they hired a $20,000 (£13k) personal chef and a driver for their L.A. stay. \nYou’ll note it seems to be swinging single celebrity guys who are most interested in this place. That could well be because it was specifically built for bachelors. As a matter of fact, Curbed reported that real estate developer Raffi Cohen commissioned the house in his bachelor days, but then got married and started a family and put it on the market before it was finished. Seems he didn’t consider it to be kid-friendly. (Insert Bieber crack here.) \nBachelor pad. \nBuilt in 2009, the three-storey, six-bedroom, seven-bath home centres on a circular outdoor courtyard, surrounded by walls of tempered glass with steel ribs, giving it its “salad spinner” look. It has 6,500 square feet of living space. \nOne of seven bathrooms. Plenty of natural lighting, but not a whole lot of privacy. \nFiner features include formal living and dining rooms, a second-storey family room, an elevator, a master suite with killer views and an aluminium-coated staircase, as well as covered parking for up to seven cars. \nThe master suite has killer views. \nOutside there are polished Portuguese blue marble walkways that meander over still-green lawns before they reach a sail-shaped infinity pool with a spa. There are also expansive city and canyon views from many vantage points on this half-acre property. \nInterior detail. \nFriends can sleep in one of six bedrooms, but judging by the size of the bed and the view of the bedroom from the courtyard, they will probably be sleeping alone. \nPublic records show the home first sold in 2011 for $9 million (£5.8m). It went up for sale again in November for close to $15 million (£9.7), but took a $3.5 million price chop when the latest owners closed at $10.5 million (£6.8m). \nWhile homes in this price range generally sell for cash so house payments aren’t usually an issue, the current owners are likely more than paying the property tax and maintenance by renting it out at such steep prices. \nWe’re betting there will be a lot of filming there as well—either public or private. Yes, it’s that kind of house: \nEven more – many more – photos below. \nLove to gawk at outrageous homes ?
