It Matters for Your Retirement \nSlott said the recent volatility of the market most likely affected balances of funds converted in 2014 when values were higher, prompting some to regret their Roth IRA conversions. However, due to the recharacterization option, that conversion can be undone. \nJamie Hopkins, a professor of retirement at The American College of Financial Services in the Greater Philadelphia area, said the number one reason a person would want to recharacterize their Roth IRA after a conversion is because the value of his investments dropped or because his tax rate in the current or next year is expected to be much lower. \n“For instance, if you converted an IRA worth $10,000 when your tax rate was 35% in 2014 and in 2015 you only expect to have a tax rate of 15% because you retired, it would be beneficial to recharacterize the $10,000 Roth IRA and reconvert the IRA at the lower 15% tax rate later this year,” Hopkins said. “In this case, it would save you $2,000, or 20% of your account.” 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:37:28.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
