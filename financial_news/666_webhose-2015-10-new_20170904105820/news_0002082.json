Replacing a wide range of smaller, less efficient facilities, the centres will produce significant savings on running costs in the region of £0.5 million each year”. \n“The new data facilities will also offer high levels of security and operational stability, providing a strong and secure foundation for the IT systems used by Northern Ireland citizens engaging with the public sector.” \nAnchor tenants for the new Data Centres will include Enterprise Shared Services, Translink and the Business Services Organisation. \nThe Centres will be available for live operation by autumn 2016. \nDFP has awarded the contract for the provision of two secure, high availability data centres to BT. The contract is valued at circa £15million over 10 years. BT will manage the operation of the facilities, including continuity plans. The public sector will continue to manage the IT systems within the facilities. Notes to editors: Over the last two years DFP has been running the cross departmental project to provide two secure data centre facilities for use by the NI public sector.
