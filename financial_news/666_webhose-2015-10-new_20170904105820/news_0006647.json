At the trailer launch, a visibly emotional Sooraj said, \"We were 20 when we started. We made our mistakes together, we had fun together and he is everything to me.\"\nIn the last decade, Salman has become synonymous with larger-than-life characters like Dabangg's Chulbul Pandey and Bajrangi Bhaijaan's Pawan Chaturvedi. Returning to Barjatya's world seemed improbable till this film happened. Sooraj recounted, \"When I told Salman about the title, he joked, ' Sooraj , aur koi hota toh main baahar phekwa deta , but it's you and that's why it works.'\"\nWhile there is a lot of prem in the film, the epic bromance of Salman and Sooraj is at its core. An overwhelmed Salman added, \"From the day we met each other, we've shared a special bond. I've worked with a lot of directors but the love and respect that I have for Sooraj babu, I don't have for anyone else. I'm happy that I've worked with him because as a human being, there is nobody in this world who is better than him.\"\nSonam Kapoor admitted it was intimidating working with Salman and Rajshri Productions. She said, \"But the nervousness went away after the first few days. Sooraj made me feel cherished. It was such a huge deal but it felt like I always belonged here and was a part of the family.\"\nREAD: Trailer: Salman Khan returns in his lover boy avatar in 'Prem Ratan Dhan Payo'\nThe event saw full attendance from the movie's cast comprising Anupam Kher, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Armaan Kohli, Swara Bhaskar and Deepak Dobriyal as well as Vijay Singh of Fox Star Studios and Bhushan Kumar of T-Series. \"When you grow up in joint families, you know how to take everyone along. You've to manage everyone especially Salman, who needs to be woken up on time for shoot. When you make a family film, you have to be a family,\" said Sooraj.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Prem Ratan Dhan Payo Official Trailer\nBajrangi Bhaijaan Amazon.in : INR 254.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.in/Bajrangi-Bhaijaan-Salman-Khan/dp/B0151EKB08%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0151EKB08", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vd4iNPuRlx4", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S%2BBCJqmLL._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:39:24.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
