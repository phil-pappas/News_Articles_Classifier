The UAW had set a deadline of 11:59 p.m. EDT Sunday to reach a new agreement or go on strike.\nDetails of the proposed contract weren't immediately available.\nThe UAW said local union leaders will meet in Detroit Wednesday to vote on the agreement. If they approve it, workers at GM's U.S. plants will then vote on it.\nThe proposed contract with GM covers nearly 53,000 U.S. auto workers.\nWorkers at Fiat Chrysler approved a new contract agreement last week. The union hasn't yet reached an agreement with Ford.\nUnited Auto Workers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:43:05.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
