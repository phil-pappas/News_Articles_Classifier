Although there is a growing realization that retirement planning should begin early, Indians don't seem to be doing it till they are 39, says an article published in The Economic Times in August 2013. I am 36 year old software engineer living in Pune. I started to give thought to retirement planning only after I came across this article while browsing the net a year back.What I LearntSixty-three percent of urban Indians feel that they'll have enough money post the working years. But the real question is with ever rising prices, meagre savings and a host of responsibilities, would we really have enough money? Here is what I realized when I started researching for retirement plans.I Should Have Started Early - The earlier you start investing, the more money you save. Also, the more time you give an investment corpus to build, the more benefits you reap. I realized that only after I calculated how much I would have already earned if I had started at 30 or even earlier.I Should Take Care of My Health - Health care costs rose at a double-digit pace between 2005 to 2015 outpacing inflation according to a report published by the National Sample Survey Office. Now that is a very alarming trend. Taking care of our health is probably the most efficient insurance plan we can have in place but due to my tight work schedules, I had not been able to do so. After a series of comprehensive check-ups, I made a conscious effort to eat healthy and exercise. Not only is healthcare cost rising but our health also deteriorates as we age therefore a comprehensive health care policy that covers you and your family is essential to save you from future financial shocks. One thing that I did when I took a retirement plan was that I got my entire family health insured so that I have my earnings covered in case any member of the family falls ill.Pay off Your Home Loan as Early as Possible - I had been re-paying my monthly installments towards my home loan on time for the past 6 years. I have never thought of paying it off early even though I had surplus income every month. This only struck me when I realized that I could pay off my loan sooner and invest the same amount of money every month to my retirement corpus.Take Inflation into Perspective - This is what my adviser told me. Inflation is going to catch up as times passes by, therefore you must take out a retirement plan that can help you maintain your lifestyle with ease even after you have stopped working.
