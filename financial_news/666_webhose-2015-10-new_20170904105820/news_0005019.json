Deciding what mortgage company to choose has just gotten easier for consumers. The Company has introduced a new initiative called The Buyers Bonus Program. This unique program offers a complimentary one-year home warranty plan for customers who purchase a home with a loan provided by Allied Mortgage Group. Allied is now offering a complimentary First American Home Buyers Protection Plan which provides coverage on most essential systems and appliances in a home that fail due to normal wear and tear.

This Buyer Bonus Program is another tangible expression of our commitment to the public and the promotion of home ownership.\"\nAllied's Buyer Bonus Program also works with new home construction, providing buyers with a year of protection that begins when the builder's warranty ends. \"Allied is helping consumers protect their investment and their future with this unique free program.\" said Mr. Wexler.\nAbout Allied Mortgage: Allied Mortgage Group (NMLS #1067) is a 22- year-old mortgage lender that has been creating extraordinary experiences since 1993.
