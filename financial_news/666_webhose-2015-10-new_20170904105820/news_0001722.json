Alex Ellinghausen by James Chessell John Kehoe Australian Securities and Investments Commission chairman Greg Medcraft is being considered as a potential new head of British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.\nA report in the Financial Times on Tuesday confirmed speculation Mr Medcraft - a onetime independent Mayor of Woollahra and former Société Générale investment banker in New York - had been approached about running the FCA, which has responsibility for protecting consumers and financial markets in the UK.\nSources said the process handled by headhunters Zygos was in its \"early stages\" and suggested Mr Medcraft had yet to have direct discussions with UK Treasury officials.\nThe Australian Financial Review was told by financial market sources in July that Mr Medcraft was being considered for the job, but at the time a person close to the ASIC chairman denied he had been approached.\nASIC boss Greg Medcraft has been chairman of the international body of securities regulators since March 2013. Chris Pearce Australian financial regulators are generally held in high regard internationally, especially since the local financial system escaped the 2008 global financial crisis relatively unscathed.\nUK chancellor George Osborne and other Conservative Party members have sought to end overt \"bank bashing\" following their election victory in May. The prominent role played by UK banks in the global financial crisis made them the target of much criticism from all sides of politics but many Tory MPs now hope to improve relations between financial institutions and the government.\nAppointed by former Labour treasurer Wayne Swan in May 2011, Mr Medcraft was considered unlikely to be reappointed ASIC chairman by the Abbott government when his five-year term expires next year, the Financial Review reported in May .\nHis contentious comments about Australia being a \"bit of a paradise\" for white collar criminals upset senior members of the Abbott government, particularly Finance Minister Mathias Cormann and former Treasurer Joe Hockey.\n It is unclear whether Malcolm Turnbull's ascension to the prime ministership and the appointment of Scott Morrison as treasurer would earn him a reprieve.\nThe federal government is conducting a full scale capability review of ASIC.\nThe review will examine splitting up, merging or overhauling the regulator following a string of high-profile scandals that engulfed the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Macquarie Private Wealth and National Australia Bank, which in some cases could have been detected earlier.\nThe UK government has demonstrated a willingness to consider offshore appointments for key jobs with the head of Canada's central bank, Mark Carney, appointed as governor of the Bank of England in 2012.\nMr Medcraft has a relatively high profile in international financial regulatory circles.\nHe has been chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions - which is the international body of securities regulators - since March 2013. Mr Medcraft, who has racked up hefty travel bills attending IOSC board meetings, has been criticised for spending too much time overseas.\nMr Medcraft has boosted his international visibility in recent months. He delivered a robust speech in Washington in June where he criticised plans by global central bankers to impose banking regulations on large asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity.\nThe FCA is charged with ensuring the financial industry is run with integrity, that firms provide consumers with appropriate products and services and that consumers can trust that firms have their best interests at heart. It is separate to the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority , which oversees the UK's 1700 banks and financial institutions.\nMr Osborne ousted FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley in July, saying the regulator required \"different leadership\". Mr Wheatley left in September with the FCA's head of supervision, Tracey McDermott, taking over as acting chief executive.\nFormer central banker Paul Tucker was originally recognised as the favourite to win the FCA's top job. Mr Tucker is the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, after being overlooked for the governor role in favour of Mark Carney.\nThe FT reported other potential candidates include include Bank of England officials Andy Haldane and Minouche Shafik as well as Allianz Global Investors executive Elizabeth Corley.\nA spokesman for ASIC was unavailable for comment.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/d2hhnKl6t04", "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Pages/about/default.aspx", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f00b1b50-6f4c-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html?ftcamp=crm/email/_2015___10___20151013__/emailalerts/Keyword_alert/product#axzz3oLC7gItj", "http://www.societegenerale.com/en/home", "http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/politics/end-banker-bashing-say-senior-conservatives-as-party-takes-power/10268.article", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/australia-paradise-for-whitecollar-criminals-says-asic-chairman-greg-medcraft-20141021-119d99.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:12:28.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
