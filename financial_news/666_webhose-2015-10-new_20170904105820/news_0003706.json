In an OAN, the owner or manager of the network does not supply services for the network; these services must be supplied by separate retail service providers. \nThis strategy, he said, aimed to speed up the rollout of fibre infrastructure and thereby introduced economies of scale and choice for home and business customers. \n“While MTN will continue to provide the high end, dedicated fibre network services complete with enterprise-grade service level agreements, smaller businesses will also benefit from MTN’s investment in its fibre infrastructure,” said Mangale. MTN’s multi-tier model gives MTN the ability to cater to the individual needs of each customer segment, Mangale said. \nHe added the service was a step up from traditional offering where other service providers are able to “piggy-back” off MTN’s fibre infrastructure. \n“The next level up from this is the reseller service that smaller IT service providers or residential property managers can offer as a value-added service.” \n– CAJ News \nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=8982 Posted by Admin on Oct 20 2015.
