On an adjusted basis, the firm said it earned $1.50 a share versus the consensus estimate of $1.19 a share. Results were driven by strong results for trucks and SUVs ion the U.S. while sales in China were soft. Shares rose over 5% on the report. \nPositive pricing was a critical theme in Coca-Cola’s (KO) third-quarter, with price and mix contributing about 3 percentage points of top-line growth in the quarter (and 2 points year to date), driven by a continued rational competitive environment in North America and substantial price hikes in Latin America to mitigate negative currency impacts. We're also encouraged by Coke's volume performance in the quarter; unit case sales (a measure of end-market demand) ticked up 3% from a year ago, with noncarbonated beverages climbing a solid 6%. Coke's profitability was solid in the quarter, with adjusted margins roughly flat with a year ago in both the quarter and year to date. Coke shares were flat at midday.\n\nShares of Boeing (BA) were up around 1% after the firm reported a 25% increase in third-quarter earnings. The aircraft maker also raised its 2015 earnings and revenue guidance on the back of the strong results.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) has agreed to buy rival SanDisk (SNDK) for around $19 billion in cash and stock. The deal is expected to help Western Digital shore up its competitive position in the face of threats from solid state storage. \n\nShares of Yahoo! (YHOO) were down 4% this morning after the firm reported another disappointing quarter. Total revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs, or TAC, declined 8% relative to 2014, the worst top-line decline since Mayer took over as CEO. A 13% decline in search revenues was the primary cause of the weak results, which management blamed on increased TAC and investments in its new advertising platform, Gemini. We believe the company will be able to stabilize the results in the company's core business, but we remain skeptical that a turnaround will be successful or likely. On the expense side, the company has shown reasonable discipline, with improved expense leverage in the product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative line items.\n\nLike last quarter, the key question coming out of Chipotle's (CMG) third-quarter update was whether decelerating comparable sales trends were a function of difficult comparisons, disruption caused by the decision to pull carnitas from stores earlier this year, or more acute macro or competitive pressures. Although third-quarter comps of 2.6% (including a 1.9% increase in traffic and a 0.7% uptick in pricing) were in line with our model and consensus expectations, comments about comps for the quarter being the highest during July's buy one, get one free promotion, \"choppy\" traffic trends in October, guidance calling for fourth-quarter comps similar to third-quarter levels, and a 2016 outlook calling for comps in the low-single-digit range admittedly raise some concerns. Shares dropped 7% at midday.\nForeign Markets\nEuropean markets were higher today. The FTSE 100, Paris CAC and Germany’s DAX were up 0.1%, 0.5% and 0.9% respectively.\nAsian shares were mixed. The Shanghai Composite was down over 3%, the Hang Seng was down 0.4% while the Nikkei 225 rallied 1.9%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:26:25.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
