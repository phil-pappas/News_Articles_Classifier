Here are some of the best network providers for using your phone overseas, and some to avoid \nUsing a mobile phone abroad can be a stressful experience, thanks to \"roaming\" charges and the prospect of accidentally incurring a sizeable bill. \nDate roaming charges in Europe are due to be abolished in 2017, but for the time being it’s still worth seeking out the best deal. \nHere are three of the cheapest, and three of the most expensive, network providers for using a mobile overseas. \nThe weekly costs shown are for a customer who makes 50 minutes of calls, sends 50 texts and uses 250MB of data over seven days in Europe, with any daily fees included. \n• For money-saving tips, tricks and ideas, get our weekly round-up here \nCosts for the rest of the world depend on the provider and country's \"zone\". Some network providers offer \"bolt-ons\" and other deals for those travelling outside Europe, but roaming rates of 60-190p per minute for calls, 20-40p per text and £5-£9 per MB of data are common. \nEU regulations mean that providers have to adhere to certain rules when you travel to the EU or some associated countries. \nThese include a \"welcome\" text that lays out charges, adhering to pricing limits and imposing an initial cap of £41 on data roaming spending, after which your roaming will be switched off. \n= Three of the best = \nO2 - cost of a week in Europe: £19.93 \nWith O2 Travel, pay monthly customers in Europe can take advantage of a £1.99 daily charge for data usage up to 50MB, 5p per text to the UK and Europe and a 50p call connection charge to talk free for up to 60 minutes. Unused data is not carried over to the following day. \nFor the rest of the world, an initial spending cap of £43 should prevent accidental overspending, but don’t expect to get much for your money. \nBusiness customers are slightly better off, as the £7.50 24-hour worldwide data bolt-on can provide mobile internet access, although that sum buys anywhere from 2MB to 200MB, depending on the country. \nVodafone - cost of a week in Europe: £21 \nVodafone’s Euro Traveller option lets you take your UK minutes, texts and data with you for £3 a day, making it both straightforward and one of the cheapest options for European travellers. \nThe World Traveller package offers the same deal for certain countries worldwide, for a cost of £5 daily, but is open only to pay monthly and business customers. \nWith Vodafone Data Traveller you can also get 25MB of data per day across most areas of the world not covered by the World Traveller package, for a £5 daily charge. \nEE - cost of a week in Europe: £28 \nEE's Euro Pass provides unlimited calls, texts and a sizeable amount of data for just £4 a day. EE Extra customers also get inclusive minutes and texts in Europe as part of their plan. \nOutside Europe, EE’s zone-based roaming add-on packages provide a fuss-free way to call, text and use mobile data. The packages start at £6 a month for calling and texting and £5 a month for data, depending on the country. \nWith many other networks just offering roaming rates, EE is one of the few to make using a mobile outside Europe reasonably affordable. \n= Three of the worst = \nGiffGaff - cost of a week in Europe: £53 \nWhen you are out of the UK, GiffGaff deducts money from your airtime credit when you use your mobile, rather than adding it to a bill, so you will be able to spend only as much credit as you top up with. \nGiffGaff does not offer any international packages or offers, so you will be charged at its roaming rates. At £53, the cost of a week in Europe is not disastrous thanks to EU regulations, but using your phone in the rest of the world can quickly become unaffordable. \nTalkmobile - cost of a week in Europe: £58 \nTalkmobile sells itself as a \"value\" network, and in Britain its prices are rock-bottom, even if the firm's customer service hasn’t been well received. \nUnfortunately, outside the UK there are no international options to save money, so again you will be charged at roaming rates. In Europe data will cost you 19p per MB, while you'll pay 16p a minute for calls and 5p per text. Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) further afield and expect to pay up to £1.79 a minute for calls, 35p for a text and £7.50 per MB of data. \nTesco Mobile - cost of a week in Europe: £58 \nTesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) is yet another provider with no international add-ons available to make using a phone abroad a realistic proposition. \nYou might survive a week in Europe, paying similar roaming charges to Talkmobile and GiffGaff. However, if you plan to go any further, where the £40 data cap doesn't apply, data will set you back £8 per MB. That's on top of up to £1.49 a minute for calls and 40p per text. \n= Honourable mention = \nThree Mobile - cost of a week in Europe: £45.90/free \nThree Mobile’s Feel at Home offering is one of the best schemes available for using your mobile abroad if you’re going to one of the 18 countries covered, which include Spain, America and Hong Kong. In these destinations you’ll be able to use your data allowance at no extra charge, make free calls and texts to UK numbers and receive any calls or texts for free. \nOtherwise it will cost you 16.6p a minute to call, 5.2p per text, and £5 a day for internet access in Europe if you're a pay monthly customer, or 17.4p per MB if you're on pay as you go. Outside Europe and the Feel at Home countries, charges are considerably more, in line with other network providers. \n= Be wary of = \n• Spending limits: Network spending caps normally cover data only, so you are free to build up your bill with calls and texts. Caps are also very easy to remove, and should be taken off only if absolutely necessary. \n• Calling your voicemail: It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) probably won't cost the same as a regular call as there could be an extra charge, so make sure you read the fine print. \n• Specifics of data packages: Don’t buy loads of data hoping to last the week, only to find out that it doesn’t roll over to the next day. \n• Things not activating: Nearly all of these offers will require you to activate them, so don’t assume that when you travel your mobile provider will automatically switch on the correct package. \n• Country zones: Check precisely which countries are in each zone, or you might get a nasty surprise. Talkmobile, for instance, charges £7.50 per MB of data in Switzerland but 19p per MB in most of the rest of Europe. \n• Pay as you go: Contract customers often get access to much better bolt-ons and international deals. \nHave a question for our experts?
