Getty Images by Alan Tovey and Christopher Williams Volkswagen is set to be pushed deeper into crisis after it emerged that the carmaker is facing a record-breaking €40 billion ($62 billion) legal attack spearheaded by one of the world's top law firms.\nQuinn Emanuel, which has won almost $US50 billion for clients and represented Google, Sony and FIFA, has been retained by claim funding group Bentham to prepare a case for VW shareholders over the diesel emissions scandal. Bentham has recently backed an action by Tesco shareholders over the retailer's overstating of profits.\nThe pair are attempting to assemble a huge class action following what they call \"fundamental dishonesty\" at the German auto giant , which plunged the carmaker into crisis after it admitted using \"defeat devices\" to cheat pollution tests.\nThe admission has been hugely costly for shareholders after it wiped more than €25 billion off VW's stock market value. Recalls and fines worth tens of billions of euros more are also expected.\nNow Quinn Emanue l and Bentham are contacting VW's biggest investors - which include sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and Norway - to ask them to join the claim.\nVW has admitted that it fitted \"defeat devices\" to 11 million cars that allowed them to fraudulently pass pollution controls, though the company's senior management has insisted it was unaware of the practices.\nRichard East, co-managing partner of Quinn Emanuel in London, said: \"We estimate shareholders' losses could be €40 billion as a result of VW's failure to provide relevant disclosure [about defeat devices] to the market and gives rise to questions about fundamental dishonesty.\"\nLegal action would be pursued in Germany under its Securities Trading Act, according to Quinn Emanuel, which hopes to file the first wave of actions by February. The law firm will argue that VW's failure to reveal its use of defeat devices to shareholders constituted gross negligence by management.\n Mr East added that damages could be calculated from 2009 - when VW started fitting the devices to its engines - and that if investors had known about them they would not have held or traded in VW shares. \"We don't think it will be very hard to find shareholders who have suffered because of it,\" he said. \"Institutional investors will be under pressure from their own shareholders to act after the fall in VW shares.\"\nJeremy Marshall, chief investment officer at Bentham, said that bringing a joint action by institutional investors is a more effective way of suing VW.\n\"We have been in touch with a tremendous number of VW shareholders. We would not be able to get it up and running unless there was sufficient investor appetite,\" he said.\nMr Marshall said to fund the case, Bentham would look to get between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of any damages paid, adding that it would probably cost between €6 million and €7 millio, before it went anywhere near a courtroom.\nVW is largely controlled by two major investors, with Porsche holding 50 per cent and the German state of Lower Saxony controlling 20 per cent, and it is thought they are unlikely to sue over losses, with their own interests closely linked to VW's health.\nThe next-biggest shareholder is Qatar's state investment fund at 17 per cent, then stakes drop down to 2 per cent or below, among them Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Suzuki, Axa and Blackrock.", "external_links": ["http://www.quinnemanuel.com/"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:07:31.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
