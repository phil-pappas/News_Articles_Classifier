Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Misa Han Dan Gray has lived all 19 years of his life unscathed by a recession. The global financial crisis, the biggest economic calamity in his lifetime, was just a blip for him and his family. \"I knew it was happening, but it didn't really affect me. My dad's a lawyer, so it meant more business if anything.\"\nBut reality hit when early in 2014 he moved out of home and into a share house. He lasted 18 months before returning to the family nest, figuring he would rather save $500 week towards travelling overseas than spend it on living expenses.\n\"When I moved out, I made the decision to be financially independent,\" says Gray, who studies commerce and law at Sydney University. \"Obviously, when I moved back home, I don't have to buy meals or pay rent.\"\nGray is the first cohort of what has being loosely dubbed Generation Z – the younger siblings of Generation Y, born after 1995. While marketers are racing to define exactly how this generation will differ from the ones that came before it, one characteristic is already clear – they grew up through the best years of the economic boom and are coming of age just as the party is over.\n\"We could end up with what Thomas Piketty would describe as the 'Jane Austen world',\" says The Grattan Institute's John Daley. Supplied Between 1993 and 2010, real net national disposable income per capita increased more than 50 per cent. Now it's going backwards. The Reserve Bank of Australia thinks economic growth will be less than the long-term average of 3 per cent. For the federal government there is no surplus in sight and traditional career paths are being swiped away with the ease of a finger on an iPhone. Add all of this together and Gen Z might be the first generation since the Great Depression who will be economically worse off than their parents.\n\"We could end up with what Thomas Piketty would describe as the 'Jane Austen world',\" says The Grattan Institute's John Daley, painting a picture of Gen Z as characters in a 19th century novel where the only way to get ahead is by inheriting wealth – or marrying up.\nWealth gap has widened A few numbers illustrate his point. In the decade to 2014, the wealth gap in real terms – stripping out inflation – between a 20-year-old household and a 50-year-old household widened from $653,000 to $829,000. If incomes of young people were increasing strongly, Gen Z could hope to close the gap. But over the past 10 years the real income gap between these two groups widened too, from $28,000 in 2003 to $38,000 in 2014.\nNathan Feiglin, a student sitting his HSC exams who in his spare time writes code for apps and websites. James Brickwood Daley says we're not officially in Jane Austen's world, because longer life expectancy means people don't inherit wealth until they're 60 – unlike the teenagers in Pride and Prejudice . \"We're not in that world yet, basically because all the rich people are still alive.\" But more and more Baby Boomer and Gen X parents are bank-rolling their children well into their 20s.\n\"We would be particularly worried if the only way to get ahead is having rich parents,\" he says. \"That's why we really care about this intergenerational stuff.\"\nEvery generation is a product of economic circumstances. Those who lived through the Great Depression were thrifty types who made do. Baby Boomers rode on the waves of the prosperity of the long post-World War II boom. In the US the children of the Boomers, born in the late 1960s and 1970s and dubbed Generation X, are seen as unlucky – their careers were hit early by the dot-com bust and then again in middle-age when the global financial crisis caused unemployment to soar, while house prices crashed. In Australia Gen X were dealt a better hand: they hit the 1990s recession early in their careers but they built substantial wealth through the house price boom. Generation Y, now aged between 25 and 35, have started their careers with supercharged income in the midst of a mining boom.\nFor their hardworking parents, Gen Z might seem like narcissistic, over-indulged and unaware of how lucky they are with their smartphones and \"gap year\" overseas holidays.\nGen Z entrepreneur Indy Clinton shows off Adidas Supershell shoes on her Instagram feed. Supplied Angst on public show The moody teenage angst is on public show on online forum Reddit. Last week, as year 12 students were in the midst of their final exams, a thread questioning the point of getting the perfect 99.95 score took off, with more than 100 comments.\n\"A 99.95 doesn't guarantee a high-paying job anyway,\" one user wrote. \"You need lots of mummy and daddy's money to get into the [property] market,\" another wrote. \"The rich get richer, while the poor are stuck renting, never being able to save enough to climb out of poverty.\"\nBut prominent economist Saul Eslake, who has two children, thinks they have a point. The steep price increases of housing in Australia means the average net wealth gap between home owners and non-home owners nearly doubled between 1991 and 2011, to $900,000. Meanwhile, the home ownership rate for those younger than 45 has dropped by 10 per cent, to 55 per cent, he says.\n\"You put those things together and I think that's fairly compelling evidence there has been a significant redistribution of wealth from younger generation to older generations,\" says Eslake, who left Bank of America Merrill Lynch in June to run a consultancy in Tasmania .\n\"In some ways I'm surprised there aren't more angry young people because the older generation has rigged their housing market against them. But instead of marching on the street – 'What do we want? Affordable housing. When do we want it? Now!' – they are protesting by refusing to move out of their parents' homes,\" he says.\n\"Baby Boomer parents who are thinking about selling their house are less able to do that because they still have a 25-year-old living at home and they can't actually think about retirement.\"\nNot all wasting time But if you're one of those parents despairing at the thought of your teenagers turning into grown-ups bunkered down in their childhood bedrooms, take heart. They're not all wasting time on YouTube and Instagram. Many are teaching themselves business skills instead, attracting thousands of online \"followers\" and turning themselves into a product.\nCompared to today's teenagers, Gen Y grew up in an era of social media poverty – all they had was Facebook, Myspace and MSN Messenger. Gen Z has been immersed in a world of YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Tumblr. They've grown up in the shadow of Justin Bieber, who became a worldwide star when his homemade YouTube videos were discovered, and Evan Spiegel, the Snapchat co-founder and the world's youngest billionaire at age 25. Today anyone can launch a start-up with no capital and take unlimited shots at economic mobility. And that's helping Gen Z stumble upon entrepreneurial pursuits from a young age. They aren't simply out to get a job, they're looking to create one.\nApp developer Nathan Feiglin taught himself how to code at age 14 by watching YouTube clips. Now 17, he has already had two business ventures – World Burrow, an Airbnb-like platform that allows businesses to sublet their unused office space, and Sailr, an Instagram-like platform where users can buy and sell things. The only investment capital needed for either business was $20 for a website domain name.\n\"At the end of the day it comes down to our own willpower,\" Feiglin says when asked if it is possible for anyone to do what he does. \"I think the internet is something most people in Australia can do and once you're online there are masses of free training available.\"\nWhile optimistic, he also appreciates that as a budding technology entrepreneur he's competing in a global marketplace – and his next idea could be outdone by someone working in Sydney, San Francisco or Mumbai.\n\"It comes with the democratisation of education and taking advantage of cheaper labour overseas,\" he says.\nImportant to stay up to date \"Larger companies seem to be interested in off-shoring legacy development rather than the front-end development, in terms of jobs, so it's important to keep on staying up to date with your skills.\"\nInstagram model Indy Clinton, 18, fell into her job almost by accident, when she started posting random photos of herself walking her dog and exercising. By the time she had 20,000 followers, she started charging businesses $50 for one post featuring their product. Now brands like the McGrath Foundation, Coca-Cola, and Surf Dive 'n' Ski pay her up to $750 per post. (Having posed for a photo-shoot for AFR Weekend she swiftly posted two shots to Instragram . They already have more than 1000 \"likes\".)\n\"I'm normal like everybody else. I'm not like a wealthy celebrity posting photos of lifestyles that are impossible to achieve,\" Clinton says. \"Marketers and branders love that and I'll make it look natural, so it doesn't look like a sponsored post.\"\nLike Feiglin, she doesn't need to invest much money into creating her brand. \"It takes all of five minutes. It's all quite natural. I won't put on make-up. I'll just snap a photo and post a natural photo of me,\" she says.\nCompanies targeting the next generation of consumers are already moulding their marketing strategies to Gen Z's creative spirit. \"Traditional brands are encouraging co-creation,\" Mark McCrindle, a social researcher, says. \"McDonald's has 'Create your own burger'. Last summer, Coke had their 'Share a Coke' campaign, you had the different names. It's a very Gen Z approach.\nIn his 1964 book The Lucky Country , Donald Horne gave a damning assessment of how Australia's resource riches had meant Australians were un-resourceful people.\nOften taken by surprise \"Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second-rate people who share its luck,\" he wrote. \"It lives on other people's ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.\"\nPerhaps Gen Z will prove Horne wrong: a less-lucky generation, which is more creative, more entrepreneurial and minded to make its own luck. While adults like Daley and Eslake are worried about the youngsters' economic future, some youngsters are pretty chill. \"It's probably the first time I thought about it,\" Gray says when asked if he's worried about expensive housing. \"I have to buy a house eventually, but it's not like having a successful life is having a house by 25.\"\nShould Clinton's Instagram popularity fade, she's already thinking about plan B – a bit of travel and starting a blog. \"I guess it's a lot better than babysitting,\" she says. Feiglin's thinking about joining the start-up scene, where he hopes to \"learn a few more things\".\nAnd in a world that requires zilch capital, if their businesses fail, they can simply move on to the next-best thing.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "https://instagram.com/indyclinton"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:09:11.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
