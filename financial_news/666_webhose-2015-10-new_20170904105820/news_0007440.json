It then reported a second-quarter loss of 900.9 million riyals. \nThe company had attributed its woes to the premature booking of revenue from wholesale broadband leases and mobile promotional campaigns and has also made further changes to the way it accounts for some contracts and the depreciation of property and equipment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:03:23.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
