Rajiv did not respond to repeated calls and emails by Reuters for comment on Thursday, a day after he said that he still worked for Carlyle Group. \nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement on Wednesday it fined Rajiv, a former Indonesia investment banking head of UBS, S$434,912 ($313,857) in the 2012 insider trading case. \nThe MAS said Rajiv bought 1 million PT Bank Danamon shares in March 2012 through his wife's bank account in Singapore after he possessed price-sensitive and non-public information on a proposed acquisition of Danamon by Singapore's DBS Bank. \nDBS announced the proposed acquisition in April 2012 and MAS said Rajiv made a profit of S$173,965 from his insider trades when he was with UBS. Due to regulatory issues, DBS subsequently pulled the plug on the Danamon deal. \nThe MAS said Rajiv admitted breaking the securities law and paid MAS the civil penalty without court action. \n($1 = 1.3857 Singapore dollars) \n(Reporting by Anshuman Daga and Elzio Barreto; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Miral Fahmy) Read the original article on Reuters .
