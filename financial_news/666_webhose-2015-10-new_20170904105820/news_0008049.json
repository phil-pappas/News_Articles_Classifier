A previous deal was soundly rejected largely because it didn't eliminate a much-hated two-tiered pay system.\nThe new agreement gives raises to all workers and eliminates the two tiers over eight years.\nIf approved, the union will use the Fiat Chrysler deal as a template for talks with Ford and General Motors.
