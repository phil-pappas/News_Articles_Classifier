It said the charge would materially impact third-quarter results, which it reports on Oct. 29. New chief executive John Cryan on that day will announce a new strategy, widely expected to ratchet up the bank’s earlier attempts to cut costs and shed unwanted assets.\nCredit Suisse Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, who joined the bank in July, is expected to outline sharp investment banking cuts, as part of an effort to meet global capital rules and new Swiss bank-specific requirements. The bank is also thought to be readying a substantial capital increase to be unveiled alongside Mr. Thiam’s grand plan.\nA poll of investors by Goldman Sachs analysts found 91% expected the bank to raise more than 5 billion Swiss francs ($5.16 billion) in fresh capital.\nOn Thursday, in response to an article in the Financial Times that reported that Credit Suisse planned to raise an amount in line with that figure, the bank said: “we are conducting a thorough assessment of Credit Suisse’s strategy, evaluating all options for the group, its businesses and its capital usage and requirements.”\nStandard Chartered, under new chief executive Bill Winters, is also considering raising equity, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter. Standard Chartered is among U.K. banks most exposed to commodities and China, two markets under intense pressure in recent weeks. The bank could raise as much as $8 billion, according to Jefferies analyst Joseph Dickerson.\nAt Barclays, investment banking head Tom King last month told analysts the division is smaller but better positioned after a two-year process of going from being a balance sheet, revenue-focused investment bank “to a much more returns-based model.”\nHe said the bank saved costs by cutting back on managing directors, the highest internal rank below the most-senior executives, which typically includes division heads and trading desk managers. Barclays previously has said around 7,000 jobs in all will be cut in the unit.\nThe bank is set to name a new CEO within the next few months. Barclays officials say the post may go to a former investment banker, raising the likelihood of more structural tweaks.\nElsewhere, HSBC Holdings HSBC 0.54 % PLC previously has said it is ending relationships with hundreds of clients who weren’t making it enough money. In the third quarter, it continued a reduction of assets it loaded up on before the financial crisis, such as U.S. mortgage-backed securities.\nChief Executive Stuart Gulliver said in August that HSBC’s Global Banking & Markets business is “the right size” in terms making money and serving clients but that low-returning loans and other boom-time assets were eating up too much of the unit’s capital.\nMeanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC continues to slash jobs and pull out of countries covered by its investment bank. The bank cut several high level capital-markets jobs last month and assigned new responsibilities to sales head Scott Satriano, now head of financing & risk solutions, and Kieran Higgins, who took over flow sales in addition to being head of sales.\nThe British bank, 73% owned by the government, has taken the most-radical moves in moving out of investment banking to focus instead on lending to domestic businesses and households.\nWrite to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:39:00.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
