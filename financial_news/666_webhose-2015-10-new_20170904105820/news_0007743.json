Bloomberg Vale reported record iron-ore production, beating analyst estimates, as the world's biggest mining companies continue defying a collapse in prices by increasing output.\nIron-ore output rose 2.9 per cent to 88.2 million tonnes in the third quarter, compared with 85.7 million tonnes a year ago, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a statement on Monday. The result, which excludes third-party purchases and operations at a venture with BHP Billiton in Brazil, topped the 87.9 million tonne average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nickel and copper production missed forecasts.\nThe top three iron-ore producers - Vale, Rio Tinto and BHP - have pushed for capacity expansions that reduce production costs and squeeze smaller competitors. The resulting supply increase coincided with faltering demand, resulted in a glut that pushed down prices more than 70 per cent from a 2011 peak. The Brazilian company is reducing output from lower quality facilities and replacing it with more productive projects.\n\"Less efficient operations, including beneficiation plants in the Feijao, Jangada, Pico, Fabrica and Brucutu operations, totaling annual capacity of 13 million tonnes, were shut down in 3Q15,\" Vale said in the statement. \"Productivity gains in other operations partially offset the production stoppage.\"\nVale, also the world's largest nickel producer, said output for the industrial metal declined 0.7 per cent in the three months to September 30 to 71,600 tonnes, missing a 75,600-tonne analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg, amid shutdowns in Canada plants. Nickel production for the first nine months of 2015 advanced to 208,000 tonnes, or about 69 per cent of the company's 303,000-tonne target for the year. Copper production fell 5.3 per cent to 99,300 tonnes, missing all seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nIron ore delivered to China averaged about $US55 a tonne in the third quarter, compared with more than $US90 a tonne a year earlier, according to Metal Bulletin data, hurting revenue for producers. Vale, which last month slashed its dividend payment for 2015 to the lowest since 2006 amid diminishing profit, will release its financial results for the quarter on October 22.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:08:15.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
