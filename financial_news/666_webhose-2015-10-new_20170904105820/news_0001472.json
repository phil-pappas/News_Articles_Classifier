Lagarde had got it from an HSBC whistleblower. \nA few years later, it emerged that three members of Papaconstantinou's family had been on the list, but their names were excised and they escaped scrutiny. \nPapaconstantinou denied any wrongdoing but a court in March found him guilty of tampering with the data. \nAlexiadis on Friday said that the statute of limitations on the Lagarde list investigation was due to expire on December 31, but the government would take steps to extend the prosecution period by another year. \nHe added that the government was also poring through bank transfers and data on Greeks with property in London and yachts registered in the Netherlands in search of undeclared income. \n\"We are not going to cover up anything,\" Alexiadis said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:16:48.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
