The agreement brings an end to legal battles over the use of technology in mobile phones and Wi-Fi and of patents covering games for the Xbox video-gaming console and Windows products, Efe cited the two companies as saying in a joint statement. \"Google and Microsoft have agreed to collaborate on certain patent matters and anticipate working together in other areas in the future to benefit our customers,\" the companies said without disclosing financial terms. The legal battles began in 2010, when Microsoft accused Motorola, later acquired by Google, of non-compliance with its obligation to allow companies to license patents covering wireless networking and video technologies at a reasonable price. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo last year but kept some assets, including the majority of its patents.
