We think that's a perverse system. It's unfair,\" he told ABC radio. \nMr Shorten said that affected 3.5 million people, 60 per cent women. \nHe said the government should also consider increasing the superannuation guarantee rate, now set at 9.5 per cent. \n\"Will he (Mr Turnbull) back removing the taxpayer-funded subsidies that the really, really, really wealthy, people who already have millions in their superannuation currently receive,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Ten looks to MCN as losses, debt grow AAP \nTen Network anticipates a much needed boost to advertising revenue from its tie up with Foxtel after its full year …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:49:42.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
