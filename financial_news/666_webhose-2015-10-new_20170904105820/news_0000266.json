He said 53,000 women, representing 48 per cent of total beneficiaries, were trained in the production of soya, maize, vegetable, picking and processing of shear and provided small scale irrigation schemes for small scale farmers including women.\nHe said 646.2km of feeder roads have been constructed to link farms to marketing centres to enhance farmers' income. \nHe said these resource-poor farmers have been equipped with technology including technical assistance in climate change adaptation and disaster risk management practices that are required to be successful. \nThe sector Minister said the programme is supporting income alternative income generating activities to increase and diversify incomes at the household level while increasing access to markets for both agriculture and non-agricultural products. \nMs Sherry Ayittey, Minister of Fisheries said data indicate that more than 60 per cent of chronic hunger all over the world is experienced by female -headed households, and about five million children under the age of five die annually of malnutrition related causes. \nGhana health demographic survey (2014) indicated that 57, 1 per cent of the poorest households have their children under five stunted and malnourished while 62 per cent of these households are located in rural communities, which have serious implications for government's efforts to reduce hunger and arm the rural poor and the disadvantaged with the tools to effectively fight poverty in all its forms. \nShe said the fisheries sector provides livelihood support to more than 2.7 million of the population and also taken other policy initiatives to confront the issue of hunger, national food insecurity and breaking the cycle of poverty. \nThese include; supporting fishing communities to adapt to climate change practices, enhancing fish production particularly aquaculture, promoting alternative livelihood support programmes as social protection mechanisms to ensure sustainable income generation for rural poor fishing communities and investing in fisheries infrastructure. \nThe Ministry is also implementing nucleus out grower input support scheme that aims at enhancing domestic fish production by an additional 84,000mt by 2017, which is creating 900 direct jobs and more than 1830 indirect jobs for women, unemployed rural youth, fish processors and traders, she said. \nShe indicated that in 2015, the Ministry assisted fishing communities with 1,000 outboard motors to increase fish catch and income levels and with the support of FAO and Development partners the Ministry introduced the Thiaroye oven technology to fish processors and smoked fish exporters. \nIn order to reduce post-harvest losses and improve returns on investment for fishers in Ghana, six cold stores were constructed at Nyanyano, Korantse, New Takoradi, Prampram, Half Assini and Shama and fish processing plant is currently under construction at Elmina which by products would be used for the production of fish feed to boost Aquaculture fish production and create additional jobs for vulnerable fishing communities, she said. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:06:12.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
