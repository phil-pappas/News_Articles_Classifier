Peter Rae Share on twitter by Robert Harley The Sydney Fish Market and UrbanGrowth NSW have committed to work together to rejuvenate what is both a Sydney landmark and a key part of the state government's Bays Precinct urban renewal ambition.\nThe aim is to create, as a top priority, a \"re-imagined Sydney Fish Market\" as the centrepiece of a proposed Bays Market District on Blackwattle Bay.\nThe chief executive of UrbanGrowth NSW, David Pitchford, said a \"competitive process\" for the creation of The Bays Market District would start in 2016.\n\"UrbanGrowth NSW has an ambition to create a new, world-class market precinct and dining destination connected to the water in Blackwattle Bay, and centred around a rejuvenated Sydney Fish Market,\" he said.\nThe general manager of Sydney Fish Market, Bryan Skepper , said his aim was to maintain the authenticity of market – with its wholesale auction – and retail activity, while improving the amenity, upgrading the linkages to the city, and broadening the offer.\n\"Our ambition is to become a key tourist destination on the western edge of the central business district while also acting as a gateway to the future Bays Precinct,\" he said.\nThe Sydney Fish Market, which is controlled by two seafood industry groups, occupies a prime 3-hectare waterfront site on a 30-year lease .\nIn the past, it has attempted redevelopment on its own. A memorandum of understanding, signed on Monday, commits Urban Growth and the Fish Market to work together on the project.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@RobertHarleyAFR"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:10.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
