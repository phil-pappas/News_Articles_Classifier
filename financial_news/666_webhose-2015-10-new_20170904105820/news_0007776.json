Advertising Print This Post England and Premier League footballer, Ryan Bertrand, has joined two other founders, Louis Bell and Matthew Kirkham, to launch Silicon Markets. The new brokerage will be based in the City of London and offer trading on FX, indices and commodities with a number of platforms including MT4 and Tradable. The founders of Silicon Markets believe that they have a chance to disrupt the established retail brokerage industry by offering free Artificial Intelligence and machine learning software to traders. Details of the company’s new software will be announced on November 3, 2015 at the Finance Magnates’ London Summit , where Ryan Bertrand will also participate as a panel speaker discussing sports marketing. Louis Bell says, “Artificial intelligence and machine learning is increasingly popular in the institutional space and we are looking forward to bringing such effective new trading techniques to a retail audience for the first time. Silicon Markets has spotted an opportunity to do things differently whilst also widening the overall pool of retail traders. We hope to attract existing traders as well as those who wish to start trading for the first time.” Another way Silicon Markets plans to distinguish themselves is by using Ryan Bertrand’s network of fans, celebrities and sports stars to attract new traders to the market. They will capitalise on his high profile in order to create significant marketing opportunities which will help to establish and grow the brand. The new brokerage will initially focus on growing a strong UK client base, with a long-term goal of becoming a global player. Ryan Bertrand comments, “Silicon Markets has a revolutionary new business strategy based on ground-breaking technology and marketed via celebrities and sports stars. I am really excited about our potential to transform the retail trading industry and am proud of the synergies we are developing between finance and football; and how we are able to introduce the financial markets to an entirely new audience.” Partnership with One Financial Markets Silicon Markets is an Appointed Representative of One Financial Markets which is regulated by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) opening offices this year in London, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong . According to Andrew Henderson, Director at One Financial Markets, “As soon as we met the Silicon Markets team we saw the huge potential they have in our industry. Their ideas are new and show great initiative. We did not hesitate in offering them Appointed Representative status and are looking forward to helping them realise their potential.” Football sponsorship will be one of the major topics of discussion during the upcoming Finance Magnates’ Summit in London.
