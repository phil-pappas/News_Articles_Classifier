Jason Chaffetz is shaking up the race to succeed outgoing House Speaker John Boehner.\nUtah Republican Chaffetz, who leads the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday he was “recruited” by members displeased with the ascent of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , the favorite to succeed Boehner. The Washington Post writes Chaffetz’s remarks reflect tensions between conservatives and establishment Republicans, but also concerns about McCarthy’s ability to communicate with the Republican base and the public at large.\nMcCarthy retains considerable advantages in the speaker race, the Post writes. House Republicans will choose their nominee for speaker on Thursday. The speaker is later elected in a floor vote of all House members.\nScalise says he has votes: Rep. Steve Scalise is telling House members he’s got the votes to be the next majority leader locked up . The Louisiana Republican, now the majority whip, is competing against Rep. Tom Price of Georgia for the No. 2 leadership position. Roll Call writes Scalise held a call with committed supporters Sunday night to tell them he is well beyond having a majority of the Republican conference behind him. There are rumors, meanwhile, that Boehner could delay the majority leader and majority whip elections until McCarthy wins the speaker post.\n‘Deeply distressing’: Hillary Clinton says McCarthy’s comments about the committee investigating the Benghazi attacks were “deeply distressing” because they dishonor the Americans who died. McCarthy said last week the committee probing the attacks on the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city should be credited for Clinton’s slide in presidential polls. Yahoo News has more on Democratic front-runner Clinton, who told MSNBC in an interview shown Sunday that McCarthy’s statement “demonstrates unequivocally that this was always meant to be a partisan political exercise.” Clinton is scheduled to testify before the Benghazi committee on Oct. 22.\nAlso read: Democrats rip McCarthy for linking Benghazi probe to Clinton’s polling .\nTrade deal nears: The Wall Street Journal reports that the U.S. and 11 countries around the Pacific have completed a sweeping trade agreement . That agreement, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, will lower barriers to goods and services and set commercial rules for two-fifths of the world’s economy. As the Journal writes, resolving final differences in the pact sets the stage for debates within national legislatures, with the U.S. Congress likely posing the biggest challenge. Under existing rules, the deal couldn't go to a vote before Congress until early next year.\nOil-export vote: Attention, energy-watchers: The House this week is expected to bring to the floor a bill that would repeal the decades-old federal ban on crude-oil exports . As National Journal writes, the repeal effort has picked up support in recent months, including from House Speaker John Boehner. But it still faces an uncertain future in the Senate.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/04/chaffetz-formally-announces-bid-for-house-speaker/", "https://www.yahoo.com/politics/hillary-clinton-calls-mccarthys-benghazi-172627073.html", "http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/scalise-has-votes-win-majority-leader-race/?dcz=", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/s/74321/outlook-defense-oil-export-bills-moving-forward"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:08:15.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
