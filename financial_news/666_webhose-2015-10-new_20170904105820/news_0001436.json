Louie Douvis by Kate Cowling In a market where equities are looking volatile and bonds are offering little in the way of returns, it makes sense for investors to seek out assets, such as infrastructure, that occupy the middle ground.\nInfrastructure has long been difficult for retail investors to access, however in the past 12 months a few new vehicles have emerged to broaden the choice.\nOne of the recent entrants is Argo, which debuted its global infrastructure LIC (AGLI) in July after raising $286 million.\nFocused on global listed infrastructure securities from a universe of about 350 companies, the LIC owns stakes in airports, water, pipelines, railways, ports, satellites, toll roads, phone towers and electricity, gas and renewable energy utilities.\nAndy Forster, a senior investment officer at Argo Investments, says the fund charges a flat fee of 1.2 per cent a year and no performance fee.\nForster highlights the global breadth of its portfolio as a key advantage.\n\"It is appealing to investors as it provides diversification in assets that are not readily available in Australia outside a handful of infrastructure and utility stocks,\" Forster says.\n\"A number of these overseas companies are significantly cheaper and offer more attractive growth prospects than the Australian listed options.\"\n Another Australian fund manager, Bennelong, has also branched out with its own infrastructure offering, 4 Corners Infrastructure, which again focuses on listed infrastructure securities but with a diversified portfolio of 30 to 60 stocks.\n'A very nice defensive haven' \"Listed infrastructure is a great middle ground,\" says Sarah Shaw, global portfolio manager and chief investment officer at 4 Corners. \"There's a low correlation to the broader equity market.\n\"It becomes a very nice defensive haven for what we consider a falling market, and that is partly supported by resilience or regulated earnings streams, as well as a nice yield … [but] we want our portfolio to be positioned so it can capture the growth in strong markets.\"\nMagellan Financial Group and RARE Infrastructure have similar retail offerings, with diversified portfolios covering a pool of global infrastructure companies.\nMagellan's product covers about 20 to 40 securities, for a management fee of 1.05 per cent and performance fee of 10 per cent. Its top holdings include American Water Works, Atlantia SpA, Crown Castle, Enbridge Inc, Flughafen Zurich, ITC Holdings and National Grid.\nMelbourne based-RARE Infrastructure has 37 securities and has a fee of 1 per cent. It has recently favoured Spark Infrastructure, CrownCastle and National Grid.\nFor those who want to buy shares directly, there are a several options with the same characteristics – of monopolistic competition and longer-term growth – listed on the ASX. Companies include toll road company Transurban (TLC), Sydney Airport Holdings (SYD), Auckland International Airport (AIA) and Spark Infrastructure (SKI).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:04:56.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
