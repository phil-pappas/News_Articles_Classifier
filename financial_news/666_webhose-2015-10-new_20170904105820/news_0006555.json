The credit union was ranked 12th on the list of the nation's credit unions with assets between $500 million and $1 billion.\nThe list includes 45 institutions out of more than 6,500 credit unions nationwide. No other credit union in South Florida made the list.\nTo come up the list, the magazine evaluates each credit union's workplace policies, practices and demographics and then surveys employees.\n\"Receiving this honor every year it has been awarded is a strong endorsement of the family-focused culture that has been an integral component of Power Financial Credit Union's guiding principles for more than 65 years,\" said President and CEO Allan M.
