Goldman Sachs forecasts the S&P 500 will return to 2,000 at the end of the year after suffering its steepest drop in four years in the third quarter. \nBut analysts expressed alarm over Friday's jobs report. The Labor Department estimated the US economy added just 142,000 jobs in September, well below analyst estimates of 205,000. The government also trimmed its estimates for jobs added in July and August. \nThe jobs report \"would indicate fairly strongly the US economy is slowing more significantly than expected,\" said Hugh Johnson of Hugh Johnson Advisors. \n\"The word 'recession' is starting to come into the dialogue.\" \nGregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Capital Markets, said the weak jobs report added to other lackluster data points, such as an Institute for Supply Management reading that showed near-flat manufacturing activity in September. \n\"We are beginning to understand why (Fed Chair) Janet Yellen was scared to raise interest rates\" at the September policy meeting, Volokhine said. \nNot all of the week's US economic data was bad. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose in September to 103.0 from 101.3 the prior month, beating market expectations for a sharp drop in confidence. \nIn another positive sign, September auto sales from carmakers showed US autos continued to be bought at brisk pace. Lightweight vehicle sales in September jumped 15.8 percent from a year ago to 1.44 million, lifting the pace of sales to the fastest since July 2005, according to Autodata. \n- Rising eurozone, China gloom - \nBut data outside the US continued to paint a gloomy picture overseas, raising worries of contagion. \nChina's crucial industrial companies saw profits fall 8.8 percent in August from a year ago, while eurozone inflation again slipped into negative territory (-0.1 percent) in September. \n\"There's a lot of fear in the market,\" Volokhine said. \nIn corporate news, Alcoa announced plans to split itself into two companies, one focused on upstream mining and smelting and the other on manufacturing aluminum products to supply industries including aerospace and auto manufacturing. \nIn other deal news, Energy Transfer Equity said it would acquire the Williams Companies for about $37.7 billion to create a giant in US oil and gas pipelines, while data-storage company Western Digital announced that Chinese technology company Unisplendour Corporation will pay $3.78 billion for a 15 percent stake in the US company. \nRalph Lauren, the 75-year-old founder of his namesake company, announced he would step aside as chief executive and hand over the top executive post to Stefan Larsson, global president of the Old Navy brand for Gap. \nNext week's calendar includes a handful of early earnings reports, including PepsiCo, Alcoa and Monsanto. \nKey economic reports include the ISM reading of services sector activity for September, US trade data for August and the minutes from the September Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook US stocks end week higher despite rising gloom AFP \nWall Street stocks closed the week on a positive note thanks to a late-afternoon rally Friday, but a weak US jobs â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:28:54.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
