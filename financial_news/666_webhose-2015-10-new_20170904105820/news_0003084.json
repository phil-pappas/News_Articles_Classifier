We launched the first of these experiences last week with Moments, a great beginning, and a bold peek into the future of how people will see what’s going on in the world,” he said.\nDorsey said the “roadmap is also a plan to change how we work, and what we need to do that work”.\nHe added that product and engineering are going to make the most significant structural changes to reflect the microblogging company’s plan ahead.\nTwitter brought back Dorsey two weeks back with a hope that he would be able to resolve financial problems and boost profits.\n 13, 2015 9:02 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:45:52.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
