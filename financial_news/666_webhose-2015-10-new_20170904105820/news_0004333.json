Twenty-six years ago this week, the film Back to the Future Part II depicted October 21, 2015 – today – as a day when people would travel in flying cars powered by compact fusion reactors, kids would scoot by on hover boards and families would watch holographic movies.\nIn the past week, there has already been plenty of commentary about which inventions dreamt up by the film's director, Robert Zemeckis, and writer Bob Gale, have come true (Large flat-screen TVs, yes, flux capacitors, no).\nWe have acheived this in 2015: Video calling in the 1989 film Back to the Future II Photo: Supplied\nPerhaps the bigger question is: if Back to the Future Part II set up a technological measuring stick in 1989 for what things could or should look like today, how is the future looking from here?\nAdvertisement Since Michael J. Fox starred as Marty McFly in the second instalment of the trilogy, cheap, ubiquitous computing has reshaped the world. The internet has transformed societies, helping depose leaders, and redirect national conversations. Advances in medical science have continued apace. GPS has become a given and even satellite launches, once a matter of wonder, are routine.\n\"Some technologies of the past 30 years have far exceeded all expectations,\" Denny Oetomo, a robotics professor from the University of Melbourne, says.\nElectronic glasses in Back to the Future II, but the double ties never caught on. Photo: Supplied\nBut Oetomo notes that in other areas, technological innovation has disappointed.\nMass market innovations in batteries remain scarce. Without rapid advances in fuel cells, other inventions are impossible. There has been no major innovation in transportation. Cars run on the same petrol they did in 1989.\n\"We haven't quite taken care of our environment,\" Oetomo said. \"We're still burning fossil fuels. We're still on coal.\"\nThe future wasn't all bad as depicted in 1989. Michael J Fox in Back to the Future Part II. Photo: Supplied\nIf Back to the Future Part II forms a measure to judge ourselves by, viewing the film today begs the question whether in 2015 – the real 2015 – we're on track to develop the needed technology to face the challenges in the new century.\nThat's a question Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been wrestling with. In announcing his new cabinet last month, he warned that if Australia wants to \"remain a prosperous, First World economy \" it must be more competitive and more productive. \"Above all we must be more innovative.\"\nSwinburne University of Technology innovation lecturer Bert Verhoeven​ says technological advancement hasn't run out of steam.\nBack to the Future – the trilogy played with time and depicted a positive 2015. Photo: Supplied\n\"I am an optimist and believe that the idea machine has not broken down yet.\"\nYet the debate about the pace of innovation rests on how much impact future advancements will have compared with those of the past.\n\"Do, for example, future innovations like virtual reality, self-driving cars, genetics or personal robots have more or less influence on how we live than innovations from the past like electricity, the combustion engine or the telephone?\"\nMarty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his hover board.

These more dystopian films \"ask us to be hesitant and philosophical in shaping that future that lies ahead\".\nSome technology thinkers, noting the trend toward the dystopian, have begun a more conscious embrace of positive science fiction. It's not just \"where is my flying car?\" But where is the hope and expectation of a flying car? Or a colony on Mars? Or transportation that is clean, efficient and doesn't damage the environment? In other words: the big, risky projects that challenge humanity and come with big rewards.\nNo less a figure than Elon Musk, the man behind SpaceX and Tesla, has been reading \"semi-utopian\" sci-fi. In honour of late author Iain M. Banks, who conjured highly evolved, post-scarcity worlds, Musk had the names of sentient spacecraft from his books painted on SpaceX's drone ships. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg has also put Banks' work on his reading list.\nBut the trend in sci-fi films is still overwhelmingly negative. In this climate, Back to the Future Part II 's real value today, may not be the many inventions it nearly got right, but the fact that the film envisioned the world to come as a positive place.\nThe optimism may be a relic of the 1980s but something the public may need today to confront the challenges of the future.\nUniversity of Melbourne Professor Angela Ndalianis and Dr Denny Oetomo will present Back to the Future II at a special screening at Hoyt's Melbourne Central on Wednesday.\nFollow Chris on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/peter-thiel-scolds-hollywood-negative-448470", "http://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/Ministry", "http://mentalfloss.com/uk/movies/25637/back-to-the-future-ii-technologies-becoming-a-reality", "https://www.facebook.com/chriszapponepublic", "http://boingboing.net/2012/02/15/neal-stephenson-on-getting-big.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:19:09.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
