Using technology like blockchain would enable banks to transfer funds and data via a system that avoids reliance on central banks. \nThe blockchain works as a decentralised ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made, with the transactions verified and shared by a global network of computers. \n\"I think blockchain is an opportunity for banks to learn together about something that could have a very significant impact on our business in future years. It could be a virtual banking system,\" NAB CEO Andrew Thorburn said in a speech to the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce yesterday. \nWhile Australia's banks have been eager to investigate the impact of the technology in the finance sector, they have been less willing to invest the same amount of time and money into Bitcoin itself. \nLast month it was revealed Australia's major banks were closing accounts of Bitcoin companies in response to tougher rules on money laundering and terrorism finance. \nThe move put at least 13 digital currency providers out of business, according to the Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA). \n\"The current bitcoin operating model requires very tough compliance and assurance requirements to ensure we meet the high standards required under anti-money laundering regulations,\" a Westpac spokesman said at the time. \n\"We continue to monitor developments in bitcoin, including their regulation.\" Copyright Â© iTnews.com.au .
