PUBLISHED: 11:18, Mon, Oct 26, 2015 | UPDATED: 11:49, Mon, Oct 26, 2015 GETTY Aldi is increasing staff pay from February 2016 \nIn London, staff are to be paid at least £9.45 an hour. \nThe budget grocer has said the wage rise, which is above the ‘living wage’ will take effect from February 1 2016. \nAldi already pays all its store assistants at least £8.15 an hour and more than £9 per hour on average. \nUnlike some other supermarkets, Aldi also gives employees paid breaks. \nIt comes as Aldi continues to win customers from Britain's largest supermarkets. \nThe company has recently opened its 600th UK store, in Cardiff. And has also announced plans to recruit and train more than 600 apprentices over an 18-month period starting in January 2016, to support its UK expansion. \nMatthew Barnes, Aldi UK and Ireland chief executive, said: \"The success of Aldi in the UK and Ireland has been driven by the commitment, hard work and ambition of our employees and we will continue to maintain our leading position on pay.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:57:54.247+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
