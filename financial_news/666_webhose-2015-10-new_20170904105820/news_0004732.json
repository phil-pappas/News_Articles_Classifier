As a former head of Marks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSF - news ) , Britain's biggest clothing retailer, he will add a strong voice to the view among many big British businesses that the country is better off in the bloc than out. \nMany UK companies are worried about the possibility of losing easy access to their main export markets and there are also concerns about the impact on Britain's financial services industry if Britons vote to leave the EU. \nOn the other side, a group of business leaders and lawmakers launched a campaign this week to persuade Britons to vote to leave the bloc. Prime Minister Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's ties with the 28-member bloc before holding the referendum.
