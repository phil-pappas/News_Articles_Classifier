If you pay your rent on time, save 20% of your salary every month, use your debit card for all of your transactions and shun all forms of credit, you would not have a credit score. And credit scores are not just used for borrowing. In most states, auto insurance companies also use your credit score to determine your premium.According to recent analysis by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there are 26 million \"credit invisible\" individuals, who have no information on their credit reports and therefore have no score. An additional 19 million consumers do not have sufficient information on their credit reports in order to have a credit score generated. In order to have a FICO score , you generally need to have at least one account that reports to a credit reporting agency and is at least six months old. In addition, you need to have at least one account with activity in the last six months.Just remember that you do not need to borrow money in order to have a FICO score. You just need to have a statement balance. If you use your credit card and pay your statement balance in full and on time every month, you would not be hit with any interest expense from most credit cards. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to borrow money and pay interest to get a score.Credit scoring companies, like FICO, have been under pressure from both regulators and banks to find a way to provide a reliable credit score for the millions of Americans without a score. FICO has responded by partnering with Equifax and LexisNexis Risk Solutions to create FICO XD. This new credit score will look at cable, utility and cell phone payment history to generate a score. The credit score is meant to reward people who pay their bills on time, even if they do not have a traditional credit card or other credit account.FICO has been testing the new score with a number of banks. According to the Wall Street Journal, 35% - 50% of people who have been scored with FICO XD have received a credit score above 620. A lot of people have the potential to benefit from the new credit score. Here are five things you need to know. 1. FICO XD does not replace the traditional FICO scores If you have enough information in your credit report to have a traditional FICO score, FICO XD does not apply to you. In fact, the goal is to graduate people from FICO XD to a traditional score. 2. You will want a copy of your Equifax and Lexis Nexis reports I encourage everyone to obtain a free, annual copy of their credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com . The information in your credit reports is used to generate your FICO score. The new FICO XD will be based upon information provided by utility companies to a separate database. Just like traditional credit bureaus, the utility database will likely contain errors and personal vigilance will be required. 3. The same score range applies to FICO XD FICO has created the same score range, from 300 - 850. And the expected default rate by score band is supposed to be the same. So, a 750 is an excellent score, whether you have a FICO 8 or a FICO XD score. 4. Secured Cards are still the easiest ways to build a credit score. You do not need to wait for FICO XD. Building a credit score is still relatively easy, especially with a secured credit card. Even if you have no credit history, you can generally open a secured card. Typically, you will give your bank a deposit, and the credit limit will be based upon that deposit. The bank reports the account like a credit card to credit reporting agencies. If you make one small purchase each month, and pay your statement balance on time and in full every month, you will be able to build a good credit history. You should have a traditional score after six months. Check with your local credit union for a good secured card. I have listed some of the best in the country at my website, MagnifyMoney . 5. FICO XD is still just in test mode. Building and validating a new credit score takes time. FICO is working with its banking partners to validate the data. FICO and the banks seem impressed with the early reads, and we can expect a wider roll-out to come soon. However, for now, the score is not yet widely available. 6. FICO XD might not be available for free. According to the New York Times , FICO has not yet decided if it will make this score available for free. We will have to wait and see.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/your-money/new-credit-score-systems-could-open-lending-to-more-consumers.html?_r=0", "https://www.annualcreditreport.com/index.action", "http://www.myfico.com/Downloads/Files/myFICO_UYFS_Booklet.pdf", "http://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/building-credit/best-secured-cards-2014", "http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201505_cfpb_data-point-credit-invisibles.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:12:31.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
