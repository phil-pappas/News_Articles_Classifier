With no immediate threat from the Federal Reserve about raising interest rates this year we feel that the momentum is here to stay for the commodity.\nSo investors can try a short-term play using a momentum strategy to add substantial returns to their portfolio. As a caveat, this is a purely speculative strategy and not meant for risk-averse players.\n\nWith volatility slated to persist in the broader market til 2016 – the election year – we feel energy stocks that have already has taken substantial hits can only witness an upward momentum. So it will be prudent to invest in stocks from this sector that have shown an upward trend in price.\n\nCrude Momentum \n\nThe Persian Gulf-based members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) demand forecast of 1.5 million barrels growth in daily crude this year had a positive impact on global oil prices. Apart from that, the heightening of geopolitical tensions after Russia’s willingness to accidentally expand the Syrian civil unrest in Iran through misplaced missiles increased the risk of supply disruption over the long run.\n\nAs an immediate outcome, both global benchmarks West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Crude futures are now trading around the $50 per barrel mark, reviving market optimism on continued momentum.\n\nAs a result, Thursday witnessed the Energy Select Sector SPDR XLE gaining almost 2.0%. Big oil components like Chevron Corporation CVX rose 2.03%, ConocoPhillips COP increased 1.83% and Royal Dutch Shell plc RDS.A advanced 1.66%\n\n5 Momentum Picks \n\nThe basic driver of a momentum trader is an investing strategy that seeks to capitalize on market volatility.
