Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.) are circulating a letter to House leaders, obtained by The Hill, \"to raise concerns regarding legislative proposals that would reduce dividend payments on required Federal Reserve stock.” \nThe more than 90 House Republicans and 40 House Democrats who have already signed the letter want to stop any Congressional talk of lowering the rate \"until there is greater examination of the issue and an understanding of the implications that such a statutory change might have on the banking system.\" \nHouse Financial Services Committee chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) requested the non-partisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the issue. \nShortly after the Fed was created in 1913, Fed officials incentivized banks to join the federal system by requiring them to invest in the central bank with a guaranteed 6 percent interest rate. \nFor decades, the stock purchase has been used as a way for banks to become invested in the U.S. banking system. \nLawmakers were successful at thwarting a similar measure in the Senate in July. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) wanted to lower the rate to 1.5 percent. \nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen raised concerns about the issue in July when she testified before the Senate Banking Committee. \n\"I would be concerned that reducing the dividend could have unintended consequences for banks’ willingness to be part of the Federal Reserve system — and this might particularly apply to smaller institutions,\" Yellen said. \nYellen, who President Obama appointed, said that lowering the rate could pose a threat to small community banks. \n\"[It] would likely be a significant concern to the many small banks that receive this dividend,\" she said in the July hearing. \"This is a change to the law the could conceivably have unintended consequences and I think it deserves some serious thought and analysis.\" \n\"Until GAO completes its work and the congressional committees of jurisdiction have an opportunity to review the significant public policy questions at issue, we believe that changes to the Federal Reserve dividend rate are premature,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter, which was sent to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:02:31.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
