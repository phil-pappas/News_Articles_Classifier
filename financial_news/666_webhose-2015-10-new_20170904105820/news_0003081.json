If the police establish there has been illegal activity it will further strengthen our suit,\" the organisation said in a statement. \n- No charge for customers - \nStruggling to restore confidence, VW said it would be \"pro-active in approaching and informing customers\" of the recall operation. \nAlready from the beginning of October, every VW customer had been able to use the company's website to check whether their vehicle was affected, simply by typing in the car's number. \nA similar function was also available on the websites of the company's other brands of Audi, SEAT and Skoda. \n\"Rectifications of the vehicles will begin from January 2016 and will be free of charge for our customers,\" VW said. \nThe solutions could involve both software and hardware measures. \nUntil the changes could be undertaken, \"every vehicle remains technically safe to drive,\" VW insisted. \nEarlier, the German authorities tightened the screws on the embattled carmaker, saying it would monitor the large-scale recall across the country in order to ensure that it is indeed carried out. \nTransport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told journalists in Berlin that the Federal Transport Authority KBA had given VW until the end of October to come up with the technical solution for the two-litre diesel engines, where a simple software change would suffice. \nFor the 1.2-litre and 1.6-litre engines, the carmaker had until the end of November to present its solutions. \nThe company has set aside 6.5 billion euros in the third quarter, but its new chief executive Matthias Mueller said that would likely only meet repair costs. \nIn addition to the costs of repairing so many vehicles, the once-respected automaker now faces billions of euros (dollars) in potential fines and legal costs, not to mention the still incalculable fallout in terms of lost sales and customer trust. \n- 'Constructive cooperation' - \nEarlier, the mass-circulation daily Bild had claimed the German authorities were running out of patience with VW and felt the carmaker's own proposals for a voluntary recall were insufficient. \nBut Dobrindt later told reporters that VW was cooperating \"constructively.\" \nTies between politicians and the auto industry are traditionally very close in Germany and politicians have been reluctant to attack VW openly since the scandal broke, as it is seen as a flagship of German industry and is a major employer. The regional state of Lower Saxony where VW is headquartered holds a stake in the group. \nMueller said last week that the recall would begin in January and take the rest of the year to complete, angering groups such as environmental campaigners Greenpeace for taking too long. \nBut Dobrindt confirmed the timetable on Thursday, not least because the technical solutions for the 1.2 and 1.6 litre engines would only be ready for installation in September 2016. \nAside from the millions of vehicles affected in Germany, more than one million could be hit in Britain and nearly a million in France. \nAccording to the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, as many as 30 VW managers could be implicated in the affair but VW dismissed that number, insisting that only a \"small group of people\" were involved. \nBut the scandal could also have wider repercussions for the German economy as a whole and its pristine engineering reputation, some experts fear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:41:03.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
