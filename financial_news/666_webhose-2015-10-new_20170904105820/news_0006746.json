That honour has now passed to emerging markets. Yet their difficulties are likely to impede what has in any case been an insipid recovery, making it harder for the euro zone to clamber out of deflation.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) was not expected to announce extra monetary stimulus when its governing council met in Malta on October 22nd (after The Economist had gone to press). But many economists think it will act within a few months, maybe as early as December. The ECB’s most likely response would be to extend its programme of quantitative easing (QE)—creating money to buy mainly public assets—beyond September 2016, when it is currently scheduled to end.\nIn this section Cracking the vault Out of fashion Funny numbers Dwindling dollars Deleveraging delayed Under threat State raid Putting Goldilocks to work Reprints\nUntil clouds gathered over China and emerging markets over the summer, the economic weather had appeared to be brightening. The euro zone’s output grew at an average rate of 0.4% a quarter between late 2014 and mid-2015. That was no showstopper but marked an improvement on the anaemic growth of the previous 18 months.\nThe recovery has also been broadening. It was initially led by Germany, which makes up nearly 30% of euro-zone GDP. More recently it has been bolstered by surprisingly strong growth in Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-biggest economy. Now Italy, the third-biggest and long comatose, is showing signs of life.\nHowever, the French economy, the second-biggest, is still at best hobbling along. And the overall pace of recovery in the euro area remains disappointing given the strong stimulus it has been receiving. One fillip has been the fall in oil prices, which has acted in much the same way as a tax cut for both consumers and businesses. A second has been QE, which the ECB has been conducting since March, buying €60 billion ($68 billion) of assets a month. That has helped exporters in particular by keeping the euro low.\nExplore our interactive guide to Europe's troubled economies\nExports to emerging markets may now slow, despite the competitive advantage of a cheap currency. These account for 25% of the euro zone’s exports, and around 30% of those of Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Germany’s success in exporting to China, which alone accounts for almost 7% of its exports, is now a source of vulnerability. Because of its prowess in manufacturing capital goods, the German economy has been a perfect match for the investment-driven growth of China. But China’s growth is both slowing and rebalancing from investment and towards services.\nAlready there are warning signs. German exports fell sharply in August compared with July, while manufacturers’ new orders also declined. In the euro zone as a whole industrial output also fell in August month-on-month, by 0.5%. Instead of quickening the recovery may slow; economists at Barclays are forecasting GDP growth of 0.3% in the third quarter.\nThat will make it harder for the ECB to get inflation back to its objective of nearly 2%. After a few months of merely very low inflation, the euro area experienced deflation again in September. The relapse will be fleeting, since the big falls in energy prices late last year will soon drop out of the annual numbers. But the euro area still looks likely to experience very low inflation next year—an unhappy prospect for the vulnerable countries such as Portugal that are weighed down by excessive public and private debt.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20151024_FNP001_0.jpg", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/2013/07/articles/body/20110212_wom539_290.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:22:52.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
