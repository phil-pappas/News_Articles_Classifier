SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud is a private, secure cloud fully managed by SAP and supported by global partners, and is offered for companies that run mission-critical applications in the cloud. SAP plans to use the NTT/Dimension Data Cloud Platform, NTT DATA’s broad range of comprehensive managed services using SAP® applications, and NTT Communications’ premium-grade IT infrastructure services. The initial focus is on South Africa and the Asia Pacific region with the goal to expand availability of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud globally. With this agreement, NTT becomes one of the select few partners delivering cloud infrastructure for SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud. In May this year, Dimension Data and NTT DATA announced that they had partnered to deliver a new set of end-to-end services that help clients leverage the agility and cost advantages of moving their SAP applications to the cloud. NTT DATA is now in a position to leverage Dimension Data’s Managed Cloud Platforms ™ (MCPs) located in over 16 countries across five continents, and to offer a comprehensive managed service for customers running their applications on SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud. NTT Communications, also a wholly owned subsidiary of NTT Group, provides premium-grade IT infrastructure services, such as data center services “Nexcenter,” cloud services “Enterprise Cloud,” global network services “Arcstar Universal One,” and high-capacity network connections between data centers around the world. Brett Dawson, Group CEO, Dimension Data said, “Our cloud strategy is focused on being the platform of choice for production workloads in the enterprise. SAP ERP is one of the most prominent applications for running production workloads in the market. Our goal is to offer SAP the mission-critical service levels required for SAP cloud customer environments, and this agreement enables us to further address a rapidly developing market segment.” Kaz Nishihata, executive vice president, NTT DATA said, “The premium partnership for SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud is yet another key step to further formalize our strategic relationship with SAP. We will continue to help our clients to get an end-to-end solution through this agreement. We will also pursue synergies combining each other’s strengths, and promote collaborations for developing new business opportunities in cloud business and new solution development.” Kevin Ichhpurani, SAP executive vice president, head of Business Development and Strategic Ecosystem said, “NTT Group provides SAP with a critical component of enterprise-grade cloud services and extensive geographic coverage from world-class carrier and data centers. This creates a compelling value proposition for NTT and SAP’s customers relying on SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud for their mission-critical applications.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:23:50.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
