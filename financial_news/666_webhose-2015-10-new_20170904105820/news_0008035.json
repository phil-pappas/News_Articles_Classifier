Revenue fell short of forecasts, due largely to negative foreign currency impact, and P&G also reported a slight drop in organic sales due to exits from unprofitable businesses. \nWhirlpool — The appliance maker earned an adjusted $3.45 per share for its latest quarter, 16 cents above estimates. However, revenue missed forecasts, with the company mentioning challenges in some of its emerging markets. Whirlpool also cut the top end of its 2015 earnings forecast, now expecting $12.00 to $12.50 per share compared to the prior top end of $13.00 per share. \nAmerican Airlines Group — The airline earned an adjusted $2.77 per share for its third quarter, five cents above estimates, with revenue in line. Like other airlines, American is benefiting from a large drop in fuel prices. \nState Street — The investment firm earned an adjusted $1.16 per share for the third quarter, seven cents below estimates, though revenue was essentially in line. The company also announced it would cut 200 to 600 jobs, and announced a multiyear restructuring designed to save about $500 million per year. \nVF Corp. — The maker of North Face and other popular brands missed on both the top and bottom lines, in what the company is calling a \"mixed retail environment.\" It also forecast full-year profit that falls shy of Street estimates. \nApple — Citi removed Apple from its U.S. Focus List, although it maintains a \"buy\" rating. It had put Apple on that list in late August prior to the iPhone 6s launch, and said all the events it foresaw in making that move have now played out. \nAlphabet — Alphabet beat estimates by 14 cents with quarterly profit of $7.35 per share, and the newly renamed Google parent also registered better than expected revenue. The company also announced a $5 billion stock repurchase program. \nAmazon.com — Amazon reported a profit of 17 cents per share, compared to an expected loss of 13 cents per share. It was the second straight quarterly profit for the online retail giant, which also beat on the top line and was helped by strong growth at its Web Services segment.\n\nMicrosoft — Microsoft profit came in eight cents above estimates at an adjusted 67 cents per share, with revenue also above forecasts. Microsoft is benefiting from its ongoing emphasis shift to software and cloud services. Separately, CNBC has learned that Microsoft will cut another 1,000 jobs in a new round of layoffs. \nAT&T — AT&T earned an adjusted 74 cents per share for the third quarter, beating estimates by five cents, but revenue came in short of analyst forecasts, owing to confusion over accounting for its acquisition of DirecTV . AT&T also raised its full year forecast as wireless and DirecTV subscribership rises, and on the benefits of cost cuts. \nCapital One Financial — Capital One reported quarterly profit of $1.98 per share, four cents above estimates, with revenue in line. The bank and credit card issuer was able to beat estimates despite having to build a reserve fund related to complaints from consumers in the U.K. \nPandora Media — Pandora matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 10 cents per share, though revenue was slightly shy of analysts' forecasts. The music streaming service is seeing its shares come under pressure, however, on lower than expected current quarter revenue guidance, as well as a $90 million settlement over royalties on pre-1972 recordings. \nTwitter — CEO Jack Dorsey is contributing a third of the company stock he owns to the company's employee stock pool. Dorsey's stock constitutes about one percent of outstanding shares and is worth about $197 million. \nSkechers — Skechers shares are plunging in premarket trading, after the company's latest sales came in well short of Street forecasts. The shoe maker also saw its bottom line results hurt by higher legal expenses. \nAlign Technology — The maker of the Invsalign invisible dental brace system earned 34 cents per share for the third quarter, three cents above estimates, with revenue also exceeding estimates. The company also issued a current quarter outlook above Street forecasts. \nGeneral Motors — GM will be the next company to talk with the United Auto Workers about a new contract, now that the pact with Fiat Chrysler has been approved. \nActivision — The video-game maker has set up a so-called \"e-sports\" division, to expand its involvement in the business of competitive online video games. \nKellogg — The cereal company is in late-stage talks to buy Diamond Foods for $35 to $40 per share, according to a report in the New York Post. Diamond closed Thursday at $32.83. \nKimberly-Clark — The consumer goods maker is in talks to buy the diaper manufacturing business of Brazil's Hypermarcas, according to a Reuters report. \nTreeHouse Foods — TreeHouse is in advanced talks to buy the Ralcorp unit of food maker ConAgra Foods for up to $2.7 billion, according to Reuters. Ralcorp is a maker of various snacks and spreads. \nPeter Schacknow Senior Producer, CNBC Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change PG ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:56:23.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
