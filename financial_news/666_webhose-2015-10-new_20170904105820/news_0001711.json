However, the state is required, even without a budget, to put aside money each month for pensions and debt service on bonds.\nIllinois' debt service payments on bonds total $3.4 billion in fiscal 2016, while payments to its five retirement systems total $6.8 billion, according to a May budget analysis by the Chicago-based Civic Federation.\nIllinois has also been ordered by courts to pay its workers and comply with federal consent decrees to fund healthcare and other services based on fiscal 2015 funding levels. But fiscal 2016 revenue is projected to fall by nearly 18 percent from fiscal 2015 due mainly to the rollback of temporary higher income tax rates on Jan. 1.
