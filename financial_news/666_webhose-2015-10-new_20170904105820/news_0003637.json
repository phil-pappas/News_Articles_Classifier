According to market research firm Javelin Strategy & Research, identity thieves stole $16 billion from 12.7 million U.S. consumers last year. However, while 5% of the general population had their identities stolen last year, that jumps to 8.1% for those with more than $1 million in assets. \nMatt Cullina, chief executive of financial security firm IDT911 (whose client base includes Allstate, Met Life and Liberty Mutual), notes that banks have hardened their defenses and have increasingly required multiple levels of authentication to make sure that transactions are being made by the right people. Those banks have set up special classes for high net worth individuals that, in many cases, require person to person meetings or calls to authenticate transactions. However, that doesn't stop identity thieves from opening new accounts or filing tax returns in those individuals' names. \n“We try to tell them your identity is a series of assets,” Cullina says. “It's not just your name, your Social Security number and your date of birth, it's also all your passwords, your PINs, all your open accounts, your email, how you communicate through e-mail, your style, how you do business -- oftentimes, high-net-worth individuals with co-mingle their business lives and social lives.” More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:59:33.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
