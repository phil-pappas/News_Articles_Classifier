One in four told comparison website uSwtich they had \"intentionally hidden family plans\". \nIn a victory for The Telegraph, which has campaigned against unfair lending decisions, the Financial Conduct Authority yesterday said it would collect evidence to see whether it needed to \"intervene\". \nChristopher Woolard, its director of strategy and competition, said the mortgage played a \"vital\" role in British life and expressed concern that there were \"potential areas where competition may not be working well and could be improved.\" \nIn April last year, the FCA introduced new lending rules called the Mortgage Market Review (MMR). They were designed to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, when a series of defaults by less affluent borrowers brought the entire money system close to collapse. \nTo stop banks from offering mortgages to people with little hope of repaying, lenders must now conduct strict \"affordability\" checks. Firms delve deep into each customer's lifestyle to ensure they could continue repayments if interest rates rose. \nBut mortgage brokers say many banks, while acting within the rules, have ignored additional regulatory guidance to use discretion in certain circumstances . \nAs a result, the experts say, loan applications from responsible customers are being rejected on technicalities . Often a computer algorithm might indicate the borrower is \"risky\" merely because their circumstances are unusual. \nIn some cases, lenders have refused to allow customers to move to cheaper loans, bizarrely arguing it would be unaffordable . There is concern that such firms are unfairly profiting from so-called \"mortgage prisoners\" who would struggle to qualify for a loan at another lender. \nDavid Hollingworth, of mortgage brokerage London & Country, said: \"This investigation by the FCA is absolutely essential because there are people out there, who consider themselves perfectly good borrowers, who are being frozen out of the market because lenders have clamped down so hard. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is crucial that the regulator starts the process of checking whether there may have been unintended consequences from its new rules.\" \nThe FCA is conducting what it terms a \"call for inputs\", with interested parties asked to submit evidence of problems. \nLenders are expected to argue that they are applying the MMR correctly, but brokers and consumer groups will point out inconsistencies. \nMr Hollingworth said no lender wanted to \"stand out from the crowd\" by relaxing its approach to older borrowers, women and people with irregular income streams. The resulting lack of competition was the \"flipside\" to the stricter rules on responsible lending. \nMr Woolard, of the FCA, said: \"Competition can play a key role in ensuring that the sector works well, delivering consumer benefits through lower prices, better customer service, and more product choice.\" \ndan.hyde@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:52:44.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
