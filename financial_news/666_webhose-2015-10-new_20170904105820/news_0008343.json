Vinyl may sound very Seventies, but Halstead has invested in creating technically advanced flooring that is both low-cost and hard-wearing. These attributes mean it is demanded across the world by hospitals and schools. \nHalstead has an attractive business for several reasons. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is difficult for new companies to start up and compete because of the high cost of the machinery required to produce its kind of flooring. The company’s manufacturing process also benefits from years of technical expertise, which lowers costs and is difficult to copy. \nJames Halstead’s global reach has reduced any reliance on one particular market and helped spread commercial risks. The group generates about 35pc of sales in the UK, 43pc from Europe, 15pc in the Far East (Kuala Lumpur: 5029.KL - news ) and 7pc from the rest of the world. \nThe company is also helped by sales of flooring having a certain degree of predictability. Gordon Oliver, finance director, said that about 80pc of business was refurbishment of buildings such as offices, shops and restaurants, with the balance going to new infrastructure projects such as hospitals and schools. Sales are, therefore, not dependent on big building programmes. \nThis was all demonstrated in the results, with revenue up 1.7pc to £227m, pre-tax profits up 5.8pc to £44.2m, and the dividend increased to 11p. The 7.8p final dividend goes ex-dividend on November 4 and will be paid on December 4. \nHalstead also looks in good condition from a balance sheet perspective. The shares are backed by net assets of £105m, or about 51p per share, and there was £47m in net cash at the end of June. \nWe said the shares were good for the long term (Buy, 330p, March 31) and although a bit expensive on 25 times earnings, this is a quality operator.
