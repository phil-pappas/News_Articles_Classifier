The NRF said online retail sales could increase up to 8 percent, to as much as $105 billion.\nFedEx said that it expects to see three spikes in package volumes during peak season, on Cyber Monday and the first two Mondays in December. The company said its holiday projections are included in its full-year fiscal 2016 earnings guidance of between $10.40 and $10.90 per share.\nThe rapid rise of ecommerce poses challenges for retailers and package delivery companies alike. In 2013 bad weather and a late surge in online retail packages caught FedEx and main rival United Parcel Service Inc off guard, leaving an estimated 2 million packages undelivered on Christmas Eve, the majority in UPS' network.\nLast year both companies touted investments in their networks and close collaboration with major retailers to manage package flows during the holidays. UPS ended up over-spending to prepare for package volume spikes that did not materialize, hurting its fourth-quarter earnings. FedEx did not report any problems.\nThis year FedEx has invested $1.6 billion in capacity and automation projects at FedEx Ground to help with peak season.\nFedEx's Fitzgerald said that if retailers come in way above forecast with a sudden surge in packages, the company may \"need to cap volumes\" in order to protect its network.
