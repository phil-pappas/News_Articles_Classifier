Pic: Facebook.\nJulia Marsh New York Post A FORMER Australian Citigroup executive says a young female underling set him up to be fired from his $US2.4-million-a-year job.\nThe banker, working in New York at the time, said she subjected him to an evening of drinks and dirty talk about her breasts, lips and sexual prowess at a Soho hotel bar — and then falsely telling their bosses he came on to her, court papers said.\nDavid James Murphy, who pulled in $US1 billion in revenue as Citi’s head of Global Prime Finance, claims junior analyst Tila Azeem told him lurid tales about her sex life in an apparent effort to get him to say he had the hots for her during their night out in 2014.\nThe 45-year-old banker insists there was never any hanky panky with the 25-year-old worker — but that didn’t stop her from ending his career by claiming to his bosses that he stalked and sexually harassed her, court papers says.\n“The relationship — while an extremely close one — was never sexual, nor did Mr. Murphy ever make any overtures towards the formation of a sexual relationship,” his lawyer, John Singer, insists in an arbitration claim that accused Azeem of slander.\nThe married father goes into excruciating detail in his 66-page claim to try and prove that Azeem is to blame for his dismissal from Citi.\nMurphy recalls one night at the James Hotel in 2014 when Azeem allegedly tried get him to admit he had the hots for her.\n“Azeem attempted … to induce and coerce Mr. Murphy into revealing his true ‘feelings’ for her,” which were only “friendship” said the suit. It added that she tried to “provoke ‘confessions’ of romantic proclivities.”\nAt the hotel, Azeem allegedly “boasted ad nauseam and gleefully about her breasts and how they were undoubtedly larger than Mr. Murphy probably realised,” he claims.\nAzeem also talked of how she was asked to be a “swimsuit model and as a lip model.”\nShe also “confided that she and her fiance were having sex every week. … She also, unprovoked, shared her preferred lighting arrangements for the performance of said act,” court papers said.\nThe next day Azeem cut off all communication. Two weeks later, company HR told him Azeem claimed “He stalked her, [and] tried to get her in bed.” He was fired days later.\nHe filed an arbitration claim in September against Azeem for slander. Azeem countered this by seeking to stop the arbitration in Manhattan Supreme Court.\nMurphy was born in Australia and graduated from the University of Sydney. He previously worked for Macquarie Bank, Merill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. Since his dismissal from Citi in the US, he has returned to Sydney with his wife and daughter.\nHis lawyer, John Singer, said Azeem’s case was “baseless.” Azeem’s lawyer, John Snyder, had no comment.\nThis story was originally published on the New York Post .\nJump back to top\nbusiness breaking news 15:50 PM Frank Lowy to retire as Scentre chair 15:50 PM Banks may be doing RBA's work on rates 15:50 PM Roy headed to startup nation Israel 15:43 PM ANZ joins rivals and hikes rates 13:52 PM Drillsearch, Beach to merge in $1.2b deal", "external_links": ["http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "http://www.nypost.com/", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c4e46842c8816a562c54ecf94724534d", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/21/subordinate-seduced-me-then-got-me-fired-executive/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:22:09.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
