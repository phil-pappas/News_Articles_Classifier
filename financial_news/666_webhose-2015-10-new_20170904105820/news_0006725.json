ECB head Mario Draghi indicated Thursday that the bank could consider providing more stimulus at its meeting in December.\nGermany’s DAX gained 2.9 per cent, while France’s CAC 40 rose 2.5 per cent and Britain’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.1 per cent.\nOn Friday the Chinese central bank took steps to boost lending and stimulate its economy, cutting interest rates for the sixth time in less than a year and reducing the amount of money banks must keep on hand as a reserve fund.\n“Monetary policy is overly restrictive in many countries around the world, including China, so I think they will continue to get looser on their monetary policy, more stimulative on their monetary policy, over the next few months,” Belisle said.\nOn commodity markets, the December gold contract fell $3.30 to US$1,162.80 an ounce, the December crude contract fell 78 cents to US$44.60 a barrel and the December contract for natural gas dropped nine cents to US$2.493 per thousand cubic feet.\nBelisle said commodity prices should rise as central banks get more assertive in pursuing policies aimed at boosting the local economy.\n“If that stimulus in China and around the world plays out, that’s generally good for commodities,” he said.\nThe loonie ended the day down 0.4 of a U.S. cent at 75.90 cents US.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:46:00.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
