Ten-year Treasury yields fell to 1.97 percent on Oct. 14, the lowest close since April 27, as bets receded for the first Federal Reserve interest-rate increase since 2006 this year.\n“It’s mainly the Fed, and not really knowing when they’re going to start tightening” that is keeping yields suppressed, said Janu Chan, an economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “Low inflation is allowing the Fed time to delay, and it also increases the chances that they’ll really go gradually.”\nThe yield on the 10-year note fell one basis point to 2.02 percent as of 9:33 a.m. in Tokyo, after dropping five basis points last week, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
