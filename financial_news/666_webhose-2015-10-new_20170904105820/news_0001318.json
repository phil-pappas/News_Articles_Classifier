The launch depends on whether Apple can negotiate streaming rights to live broadcast content, as Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) has done. \nComcast's $15-per-month Xfinity Stream service will include only the major live broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox — along with HBO and local TV channels. Comcast's service, which also serves up on-demand content, targets \"cord nevers\" — young adults who have shunned pay-TV. Sling TV CEO Roger Lynch introduced Dish Network's $20 'skinny' service, Sling TV, at January's Consumer Electronics Show.

Each skinny bundle will have its own take on what \"must-have\" programs should be included. \nDish Network (NASDAQ: DISH ) targeted \"cord nevers\" with its $20-per-month Sling service rolled out in January. Dish did not include the four major broadcast networks, opting instead to go with Walt Disney 's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN and some cable TV channels, mainly from AMC Networks (NASDAQ: AMCX ) and Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ). \nDish Network had 240,000 Sling customers as of June 30, but is signed up fewer users in Q2 than in Q1. Sony (NYSE: SNE ) also launched a Web-TV service in early 2015, but it hasn't disclosed subscriber numbers. Sony's $50-per-month service packs in more channels than Sling, perhaps because as an outsider to the pay-TV industry, its negotiating position with content companies was weaker, analysts say. \nEven Apple's clout may be suspect, if it wants a $40-per-month service that includes only top networks, while offering other channels in add-on tiers that cost consumers extra. \n\"This may not fly with many of the programmers, which will likely lead to Apple having to put more than it wants in the basic tier, pay more for programming, exclude some programmers, set a higher price, or simply give up,\" said Bryan Kraft, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a recent research note. \nWhile skinny bundles are likely here to stay, not all will pan out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:40:05.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
