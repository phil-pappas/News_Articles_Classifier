MacArthur Foundation. \n'It was a real surprise and frankly, it took a while to sink in,' the 50-year-old told the Seattle Times via email. \n'I feel overwhelmed with gratitude to the foundation and those who helped build Ashesi University. \n'Awuah's innovation in higher education is not only empowering individual students; it also has the potential to transform political and civil society in Ghana and other African nations by developing a new generation of leaders and entrepreneurs,' the Foundation said. \nMr Awuah said he doesn't have specific plans for the cash award, but was confident he can find a way to put it to use to advance the school's work. \n'The Ashesi community is buzzing with excitement,' Awuah said. \nMore than 900 people have been given the grants since they were first handed out in 1981. Shrouded in secrecy, the selection process doesn't involve applications. Instead, anonymous groups make nominations and recommendations to the foundation's board of directors. \nThat secrecy extends to the winners who, when they are notified of their grants, are asked not to tell more than one person until a public announcement is made a couple of weeks later. \nThat has led to some difficult times for recipients. \n-Starrfmonline Business & Finance Follow Us the dignity of a man and his legitimate aspirations is not known unless his absence is felt.
