Retirement, often decades away for couples with young kids, isn't much of a factor in the discussion. \nBut it came into focus recently for Andrea and Brett Wade, who made the decision about 15 years ago to have Andrea quit a county government job to stay home with their first child. A second son was born about five years later, and Andrea has also been home schooling the boys for the last three years. \nThroughout that time she's worked side jobs from home, from helping Brett with his swimming pool service business to running her own house cleaning company. Today, she works for Envoy, an Uber-style startup online business that offers \"family concierge\" services like shopping and running errands or light-duty companionship services for seniors. \nEven with the extra side jobs, saving for retirement has been a struggle without the workplace savings plans common in more traditional careers, she said. \nFive months ago, the couple moved from California to Texas, hoping the lower cost of living will eventually help them buy a home after renting in California. And a recent death in the family prompted the couple to purchase life insurance and start saving for retirement.

They start to realize that even though they might have had a comfortable existence, when they start sending three kids to college and looking at retirement lasting 30 years or more, one income isn't going to do it.\" \nSo how can stay-at-home parents plan for retirement? \nOpen the right accounts. A spousal IRA allows couples to save up to $6,500 ($5,500 for those under 50) for 2015 in the name of a spouse with little or no earned income. If you're doing self-employed side jobs in addition to taking care of the kids, check out whether a Solo 401(k) or a SEP-IRA, which allow for higher contributions, makes more sense. \nPlan for Social Security. Spousal Social Security benefits were designed to shore up retirement finances for spouses who spent years out of the workforce, but they are capped at roughly half of the primary earners' benefits. For many couples, this means much lower lifetime benefits compared to couples who earned two paychecks. Consider doing all you can to maximize your joint lifetime benefits and explore a deferred fixed annuity if your guaranteed income still comes up short. \nRethink life insurance. Add up not only the cost to replace the parenting and household duties, but also an estimate of what the spouse is likely to earn once back at work. Also consider laddering a couple of policies with different terms to maintain flexibility, said financial planner Theresa Wan. \nThink longer term. If staying home means you are impoverished in old age, that's a huge burden for your kids. Jumping back in, say, five years earlier could substantially boost your retirement income and Social Security benefits. On the flip side, if you radically alter your lifestyle to accommodate a one-income budget and still save for retirement, the payoff can be rewarding as well as enriching. \n\"Having one income forces (a couple) to step outside the stereotypical mold,\" said Sheryl Garrett, a financial planner and founder of the Garrett Planning Network. \"They can eliminate a car and enroll in fewer costly activities, and the trade-off is doing more together as a family.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:44:06.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
