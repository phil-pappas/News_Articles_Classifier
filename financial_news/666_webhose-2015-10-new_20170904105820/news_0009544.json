I say this quite frankly: this will not be without pain. \n\"Technical solutions to the problems are within view. However, the business and financial consequences are not yet clear.\" \nMr Mueller also cautioned that care was more important than speed in clearing up the diesel emissions disaster. \nA VW Passat undergoes an emissions test \nBut fixing some 11 million rigged vehicles will be expensive, and the €6.5bn VW has already set aside for repairs won't be enough to cover fines and potential legal damages as well, Mr Mueller said. \nThe company is also exploring options from a simple software upgrade to replacing some cars outright, according to Bloomberg. \nThe government of the German state of Lower Saxony, which owns a 20pc stake in VW, said it would do all it could to prevent job losses. \n\"I am aware that work at Volkswagen is the livelihood for many thousands of workers and their families worldwide, and especially here in Lower Saxony,\" Stephan Weil, the state prime minister, wrote in a letter to staff. \n\"That's why I see it as our task to work with all our strength for the safety of these jobs.\" \nThe German government has given VW until tomorrow (Wednesday) to set out how it intends to fix the problem, which analysts say is likely to cost tens of billions of pounds to put right. \n\nThe announcement followed news that eight million of the 11 million cars fitted with illegal emissions-cheating software were sold in Europe. \nA total 1.2 million of the affected cars are in the UK, including VWs, Audis, Seats, Skodas and VW vans. \nThe admission came in a letter of apology to German MPs as VW mounts a huge PR campaign to try to undo some of the damage to its brand. \nThe letter, sent to every MP with a VW outlet in his or her constituency, apologises for the \"wrongdoing of a few individuals\" and promises to \"carry out a full investigation of what happened with the help of German and American lawyers\". \n\"Rest assured that we are currently working at full speed and in close co-operation with the authorities... on a technical solution for the vehicles concerned,\" it says. \nThe company used column inches on Sunday, as Germany was celebrating 25 years of reunification, to reassure Germans that it would resolve the crisis. \n\"Actually, our reunification anniversary message should be here,” the advertisement read. \n\"It would have been the right moment to say thank you for our customers’ confidence in our cars and for the great popularity VW has experienced during this time in Germany. \n\"But now we only have one sentence to say to you. We will do everything to regain your trust.\" \nThe scandal has wiped almost €30bn off the value of VW and prompted a raft of government investigations and lawsuits around the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:40:26.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
