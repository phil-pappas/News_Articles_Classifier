As many as 1 in 4 Americans have errors on their credit report, yet only two-thirds of consumers say they have ever checked their report. In the same survey, Bankrate.com found that almost half (41 percent) of Millennials report they have never seen their credit report.\n“Credit is something most people don’t know enough about, yet it can affect everything from interest rates on loans to job prospects and insurance pricing,” said David Kexel, director of marketing for Arizona Federal. “With the Taste the Good Life event, we’re providing a fun, informal atmosphere for consumers to learn about their credit and receive tips on how to improve their score.”\nThe free event is being held from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Arizona Federal Operations Center located at 333 N. 44th Street, Phoenix, AZ 85008. Attendees are encouraged to RSVP at http://www.ArizonaFederal.org/GoodLife .\nAbout Arizona Federal Credit Union\nArizona Federal is a $1.3 billion not-for-profit financial cooperative providing financial services and expertise to over 120,000 member/owners.
