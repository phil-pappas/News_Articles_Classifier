Henry Zwartz Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan The data flow slows to a trickle in Australia and the United States this week but central bankers from both countries, another week of US corporate earnings, and third-quarter national accounts from China will still provide investors with plenty of trading cues.\nIn Australia, futures pricing has the local sharemarket set to open higher after a relatively strong Wall Street close on Friday .\nHowever, the fortunes of the S&P/ASX 200, and the Australian dollar, throughout the week will depend on any signs of further easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia or tightening from the US Federal Reserve, as well as the state of the Chinese economy.\nCompanies reporting in the US include big names that could also help steer sentiment in a range of sectors.\nBeijing releases its third-quarter gross domestic product figure on Monday, and this is expected to come in at 6.8 per cent year on year, down from 7 per cent at the end of the second quarter.\nThe range of economists' estimates, however, is wide – from 6.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent – with the spread partly reflecting uncertainty about official efforts to iron out discrepancies between the headline figure and its constituent parts, according to analysts.\n\"Efforts to smooth the official GDP series after it failed to register the sharp slowdown that many other indicators showed early in the year may pull reported growth down in the third quarter,\" Capital Economics' China economist Chang Liu said.\n\"The collapse in equity trading activity will also have produced a sizeable drag in financial-sector output growth last month.\n \"But the desire to keep growth close to the annual 'about 7 per cent' target means that growth probably won't be shown to have slowed by much,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, the RBA releases the minutes of its latest policy meeting, two weeks ago, when the board again opted to keep the cash rate at 2 per cent, where it has been since May.\nTraders and investors will be looking for any market signals in the full details of the October 6 statement by governor Glenn Stevens , who singled out China's softening economy for special mention. The slowing pace of house price growth in Sydney and Melbourne, too, is back in focus, and this is weighing on broader economic sentiment.\nRBA assistant governor Malcolm Edey may address the issue during any question-and-answer session after a speech to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's annual conference in Sydney on Thursday.\n\"We note that this [RBA board] meeting would have included a presentation of the Financial Stability Review, which was released [on Friday] and noted 'risks surrounding the housing and mortgage markets seem higher than average at present',\" wrote National Australia Bank's economics team at the weekend.\nIn the US, four Fed Open Market Committee speakers, including Fed chief Janet Ellen, may furnish the investment community with further guidance on its first interest-rate increase in almost a decade. However, economists say housing and employment data due out this week will provide a clearer idea on the Fed's direction.\nPatchy data in September becalmed building expectations of tightening lift-off this year, and investors will be looking for this sentiment to improve, says BK Asset Management's managing director of foreign exchange strategy Kathy Lien.\n\"For the market to be convinced that 2015 lift-off is still a strong possibility, the deterioration in September needs to be offset by back-to-back improvements in October,\" she said. Weekly unemployment claims figures are released late on Thursday Australian time, while existing-home sales – a key indicator of broader economic health – come out early Friday morning.\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank meets on Thursday but no-one expects any change to existing policy settings until December or early next year.\nCanada holds federal elections on Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://www.domain.com.au/news/i-am-disappointed-i-cant-deny-that-says-vendor-as-home-fails-to-sell-20151017-gkbln7/", "https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:09:40.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
