Asa Hutchinson to study highway funding is offering a menu of options for boosting money for state roads. It's offering little clarity, however, on whether any of the plans will be appetizing to a Republican-led Legislature that's resisted both approaches in recent years. \nThe draft recommendations released last week by the Governor's Working Group on Highway Funding is stopping short of endorsing a specific plan for the state's growing road financing needs. Instead, it elaborates on the two options lawmakers and policy leaders have for years said are the only paths to close that funding gap. \n\"There are only a couple of pathways to get you to additional revenue for highways: reallocating some existing revenue or raising new revenue through taxes and fees,\" said Craig Douglass, executive director of the Arkansas Good Roads Foundation and a member of the working group. \"The idea of giving the governor a set of options allows him and (finance officials) to take a look at those options and the revenue impact on existing revenue or tax policy and fit that into their overall budgeting strategy for the next year or two.\" \nThe recommendations include the plan offered by Douglass' group to increase fuel taxes by 10 cents a gallon, a hike that would be phased out as the state gradually transfers tax revenue from auto sales to highways. That approach also calls for increasing the registration fees for hybrid, electric and other alternate-fueled vehicles. \nOther plans include a \"revenue neutral\" package that, in part, calls for an increase in diesel fuel taxes that would be offset by an already planned reduction in the state's sales tax on groceries. Another proposal would eliminate the sales tax exemption for motor fuel and diesel. \nThe recommendations, which are expected to be in a report completed next month, also incorporates ideas from a previous Blue Ribbon Committee formed to look at highway funding issues. Those ideas include indexing the fuel tax to inflation and levying taxes on alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas. \nThe proposals are the latest attempt to tackle a road funding problem that's bedeviled the state for years. Arkansas highway officials say they have $20.4 billion in needs over the next decade, but only $3.6 billion in expected revenue from the state and federal government. The proposals are aimed at raising $160 million for roads over the next few years. \nIt's unclear whether any of them will curry favor with Hutchinson, who's urged the panel to be politically realistic when looking at highway funding. The reality is that most tax increases ideas face an uphill battle at most in the Legislature, where Republicans have gained control in recent years partly on an anti-tax message. \nAnd diverting general revenue could be just as difficult, with health advocates, higher education leaders and others warning that such a plan could threaten other essential state services. \nRepublican Rep. Andy Davis, who has warned tax increases would have a difficult time in the Legislature, said he believes the list of options offer a chance for a highway funding plan that could gain support. Davis said any tax increase would have to be offset by cuts in fees or reductions elsewhere to win that support. \n\"A lot of these things could get done if they were part of a larger reform plan, whereas if they're just standing on their own, they're hard to get through,\" Davis said. \nDuncan Baird, who's chairing the group, said offering a list of ideas rather than endorsing a specific plan will give Hutchinson more options to choose from as he tries to find a solution to the state's highway funding woes. \n\"If you had a menu, you could take those things and structure them in many different ways,\" said Baird, the state budget administrator. \nAndrew DeMillo has covered Arkansas government and politics for The Associated Press since 2005.
