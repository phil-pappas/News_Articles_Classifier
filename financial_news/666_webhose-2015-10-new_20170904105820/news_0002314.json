But fixing U.S. stores is becoming ever more crucial. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. surprised investors by predicting that profits would drop as much as 12% next year as it spends heavily to raise wages, boost online sales and overhaul inventory systems. In the wake of the announcement, the retailer’s stock fell 10% in a single day and is on pace for its worst year since 1973.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com. \nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:09:33.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
