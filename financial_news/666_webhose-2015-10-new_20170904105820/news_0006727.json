In response, the government earlier this month told ICJ that it will join the arbitration and appoint an arbitrator soon, they said.\nWhile Cairn had named former Bulgarian minister Stanimir A Alexandrov as its arbitrator in the matter, the government is yet to finalise its arbitrator, sources said.\nOnce the two arbitrators are in place, they will then appoint a neutral presiding judge of the three-member Arbitral Tribunal.\nCairn wants the Tribunal to declare that “India has violated its obligations under the Treaty and international law” and has “failed to accord Cairn’s investments fair and equitable treatment and impaired them through unreasonable and discriminatory measures in violation of the Treaty.”\nBesides claiming cost of arbitration, it also wants to be compensated for the loss of value of its shareholding in Cairn India which the Income Tax Department had attached following the January 2014 tax assessment notice.\nThe government, on the other hand, maintains that the tax dispute does not fall within the scope of the India-UK Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement.\nThe Income Tax Department says Cairn Energy allegedly made a capital gain of Rs 24,503.50 crore in 2006 while transferring all its India assets to a new company, Cairn India, and getting it listed on the stock exchanges.\nCairn Energy, which had in 2011 sold majority stake in its Indian unit to mining group Vedanta for USD 8.67 billion, still holds 9.8 per cent stake in Cairn India. But it has been barred by the I-T Department from selling this stake.\nThe value of the shareholding in Cairn India has halved since attachment.\nDisputing any capital gains made out of an internal business reorganisation, Cairn in the notice states that the UK-India BIT specified that each contracting party is required to “grant to investors of the other contracting party the unrestricted transfer of their investments and returns”.\nThis was violated by attachment of Cairn Energy’s shares in Cairn India and preventing it from selling those shares and repatriating or otherwise disposing of the proceeds, the arbitration notice said.\nFirst Published on October 25, 2015 1:48 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:02:14.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
