Philip Gostelow by Marianna Papadakis Australian law firm IMF Bentham confirmed it was shoring up class actions in Europe against Volkswagen through its European joint venture with United Stated advisory firm Elliott Management Corporation, called Bentham Europe.\nIt is a landmark case worth billions and if London-based Bentham Europe can strike a deal with institutional investors it could affirm the Australian listed company as an international leader in large scale litigation funding.\nIt comes as the federal government holds critical discussions today with car makers Volkswagen and Audi that could dictate how the government reacts to the emissions rigging scandal.\nVolkswagen is facing a torrent of law suits and class actions worldwide, including in Germany and United States, arising from the scandal that has led to the resignation of several senior executives, and the prospect of a worldwide vehicle recall.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been vocal about its frustration in Volkswagen's delays in notifying the Australian market how many consumers here could be affected.\nIt has warned the carmaker it faces fines going into the millions for every breach of the law, if Volkswagen is found to have used an emissions-rigging device in Australia.\nMarket cap smashed Meanwhile Volkswagen's market capitalisation has dropped by more than €25 billion and investors have watched the share price plummet from €160 to around €100.\n Bentham Europe said it was in discussions with institutional investors worldwide to fund a shareholder action in Germany against Volkswagen.\nInvestors could seek compensation for losses arising from the car maker's alleged breach of German securities law over an eight-year period from 2007 to September 18, 2015. The allegations could include that the company failed to disclose to the market its use of \"defeat device\" software in cars sold worldwide.\nBentham Europe's London-based chief investment officer Jeremy Marshall said in a statement the scandal caused significant harm to Volkswagen's reputation and financial position as well as raising serious concerns about the corporate governance regime within one of Germany's blue chip companies.\nMs Marshall said shareholders who saw billions wiped off the value of Volkswagen deserved more than just an apology for what appeared to be long-running and concerted cheating of the system.\nShareholders deserve more than apology \"Volkswagen shareholders are justifiably concerned that Volkswagen has appeared to have allowed this practice to continue for what may have been a number of years, in the assumed knowledge that its disclosure to the market would be likely to cause them and their shareholders significant financial harm,\" Ms Marshall said.\n\"We expect a legal claim to reveal the true extent of the problem and allow shareholders to seek compensation for the undoubted harm that has been suffered.\"\nBentham Europe would instruct lawyers to commence the necessary proceedings as soon as possible. The shareholder action would be conducted in Germany by a leading international commercial litigation law firm, Ms Marshall said.\nManaging director of Australian-based IMF Bentham Andrew Saker told The Australian Financial Review on Thursday the company was investigating funding not only a consumer class action in Australia, but consumer and shareholder actions in Europe where it had bases.\nIMF Bentham's portfolio of claims is worth over $2 billion and Mr Saker said the Australian listed company has both the resources to fund legal action and cop any potential adverse costs order if a case was lost.\nIt follows Bentham Europe's first foray into the European litigation funding market with a shareholder class action against British supermarket giant Tesco last year .\nClass actions are being investigated in Australia by Maurice Blackburn, which has received hundreds of calls from consumers expressing concerns their cars – including VW, Audi and Skoda brands – have been affected.\nInternational firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which has lodged a claim in California with another law firm accusing Volkswagen of misleading consumers, is also considering pursuing a class action in Australia against the car manufacturer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:03:34.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
