See also “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Revenue less repair payments* in the fiscal second quarter was $133.3 million, representing a 5.4% increase versus the second quarter of last year and a 5.4% increase from the previous quarter. Excluding exchange rate impacts, constant currency revenue less repair payments* in the fiscal second quarter grew 11.2% versus Q2 of last year, and 5.7% sequentially. Year-over-year, fiscal Q2 revenue was adversely impacted by depreciation in the British Pound, Australian Dollar, South African Rand and Euro against the US Dollar. These headwinds were more than offset by revenue growth driven by both existing client expansions and the ramp in new account wins. Year-over-year, revenue improvement was paced by growth in emerging verticals, including Retail/CPG, Utilities, Shipping and Logistics, Healthcare, and CPS, which all grew in excess of 12%. Sequentially, revenue less repair payments* improved despite modest headwinds from currency movements net of hedging. Adjusted operating margin* for the second quarter was 23.1%, as compared to 21.8% in Q2 of last year and 20.0% reported in the prior quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin* improved as a result of currency movements net of hedging, operating leverage associated with higher revenue, and improved seat utilization. Partially offsetting this favorability was the impact of our annual wage increases, and performance-based incentives and gain sharing recorded in the second quarter of last year. The sequential improvement in adjusted operating margin* was driven by currency favorability, gains on hedge positions, productivity improvements and higher volume. These benefits were partially offset by lower seat utilization resulting from the opening of our new delivery facilities in South Africa. Adjusted net income (ANI)* in the fiscal second quarter was $27.1 million, up $3.2 million as compared to Q2 of last year and up $4.4 million from the previous quarter. Second quarter ANI* margin was 20.3%, as compared to 18.9% in Q2 of last year, and 17.9% reported last quarter. From a balance sheet perspective, WNS ended Q2 with $129.1 million in cash and investments, and no debt. In the second quarter, the company generated $26.6 million in cash from operations, and had $6.6 million in capital expenditures. Day’s sales outstanding were 27 days, as compared to 30 days in Q2 of last year and 28 days reported in the previous quarter. During Q2, WNS completed its share repurchase program, buying 330,000 ADS’s at an average price of $29.65 per ADS, totaling $9.8 million. We are pleased with the company’s second quarter financial and operational performance, highlighted by year-over-year constant currency revenue growth of 11 percent,” said Keshav Murugesh, WNS’s Chief Executive Officer. “Business momentum remains healthy, as WNS continued to add new strategic logos and expand our existing relationships in the quarter. WNS also received several key awards from the industry analysts and sourcing advisors during Q2, and launched a new suite of solutions for the travel industry leveraging WNS-owned technology and embedded analytics. We intend to continue expanding our capabilities and services in the areas of domain expertise, automation, analytics and digitization to enhance our differentiated positioning the BPM marketplace.” WNS has updated guidance for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016 as follows: Revenue less repair payments* is expected to be between $523 million and $539 million, up from $503.0 million in fiscal 2015. This assumes an average GBP to USD exchange rate of 1.53 for the remainder of fiscal 2016 ANI* is expected to range between $98 million and $102 million versus $92.3 million in fiscal 2015. This assumes an average USD to INR exchange rate of 65.0 for the remainder of fiscal 2016 Based on a diluted share count of 53.5 million shares, the company expects adjusted diluted earnings* per ADS to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.91 \n“The company has updated our forecast for fiscal 2016 based on current visibility levels and exchange rates,” said Sanjay Puria, WNS’s Chief Financial Officer. “Our revised guidance for the year reflects top line growth of 4% to 7%, or 9% to 12% on a constant currency* basis. We currently have over 98% visibility to the midpoint of the range. The increase in our guidance for adjusted net income* is largely the result of favorable currency movements and improved operational efficiency.” Conference Call WNS will host a conference call on October 15, 2015 at 8:00 am (Eastern) to discuss the company's quarterly results.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures The financial information in this release is focused on non-GAAP financial measures as we believe that they reflect more accurately our operating performance. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to our GAAP operating results are included below. A discussion of our GAAP measures is contained in “Part I –Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” in our annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on May 5, 2015. For financial statement reporting purposes, WNS has two reportable segments: WNS Global BPM and WNS Auto Claims BPM. Revenue less repair payments is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as (a) revenue less (b) in the auto claims business, payments to repair centers for “fault” repair cases where WNS acts as the principal in its dealings with the third party repair centers and its clients. WNS believes that revenue less repair payments for “fault” repairs reflects more accurately the value addition of the business process management services that it directly provides to its clients. For more details, please see the discussion in “Part I – Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects – Overview” in our annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on May 5, 2015. Constant currency revenue less repair payments is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present constant currency revenue less repair payments so that revenue less repair payments may be viewed without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Constant currency revenue less repair payments is presented by recalculating prior period’s revenue less repair payments denominated in currencies other than in US dollars using the foreign exchange rate used for the latest period, without taking into account the impact of hedging gains/losses. Our non-US dollar denominated revenues include, but are not limited to, revenues denominated in pound sterling, South African rand, Australian dollar and euro. WNS also presents (1) adjusted operating margin, which refers to adjusted operating profit (calculated as operating profit excluding amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense) as a percentage of revenue less repair payments, and (2) ANI, which is calculated as profit excluding amortization of intangible assets and share-based compensation expense, and other non-GAAP measures included in this release as supplemental measures of its performance. WNS presents these non-GAAP measures because it believes they assist investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. In addition, it uses these non-GAAP measures (i) as a factor in evaluating management’s performance when determining incentive compensation and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for WNS’s financial results prepared in accordance with IFRS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:27:19.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
