O3b’s first year anniversary achievements include: Initial constellation capacity of 192 Gbps 40 customers in service 31 countries with live customers Already, the capacity that O3b has sold is equivalent to nearly 10% of the contracted capacity of the three largest Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) operators combined. O3b Networks operates a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite constellation, which at 8000 km, is much closer to the earth than traditional geostationary (GEO) satellites. The lower altitude greatly reduces latency, decreasing response times and improving voice and video quality as well as enabling an array of cloud services. O3b satellites achieve extremely high throughput, making its satellite service an ideal solution when fiber is impractical or unreliable. Steve Collar, CEO, O3b Networks “Our first year of commercial service has been phenomenal. We couldn’t be happier to see the impact that O3b has had on our customers and their businesses. The breadth of industries and geographies that our customers span reflects the broad based demand for high performance connectivity and we are excited to help our customers take their network capabilities to another level.” Philippe Israel, Managing Director, Raga Sat : \"The experience was absolutely mind boggling… I couldn’t be more thrilled for our customers to finally have the type of technology that is comparable to what they have in the western world.\" Susan Bonner, VP Onboard Revenue, RCCL : \"It is a game changer for us, it is also a game changer for the guests we're going to attract to come on board. It enables us to provide the same level of connectivity as they experience in their homes today.\" Michael A Iwanow, CEO, MEOSAT : \"With the key features that O3b offers, with the lowest latency and uptime of almost 100 percent, we can deliver the market what the market needs.\" About O3b Networks Limited O3b Networks Limited is a global satellite service provider operating a next-generation satellite network for telecommunications operators, Internet service providers, enterprise and government customers in emerging markets.
