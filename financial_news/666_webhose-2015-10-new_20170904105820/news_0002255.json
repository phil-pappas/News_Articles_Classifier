This prestigious, two-day annual event is among the premier gatherings of professionals in private equity. Corey and the other panelists - Greg Pappas (Berkshire Partners), Bob Geiman (Cava Capital), Cory Eaves (General Atlantic) and Charles Gottdiener (Providence Equity Partners) will examine several topics related to the current and future role of operating partners in private equity firms.\nPanelists will offer expertise drawn from their firsthand experiences with different operating models in exploring the impact that firm size (AUM) and investment strategy have in choosing the best approach for a firm’s operating partner model. They will probe the current state and future outlook for support by investment professionals of the operating team. And the panel will examine the practical questions of allocating limited time to value creation opportunities and ways to identify and communicate the values realized from operating team activities. Audience surveys planned during the session will provide an even broader perspective on several topics.\n“What’s exciting is the chance to learn from each other about trends in this important area of private equity firm operations and what the implications are for portfolio value creation,” Corey said. “That’s critical to all participants.”\nFor more information about the PEI Operating Partners Forum, see the Forum website here .
