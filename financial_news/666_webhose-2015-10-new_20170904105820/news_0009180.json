Bundrick, CFP 10/15/15 - 9:45 AM EDT \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- The freelance economy can be tough. Steady work can be hard to find, not to mention reliable payment. Whether you’re a contract designer, writer or Uber driver , cash flow rules. Andrew D’Souza is working to turn that income trickle into a steady stream with an idea called Clearbanc. \nD’Souza is a Toronto entrepreneur who pitched his concept to the Y Combinator Fellowship program. YC is the Bay Area tech incubator that has been instrumental in helping hatch many high-profile startups, including Reddit, Dropbox and Pebble watches. The Fellowship program is YC “Light” -- a less intensive, short-term (eight-week) program with a $12,000 grant (compared to the $120,000 for a 7% equity stake YC offers in its regular program). The junior program is for “idea stage” companies. \nThat’s Clearbanc for sure. It’s not yet a real business -- at least not a proven one -- so “idea” describes best what’s going on here. And that’s basically what D’Souza has -- the spark of an idea: to help the freelance workforce get paid faster , by advancing their pay daily. And he’s starting with Uber drivers.
