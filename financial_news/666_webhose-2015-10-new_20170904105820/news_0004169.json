These will be made public under the auspices of the fourth Brand Africa 100: Africa's Best Brands rankings of the Top 100 Most Admired and Most Valuable brands. Brand Africa 100 is a proprietary approach developed by Brand Leadership Group in partnership with Brand Finance plc, the world's leading independent valuation consultancy, TNS, the globally respected consumer knowledge and information company and Geopoll, the leading mobile survey platform with a database of nearly 200 million users in emerging markets. \"These rankings are an important metric of the progress Africa is making in building made in Africa brands and challenging the dominant non-African brands in Africa which over the years have accounted for 80 percent of the most admired brands in Africa and a dominant 99 percent share of the value of the Top 100,\" said Thebe Ikalafeng, Founder and Chairman - Brand Africa.

This year, the scope and sample countries have been vastly expanded from a base of eight countries in the past years to 22 countries covering every leading African economy, all 5 political regions and economic zones - making it the only and most representative and comprehensive pan-African study on brands in Africa.
