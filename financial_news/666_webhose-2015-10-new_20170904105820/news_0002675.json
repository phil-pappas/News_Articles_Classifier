Strategize a plan to defeat student loans now. Saving for retirement doesn't have to be hard. If you turned it into a \"robo-plan,\" you'd save much more without thinking about it.Such is the advice of Charles Ellis, the managing partner of Greenwich Associates and all-around Wall Street guru. In his new book \"Falling Short: The Coming Retirement Crisis and What to do About It,\" he doesn't mince words. We're coming up incredibly short-handed when it comes to retirement saving -- median savings is only about $100,000 -- and we need to something about it.Ellis is beating the drum for \"best practices\" that can improve retirement savings overnight. Although his program is voluntary, it can work on a big scale. I heard him speak at the Morningstar ETF conference on Sept. 30 in Chicago.\"I have no intention of making this an agreeable conversation,\" Ellis began his talk on retirement savings. \"This is a formidable problem.\"Ellis says the disappearance of the guaranteed defined-benefit pension in recent decades has led to this retirement savings crisis. American workers are largely handed 401(k) plans that they have no education or experience managing.Imagine you were handed a business that you had no idea how to run and were expected to know everything you needed to know without any background? That's the 401(k) world, where most people have no idea what they're doing and don't get much meaningful help.Not only are 401(k)s dangerous vehicles for most people -- they consistently lose money in them -- they are loaded with middlemen fees. Most people never calculate how much these fees eat into their retirement plans.\"People are free to borrow, invest and choose managers in 401(k)s without any risk to the employer,\" Ellis notes. \"In a bull market, everyone loves them.\" But when stocks turn sour, as they did in the last quarter -- the worst since 2011 -- people panic and start to sell at the wrong time. What Can You Do You can urge your employer to improve your plan on many levels. Only they can do this since they choose the managers and administrators.If you're in an individual retirement account (IRA), SEP-IRA or solo 401(k), you can also make improvements. Here are some essential best practices: * Automate Your Savings. That means setting an automatic amount that's withdrawn from your paycheck that goes directly into your 401(k) every month. That way you save without making a decision on whether to spend the money. * Automate Increased Contributions. How much you put into your 401(k) will increase with every raise -- automatically. You make more, you save more. It's as simple as that. * Automate Your Allocation. You want a 60% stocks, 40% bonds mix? You can set that up through index mutual- or exchange-traded funds or invest through a target-date fund.In either case, the money you contribute goes where you want it to go every month. You are not timing the market.Of course, all of these features can be incorporated into any retirement plan. All you have to do it set it up using the lowest-cost passive funds on the market.My suggestion is that you or your employer can cherry-pick funds from the Fidelity, iShares, Schwab, SPDR and Vanguard groups.However you approach this subject, keep in mind that the more you automate, the lesser the chance of you getting in the way of consistent saving. Robo-plans are here to stay. You just have to pull the switch to make them work.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0190218894", "http://corporate1.morningstar.com/Morningstar-ETF-Conference/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015NLA8BQ"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:09:14.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
