Paul Jones Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Speculation is rising about a potential bidding war for Australian technology services group UXC after managing director Cris Nicolli revealed US tech giant Computer Sciences Corporation had not been the only interested party ahead of its $428 million bid to buy the company on Tuesday morning .\nMr Nicolli told The Australian Financial Review the company had been fielding interest from at least one other suitor over a period of about four months, but said CSC had firmed as the only serious bidder.\nThe UXC board has indicated that it supports CSC's bid, and CSC has been granted a five-week period of exclusive due diligence, during which UXC has agreed not to solicit any competing offers.\nCSC's bid values UXC at $428 million, with a price of $1.26 a share, however, this was below the company's share price of $1.33 at the time of the bid announcement, which would value the company at $445 million. Shares in UXC have since fallen 6 per cent to $1.25 in post-announcement Tuesday trading.\nUXC is a broad ranging technology services conglomerate, which has grown through numerous acquisitions since 2002. Among its offerings it advises customers on how to implement large technology programs, manages complex technology infrastructure for companies and has divisions consulting on different enterprise applications from the likes of Oracle, SAP and Microsoft.\nMr Nicolli confirmed that prior to the announcement UXC had been looking at its options for a sale of the business, due to the number of initial enquiries it was receiving from potential suitors. It is understood that UXC is being advised on the transaction by Nomura.\nAssessing options \"It would be fair to say that we have had significant number of overtures, which led us to have a closer look at the process of what we should do,\" Mr Nicolli told the Financial Review .\n \"Some of them are ambit claims and others are very meaningful, but it is fair to say that there was a competitive process going on, and CSC has put its best foot forward and offers a very strong complimentary fit around customer base, expertise and geographic coverage.\"\nWhen asked if he believed it was likely that another bid would emerge now that CSC had shown its hand, Mr Nicolli said it was too early to tell.\n\"It's possible, that is one of the challenges we see in the market,\" he said.\n\"There may be people that have spoken to us in the past that want to show interest, but also there may be people we have spoken to in the past that don't want to do anything, I really don't know.\"\nIn a research note to clients on Tuesday Patersons Securities analyst Ben Kakoschke said that while UXC had agreed not to solicit any competing transactions: \"T here is always the possibility of a superior offer being flushed out .\"\nLong time target Chief executive of technology advisory firm capioIT, Phil Hassey, said CSC's approach for UXC hadn't come as a big surprise because there had been rumours of UXC being a possible acquisition target by global tech vendors for the past few years. He said that, unless a superior bid emerged, he expected UXC investors to accept the bid.\nMr Hassey drew parallels with the 2014 $171 million acquisition of Australian service firm Oakton by global player Dimension Data as an indication that further deals could happen locally in the future. Other locally listed tech services firms include SMS Management and Technology, Data#3 and ASG Group.\n\"The number of potential candidates is shrinking. It would not surprise to see the likes of HP and Fujitsu look to be part of the consolidation to meet the extra scale The focus will now be on the other Australian vendors to identify their future as either an independent stance or to be acquired,\" Mr Hassey said.\nMr Nicolli said that his immediate concern was to make sure the company's 3000 staff were well informed and knew what to expect. It has businesses in three separate divisions; advisory and consulting, enterprise applications and IT infrastructure .\nSome of its best known businesses are Red Rock Consulting, ServiceNow partner Keystone, Eclipse and Oxygen.\nStaff concerns He has been managing director of UXC since 2010, having initially run the company's technology division since 2002. He said he doesn't intend to move to CSC permanently if the deal goes through.\n\"I will take on responsibility for making any transition happen as seamlessly as possible and then I will be available to CSC to help them get any benefits that they think I can help them with, but my intention is not to apply to run any part of CSC,\" Mr Nicolli said.\nHe said discussions with CSC hadn't yet progressed to cover what will happen to all of UXC's staff and divisions, but he expected most employees would move across to CSC.\n\"We still need to go through the exclusive due diligence period, and after that the local team will determine what parts of UXC are absolutely vital to them,\" he said.\n\"Obviously there will be some synergies, but it is pretty hard to take a business doing almost $700 million in revenue and wrap it into another one without taking most staff across with you.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "http://www.uxc.com.au/our-business/", "https://twitter.com/@SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-10-06T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:06:19.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
