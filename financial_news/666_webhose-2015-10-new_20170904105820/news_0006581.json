Photo: Graham Tidy\nIt seems like only yesterday that the biggest threat to the Australian economy was slowing growth in China, by far our largest trading partner, and the related decline in mining-related investment and commodity prices.\nAs long as other sectors of the economy struggled to make up for the drop in resources-related activity, growth in Australia's gross domestic product risked slipping below 2 per cent a year, or could even contract for a couple of quarters, according to the most pessimistic forecasters.\nNow, a growing number of commentators say bigger risks are accumulating in the overheated property markets of Sydney and Melbourne, where record low interest rates have fuelled robust demand from first home-buyers and buy-to-let and buy-to-flip investors. This, in turn, has encouraged developers to build new apartments and houses, and consumers to spend on furniture and other household goods and services.\nHowever, recent auction clearance rates and other indicators suggest demand for new and existing housing is slowing, as prices drift out of reach for many and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority makes it harder for banks to lend to property speculators. In effect, APRA is being asked to apply the brakes after the Reserve Bank of Australia has turbo-charged the engine by cutting the cash rate to a record low 2 per cent.\nAdvertisement While RBA governor Glenn Stevens has done this to smooth Australia's economic diversification away from mining-related activities, he has also been acutely aware of the risks of inflating a property bubble. Most economists have drawn short of referring to double-digit percentage growth in the Melbourne and Sydney markets as a bubble, but they, too, now worry that a price correction could do more damage to the broader economy than the Chinese slowdown. Such a flattening or drop in prices would be driven by Australia's slowing population growth and the pace at which new dwellings are coming on to the market.\nThose who have borrowed heavily to speculate by selling on or letting out might suddenly find themselves working in an over-supplied market, making it harder for them to cover mortgage costs. Those who bought to simply live in their house or apartment could feel that they've paid too much once prices start to soften, hurting confidence about eventually upscaling or taking profits further down the track. Any pressure on the RBA to start to lifting interest rates as inflation returns would just add to this.\nThe feeling that one's paper worth is shrinking rather than growing can discourage consumption in other areas, such as holidays, dining out and life's other little luxuries.\nThis, in turn, may affect many of the businesses that are supposed to be benefiting from record low interest rates.\nWith the commodity boom well and truly over, Australia can ill afford an abrupt end to the housing boom.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:11:41.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
