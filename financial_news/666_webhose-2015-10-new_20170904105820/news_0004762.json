Comment Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 6:22 PM By HOWARD FRANK Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 6:22 PM » Social News Fewer residents of the farming-rich West End live in poverty, according to U.S. Census figures. Each of the four municipalities — Chestnuthill, Eldred, Polk and Ross townships have lower rates of poverty than the county, state and nation. And the area fared better than most of the county’s individual municipalities. Polk Township had the highest rate of residents in the West End living below poverty levels at 10.9 percent. It was followed by Chestnuthill at 7.7 percent and Eldred at 7.5 percent. Ross had the lowest poverty rate, with 7.3 percent of residents living in poverty, according to 2013 U.S. Census data on poverty, the latest figures available. The Census Bureau uses a set of income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the bureau's family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty, according to the census bureau. For individuals not living with family members, their own income is compared with the appropriate threshold. Income thresholds are a combination of income before taxes and do not include capital gains or noncash benefits, such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps The official poverty thresholds don’t vary geographically, but are updated for inflation using Consumer Price Index. The size of a family and the ages of its members also help determine the levels. In 2013, the poverty level for a family of two an annual income of $15,510. That figure increased by $4,020 for each additional member. The poverty threshold in 2015 went up by about 3 percent to $15,930 for a family of two. That number increases by $4,160 for each additional member. Monroe County's poverty rate lagged above that of the West End, but below that of the state and nation. About 12 percent of families and individuals in Monroe were living in poverty in 2013. The state rate was higher, at 13.3 percent, and the nation even higher at 14.9 percent. Poverty rates in West End municipalities were among the lowest in the county. Ross, Eldred, Chestnuthill and Polk townships ranked three, four, five and 10 out of 20 municipalities. Hamilton had the lowest rate of residents living in poverty at 5.1 percent, with the Borough of Stroudsburg at 27 percent and East Stroudsburg at 32.7 percent. Population didn’t seem to correspond with poverty levels among Monroe County municipalities, with a virtually zero correlation between the two measures. Chestnuthill Township had 1,296 people living below poverty levels in 2013. Eldred had 217, Polk had 850 and Ross had 426. Some government aid programs use different poverty measures other than those set by the census bureau. The Department of Health and Human Services poverty sets its own guidelines to determine aid program requirements, according to the bureau.
