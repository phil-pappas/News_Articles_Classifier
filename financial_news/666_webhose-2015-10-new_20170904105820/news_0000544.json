Many now also use apps to shop for stocks.\nThis isn’t technically a new platform since some Indian brokerages have had such systems in place for 4-5 years, but the method is gaining popularity now, mostly due to increased use of smart phones, and also app-based transactions. A number of brokerages are seeing exponential growth in this segment and are working towards making the platform more user-friendly. While for traders moving to an app-based platform for transacting in stocks is intuitive, investors, too, have a lot to gain. In addition to anywhere, anytime trading, access to research and market information also make stock market apps attractive.\nHow stocks apps work\nTill a few years ago, downloading an app and transacting through it was an unknown, uncertain and risky experience. But today most smartphone users have multiple apps.\nStock market apps are simple to use. As with other apps, go to the app store in your smart phone and download the trading app that you want. Most of these apps allow a user to login as a guest; this will let you experience the app, use it to track markets, get information on companies and results, access to research reports and even global market trends. To register as a guest user, you have to provide basic information such as name, email address and mobile phone number. What you can’t do as a guest user is transact or buy and sell stocks and derivatives; for that you will have to open an account with the broker whose app you are using.\nFor most market apps, the account opening can be initiated through the app itself and then the process gets completed offline as some parts of the process, like know-your-client (KYC) requirements, need to be done through physical interaction.

This has enabled many to move to a more convenient platform, which the mobile app offers.”\nWhen you open an account with a brokerage, your bank account and demat account linkages are taken care of and the app will support these so that transactions can happen seamlessly. The process to start using an app might be lengthier for a first-time capital market participant. “For first-timers, certain documents have to be verified in their original form. The process can be initiated through the app and then a relationship manager will take over,” said Kamath.\nStock trading apps are free downloads.\nWhat works...\nThe biggest advantage that apps offer is convenience. “The benefit of an app is that it is mobile, which means trading anytime, anywhere. Moreover, the customer is not dependent on any other entity—it is instant access and immediate execution,” said Arun Chaudhry, head-online and retail channel, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.\nBut it’s not just the convenience of quick execution but also speedy access to information that drives usage. Rahul Jain, head-retail advisory, Edelweiss Financian Services Ltd, said, “There are do-it-yourself clients who like to do everything themselves and the app is fairly good for them. There is also a relationship manager-driven segment for whom monitoring is also important. With the app, they can monitor prices and information in real time and then call the relationship manager for execution.”\nOn the Web, if you have not set alerts, you might miss updates and news when you aren’t online. Through an app, any relevant updates can be seen immediately as notifications will flash on your screen. This is the other advantage—information and research on apps can be tailored to suit your requirements.\n“Let’s say, you don’t want to place any trade of more than Rs. 1 lakh. This can be built into the app itself. On the research side, soon users will be able to customise research. If you are only interested in delivery-based stock calls, then you will be able to choose to receive notifications and information on such stocks only rather than having to see even the trading calls,” said Chaudhry. App platforms are still evolving, and sooner or later, these features will be available across brokerages. “Flexibility to design some of the screens depending on whether you are a trader or a delivery-based client will happen soon in our app,” said Kamath.\n...what doesn’t\nWhile the apps may be gaining popularity, the biggest impediment to successful usage is the poor quality of mobile network. “If using the app while travelling, one may encounter issues with the network. An improvement in network will be a huge advantage,” said Chaudhry.\nWith the Motilal Oswal app, if the network drops when you are in the middle of a transaction, the app itself has a number through which you can immediately connect with a dealer to complete the transaction.\nBut not all apps have this; in some cases, you will have to have a number handy to call in such an eventuality.\nMost stock trading apps are light enough to be run on 2G networks as well, but optimisation is an ongoing process. More features will get added to apps as comfort with network improves. At present, the focus remains on keeping the app light so that it is compatible with networks.\nThe other potential concern is security. “As a culture, we are getting comfortable with transacting through the mobile phone and security is well understood,” said Kamath. Across Android, iOS and BlackBerry platforms, concerns on transaction security are receding. Vinay Agrawal, chief executive officer, Angel Broking Ltd, said, “With more apps from the banking and financial services space available on the mobile platform, app developers and regulators have taken care to mitigate the risk. Also, some platforms offer an added level of security.”\nMint Money take\nThe acceptance of the app platform has especially increased in the last year. According to data on the website of BSE Ltd, mobile-based transactions accounted for 1% of the total trades as on September 2015 compared to a much lower 0.4% a year ago.\nEdelweiss Securities, too, has seen a marked shift in trades through mobile phones. “17% of daily clients trade through mobile phones, which was 8% in financial year (FY) 2014 and 4% in FY13,” said Jain.\nAt Kotak Securities also, the growth in volumes through the app has been significant and number of users has doubled, said Kamath.\nAs a result of this increase, revenue contribution from the mobile platform has increased for brokerages. Retail brokerages are seeing the trend change quite fast. “The daily logins of clients through mobile phones have increased 400% and the trading turnover has increased from 1.5% to 8% in just a couple of years, which shows the increase in business from mobile app. The mobile app now contributes around 7% of the total revenue,” said Agrawal.\nChaudhry concurs with increase in usage. “About a year back, 1.7% trades were happening through the app. Now, about 6% of all orders come through the app. Revenue contribution is around 4%,” he added.\nWhile there is still an age bias with the younger users—typically in the 20-45 years age group—dominating app usage, the popularity of this platform is set to grow exponentially.\nStock exchanges are working towards increasing the real time trade speed and that can complement such platforms.\nInvestors, however, should embrace the new platform with care. While access to information and research is useful, as is instant trade execution, long-term delivery-based investors should use this facility with care. Just like you need to avoid buying things you don’t need when using an e-tailer’s app, you also have to be mindful of not buying more stocks than you intended to or transacting more frequently than needed just because you can do so at the touch of a finger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T02:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:30:39.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
