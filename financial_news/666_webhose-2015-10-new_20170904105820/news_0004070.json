Whether it will one day prove a master stroke or an expensive mistake remains to be seen. Wayne Taylor Partial success \"The big push when Mike Smith came in was really about enlarging the Asian franchise and this has happened, a bit, but not terribly meaningfully,\" says Young, who has worked in the region for the past three decades and has followed Smith's banking career. \"He set out to achieve a helluva lot at ANZ,\" says Young. \"It's not easy. He's had partial success.\"\nAnd that assessment is backed up by how the sharemarket rates ANZ. When Smith started at ANZ on October 1 2007, the bank's share price was $29.61. It closed yesterday at $27.52.\nOn another measure, ANZ trades at a discount to its peers on a price-to-earnings basis. It trades on a multiple of 10.1 times, compared with Commonwealth Bank at 12.9, National Australia Bank at 12.1 and Westpac Banking Corporation at 11.7.\n Brian Johnson, CLSA's banking analyst, says \"thus far, ANZ's Asia strategy has neither delivered the excess growth or the higher return on equity, which I thought it was premised on\".\nSmith joined ANZ from HSBC where he had worked for three decades, the last three years as head of Asia. During that time he righted the imbalance in HSBC's Asia earnings, where Hong Kong was contributing the lion's share. He set and achieved the goal of a 50-50 split in earnings from Hong Kong and the rest of Asia.\nBold beginnings From there he was lured to ANZ by a board led by then chairman Charles Goode, which gave him a mandate of transforming ANZ into a super regional bank. Building a mini-HSBC must have held its appeal, even though the portfolio of assets ANZ had in Asia were a hodge podge of stakes in existing Asian banks and some organically grown assets.\nSmith began boldly. In December 2007 he outlined his ambition for ANZ in presentations: to grow the Asian operation's contribution to group profits from 7 per cent to 20 per cent. Six years later they hadn't hit this target, even when the Asian earnings were recast to include Europe and the US. The target was then reset to be 25 per cent by 2017. Smith won't be there to see whether that is achieved, but he stated categorically that this is what he wants to be judged upon.\nIn 2013, he told The Australian Financial Review that he wanted the bank's success in Asia to be his legacy. \"What I want for this bank is to be a really great bank in 20 years' time. It's the creation of this super regional bank and the creation of a truly great bank that Australia can be proud of. To me, it's inconceivable that a country with the size of an economy that Australia has and a dependence on its region like virtually no other country with its trade and investment flows, it must have a bank which represents that coverage. It must do, otherwise, it's giving up. That's my legacy, that's what I want.\"\nThere were bumps in the road for Smith. He joined ANZ in 2007 just as the global financial crisis was beginning to unfold. The GFC is typically thought to have begun in July that year when investors lost confidence in the value of sub-prime mortgages that triggered a global liquidity crisis.\n'It must have been horrible' The unfolding crisis exposed weaknesses in ANZ's commercial lending book. \"When Mike Smith got there it must have been horrible,\" says CLSA's Johnson. \"It seemed every big impaired corporate exposure managed to hit ANZ.\" These included Opes Prime, Timbercorp and Centro Properties Group.\nThis was a significant distraction for Smith who spent a lot of time managing the bank through arguably one of its toughest times, say those who were there to witness it such as Alex Thursby, who is ANZ's former head of international and institutional banking. \"Mike did a great job stabilising things and then developing a new strategy and getting it executed,\" says Thursby, who was touted as a one-time potential successor to Smith. He quit ANZ instead to become the boss of the National Bank of Abu Dhabi.\nThursby is a counter to those who say the super regional strategy hasn't delivered. He says as a result of the Asian strategy ANZ is a more diversified bank with strong growth prospects in the region, even at a time when growth particularly in the region's biggest economy China is slowing.\n\"Mike has left a very substantially different bank. There's a sizeable Asia-Pacific business and the bank is well-positioned to continue to work off Mike's legacy. Clearly he was in tenure for a long time and people thought he was doing a good job.\"\nThe GFC also threw up opportunities for ANZ with it able to acquire the Royal Bank of Scotland's Asian assets, which allowed it grow its institutional business. Whether ANZ would pounce during another potential downturn remains to be seen. But given it was recently forced to raise $3 billion in capital, shareholders might not have the appetite. Smith had denied a capital raising was necessary, which saw him end up with egg on his face when it did.\nAustralasia focus In recent years, the focus of ANZ management has shifted back to the Australian business, which has been growing its retail loan book aggressively against the other major banks. The focus has remained on Asia but the importance of Australia was underlined when David Gonski came in as chairman last year. He said it was important that the Australasia business was nurtured and brought to its full potential, meaning more work could be done to lift ANZ from its position as the smallest of the four big banks domestically.\nDuring his tenure Smith has taken on everyone he has seen as critical of ANZ or has differed with his views. In 2012 he noted the problem with bank regulators was that they had no natural predators. \"You have to think who regulates the regulators, and at times they get away scot-free with stuff.\" In 2010, he described Joe Hockey, who was then shadow treasurer, as \"taking economics lessons from Hugo Ch√°vez\" after Hockey called for a banking inquiry and curbs to interest rate increases. It was around this time he also took on those pesky banking analysts and journalists, imploring CEOs to stand up to the short term focus of \"some spotty analyst who couldn't run a two-ticket raffle\".\nHis colourful but more often than not very insightful views on global banking and the economy kept him in the headlines. He remains fearless in his views and in defending himself and his performance at ANZ.\nHe noted yesterday that the unfinished business on his watch was that more could have been done on investing in technology. And as for the Asia strategy?\nWell, it remains an ongoing story that Shayne Elliott will now have to tell and and how well he tells it and executes will be reflected in black and white in the numbers. That's what most chief executives get judged on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:45.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
