They also believe facilities management has “pockets of growth”. \nCarillion rose 19.5p, or 6.5pc, to close at 319.7p. \nThat upgrade came a day after two building products businesses, Travis Perkins (LSE: TPK.L - news ) and SIG (LSE: SHI.L - news ) , warned on profits. \nDespite falling 6pc on Thursday , Travis Perkins recouped some of its losses yesterday, rising by 5.1pc to £19.39 the top FTSE 100 gainer after Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) upgraded it to “buy”. The bank believes Britain’s biggest supplier of building materials now has a more attractive valuation, after the relatively weak share price performance in recent months. \nAmi Galla, of Citigroup, said: “We believe the group’s strategy to modernise its business and strengthen its leadership position should bring more structural gains over the medium term.” \nHowever, mid-cap insulation specialist SIG did not enjoy the same recovery. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) extended its losses after Goodbody downgraded the shares over the company’s unexpected profit warning and the uncertainty over its inability to drive margins. The stock, which has fallen 23.5pc in two days, closed at 137.6p yesterday. SIG three-day graph (Source: Bloomberg) \nIn the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed 122 points shy of where it finished at the end of last year. The blue-chip index has been boosted by China slashing its benchmark interest rates and the European Central Bank suggesting it might ramp up its quantitative easing programme as early as December. \nChris Beauchamp, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , said: “The action seen in the past 24 hours has been more than enough to make up for the sleepy atmosphere that prevailed in the first half of this week. \n“While [China’s] move is a recognition that the economy is slowing, markets can apparently live with this if they believe that the People’s Bank of China is prepared to take steps to counter the weakness.” \nThe FTSE 100 closed 67.8 points, or 1.06pc, higher at 6,444.08. \nChina-exposed stocks enjoyed a strong bounce following the central bank’s decision. However, gains made by miners soon eased. Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) leapt by as much as 9pc before closing at 119.2p up 1.8pc while BHP Billiton was 2.2pc higher and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) advanced 2.2pc. \nOnline grocer Ocado also rallied, up 24.2p to 370.8p, after Amazon gave no hint of entering the UK market during a second-quarter conference call on Thursday night. \nFinally, Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) leapt 4.4pc to £46.41 after its chief executive Flemming Ornskov said it was still committed to taking over US rival Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) . However, he noted it was not the only deal in focus. The shares have rallied in recent weeks amid chatter Shire was interested in acquiring US-based Radius Health (Xetra: 1R8.DE - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:13:17.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
