Rob Homer by Tony Featherstone With demand for food set to soar as the world population reaches almost 10 billion by 2050 , these five strategies will help you gain exposure to food stocks and commodities.\n1. Agribusiness managed funds Only a few Australian funds specialise in global agribusiness. The Colonial First State Global Soft Commodity Share Fund has returned 14.5 per cent annually over three years and the Ironbark GTP Global Equity Agribusiness Fund, managed by Global Thematic Partners, has a 6 per cent annualised return over five years.\nDeutsche Bank's DWS Global Agribusiness Fund is another option. 3F Asset Management's Food and Fibre Fund is an interesting new choice for investors seeking exposure to agriculture-related supply chain businesses.\n2. Global agribusiness shares Several themes dominate global agribusiness funds. Colonial's Global Soft Commodity Share Fund favours grain-handling stocks with a global footprint, such as Archer Daniels Midland. \"We like the supply chain space in agribusiness and firms that shift commodities around the globe,\" says Colonial's Mario Maia. \"Almost perfect crop-growing conditions in the past two years have created a lot of grain inventory that needs to be moved.\"\nProtein producers in emerging markets are another preferred theme. \"The devaluation of the Brazilian real has made that country's agribusiness sector ultra-competitive,\" Maia says. \"China has approved the importation of Brazilian beef and we expect Brazilian companies to increase agribusiness exports across a range of proteins.\" Maia says Minerva Foods, listed on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, is an example.\nAbout a fifth of the Colonial fund is invested in fertiliser stocks. Key holdings include Syngenta AG, Monsanto Company (its takeover bid for Syngenta failed last month), Archer Daniels Midland and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.\n Global Thematic Partners' Ralf Oberbannscheidt​ likes fertiliser companies and agribusiness supply chain managers. \"The market is underestimating the value of companies that can ship surplus wheat from North America to Europe or elsewhere. These are difficult assets to replicate.\" Archer Daniels Midland, giant US agribusiness provider Bunge​ and GrainCorp are examples.\nThe Global Thematic Partners' Agribusiness Fund's 10 top holdings are: Agrium​, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Mosaic Company, CF Industries Holdings, KWS SAAT​, Vilmorin​, Monsanto, Syngenta​, The Andersons and Bunge.\n3. Australian agribusiness shares Fat Prophets chief investment officer Angus Geddes✓ is bullish on a small group of Australian agribusiness stocks. \"We have a very favourable view on the sector,\" he says. \"The long-term thematic of a rising global population needing more food, and Australia's capacity to supply more of it, is compelling. Short term, we expect further falls in the Australia dollar to boost competitiveness, and for sector restructuring to produce faster revenue growth.\"\nGeddes prefers Nufarm and Elders. \"Both have been through difficult, transformative corporate restructures, and [are] in a much stronger position today. We expect further gains as restructuring benefits are realised in the next few years.\"\nNufarm's profit result in September reinforces the agribusiness sector's potential to deliver faster revenue growth, Geddes says. He believes Nufarm could be a takeover target for its key shareholder, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical.\nThe fertiliser and explosives producer Incitec Pivot is another Geddes preferred stock. \"Incitec has been through a capital intensive period as it brings on its Louisiana ammonia plant. As capital spending decreases, Incitec's free cash flow and dividend should increase, and it benefits from a lower Australian dollar. Also, investors who buy Incitec are getting exposure to the Dyno Nobel explosives businesses at the low point in the mining cycle.\"\n4. Exchange-traded funds A handful of ASX-Quote: d exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide exposure to soft commodities. Key options include the BetaShares Agriculture ETF and ANZ ETF Securities funds over a basket of commodities or over corn, grains and wheat.\nBetaShares' Agriculture ETF offers leverage to soybeans, corn, wheat and sugar, and is hedged against currency movements. It is technically a synthetic ETF because it uses derivative instruments to provide access to those commodities because physical storage is not possible.\nBetaShares managing director Alex Vynokur​ says the Agriculture ETF's main benefits are portfolio diversification and an offset against rising inflation. \"Soft commodities historically have a lower relationship to other asset classes, such as equities and bonds. As such, introducing soft commodities to a portfolio can potentially improve its risk-adjusted return. Also, they tend to shelter portfolios if inflation increases.\"\nVynokur says investors who want better portfolio risk diversification should allocate 5 per cent to 10 per cent of a portfolio to agricultural and minerals commodities. \"Australian investors, generally, have very low or no exposure to soft commodities, despite a large, growing middle class in China, and later in India, needing more food. Investors tend to group all commodities together, but soft commodities dance to a different tune compared to bulk or base metals or energy prices, and have held up better than other commodities this year.\"\nThe BetaShares Agriculture ETF has a one-year return of minus 18.5 per cent and has lost an annualised 18.7 per cent over three years. As a currency-hedged ETF, it has not benefited from the Australian dollar's fall. Contrarians could see the ETF's fall as a buying signal.\n5. Rural land Gaining exposure to a diversified portfolio of Australian farmland, through a listed or unlisted fund, is becoming more popular.\nRural Funds Group, Australia's first listed agricultural property trust, owns poultry farms, almond orchards and viticulture. It buys farms and leases them, and its manager, Rural Funds Management, is one of Australia's oldest agricultural investors.\nUnlike many Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (AREITs) in this market, Rural Funds Group trades at a discount to its net asset value (NAV). Its $1.16 unit price compares to its adjusted NAV of $1.22 (which includes independent valuations of water entitlements), meaning it theoretically trades just below its asset backing.\nRural Funds Group in late August increased its distribution guidance for 2015-16 to 8.93¢ per unit, implying a 7.6 per cent yield. As a land owner, it is a lower-risk play on agribusiness compared to investing in farm producers or soft commodities.\n\"A listed property trust over farmland is, in our opinion, the least volatile way to invest in the farm sector,\" says Rural Funds Management CEO David Bryant. \"We are not subject to the same operating risks as a farmer, and benefit from steady growth in farmland values over time, and from rising rental income from indexation and other reviews.\"\nBryant says Rural Fund's core commodities of almonds, poultry and viticulture have good prospects. \"Big sections of the Australian agriculture sector are making good profits, in part because of our falling dollar. Look at the returns Select Harvest has achieved in almonds, or by cotton growers in South Australia, or beef and lamb producers. But things can change quickly in agriculture, which is why you should invest through diversified funds.\"\nFarmInvest Australia chairman Steve Burt also favours a model of investing in farmland through a fund. FarmInvest in February launched the $500 million wholesale Australian Farmland Investment Fund to invest in local agricultural land. The unlisted fund closes in June 2016. FarmInvest's directors manage farms worth $43 million and have achieved a 7.3 per cent annual return over 10 years, net of fees.\nFarmInvest wants to buy large and small farms, and lease them back to farmers. \"We've seen similar models in Canada, where managed funds invest in farms in different regions, and across different commodities, to reduce risk,\" Burt says. \"We expect to see greater consolidation of Australian farmland in the coming decade and believe this trend provides a steady, attractive opportunity for long-term investors who seek a combination of steady yield and exposure to capital growth opportunities, while aiding succession and capacity building for local farmers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:04:10.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
