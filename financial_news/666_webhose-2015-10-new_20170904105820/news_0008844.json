By the time my term of office expires, the 2.2 million jobs will be out there,\" Zhuwawo was quoted as saying. \nZhuwawo said the government was working on a comprehensive national economic empowerment strategy to ensure all Zimbabweans benefited from the country's indigenisation and empowerment processes. \nReports on Monday indicated that the minister had proposed a 10% empowerment levy on companies as part of efforts to generate internal resources to fund the indigenisation programme. \n\"For us to be able to fund empowerment programmes in the long-term, we are proposing the introduction of an empowerment levy and we're empowered by law to propose the law,\" the state-controlled Chronicle newspaper quoted Zhuwawo as saying. \nFin24 reported on Wednesday that Zimbabwe was imposing an additional tax burden on foreign-owned companies after Zhuwawo said the proposed 10% empowerment levy to fund indigenisation and economic empowerment would be raised to 12.5% in 2017. \nHigher taxation framework \nZhuwawo said the empowerment levy would raise $93m in 2016 to fund the country's cash-strapped National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Fund. \nForeign-owned companies in Zimbabwe are already burdened by the country's controversial 2007 indigenisation law that states foreign-owned companies should hand over a 51% shareholding to local partners to reverse imbalances resulting from colonialism. \nZimbabwe also has a higher taxation framework compared to its peers in the region. \nMugabe's critics say the policy is the chief cause of investor aversion with some saying the indigenisation campaign has been fraught with ambiguity and corruption on a grand scale. \nZhuwawo recently attacked the Minister of Finance Patrick Chinamasa over calls for foreign investment, saying requests for the injection of foreign direct investment were against Zanu-PF's indigenisation policy.
