AP Share on twitter by Karen Maley After this week's wild market gyrations, investors are puzzling as to what approach they should take to protect their portfolios from hefty losses.\nHigh profile market analyst, Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at financial services firm Allianz, says that investors need to prepare themselves for ongoing market volatility in the final three months of the year.\n\"We are in a secular rise in volatility, we are shifting volatility regimes\", he said in an interview on CNBC overnight .\nAs a result, he said, investors should prepare themselves to see \"all sorts of price overshoots\". In addition, he predicted markets would also see \"undue contagion\", meaning that \"bad names and good names are going to trade together.\"\nBut on a more positive note, he noted that markets would see occasional \"really sharp\" rebounds.\nIn such market conditions, El-Erian said, it was possible for nimble investors to pick up good assets at \"pretty bargain\" prices, and to improve the quality of their portfolios.\nIn particular, there were likely to be opportunities in what he termed \"completely unhinged\" sectors.\nExciting opportunities \"Emerging markets have become completely unhinged, they're broken in terms of markets. Energy, and high yield is on the verge of getting there … So there's going to be a lot of exciting opportunities.\"\nBut while El-Erian's comments offer investors the hope of perhaps being able to pick up some bargain buys, emerging markets are continuing to haemorrhage capital as investors worry about their declining economic fortunes.\nAccording to the Institute of International Finance, emerging markets are set to suffer a new outflow of capital for the first time since the 1980s, with foreign investor inflows falling to just $US548 billion ($780 billion) this year - even lower than the levels recorded during the peak of the global financial crisis – while outward investment flows were expected to reach $1,089 billion.\nAs a result, emerging countries would suffer net outflows of $541 billion this year, compared with last year's $32 billion of inflows.\nThe IIF said that the countries most at risk were those – like Brazil and Turkey – which run large current account deficits, which have a high level of debt denominated in foreign currencies, and where the political situation was uncertain.\nEarlier this week, Christine Lagarde, who heads the International Monetary Fund , warned that global growth was \"disappointing and uneven\", with emerging economies – which are being hit by the slowdown in China, tumbling commodity prices and the likelihood of rising US interest rates – particularly at risk.\nLagarde added that the problems in some emerging nations, which are facing their fifth consecutive year of slowing growth, could be exacerbated by an increase in US interest rates. According to a study by the IMF, the past decade has seen corporate debt of non-financial companies across large emerging market economies more than quadruple from $US4 trillion in 2004 to more than $US18 trillion in 2014.\n\"Rising US interest rates and a stronger dollar could reveal currency mismatches, leading to corporate defaults – and a vicious cycle between corporates, banks and sovereigns\", she warned.\nOvernight, El-Erian agreed that although the US economy was \"pretty sound\" it was not strong enough to offset slumping activity in the emerging markets.\n\"It's not that powerful to pull everybody out\", he warned, adding that problems in emerging markets could push Europe into recession.\n\"Remember the emerging markets were the locomotive of growth, now they've become the caboose,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnbc.com/mohamed-el-erian/", "https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:12:56.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
