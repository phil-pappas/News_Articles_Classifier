It underpins hundreds of trillions of dollars in financial products globally.\nThe case is the first by the U.S. Justice Department to go to trial following investigations by U.S. and European authorities into whether banks submitted artificial rate estimates to bolster profits on trading derivatives tied to Libor.\nThose investigations resulted in charges against 22 people in the United States and United Kingdom and around $9 billion in regulatory settlements with financial institutions.\nAllen, Rabobank's former global head of liquidity and finance, and Conti, a senior trader, were indicted in October 2014, a year after the Netherlands-based bank reached a $1 billion deal resolving related U.S. and European probes.\nDuring her opening statement, Sipperly said Allen and Conti had been entrusted to make Libor submissions \"honestly and fairly.\"\n\"These men exploited and abused that role over and over again to serve their own ends,\" she said.\nAaron Williamson, Conti's lawyer, said the prosecutors \"cherry picked\" a handful of electronic messages to support their claim, when Conti's 15,000 Libor submissions told another story.\n\"You'll see no evidence Tony's submissions skewed to benefit those traders' positions,\" he said.\nBoth defense lawyers sought to discredit the expected testimony of three ex-Rabobank employees who pleaded guilty and are cooperating in hopes of lenient sentences. Williamson said those men \"panicked and told a story.\"\nThe first of those employees, ex-Rabobank trader Lee Stewart, is expected to testify on Thursday.\nThe case is U.S. v. Allen, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-cr-00272.
