What's worse, these stocks are commonly found in the retirement accounts of millions of investors. \nThe following three stocks pose a clear and present danger to your portfolio. If you want to see a list of the absolute worst stocks you can own right now, take a look at this report called 29 Dangerous Stocks: Sell Now! . Inside, you'll see a full list of the market's most overvalued stocks, and learn the process you can use to keep avoiding them in the future. Click here for a copy . \nA host of factors loom over the global economy that could trigger a major stock market plunge: China's precarious stock market and flagging economy; debt woes and a migrant crisis in the euro zone; violence in the Middle East; political dysfunction in Washington, D.C. The list goes on. The following stocks are already vulnerable on their own accord, but they'd get dragged down the hardest in any market drop. Let's take a look. \nMust Read: Technology Stocks Trigger Technical Warning, Solidifying Negative Market Trend \nOn our list of endangered species, you could include just about any overhyped social media stock, such as LinkedIn ( LNKD - Get Report ) , Twitter ( TWTR - Get Report ) or Yahoo! Inc. ( YHOO - Get Report ) . \nBut I think Facebook ( FB - Get Report ) poses the worst danger, because of its nosebleed valuation combined with investor complacency. \nWith a whopping market cap of $262 billion, Facebook is ostensibly thriving. Every strategy of company founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to be working. The company's revenue took off in 2014 and exceeded $12.4 billion. \nAs the progenitor of social media, Facebook is now heavily investing in the purchase of promising new technology companies. It's also emphasizing mobile and the \"Internet of things.\" Just like a company called...MySpace. \nSure, Facebook now has more than 1 billion monthly active users. But most of these users are millennials, a customer base that's fickle and suffers from a collective short attention span. At the same time, teens are leaving Facebook at the rate of about 1 million a year, for \"cooler\" social media venues such as Snapchat and Instagram (which Facebook owns). \nFacebook now sports an outrageously high trailing 12-month price-to-earnings price-to-earnings ratio of 95, compared to the average price-to-earnings ratio of 47.4 for Internet information providers and 20.16 for the technology sector as a whole. All it would take is for one disruptive technology to send Facebook falling on its face. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:45:05.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
