Navistar will add 300 jobs and invest more than $12 million in the factory. Exact terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but the trucks will feature GM-built engines.\nBoth GM and Navistar will sell the trucks. GM said the trucks will once again carry the Chevrolet brand but won’t be sold under the GMC brand. A spokesman declined to say if Chevrolet will reactivate the Kodiak nameplate for the trucks.\nThe trucks are generally used in the service industry as tow trucks, dump trucks, delivery trucks and for construction work.\nFor GM, the announcement underscores the reversal of fortune the auto maker is experiencing as both consumers and businesses, particularly in the U.S., continue buying. Many business and fleet operators had delayed purchases when the U.S. economy stalled in 2008 and 2009.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:22:34.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
