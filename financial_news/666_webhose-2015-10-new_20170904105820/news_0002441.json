Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith Andy Vesey was leaving the Bulgarian Prime Minister’s office in Sofia last year after chasing an outstanding payment for his employer, US power giant AES Corporation, when he got a text message about an offshore job. In the gloom of the government building, he could barely make out what it was about.\nAfter checking the role was in Australia (an English-speaking country ) leading AGL Energy, the then New York-based chief operating officer of the energy multinational did a quick search to find out more. Reading that AGL was Australia’s largest owner, operator and developer of renewable energy, he thought: “That’s for me.” Vesey quips that when he got here, he found that AGL was also the country’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.\nEven if the story has been embellished – one suspects his due diligence was more thorough – the anecdote illustrates the journey the 60-year-old has embarked on at the $11 billion utility that turned on the first gas street lamp in Sydney in 1841.\nMost investors had seen little need for fresh blood when chairman Jerry Maycock advised in May last year that CEO and long-time company man Michael Fraser would retire by mid-2015 after almost eight years running the business. The choice of the little-known American came as a surprise.\nBold beginning Nine weeks into his tenure and little more than a year after his predecessor signed off on AGL’s $1.5 billion takeover of giant NSW coal-fired power generator Macquarie Generation, Vesey revealed the plan to take the company out of coal-based electricity by 2050. The date for the transition was attacked by environmental groups as too distant to be meaningful, but it was a turnaround, given AGL had only just bulked up on coal generation, including its 2012 full takeover of Victorian brown coal generator Loy Yang A .\nSince then, Vesey has ramped up the profile of AGL’s nascent New Energy division, aiming to tap into surging consumer appetite for rooftop solar and a more flexible, controllable power supply.\nHis enthusiastic portrayal of a future energy supply system – and a super-functional, high-tech power grid that connects appliances in an “internet of things” – gave some the impression that Vesey was shaping up as an industry disruptor who would change AGL’s direction and shake up the whole sector. Yet Vesey rejects the disruptor tag. Instead, he sees his role as leading a “transformation” of the business model that sets AGL up to thrive in the rapidly changing energy market.\n “The way we make money today may not be the way we make money tomorrow,” he says. “I can’t tell you what it looks like, but I’m open to recognise that we are going to change and the change is going to be significant, and I’d rather be out in front of that than trailing behind it.”\nDefence mechanism Growing up in the Hungarian neighbourhood of the East 70s district in Manhattan in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Vesey and his older sister were firmly guided on a path of study and effort by their parents, who were convinced of the opportunities a decent education would bring.\nHis father, initially classified as an enemy alien when he arrived with his family in the 1930s, gained his US citizenship by volunteering for the armed services, becoming a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division and seeing active service in Europe during World War II.\n“There was this whole sense of a strong work ethic, but also of service,” says Vesey, who was brought up strictly all-American and only last year claimed his Hungarian citizenship. School was dominated by books and sport – soccer, track and wrestling; the latter, Vesey says, taken up partly in self-defence: “No one would mess with you if you were a wrestler.”\nAt university – “there were no ifs or buts” that would be his path – Vesey enrolled in an engineering program at the private liberal arts institution Union College in the small city of Schenectady, the home of General Electric.\nAfter five years of study, which spanned the time of the United States’ first oil embargo , Vesey earned bachelor’s degrees in mechanical engineering and arts, majoring in economics. He passed up offers from Mobil Oil and the US Navy to work as a nuclear submariner, and in 1978 plumped for a slightly higher-paying job as an electric planning engineer at New York utility Consolidated Edison, which had a salary of $US16,500.\nIn the evenings, he attended graduate school at NY University and “never saw the sun rise and never saw it set” for 18 months as he packed in the hours, concentrating on nuclear reactor kinetics and, for his senior project, building a solar collector made of old beer cans scavenged from around the university, which successfully heated a science lab.\n“It was sort of ingrained in my genes that education was a good thing, so more is better,” he says. And his employer was paying for the course. “I just thought, OK, I’ll be smarter, I’ll be better.”\nHigh stakes Vesey sees parallels between OPEC’s oil embargoes of the US in the 1970s with today’s task of shifting away from coal-fired power. “Oil prices were going through the roof, everybody was trying to figure out how to get back on coal, and that opened up thinking about wind technology and all the others,” he says.\nNow, Vesey has just as big a challenge to shift AGL away from coal and, while the 2050 date is seen by some as “greenwashing”, he counters that moving more quickly risks losing value. At stake are also some 1500 jobs at the three plants – almost half AGL’s workforce.\nThe commitment not to extend the life of any coal-fired stations will see the Liddell unit in the Hunter Valley close in 2022. But the latest date for closing Bayswater, the larger MacGen generator, is 2035, and Loy Yang A even later, in 2048.\nVesey says a more significant part of the greenhouse policy he devised is AGL’s pledge not to buy any more coal-fired generators, ruling it out of possible privatisations in Queensland in which AGL was expected to participate. “That’s a big option that has been taken off the table,” he says.\n“I do think there’s a lot of value to [the policy], because it does definitely set dates and it also makes commitments that we will not acquire, we will not finance and we will not extend; that is really powerful.”\nDivestment drama Vesey says the deals under Fraser to add the lowest-cost generators in NSW and Victoria were “smart moves”. “If we didn’t have this issue of carbon, then these would have been thoroughly brilliant decisions for a long time out.” The addition of MacGen fuelled the 12.1 per cent increase in AGL’s core profit in 2014-15.\nBut Vesey won’t say whether he would have done the same thing. His reasoning seems circular; the deal improves AGL’s financial capacity to deal with the carbon challenge: “The fruition of Michael’s strategy is what’s going to give us the gunpowder to move into the future.”\nHowever, it created a much bigger carbon challenge. Loy Yang is the biggest carbon emitter of any power generator in the country and AGL owns three of the top eight carbon emitting power plants. AGL’s carbon emissions are estimated to be 7.5 per cent of Australia’s total annual emissions, while the proportion of energy it generated from renewables has shrunk from 14.5 per cent registered in 2014.\nAGL expects to reduce emissions by approximately 7.5 million tonnes by 2022 and says it is investing in carbon capture and more efficient technology.\nBut some shareholders and activist groups want more. AGL is the only local electricity player caught in the Norwegian government’s $US900 billion ($1250 billion) pension fund initiative to divest from companies depending on coal for more than 30 per cent of their generation. The fund owned 1.16 per cent of AGL, the country’s second-biggest retailer of electricity and gas, as of December 31.\nWith the fossil fuel divestment strategy gaining serious traction worldwide, small shareholders are ramping up the pressure on AGL and arch-rival Origin Energy to make a more decisive and rapid move away from coal.\nBack to basics Julian Poulter, the London-based chief executive of the Asset Owners Disclosure Project, which aims to protect retirement savings from the risks of climate change, says AGL needs “to proactively diversify” away from fossil fuels much faster.\nIt says the company is facing multiple risks by not moving faster, including reputational risks, being seen as “part of the problem.” It also points out that AGL set a target for emission reduction in its 2012 annual report but this wasn’t met or mentioned in its 2014 report. In fact, emission intensity tripled between 2011 and 2014. AODP also asks why there are no emission reduction targets in AGL’s greenhouse gas policy. An AGL spokeswoman says AGL expects to reduce emissions by approximately 7.5 million tonnes by 2022.\nAnd Vesey blames lack of tougher government regulation. He says the government should set performance requirements for each major emitter. He’s called on the Australian government to copy the US and Canada and set minimum carbon emissions standards for power plants.\n“You can set policies that say: ‘Invest money to clean up your plant or shut it down.’ That’s an economic market-based decision and I think a sovereign has every right to basically dictate what it expects in performance in these plants,” Vesey says.\nLate in September AGL committed to aligning its business with a scenario that limits global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Concerned shareholders welcomed the statement to disclose in 2016 how it will meet this pledge.\nAnd his commitment to encourage dirtier power plants to shut down and support more renewable plants has been welcomed in some quarters. “It was music to my ears,” says Miles George, managing director of wind power producer Infigen Energy.\nPositive and constructive Emma Herd – chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing funds with about $1 trillion under management – describes the publication of AGL’s greenhouse policy as “really positive and constructive”, and says Vesey has contributed to “a more practical and rational discussion” around the risks of carbon emissions.\nDescribing himself as a “technologist”, Vesey says he is not well enough informed to hold a personal belief on the science of climate change. But in any case, what he believes is not the issue.\n“If my customers believe it, if people potentially investing in my equity are acting as if it’s true, then I have to be responsive.”\nIn fact, acknowledging that the future is going to be carbon-constrained is one of three key drivers behind Vesey’s strategy for AGL, alongside the proliferation of digital technology and the increased importance of customer retailing in the value chain.\nVesey says the real focus is how best to serve AGL’s 3.8 million customers, using data on consumer behaviour and needs, and applying new technology to make customers more loyal. “It’s not just about sending them the electrons and sending them the bill; it’s how we’re working at a much more intimate level with customers,” he says.\nVesey has stepped up efforts to tap into the solar revolution that has captured 1.4 million households across the country and helped drive a downturn in demand for power from the grid.\nAt an investor day in the Hunter Valley in May, he took to the stage in a glitzy presentation some likened to a TED talk, peppered with management-speak, to outline the vision for AGL.\nHe went public on the goal for 1 million “smart” connections to consumers and businesses by 2020 by the business that spans the rooftop solar, smart metering and battery storage areas.\nHigh-tech vision The hugely competitive retailing sector – customer churn rates in Victoria are among the world’s highest – sets the stage for innovation in energy supply, while digital technologies and increased awareness of energy use have increased customer expectations for price transparency and control.\nVesey says retailers will need to compete on innovation, not just on price, and points to a future where consumers and their multiple devices and appliances are connected by a super-intelligent grid, able to move electricity to where it is needed both efficiently and reliably.\nHis vision of the grid as the backbone of a high-tech, smart power-supply system puts him at odds with some others, such as NRG Energy chief executive David Crane, who predicts networks will become increasingly irrelevant as more customers generate their own power from rooftop panels and battery systems.\nVesey talks of a time in the future when “every end-use device, based on consumer preferences, will work in real-time arbitrage to trade electricity between every other device that’s connected to a network”. The grid that makes it all happen efficiently and cost-effectively needs to be large and extremely reliable.\n“As a responsible manager of this business and steward of my shareholders, if I believe that is the future, what should I be doing today to position myself for that future?” he asks.\n“If you look at the opportunities, it’s not about solar rooftops, batteries; it’s that whole ecosystem of technology that is going to make that future happen.”\nSelling wind Of AGL’s more than 10,000 megawatts of electricity generation capacity, coal accounts for almost 7000 megawatts, and gas another 1320, leaving renewables a small part of the portfolio. Yet AGL has invested more than $3 billion over the years in wind and solar projects, including two large-scale solar projects starting up this year.\nEven so, the $50 million a year being injected into New Energy remains a fraction of the $350 million of stay-in-business investment required by AGL’s coal generation business.\nBut Vesey has put a stake in the ground with firm targets for the division: $400 million revenue by 2020; 600 gigawatt-hours a year of rooftop solar generation; and break-even before interest and tax by 2018.\nAGL in September sold its half-share in the 420-megawatt Macarthur wind farm project in Victoria – the largest in the southern hemisphere – to Morrison & Co for $532 million, part of a $1 billion asset divestment program launched by Vesey. AGL will still operate the venture and buy electricity and renewable energy certificates from it.\nUnder a simplification of the business structure implemented by Vesey, retailing and generation are now housed together and accounted for $2.06 billion of earnings before interest and tax in 2014-15. In comparison, the New Energy business is in its infancy, with $2 million of EBIT last financial year.\nIn addition to the $1 billion of asset divestments, AGL is targeting $470 million of savings in costs and working capital by mid-2017. The changes look to have gone down well in the market, with AGL shares hitting a post-GFC high of $17.15 in August, before sliding with the rest of the market.\nBut Investors Mutual portfolio manager Jason Teh says AGL’s current performance results from decisions made by Fraser and it will be two or three years before the market can judge Vesey’s efforts.\nCSG trouble AGL is controversially planning to develop a coal seam gas supply project at its Gloucester site in NSW. Vesey says it is a viable technology that can be applied safely and sustainably. But there are other factors to consider: economics and the positions of stakeholders and communities for the decision to be taken early next year.\nVesey’s open-door policy has seen him hold meetings with CSG opponents, including Groundswell Gloucester , at AGL’s North Sydney headquarters, raising hopes AGL will drop the project. But Vesey says he is still keen to go ahead even though he has abandoned the company’s strategy of increasing self-sufficiency in gas production in the belief there will be ample supply.\nCorporate change It was at Consolidated Edison, one of the US’s largest utilities, where Vesey’s career expanded to combine technology and strategy. A professional turning point came when working for a team scrutinising the vastly over-budget Nine Mile Point, Unit 2 nuclear reactor. Vesey calls it getting his MBA: “That’s where I turned from being an engineer and technologist into a general manager; not only learning about the business, but learning how you make companies change.”\nHe describes his style as face-to-face and verbal, which is why he wouldn’t consider a CEO role in a non-English-speaking country.\n“I don’t hide in my office and communicate by email,” he says. “I need to be out, I need to be engaging people, and that’s not just my people, that’s stakeholders and others.”\nMarket response Vesey’s old boss at AES had warned him he’d be bored at the Australian utility after his high-flying role at the multinational.\nBut Vesey thought not: “All the challenges that I’ve seen around the world, whether it be retail competition, technology changes, operational efficiency, lack of public policy clarity, customer service, all those things are here,” he says.\nSo far, the immediate challenge has not been a lack of knowledge of company and industry issues, but Vesey’s own reflexes in a different business culture. “I have to get counsel on it, because I don’t know if my natural reflexes are necessarily the correct ones,” he says.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
