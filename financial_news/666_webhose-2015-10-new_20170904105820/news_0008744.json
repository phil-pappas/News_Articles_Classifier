(AP) - Apple has filled a void on its board of directors with James Bell, the former chief financial officer for aircraft maker Boeing Co.\nBell becomes the only African American on Apple's board, helping the iPhone and iPad maker diversify its corporate hierarchy at a time when major technology companies are under fire for not having enough women and minorities in leadership roles and its overall workforce.\nApple already has two women on what is now an eight-director board.\nBell fills a vacancy created when J. Crew Group CEO Millard \"Mickey\" Drexler relinquished his spot earlier this year.\nBesides serving as Boeing's CFO, Bell also was the company's interim CEO in 2005.\nBell also sits on the boards of JP Morgan Chase, Dow Chemical and another technology company, CDW.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:32:13.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
