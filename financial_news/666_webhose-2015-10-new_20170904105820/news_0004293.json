The passage of these bills will improve governance not only in the petroleum sector but also in the other resource industries,' he said. \nProf Adjaye also called for the passage of the Budget Act, with specific provision for an independent Budget Office, which would provide technical expertise for analyzing and monitoring the Budget, and making recommendations to Parliament. \n'We believe that the current method of allocating funds under the Annual Budget Funding Amount is inefficient and that it diminishes the developmental impact of the petroleum revenues,' he said. \nHe therefore advocated for a more inclusive approach in decisions and projects to be funded, as well as the formation of a committee of stakeholders to advice to sector Minister. \nGNA Business & Finance Follow Us Not only was Ghana's President Mills not a great leader, he was not even a good one.
