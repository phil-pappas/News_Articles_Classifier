By Alison Steed | Telegraph – 10 hours ago 0.00 0.00 \nAs the Government offers the opportunity to boost your old age income, our Expat Money columnist got an expert to crunch the numbers \nFancy getting a bit more pension? Who wouldn't? Well for the next 18 months you have the chance to get more from your UK state pension if you wish but it does not come cheap. \nThe Government has decided that for 18 months beginning this month you can buy additional pension payments worth an extra £25 above the maximum standard amount of £115.95. \nThe cost of the benefit varies depending on your age, and as you might expect the older you are the cheaper it is to buy the uplift. The price is £22,250 if you are 65. By the time you're 70 the price is £19,475. If you're 80 it is £13,600. \nYou make the extra payments via what are known as class 3A National Insurance contributions, and to qualify you have to reach state pension age before April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 6, 2016. \nThe Department for Work and Pensions expects around 265,000 people to take up the offer. The question is, should you? \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) depends on how long you think you are going to live after you make the payment. Of course, this is impossible to predict but Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , has crunched some numbers to help you make a decision. \nSince you would get £25 per week extra, that equates to £1,300 a year. Mr McPhail has compared this with what you would receive if you put that money into an annuity instead. \nIf you are aged 65 and you want to get an extra £25 a week in retirement, it would cost you £35,215 to buy this through a standard annuity, giving a yield of 3.69 per cent for the money you are putting in. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if you bought a seriously enhanced annuity where you can get a better deal from an annuity provider if you have an illness because you are less likely to live as long it would cost you £26,094 to get the same boost to income being offered by the Government. \nThe only time a seriously enhanced annuity is cheaper to get the same benefit is when you are 80, and even then the difference is marginal. You would pay £13,600 to the Government to get the extra £25 per week, while with the seriously enhanced annuity it would cost you £13,594 - £6 less. \nYou should not forget either that the UK state pension offers 50pc of income as a death benefit for your spouse, with a guaranteed inflation-linked income for most pensioners. \nI say most, because UK pensioners in the likes of Canada, Australia and South Africa have their pensions frozen at the level they were when they left the UK. Expats affected by this would be far better off spending their money elsewhere. \nAs for how long you might live - Mr McPhail has looked at some life projections from the Office for National Statistics. \nMen aged 60 are expected to live another 22.35 years, while women should survive another 25.17 years. At 70, life expectancy for men falls to 14.56 years and to 16.81 years for women and by 80 that drops further still to 8.22 for men, and 9.65 for women. \nSo based on the average life expectancy and a payment of £1,300 a year, a man aged 70 would pay £19,475 to get the £25 a week uplift, but would only receive £18,928 in return before he died. \nWomen on the other hand would receive £21,853 so would gain based on the typical life expectancy but neither of these figures take into account the effect of inflation-linking, which would increase the amount received in real terms but reduce your spending power in almost equal measure. \nSo, is paying for this pension boost a good idea? As with all of these things, it will depend on your circumstances and the best thing to do is to get some good advice from an expert in pensions. \nAs an expat, you should also take into account the effect of currency risk as you will need to convert your state pension which is always paid in sterling to the currency of the country you are living in. This will impact on its value in the way that UK pensioners do not need to think about, and only once all of the factors are taken into consideration can you make the right decision. \nAlison Steed is founder and editor of MyMoneyDiva.com , a personal finance website offering information and deals.
