The stock ended down 19.2 percent at $118.61, its lowest level since October 2014. \nShares of Allergan (AGN.N), which has a business model similar to that of Valeant, was down 1.7 percent at $259, cutting earlier losses after the company said nearly all of its drugs are being distributed through traditional wholesale and retail channels. \nAlso in the healthcare sector, insurers Aetna (AET.N), Humana (HUM.N), Anthem (ANTM.N) and Cigna (CI.N) all fell at least 3 percent after Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she had \"serious concerns\" about the mergers the companies were proposing. \nA drop in crude oil prices weighed on the S&P 500 energy sector (.SPNY), which fell 1 percent. That led sector declines for the S&P 500, followed by materials (.SPLRCM), down 0.9 percent, and S&P health care (.SPXHC), also down 0.9 percent. \n\"Oil inventories were up quite a bit, so energy was down and that weighed down the market. Going into the afternoon the buyers were just lined up to watch as we drifted lower into the close,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. \n\"Also there was weakness in healthcare, not just in individual stocks, but that sector underperformed.\" \nThe Dow Jones industrial average (.DJI) fell 48.5 points, or 0.28 percent, to 17,168.61, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 11.83 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,018.94 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 40.86 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,840.12. \nOn the plus side, shares of General Motors (GM.N) rose 5.8 percent to $35.42, while Boeing (BA.N) rose 1.7 percent to $141.19, after both industry heavyweights reported better-than-expected results. \nFerrari (RACE.N) was up 5.8 percent at $55 in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. \nStocks have mostly gained this month following a sharp selloff in the third quarter. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,173 to 888, for a 2.45-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,066 issues fell and 717 advanced for a 2.88-to-1 ratio favouring decliners. \nThe S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 52 new highs and 82 new lows. \n(Editing by Don Sebastian and Chizu Nomiyama)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:04:45.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
