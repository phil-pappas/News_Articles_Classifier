To name a few: plunging commodity prices, wobbly equity markets, weak world trade, reduced profit forecasts for American companies and lower long-term inflation expectations. In recent weeks, a new one has joined the list: rising corporate-bond spreads.\nThese spreads—the difference between the interest rates paid by governments and blue-chip companies and those paid by riskier borrowers—reflect the risk of default. Rising spreads imply that investors are getting antsier about being repaid. That anxiety may well stem from worry about the economy.\nIn this section Assessing the assessments Upwardly mobile Red scare The vultures circle Less of the same Under the cosh Money for everything Taking a pounding Emerging markets Recessions and depressions Economies British economy World economy\nSpiking credit spreads have often been a harbinger of recession (see chart). As David Ranson of Wainwright Economics argues: “Yield spreads represent a market assessment of the strength of the economy and are not affected by any of the technical measurement problems that plague the GDP figures.”\nAs an indicator, credit is clearly not entirely reliable: a rise in spreads in 2012 was not followed by a downturn. As yet there is no sign of a rise in the default rate on high-yield debt: it dropped to 2.3% in August, according to Moody’s, well below the historical average of 4.5%. However, the proportion of American corporate bonds classed as “distressed” (a yield ten percentage points or more higher than Treasury bonds) has risen to 15.7%, a four-year high. Liquidity in the corporate-bond market is not great, since banks have reduced their market-making activity. This can lead to sharp price moves if institutions lose their enthusiasm for credit. David Lloyd of M&G, a fund manager, says current conditions resemble “a temporary buyers’ strike”.\nMany will point to the problems of energy and mining firms and argue that the rise in bond spreads is yet another manifestation of the fall in commodity prices. Worries about the health of Glencore, a big mining firm, led to a plunge in its share price and a rise in its bond yields this week.\nHowever, the fall in commodity prices is itself being driven by a worrying slowdown in demand from China and the rest of Asia. South Korea, seen as a bellwether economy, has suffered a 14.7% fall in exports over the past year. Even India’s central bank, presiding over one of the strongest economies in Asia, decided to cut rates by half a percentage point on September 29th, citing flagging global demand.\nSlower emerging-market growth creates another problem for bond investors to worry about. The debt of non-financial firms in emerging markets quadrupled between 2004 and 2014, according to a new report from the IMF. Over the same period, the average ratio of corporate debt to GDP in emerging markets rose by 26 percentage points. That debt will be harder to service as growth slows.\nThe role of credit in driving booms and exacerbating busts is extremely important. Stronger credit growth tends to boost economic activity and push up asset prices—encouraging further credit growth since banks become more confident about lending in a world of higher asset values. This is a virtuous circle. But after the peak is reached, asset prices fall, banks become less keen on lending and activity declines—the circle turns vicious.\nIn a recent speech Andrew Haldane, the chief economist at the Bank of England, talked of a “large slug of global liquidity” that has “by turns inflated then deflated capital flows, credit, asset prices and growth in different markets and regions”. The Anglo-Saxon crisis of 2008-09 was the first manifestation of this problem, the euro-zone crisis of 2011-12 was the second, and we may have entered into a third crisis, this time in emerging markets, he argues.\nMatt King of Citigroup points out that capital flows into emerging markets seem to have stalled. Furthermore, the central banks of emerging markets have been selling, rather than buying, assets. This means that, despite the efforts of the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, central banks are no longer net buyers of financial assets at the global level. Given the huge role played by central banks in supporting financial markets since 2008, this is a worry. And given the role played by emerging markets in supporting global growth, their problems are a concern, too.\nThe rise in credit spreads is not proof that recession is imminent—it is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. But it is an indication that financial stresses are beginning to emerge. One swallow does not make a summer. But the sudden appearance of a vulture circling overhead ought to raise serious concerns.\nEconomist.com/blogs/buttonwood\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20151003_FNC015.png"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:50:49.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
