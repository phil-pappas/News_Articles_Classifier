Goldman does not have a consumer banking business, and makes its money providing financial advice to companies and high net worth individuals, as well as a significant stock, bonds, and commodities trading operation.\nNet revenue in Goldman’s fixed income, currency and commodities business was $1.46 billion this quarter, down a third from a year earlier.\nGoldman’s lending and investing business, the firm’s own investments, also took a hit this quarter, posting revenue of $670 million, down 60 percent from a year ago. The firm said its investments ”were negatively impacted by a significant decrease in global equity prices.”\nOne positive note in Goldman’s results was its investment banking division, which saw a 6 percent increase in net revenue from a year ago. The amount of money Goldman made in advising companies through mergers and acquisitions, one of the firm’s highest profile businesses, was $809 million in the quarter, up 36 percent.\nNot surprisingly, the firm’s employee compensation levels shrank, a reflection that Goldman employees are largely paid in bonuses and for performance. The amount of money Goldman set aside for compensation was $2.35 billion in the quarter, down 16 percent from a year ago.\nThe results did not meet Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.94 per share. Revenue also did not meet analysts’ expectations of $7.29 billion.\nGoldman’s stock fell $2.31, or 1.3 percent, to $177.20 in pre-market trading.\n 15, 2015 11:19 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:35:03.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
