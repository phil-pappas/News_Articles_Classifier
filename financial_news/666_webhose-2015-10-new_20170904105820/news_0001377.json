It allows small businesses to instantly connect their loans, offset accounts and credit cards between the two organisations.\n\"Clearly, the richness of data in Xero that the customer is able to authorise the bank to access means a more complete picture of the customer's financial health can be achieved, and this will tend to speed up any loan approval process,\" Xero Australia managing direct Chris Ridd told Fairfax Media.\nAdvertisement Many small-business bank customers find it difficult to compile the information required by banks to get loans, Mr Ridd said.\n\"For the first time, small businesses can submit published reports, such as P&L and aged debtors, direct from their accounting software to the bank, so NAB can make a faster loan decision. This means less time chasing reports, compiling them, and ensuring they make it to the right person at the bank.\"\nNAB and Xero have a long relationship; when Xero listed in New Zealand in 2007, one of its initial equity investors was NAB's New Zealand subsidiary, BNZ. NAB would not confirm the size of its equity stake in Xero, which is now dual listed in New Zealand and Australia and has a market capitalisation of about $2 billion.\n\"We were at the forefront of large banks investing equity capital into technology start-ups,\" NAB chief executive Andrew Thorburn said. Xero was supplying NAB with a much richer set of data about its customers, in real time, he said. \"What we are receiving through that electronic supply is all their latest data and accounting information â€“ live, up-to-date, electronic, [which is] a good step forward,\" he told the Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce last week.\nNAB will pay Xero a small commission for any referrals from the accounting system to the bank. Xero has also established relationships with fintech companies, including ASX-listed foreign exchange disrupter OzForex and the online business lender Moula, to build automated banking products that integrate with Xero's software.\nXero is also in discussions with insurer CGU, which is understood to be interested in payroll data captured by Xero to better assess workers' compensation premiums.\n\"Disruption in financial services does not mean that the entrenched players get muscled out; it means the industry is finding new ways to solve old problems. Some are moving faster than others. We're not picking winners,\" Mr Ridd said.\n\"We spend a fair bit of time talking to the banks. There's a huge amount of recognition of value of what we are doing globally, and it's amazing to see some of the ideas that banks are coming up with to work closely with us on making running a small business easier.\n\"Our financial web strategy is all about helping small businesses get better access to capital and grow their business, as well as seamlessly delivering other types of financial capabilities such as payments and insurance. It means that, for the first time, banks have the ability to support their customers' needs by allowing a small-business customer to opt in and share their financial information for specific decision-making purposes.\"\nA DBM Consultants survey released last week found NAB has improved its business satisfaction rankings in recent months.\nDBM Director Maria Claridad said NAB's improvement followed its decision to add 200 new bankers to its small and medium-business banking division in the past year. \"Results show that the vast majority of NAB's customers are happy with the bank,\" she said. \"NAB seems to have built a momentum in the business market.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/technology/startup-war-story-xeros-rod-drurys-growing-pains-as-a-publicly-listed-startup-20150824-gj64qj"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:53:04.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
