Smaller coinage will remain legal tender, and rounding will only apply to cash payments. \n• Why we should scrap 1p and 2p coins \nIreland follows Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands and Sweden, who have all phased out the smaller denominations. \nRonnie O’Toole, of the Irish central bank, said evidence of rounding showed that consumers and retailers would welcome the move. \n\"As a country we are good at making changes like this,\" he said. \n\"We migrated to the euro ahead of most other countries, and the indications so far are that consumers and retailers alike will embrace rounding.” \nThe rounding will only apply to total bills rather than individual items. For example, a purchase of €10.21 or €10.22 will be rounded to €10.20. \nA bill of €10.26 or €10.27 would be rounded to €10.25. \nThe move had been widely anticipated after it was recommended by the country's finance minister, Michael Noonan. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) follows a trial carried out in Wexford in 2013 where 85pc of consumers and 100pc of retailers wanted the system rolled out nationally. \nA 1c coin costs 1.65c to produce while 2c coins cost 1.94c. The central bank has estimated it has spent in excess of €30 million on minting the two coins between 2001 and 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:25:25.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
