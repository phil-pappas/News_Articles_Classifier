It has no debt and an unsecured credit line of $50,000 for emergencies. Its current and past client roster includes Dell Inc., Microsoft Corp. MSFT 10.08 % , NBCUniversal, HomeAway.com and FreshDirect.\nBut in recent years, the 47-year-old Ms. Gabor has faced challenges expanding. She spoke with The Wall Street Journal about why that is and what she is doing about it. Here are edited excerpts:\nThe problem within WSJ: What is the biggest challenge you face?\nMS. GABOR: Sol Marketing has been around for 12 years. After doubling revenue for about the first six years, we have been stalled at the $2.5 million to $3 million mark for the past four years running, despite heroic efforts on the part of me and my team. I feel like our addressable market is huge; we solve an acknowledged industry need in a unique way; we are extremely flexible and agile. We have a proven record with some of the best-known brands and companies in the world. We have a talented team, plenty of money in the bank and can sell like nobody’s business. But we can’t seem to scale.\nWe have challenges similar to other businesses of our size and experience in managing cash flow, hiring, compensating and leading people, making good on promises we make to our clients. However, the most significant impediment to our growth is me.\nWSJ: How so?\nMS. GABOR: We have a total of nine employees, including me. As a services business, our revenue is limited to the number of employees we have and hours in the day. There is endless business out there for us to secure; I am confident in our ability to find new clients and grow the volume and profitability of existing relationships.\nBut because I can’t seem to shake the need to have the tip of my pinkie finger in every piece of client business that comes through our door, we can’t grow beyond work I can directly impact.\nI love to consult with clients—that’s why I started this business. I love to uncover “aha’s” that open up new opportunities for clients. Ultimately, I love to be the hero. But that comes with a cost.\nENLARGE WSJ: How do your employees react?\nMS. GABOR: Since I’ve inserted myself into every account, even if it’s in the most subtle way, I have created a situation in which employees are uneasy taking big risks and, in some cases, making day-to-day decisions for fear that they might not do “what Deb would do.”\nWSJ: What steps are you taking to address the problem?\nMS. GABOR: Since last spring I have taken every Friday off. The team knows they cannot reach me. About four months ago, I added a middle-level manager to take care of operations. I already had a senior individual working alongside me, and a couple months ago, I made her directly responsible for client services.\nThis allows me to work on strategy.\nWSJ: How do you plan to expand your business in a way that requires less direct involvement from you?\nMS. GABOR: In 2013 I started InvestorPitches.com and in 2014 CrunchTest.com, [which tests the viability of products]. I started InvestorPitches.com first to address a market need. [People] in my network started coming to me for the brand strategy-services they experienced at larger companies, just scaled down for their entrepreneurial endeavors at this critical moment of truth—when they are pitching investors. I saw the business model as an opportunity for less-experienced employees to manage comprehensive projects that were like our big client projects in every way except their size and scope. Because an investor pitch is usually a 12-15 page presentation that includes strategy, messaging, copywriting and design, a junior project manager can run the whole project in just under three weeks with little to no intervention from me.\nNewfound confidence WSJ: How do these ancillary businesses make it possible to be less involved?\nMS. GABOR: They require very little upfront selling. Both InvestorPitches and CrunchTest rely upon aggressive online-search marketing campaigns, which generate about 90% of the leads. The rest come through referrals. Since I don’t have to be involved in the lead generation, sales pitch or making the close, I have more time available to do sales and business development with the larger, higher-margin clients.\nIn the first year, we made about $100,000 on investor pitches alone, all with very little involvement from me. In 2014 we about doubled that. I’m proud to say that there are investor pitches that have gone out the door without me ever even glancing at them.\nSince I started leaving more of the decisions to the team, they have really surprised me with newfound confidence and decision-making skills. In the past few months, I’ve been encouraged to see new leaders emerging.That has allowed me to spend less time double-checking work and more time filling the sales pipeline and forging relationships with vendors and partners who can expand our capabilities and bandwidth.\nMs. Haislip is a writer in Chatham, N.J.
