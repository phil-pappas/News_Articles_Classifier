Photo: Bloomberg\nThe greenback's advance won't be derailed by the US central bank's reluctance to raise interest rates, according to BT Investment Management and Saxo Capital Markets.\nThe US currency is strengthening as investors who used low-cost funds to purchase higher-yielding assets are forced out of so-called carry trades, said Vimal Gor, head of fixed-income at BT Investment in Sydney, where he helps to oversee more than $US10 billion. The greenback is reversing a decade-long bear run and its gains will drive the Intercontinental Exchange's US Dollar Index at least 25 per cent higher over the next three years, said Kay Van-Petersen, a Singapore-based strategist at Saxo.\n\"The dollar is very firmly entrenched in a significant up-cycle,\" Gor said. \"Ultimately, a stronger dollar puts stress on the global economy, but the up-cycle is going to continue and pretty much every currency, apart from probably the yen, will depreciate.\"\nThe greenback has climbed against 14 of its 16 most-traded peers since September 17 as the Fed's decision to not increase interest rates amid global growth risks compounded a selloff in equities and commodities. Gains have been sustained even as futures traders bet there's less than a 50 per cent chance of a liftoff by January.\nAdvertisement The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six major peers, climbed 0.8 per cent in the third quarter to 96.27 on Wednesday. A gauge tracking 20 developing-nation currencies dropped 8.3 per cent over that period, its worst quarterly performance since September 2011.\nGor said he expects further declines in emerging-market currencies, particularly those like Malaysia's that are hurt by the \"triple whammy\" of falling commodity prices, large external dollar-denominated liabilities and political turmoil.\nThe Fed could raise rates in December but Gor believes that's unlikely. \"The problem is that if they don't hike soon, they're not going to get a chance to,\" he said.\nFollowing its September meeting, Fed officials, including chair Janet Yellen, said policy rates will probably be lifted later this year and future tightening will be gradual. The US economy isn't far from full employment, Yellen said September 24.\nThe Fed's stance contrasts with that of overseas central banks combating slowing growth and muted inflation. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have said they stand ready to add stimulus if needed, while officials in more than 20 nations including China, India, Hungary, Poland, Canada and Norway have cut benchmark rates this year.\n\"Regardless of whether the Fed hikes or not, the US dollar still gets stronger because everyone else is on an easing bias,\" Van-Petersen said. \"We've been in a bear market for so long - almost a decade - so this is why it's the biggest carry trade out there and we are only at the inception of the unwind of that.\"\nThe Dollar Index has climbed about 20 per cent over the past two years, though it's still 20 per cent below a 2001 high. It will advance toward a level of 120 over three years, Van- Petersen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:45:00.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
