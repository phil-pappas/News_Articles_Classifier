The collapse of a major contract in Libya preceded the company's exit from Yemen in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , due to fighting there. \nThe suspension of its Libyan contract - the company's largest ever, accounting for more than a third of its revenue last year - pushed APR to the brink of breaching its debt covenants. \nThe company secured a renegotiation on its credit facility in April, thus avoiding a breach, and was later granted a month's extension of its next covenant testing date of Sept. 30. \nThe consortium bidding for APR intend to supply $200 million of additional funding to the company within 31 business days of its offer being declared unconditional. \nAbout $150 million of this will be used to repay debt and the rest will be used for working capital and transaction costs. \n\"Given the volatility of the market, combined with the capital-intensive nature of the business, we believe that APR Energy would benefit from a period as a privately held company as it seeks financial stability,\" Fairfax Financial Chairman and Chief Executive Prem Watsa said in a statement. \nGeneral Electric Co, which owns about 16.4 percent of APR's issued share capital through a subsidiary, has agreed to the offer, as have APR's directors, the company said.
