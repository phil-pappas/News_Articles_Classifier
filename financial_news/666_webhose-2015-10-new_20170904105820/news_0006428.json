Ms Hunt joined Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) as chief executive of its UK and European operations just two years ago. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) came from Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) , where she had been chief financial officer, and Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said she was likely a “serious” candidate to succeed Tidjane Thiam as group chief executive of the FTSE 100 insurer earlier this year. The top job went to Mike Wells , who took the helm at the start of June. \nMr Cornes described Ms Hunt’s exit as a “surprise” and suggested there could have been a “clash of personalities” with Mr Wells. \n“We suspect that Mike will have wanted to establish his own stamp on the UK business and that goes some way to explaining Jackie’s sudden departure,” the analyst said. \nA spokesman for Prudential declined to comment on the reasons for Ms Hunt’s exit. \nHer role at Prudential will be filled on an interim basis by John Foley until a permanent replacement is found. Mr Foley is a Prudential veteran who has been with the insurer for 15 years, most recently as group investment director. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is the latest in a series of high-profile executive changes at the FTSE 100 company since Mr Thiam quit as Prudential boss earlier this year to lead Credit Suisse (LSE: 0QP5.L - news ) . \nLess than a fortnight after Mr Wells was named the new Prudential chief executive, Pierre-Olivier Bouee, who had been chief risk officer, resigned to join Mr Thiam at Credit Suisse. \nMr Wells, who had headed the insurer’s North American business, was succeeded by Barry Stowe. Mr Stowe, previously the chief executive of Prudential’s Asian division, was in turn replaced by Tony Wilkey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:05:57.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
