You try to get the most buck (highest total return) for any given level of bang (explosively volatile prices).But some investors don't care about total return as much as they care about income return. They want to live off yield. What's the optimal portfolio for someone like that?An academic might be contemptuous of a preoccupation with dividends and interest, and I myself warn about the dangers of chasing yield. But David Blanchett, head of retirement research at [entity display=\"Morningstar\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"false\" deactivated=\"true\" key=\"morningstar\" ticker=\"MORN\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/9942\"]Morningstar[/entity], has some sympathy for the yield-hungry.Let us accept the fact, Blanchett says in a recent paper, that certain investors want a steady income. Rationally or not, they are loath to dip into principal. They can't live on the puny yields from stocks and bank CDs. What do we tell them to own?To address the question Blanchett applies the techniques of portfolio theory but moves the goal. In the classic analysis the game is to maximize total return (price change plus income) for a given level of volatility in that return. In the alternative analysis the goal is to maximize income for a given level of volatility in that income.The answers that come out are very different. Optimizing for total return gives you a big dose of common stocks, watered down with cash to keep risk at a tolerable level. Optimizing for income sends you off on a hunt for junk bonds and preferred stocks. Junk debt is very volatile on a total return basis, but its income stream is not so turbulent.Look at what happened in the recession. The price of iShares U.S. Preferred Stock crashed from $50 to $15, yet the ETF's annual payout held fairly steady in the neighborhood of $2.80. The Vanguard Corporate High-Yield Fund had a frightening total return, but its distribution dipped only 9% from 2007 to 2009.I've applied some of Blanchett's thinking in coming up with a portfolio for a new retiree. It squeezes a lot of juice out of the lemons in fixed income but doesn't go all-out for yield. The payout starts at 4% of the amount invested. That leaves room for a little growth.You can find 6% coupons and more on junky securities. Why not grab them with both hands? Because fat yields chew up your capital.That Vanguard fund is eroding, notwithstanding that it is well run and aims at the less trashy end of the high-yield spectrum. If you invested when the fund opened in 1978 and spent all the dividends, then you now have, in purchasing power, only a sixth of the capital you started with.This is inevitable. Corporate borrowers do not give you cost-of-living raises. Some go bust. The others do not repay more than they borrowed.Stockbrokers don't spend a lot of time discussing erosion. Exception: the fictional one played by Woody Allen in one of his movies. He described the job this way: \"I help people with their investments until there's nothing left.\"My steady-income $1 million portfolio has a Treasury backbone paying a guaranteed semiannual coupon that comes to $1,000 a month. It gets a yield boost from junk, preferreds and emerging market debt. As antidote to the erosion from all those things it has a few equities.I estimate the starting payout at $3,400 a month, climbing to $3,900 as the Treasury bond nears maturity 22 years from now. The $500 won't fully offset inflation between when you're 66 and when you turn 88, but it will make a dent.Buy $240,000 (par amount) of the 5% T bond due in May 2037. That will cost you $337,000. Put $200,000 in the Vanguard junk fund (VWEAX, 5.77) and $100,000 each in [entity display=\"Vanguard's\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" activated=\"false\" deactivated=\"true\" key=\"vanguard\" natural_id=\"fred/company/14683\"]Vanguard's[/entity] Emerging Markets Government Bond (VWOB, 76) and FTSE Developed Markets Stock (VEA, 38) .Put $100,000 in preferreds, dividing the pot between the iShares fund (PFF, 39) and Market Vectors Preferred Securities Ex-Financials (PFXF, 20) . Put the $163,000 balance in Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI, 104).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:15:48.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
