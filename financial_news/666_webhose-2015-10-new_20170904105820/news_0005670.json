You may only have until spring 2018 By Peter Spence | Telegraph – 1 hour 31 minutes ago 0.00 0.00 \nThe Financial Conduct Authority wants consumers to make their PPI claims soon or forever hold their peace \nBritain's financial regulator is bringing one of the UK's biggest mis-selling sagas to an end with plans to put a deadline on payment protection insurance (PPI) claims. \nThe Financial Conduction Authority (FCA) is launching a consultation on the cut-off and expects to announce when the new PPI deadline will be as early as next spring. \nHowever, the deadline is expected to be some time in early 2018, which means lenders and consumers have another two-and-a-half years to make claims and settle disputes. \nThe City watchdog said that it would also consult on a communications campaign, to ensure that consumers know when the cut-off point is. The campaign is expected to be funded by the banks, as the regulator wants to draw a line under the scandal , but does not want customers to lose out because banks fhave dragged their feet processing claims, or because they were unaware that they could claim. \nAfter the deadline, customers will lose their right to have new PPI complaints assessed by firms or by the Financial Ombudsman Service. \nThe banking industry has already had to come up with a combined £24bn for compensation to people who were mis-sold the insurance product. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has repeatedly called on the regulator to introduce a deadline on PPI claims . \nThat total is set to rise by several billion pounds. In the case of Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance last year, a complainant won her case arguing that Paragon (LSE: 0NFG.L - news ) had treated her unfairly by failing to declare the commission it earned on the PPI sale. \nThe FCA will now consult on how best to extend this ruling to the rest of the industry, which could result in a substantial new wave of claims against banks. \nJayne-Anne Gadhia, the boss of Virgin Money, has said that whoever replaces Martin Wheatley as head of the FCA should bring an end to the saga. \n\"It is unfortunate that the PPI costs continue to roll as they do, and I think that has taken capital out of the system. People should be held accountable for the problems of the past, although I do think [those costs] should probably be capped,\" she said in August . \n\"I do think banks should be held to account for the sins of the past, but in a controlled, limited way. It is important to have a strong banking system for all of us.\" \nMeanwhile, the number of PPI complaints lodged with the ombudsman and individual lenders has also slumped, according to figures published earlier in the week . \nThere were still 883,043 complaints about PPI in the first six months of this year, but this was down 16.6pc on the second half of 2014, according to FCA data. That dragged down the total number of complaints by 2.1pc to 2.1 million. \nA \"significant proportion\" of recent PPI compliants have turned out to be unfounded, and a \"high and growing proportion\" refer to sales made before 2005, where \"evidence held by firms and consumers is likely to have significant gaps\", the FCA said. \nHowever, the regulator believes that there are still many people with genuine claims who have not yet come forward. It hopes that by imposing a deadline, customers will be encouraged to lodge complaint. \nBanks have been writing to customers who they believe do have a valid claim. Those customers who have received a letter have three years from the date of receipt to lodge their claim. \nThat means a mis-selling victim who received a letter last year will have only until 2017 to claim, while those who get the letter later this year will have until closer to the end of 2018 to claim compensation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:29:02.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
