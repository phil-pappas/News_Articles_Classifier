Will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates or not? What effect could it have on banks?\nThis is exactly why this could be the time to put some money into the banking sector. Going against the herd, in general, is always a good thing, because the crowd is notorious for being on the wrong side of the market.\nAdditionally, every balanced portfolio should have some money allocated to financial stocks. Of course, many investors are angry at the big banks after the financial crisis, and for good reason. But take a tip from the annals of mass psychology: Do not let your emotions get in the way, because the market does not reward emotional junkies.\n\nSome observers are positing that just because Citigroup ( C - Get Report ) and Deutsche Bank ( DB - Get Report ) are trading below their pre-2008 highs, it is a sign that the markets will take the same path and crash. This is hogwash. Both stocks are trading below their 2008 highs, but so what? The same argument could have been made for the Nasdaq , but it did eventually test its old highs. Look at the chart below.\n\nAfter the correction of 2003 ended the Nasdaq generally trended upward. Now you could have put on your bearish lens and moaned and groaned as it continued to trend higher and higher, interjecting along the way that the rally was not valid as it was trading well below its all-time high. If you took this path, pain and loss would have been your only friends. Or, you could have recognized it for the opportunity it was and jumped onboard.\nMust Read: The Factors Behind Tesla's Slump \n\n1 of 3 Check Out Our Best Services for Investors Action Alerts PLUS Portfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.\nProduct Features: $2.5+ million portfolio Large-cap and dividend focus Intraday trade alerts from Cramer Quant Ratings Access the tool that DOMINATES the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500.\nProduct Features: Buy, hold, or sell recommendations for over 4,300 stocks Unlimited research reports on your favorite stocks A custom stock screener Stocks Under $10 David Peltier uncovers low dollar stocks with serious upside potential that are flying under Wall Street's radar.\nProduct Features: Model portfolio Stocks trading below $10 Intraday trade alerts 14-Days Free Only $9.95 14-Days Free Dividend Stock Advisor David Peltier identifies the best of breed dividend stocks that will pay a reliable AND significant income stream.\nProduct Features: Diversified model portfolio of dividend stocks Updates with exact steps to take - BUY, HOLD, SELL Trifecta Stocks Every recommendation goes through 3 layers of intense scrutinyquantitative, fundamental and technical analysisto maximize profit potential and minimize risk.\nProduct Features: Model Portfolio Intra Day Trade alerts Access to Quant Ratings Real Money More than 30 investing pros with skin in the game give you actionable insight and investment ideas.\nProduct Features: Access to Jim Cramer's daily blog Intraday commentary and news Real-time trading forums Only $49.95 14-Days Free 14-Days Free View other subscription services that we offer comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:35:07.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
