The country’s largest banks, Wells Fargo (WFC), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Goldman Sachs (GS), are due to report their earnings during the week.\nGoldman Sachs will report its third-quarter earnings on October 15, 2015. In the past quarters, earnings of Goldman Sachs have been difficult to predict.\nGoldman Sachs’s second-quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates. Its 2Q15 EPS (earnings per share) of $1.98 was much lower than consensus expectations of $3.89.\nThis miss was primarily due to higher litigation charges booked during the quarter. The litigation provisions caused a fall of $2.77 per share in earnings. The bank created a provision of $1.45 billion for legal and regulatory expenses during the quarter, which was much higher than the $284 million they charged in 2Q14. The bank’s earnings were marked by the over $1.45 billion dollar litigation charge, which reduced return on equity by 6.7% to 4.8%.\nHowever, its revenue of $9.1 billion exceeded analysts’ expectations of $8.8 billion. Investment banking revenue was up 13% at $2 billion compared to last year. In the equities division, revenue rose 24% over the past year to $2 billion.\n\n3Q15 estimates According to data compiled by Bloomberg, Wall Street analysts estimate Goldman Sachs to report revenues of $10 billion for the third-quarter. This compares to $9.1 billion in revenues reported in 3Q14 and $9.1 billion in 2Q15.\nDespite weak earnings in the last quarter, analysts are upbeat about Goldman Sachs. The company ranked first in worldwide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions during the first half of the year.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 1 - Goldman Sachs Has Underperformed the Financial Sector This Year Part 3 - Investment Banking Business to Gain, Trading Revenues to Suffer Part 4 - What Wall Street Analysts Expect from Goldman Sachs’s Earnings Goldman Sachs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:28:53.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
