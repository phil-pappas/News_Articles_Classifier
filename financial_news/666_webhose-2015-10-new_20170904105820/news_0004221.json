Advertising Firms May Have a Morale Problem Written by: Emily Stewart 10/10/15 - 9:53 AM EDT Tickers in this article: RHI \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- The unemployment rate across the U.S. is low, and in the advertising industry, it's even lower -- meaning companies in the sector may have to work extra hard to acquire and retain talent. But that's actually a big problem for the flashy firms that bring us cool ads and inspired AMC 's hit show Mad Men . \nThe nationwide unemployment rate reached 5.1% in August, its lowest point in seven years. But in some creative and advertising fields, the numbers are even better. Preliminary data from the end of the second quarter from the Bureau of Labor Statistics lists unemployment for marketing managers at 2.6%, web developers at 3.1%, designers at 3.2%, writers at 1.9% and editors at 2.4%. \n\"Unemployment rates are very, very low at a time when demand is very, very high,\" said Diana Domeyer, executive director of The Creative Group , a creative and marketing staffing agency based in California.

Of those who indicate morale is high, just 20% are looking for a new job. But among the group rating morale as low, 70% are actively seeking to jump ship. \n\"What really surprised me is that morale had such an impact on retention,\" said Douglas Quenqua, editor-in-chief of Campaign US . \"There's a huge talent problem. There's so much trouble finding talent to do the work, and the fact that people are leaving because of low morale, that's huge.\" \nHere's the problem: Bad morale and a low unemployment rate in advertising make it really easy for employees to switch firms, driving salaries up and disrupting the flow of business. \nRespondents to the survey cited management as the single greatest factor driving down morale. Lack of advancement opportunities and work-life balance were named as issues at hand as well. Compensation was also often mentioned, though the numbers don't tell an obvious story. \nRespondents in the mid-salary range ($50,000-$100,000) were the most likely to rate morale at their company as very low at 40%, while those making the least (under $50,000) were actually more optimistic at 35%. The individuals making the most amount of money (over $100,000) were the least likely to say morale was low at 32%. \n\"You need to look at the overall perks that your organization is offering, and those perks may be work from home, of course it's benefits, but it may also be other monetary aspects of things like tuition reimbursement, wellness programs, those types of things,\" Domeyer said. \"The cost of losing an employee is much more than paying a little bit more to attract and retain the talent you have.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:19:51.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
