( FARO ), the world's most trusted source for 3D measurement technology, announces the release of the new FARO Freestyle 3D X Handheld Laser Scanner, a 3D Laser Scanner designed to transform the way the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC), Law Enforcement, and other industries document3D data through easy to use, intuitive data acquisition. With the release of the Freestyle 3D X, FARO´s portfolio now contains two handheld scanners designed to help customers increase productivity, save time and make effective, data-driven decisions.\nView gallery\n. The new FARO Freestyle 3D X incorporates state-of-the-art scanning technology that delivers enhanced scanning accuracy of 1 millimeter at a 1-meter range. The Freestyle 3D X is available with a U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration accessory to provide users with verifiable data accuracy, which is critical for forensic scanning and other highly regulated industries. On-site calibration data is exportable in PDF format, allowing information to be easily shared with other team members. \nThe Freestyle 3D X also incorporates an automatic flash mode enabling users to scan objects in a variety of lighting conditions. New software tools deliver an intensely detailed visualization of the created 3D point cloud, and an integrated best-point filter enhances the quality of the scan data by reducing noise up to 35%. Finally, post-processing functions have also been improved, offering up to 5x faster data writing speed to further improve productivity on the job site. \nThe Freestyle 3D X can be employed as a standalone device or used in concert with FARO Focus 3D X Series Laser Scanners. Point cloud data from all devices can be integrated seamlessly – even in grey scale. \n\"The Freestyle 3D X sets the industry standard for ease-of-use and verifiable accuracy among professional, portable scanning devices,\" stated Joe Arezone , Senior Vice President and Managing Director FARO Asia and EMEA. \"The new features such as automatic flash mode, best point filter and new algorithms decisively enhance the overall scanning experience and enable users to carry out more projects with better quality at the same time. Moreover, the new Freestyle 3D X will allow the most demanding users to achieve better accuracy in their projects.\"\nWith the introduction of the Freestyle 3D X to its portfolio, FARO continues its role as a technology innovator for customers – helping them work faster, more effectively and save money in the process.
