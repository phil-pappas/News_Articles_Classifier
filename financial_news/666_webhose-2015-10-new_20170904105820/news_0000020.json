The company is now telling all who care to listen that it will play a central role in helping businesses utilize the opportunity in the Internet of Things (IoT). Highlighting the fact that businesses, while aware of the technology are still unsure about how to use it to advantage, Cisco is promising to be the savior. It’s starting out laying the path for manufacturing, transportation, utilities and oil & gas companies, which will need extensive software-driven networks that are also highly secure. \nCisco is one of the largest networking companies with one of the largest plays in security and it expects its focus on security will win customers. It will however take an open approach so its technology works with others’ (as may be expected in the new cloud-focused world). \nAnalysts Positive on Cisco, Yahoo : A Citi analyst initiated coverage of Cisco shares with a Buy rating, expressing confidence in its leading position in networking and share gains in servers and security, and potential for earnings and cash flow increases. Yahoo on the other hand saw a price target increase at Axiom, with the analyst expressing satisfaction that Alibaba spin-off risks were minimal. \nAlphabet Buys Huge Domain Name : While it’s true that Alphabet.com wasn’t available, it’s a little hard to understand why Alphabet would choose to buy the domain abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.com. It does contain the alphabet, but people would have a hard time typing it in every time. Of course it might simply be Alphabet’s attempt to prevent any of its competitors from acquiring it. In any case, the company is using ABC.xyz as its official website address. \nSaudi Prince Increases Stake In Twitter : \nLegal/Regulatory \nFacebook Lawsuit : A lawsuit in the EU by one Max Schrems against Facebook for being unable to protect his data has had far-reaching implications for the U.S. Based on disclosures by Edward Snowden that indicated that the U.S. has mass surveillance programs in place and this specific lawsuit, the highest European court has invalidated a 15-year old Safe Harbor deal between the EU and the U.S. \nThe deal was important because it allowed for the free flow of personal data between Europe and the U.S. provided companies certified that the data was secure. It appears that the big companies are not dependent on this law and there are other provisions they can rely on for legal data transfer, but there are numerous small and medium companies that depend on this law that won’t be so lucky. \nMicrosoft on U.S.-EU Ties : Microsoft is not one to let go easily. The company has withstood pressures from U.S. courts to release data picked up offshore, specifically, at its Dublin data center. The company maintains that the data is stored in a foreign country and is therefore subject to rules and regulations of that country while the U.S. courts have held that since the data is held by a U.S. company it should be able to disclose it to the government. Microsoft has one contempt-of-court charge against it on this issue. Last week, it appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. \nRussian Ultimatum to Google : Russia has given Google a month to decouple its free app bundle from Android so competing service providers can get their apps pre-installed. The case is the result of search company Yandex, which complained to Russian competition authorities when it started losing market share to Google. \nIf Google fails to comply it could be liable to penalties of up to 15% of revenues from mobile apps in Russia. Google may have to pull out of Russia if it can’t monetize Android, or it may have a different strategy up its sleeve. It’s all guesswork at the moment because the search giant isn’t commenting. \nNew Technology/Products \nGoogle Drive Backing Up WhatsApp Chats : WhatsApp owner Facebook enabled iCloud storage for iOS users some time back, so it only makes sense to do the same thing for Android. Particularly since the majority of WhatsApp/Facebook users use Android devices. So last week, it was announced that WhatsApp chats on Android devices can now be backed up in Google Drive. \nFacebook Wants To Do Handymen Too \nAmazon Live Streaming \nTwitter Now Has “Moments” \nM&A and Collaborations \nGoogle Invests in Symphony : Google has participated in a fresh funding round in Symphony that values the secure messaging service for financial companies, corporate customers and even individuals at $650 million. Top banks including Goldman, Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan have already invested in the service since it was discovered that the extremely expensive Bloomberg terminals were used by its reporters to spy on their activities. Symphony doesn’t charge for organizations with less than 50 members and if it’s over 50, the charge is $15 per user per month. \nPandora Buys Ticketfly : Pandora is paying $450 million in cash and stock for Ticketfly, a popular destination for event and concert tickets in the U.S. and Canada. The ad-supported radio service says that the deal will build on its Artist marketing Platform (that displays most popular shows by geography) and Next Big Sound acquisition (an analytics-type service studying listening and searching patterns). Ticketfly, which sold 16 million tickets last year, takes this a step further because it can help artists sell concert tickets to Pandora users. \nMicrosoft Acquires Intel’s Havok : In a push to boost its entertainment offerings, Microsoft acquired an illustrious, if lesser-known 3D physics company called Havok. Intel paid $107 million for the company back in 2007, so it must be paying at least that much (although details remain undisclosed). Havok enables special effects in games and video (it has been used by developers inthe “Halo,\"\"Assassin's Creed,\"\"Call of Duty\" and \"Destiny\" games as well as in the movies “The Matrix” and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”). \nCisco Gets into Robotics : Factory automation is reaching new levels. Last week, Cisco announced a collaboration with FANUC America, which will be using its big data analytics to determine robot maintenance schedules that will minimize their downtime. The technology is now being tested on 1,800 robots, some of which are currently being used by FANUC customer GM. Fanuc says the technology has saved its customers $38 million thus far. It plans to roll it out to 2,500 robots by year-end. GE has also signed up to use Cisco’s technology in 100 of its factories. \nAlibaba, Tencent Getting Cozy : Two of the BAT companies (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) that represent the largest chunk of Internet business in China continue to get cozy. Last week, Alibaba and Tencent entered into an agreement to merge their competing group buying companies Meituan.com and Dianping.com in a deal worth $15 billion. The idea is to reduce competition in the already-crowded online-to-offline market, much like what they did by merging their ride hailing services Didi and Kuaidi to better compete with Uber. \nSanDisk-HP In Memory Making Partnership \nSome Numbers \nApple Mac Sales Slowdown : IDC and Gartner didn’t agree on this. According to IDC, Apple saw Mac sales grow 16.1% year over year in the second quarter and decline 3.4% in the third. Gartner says that Mac sales fell 2.5% in the second quarter but grew 1.5% in the third. But both agree that it currently has around a 7.5% share of the worldwide PC market. While growth rates are slower than they were a couple of years ago, Apple is growing off a larger base now. Also, like other PC vendors, it should be feeling the effects of the stronger dollar. \nApple Offshore Cash : It was reported last week that Apple tops the list of tech companies holding significant cash overseas. Apple has $181 billion overseas, followed by GE with $119 billion, Microsoft $108 billion, IBM $61 billion, Cisco $53 billion, Google $47 billion, Hewlett-Packard $43 billion, Oracle $38 billion and Intel $23 billion. \nGoogle Says Mobile Search Crosses Desktop : Google head of search Amit Singhal has said that worldwide Google searches on mobile devices (excluding tablets) surpassed those on desktops this summer. Google addresses more than a 100 billion queries a month, not all of which are typed into the search box. As auto and wearable device search increases, voice search will become a more important factor. As a result, Google is currently working on improving speech recognition. It is also rethinking advertising strategies (i.e. other than keywords-bases search) given that screen sizes are often smaller these days. \nNetflix Raising Prices : New Netflix NFLX customers in the U.S., Canada and some Latin American countries will have to pay a dollar more for the standard plan as the company tries to recover the high costs of content acquisition while sticking to its ad-free model. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
