Photo: Supplied\nOn one of his six annual trips to the United States to see his girlfriend, the penny dropped.\n\"Shoes are so bulky so you can only buy so many pairs [when you travel overseas],\" he says.\n\"But it sure hurts when you come home and see the same shoes for double the price and it was that light-bulb moment when I asked myself 'why not create an online shoe website that mirrored my existing IT business in terms of structure and model?\n\"I realised we could leverage our existing contracts and experience to build a business selling a commodity that is highly sought after and importantly that I had a real passion for.\"\nHe started approaching US manufacturers Converse, Asics, Nike and Vans about distributing via his Australian e-retailing start-up.\nThey agreed and using funding from Sonix and his parents, he spent late 2013 developing a website with secure transaction capabilities and made his initial stock orders.\nThen he got his childhood friend Andrew Wong on board; \"it was the perfect timing as I was travelling abroad a lot and needed someone I trusted on the ground\" then asked high school mates Ryan McClelland and Kristopher Hunt to join the venture.\nLast summer the school friends DIY updated their warehouse racking system in Gladesville, Sydney so it now has room for 15,000 pairs of shoes.\n\"We are not extremely social media savvy so the first three or four months were very slow and we're used to B2B where Google is all you need [to find your market] but have found B2C is a bit different and you do need to do more to assure people that you are really what you claim to be and that there is no catch.\"\nWith no marketing budget, the lifestyle shoe e-retailer recorded $650,000 turnover in 2014-2015, almost 70 per cent of which came in its final quarter.\nSite visitations are growing monthly and via a broader range of brands, which Hsu says is encouraging.\nKeeping prices down\nAsked about his business model and how he can price less than his shop rivals with exactly the same shoes, Hsu says he's able to offer prices typically 10 to 20 per cent lower because as an independent e-tailer his business can parallel import and has no affiliation with the brands it supplies.\n\"That said, we do offer up to 30 per cent off if deals or promo codes are used and there are definitely shoes approximately 50 per cent off for models that have been superseded by the latest in-season product, or models that we can get good deals on.\n\"We are not bound by the minimum advertised price policies issued by brands when we import from our overseas suppliers.\n\"As an example Rebel Sport or The Athletes Foot do have contracts with Asics Australia, which means they source from Australian distribution and therefore have to sell at their RRP otherwise everyone would be outpricing one another.\n\"Additionally bricks and mortar stores have higher overheads, whether it be staff, shop fittings, rent in a high foot-traffic location and they have limited customers based on their proximity to the store unless they have an online presence, whereas we source from countries where RRPs are lower than that of Australia.\n\"We source in bulk, don't buy a pair or two to fulfil orders but bring shoes in by the thousands, which lowers our shipping costs as it is averaged out.\"\nThe year ahead will focus on developing supporting apps and improving the website.\n\"Looking longer term anything that comes in pairs – socks, headphones, etc – will be products we will explore.\n\"We do have competitors but no competitors doing exactly what we do.\"\nFlash sales\nAlexandra Mills is chief executive of The Active, a start-up that shares some market turf with The Next Pair.\nFounded in 2014 so Aussie don't have to travel abroad to buy discounted branded sportswear products including shoes, Mills says the flash sales site is one of 14 businesses under parent company the Aussie Commerce umbrella.\n\"It launched because we saw this gap in our local market today,\" Mills says.\n\"There are a lot of fashion and home-wares brands adopting the flash sale business model but surprisingly not sports and outdoor adventure.\n\"It's essentially about positioning (these products). We are still very committed to stock under $100.\"\nMills says The Active has 200,000 customers on its database and turned over $3 million in 2014-2015. It plans to double revenue this financial year.\n\"There are others in the market such as Catch of the Day which do release flash stock but do not specialise like we do and therefore not able to offer every style and every colour so, no, no exact rivals.\n\"Our challenge is making those relationships with the big brands and the big retailers so we get the best clearance stock; that is going to be our ongoing challenge.\"\nBricks and mortar\nMeanwhile, the bricks and mortar Aussie retail footwear industry continues to slide.\nAccording to latest figures from global company IBISWorld, revenue has declined by 2.9 per cent a year since 2010 to $2.8 billion. It was expected to contract by 2.4 per cent in 2014-2015.\nChris Sheppard, general manager of Peter Sheppard Footwear , which turned over $24 million last year, is aware mainstream retailers who compete on price have been pummelled this decade by e-trading rivals.\nHis business has responded by holding firm to its niche as a shoe fitting company, and its Europe-only stock offering.\n\"We bring in brands from all over Europe and have no China imports,\" Sheppard says.\nHowever, acknowledging some of its consumers do expect an online retail option the 42-year-old shoe company will launch its e-commerce platform next April: \"It is going to be interesting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:16:12.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
