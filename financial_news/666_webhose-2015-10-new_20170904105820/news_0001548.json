It said: \"Laid back nurse, no Haitians\" and required that candidates also have state certifications.\nInterim, an in-home nursing provider, issued a statement from President Kalthleen McNally on its Facebook page and website, saying the ad is \"totally unacceptable and is offensive to us.\" She said a review would be conducted to look at what happened and make sure that it didn't happen again.\n\"Please accept our sincere apology. In particular, we apologize to the entire Haitian community,\" McNally said.\nThe Pennysaver Group said Monday that the ad was published by mistake and without \"proper editing protocol\" and has since been removed.\n\"We deeply apologize to our readers and the Haitian community,\" the company's chairman and chief operating officer said.\nThe Haitian American Nurses Association of Greater New York said it was appalled by the ad.\nState Sen. David Carlucci, who represents part of Rockland County, called on the state's Labor Department to investigate.\nWest Haverstraw, a town of about 10,000 residents, is about 40 miles north of New York City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:25:59.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
