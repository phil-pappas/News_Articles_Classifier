Seides, who co-founded hedge fund investment firm Protégé Partners, resigned from that firm in June and had planned to run a hedge fund at Credit Suisse. \"As we worked through the details over the last three months, we hit a snag in reconciling conflicts between my departure at Protégé and my arrival at Credit Suisse,\" Seides wrote. \"The complexities of the transition led me to take a pause, reassess, and conclude that I wanted some more time and space before diving into my next adventure.\" Seides, 44, confirmed the note in a telephone call Wednesday. A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment. Separately on Wednesday, Credit Suisse said it had completed a strategic review and that it was raising 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.3 billion) from investors, slimming down its investment bank, and cutting jobs. Tidjane Thiam, the bank's new chief executive, launched the review in July soon after he took the reins. Seides had planned to join Credit Suisse Asset Management to work with Mino Capossela, who heads hedge-fund-like products for retail investors known as \"liquid alternative investments,\" and Bob Jain, who heads global asset management. He was set to run investing for a planned hedge fund that would use multiple portfolio managers to place bets on the markets, a so-called \"multi-manager\" approach. In 2001, Seides helped found Protégé, which is now a $2 billion fund, after working under David Swensen at Yale University's famed endowment investment unit from 1992 to 1997. Protégé, now led by co-founder Jeffrey Tarrant, famously has a bet with Warren Buffett on whether a group of hedge fund managers can beat a low-fee stock index fund over 10 years ending on December 31, 2017. As of the middle of this year, Buffett was well ahead in the bet. Seides also recently wrote a book about how to invest in hedge funds, to be published by Wiley in January. In his letter, Seides said he is considering starting his own investment firm, investing in hedge fund managers as part of a larger shop, or even joining a large direct investment firm in a senior role. \"With this recent development and for the first time in a decade and a half,\" he wrote, \"I am declaring my free agency in time for the MLB World Series (although unfortunately not in time to help the Yankees get there),\" referring to U.S. Major League Baseball.
