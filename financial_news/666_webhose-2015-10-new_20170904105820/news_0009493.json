Bloomberg But a watch is clothing, a rare and personal statement that we unconsciously flash across meeting tables flanked by generic looking suits. If that sounds like a familiar part of your day, there's no getting around the fact that even a $24,000 rose gold Apple Watch doesn't look all that different to the $499 aluminum model accessorising your daughter's activewear.\nDigital duties Yet a smartwatch must also deliver on its digital duties, and our time with the Huawei watch shows that while Android Wear still lacks a lot of the Apple Watch's abilities, it can handle a reasonably useful amount of smartphone tasks.\nHandling emails and messages and checking a diary are a smartwatch's most important functions, and Android Wear gets three out of five stars here.\n As with Apple's notifications, you can read, delete and reply via impressive voice recognition to emails and (by handing SMS duties to Google Hangouts) text messages. Unfortunately, the Android system doesn't allow you to view embedded images but worse, there are so far no native Google calendar or email apps.\nThis means once you've dismissed the notification for an email or upcoming appointment, there's no way to see it again other than through some rather slow and limited third-party apps. It's the same for the wider app universe.\nWhile you'll find Shazam and Uber, you won't find Instagram or even Google Photos, which again means turning to third-party apps for something as basic as viewing photos.\nSuch notable deficiencies are partly alleviated by the Google Now cards feature. On an Android phone, we often forget these automatically gathered little tidbits of information such as football scores, shareprices, flight departure times and commute estimates, but they're perfect for idly flicking through when you've got a few moments on the station platform.\nGood reading It's a shame, then, that there's no Google Now app, which again means that once you've dismissed a new card, there's no going back to it.\nReadability is a big plus for Android Wear. The Apple watch uses dark screens to save battery life; the Huawei watch and its stablemates use the same white backgrounds and generous colours you're used to on a smartphone, yet still deliver equal or even battery life than the iOS rival.\nAndroid Wear even has enough juice for an \"always on\" mode which means you can tell the time without twisting or lifting your wrist. By contrast, the Apple Watch spends a great deal of its day with a forlorn black screen.\nPerformance wise, we're a little disappointed. While the Huawei watch runs smoothly most of the time, there are sometimes lags in opening apps. It's a problem the iPhone has struggled with too, though not as severely, and hopefully, improvements in software and the Bluetooth wireless technology will alleviate the type of lags we haven't seen since early Android models several years ago.\nUltimately, we think the choice between Android Wear such as the Huawei watch and the Apple watch comes down to the aesthetics, viewability and variety of style of Google's stable, versus the incumbent's superior functionality, but if you're tossing up between the two, it's a package deal with your phone.\nThe Apple watch only works with an iPhone, and while Android watches now work with Apple's Android Wear app, it's so limited and frustrating we suggest giving an Android watch-iPhone combo a wide berth for now.\nThe author attended the launch of the Huawei watch in San Francisco as a guest of Huawei. ï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:03:40.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
