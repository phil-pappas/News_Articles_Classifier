Another source said that Christofferson Robb & Co, a private money management firm, was also teaming up with them. \nA second bid was from U.S. bank Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) and Deutsche Bank along with U.S. buyout firm Blackstone, U.S. hedge fund Och Ziff, and the special situations arm of private equity firm TPG Capital, two sources said. \nThe third bid was from U.S. bank Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) and private equity firm Cerberus, another source familiar with the process said. \nThe assets are being sold by UK Asset Resolution (UKAR), Britain's so-called bad bank which is winding down the loans of Northern Rock, which collapsed in 2007 and was nationalised by the British government. \nUKAR said it expects to choose a preferred bidder this year and complete the deal by the end of March. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) declined to comment on the identity of any bidders. \nAll the companies involved either declined to officially comment or could not immediately be reached for comment. \nOther companies that showed an interest but did not bid included state-backed bank Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . \nBritain's government started the sale process in March. Reuters reported in June that several bidders including Blackstone had submitted indicative offers. \nIt is taking time to complete because the size of the portfolio requires extensive due diligence. \nBritish finance minister George Osborne is keen to sell the government's banking assets to recoup taxpayers' money.
