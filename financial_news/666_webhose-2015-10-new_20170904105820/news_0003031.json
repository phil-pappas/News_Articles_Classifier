Like all trade deals, it contained unavoidable political compromises due to powerful interest groups lobbying to retain protection in their home markets.\nFrom the United States to Australia, trade deals have become a hard sell.\nUnderlining how politics can hobble sound free-trade economics, US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton this week came out opposing the TPP deal struck by her former boss, Barack Obama.\nClinton, who as Secretary of State championed the TPP as the \"gold standard\" of trade accords, now says the pact doesn't appear to \"create good American jobs, raise wages and advance our national security\" to the high level she expected.\nHopes of slashing trade barriers for Kiwi cheese, butter and milk were dashed. Joe Armao She appears to have wilted under pressure to oppose the TPP from blue-collar unions and rising socialist presidential rival Bernie Sanders.\nClinton's politicking has shades of Bill Shorten's opposition to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement: Labor, backed by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, raised concerns about cheap Chinese labour flooding Australia and stealing local jobs.\nIn an increasingly globalised world, politicians, particularly on the left, are playing on anxieties about trade accords threatening employment at home.\nThe 12-country TPP is unique, in that it sets a partnership between highly developed economies US, Australia, Japan and Canada, with developing nations including Malaysia, Vietnam, Chile and Peru.\nHillary Clinton has spoken out against the TPP. AP Emerging economies have lower wages and are more competitive in basic manufacturing like clothing and textiles. Advanced countries tend to excel in high-end manufacturing, services, technology development and intellectually property-intensive industries like pharmaceuticals.\nEconomics 101 suggests nations should specialise in what they are best at producing in order to grow the overall economic pie. That is especially important right now. The International Monetary Fund this week downgraded its forecast for world economic growth this year to 3.1 per cent, 0.3 of a percentage point lower than in 2014, and 0.2 of a percentage point below its forecasts three months ago.\nPresident Obama has tried to appease the left of his party by insisting that labour protections setting fair working hours and prohibiting child labour are built into the TPP text. The rules are designed to limit Asian \"sweatshops\".\nOn the flipside, the TPP will break down arcane behind-the-border rules on licensing, local content requirements, customs paperwork and work visas, to promote the trade of services like mining equipment services, logistics and finance .\nThe White House estimates the TPP will eliminate 18,000 tariffs and the Turnbull government estimates it will eliminate 98 per cent of tariffs in the region, removing $9 billion of taxes on Australian trade.\nOverstating employment benefits Still, any politician selling the deal as a massive boost to the economy is likely to be overstating the direct employment benefits.\nJean Ergas, an international economics professor at New York University says: \"The key benefit shall not be in job creation but in lower prices and consequent increases in disposable income, perhaps alleviating some of the impact from stagnant wages and increasing income inequality.\"\nHence, international trade can actually help the poor, especially as consumers spend a greater proportion of their income on basic goods that tend to be traded, rather than more difficult to trade services.\nStill, judging the net effect of the TPP is far more complicated. The final text of the 30 chapters will not be made public for weeks or months, until trade lawyers have completed the complex finer details.\nBeyond the economy-sapping carve-outs for Japanese rice farmers, Canadian dairy producers and US sugar farmers, there are potentially dubious intellectual property protections for pharmaceutical firms, Hollywood studios and Silicon Valley tech firms.\nIP rules are designed to incentivise and reward investment in breakthrough discoveries. Beyond a reasonable point, however, extra years of IP protection are simply a windfall for incumbent producers at the expense of consumers, as new emerging competition is stifled.\nThe copyright protection Australia granted the US in the 2004 free trade deal, of the life of the author plus 70 years, was deemed by the Productivity Commission to be excessive and a \"net cost\" to Australia.\nA one-page fact sheet on IP, published by the Department of Trade and Foreign Affairs this week, says Australia will not need to change its IP laws to adhere to the TPP.\nTrade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb stared down a US demand for at least eight years of data exclusivity protection for biologics drugs, holding the line at five years.\nPolitically, Robb played a shrewd game in limiting any openings for Labor to run a scare campaign against the deal. Prescription drug prices are unlikely to rise, as Australia retains its existing biologics data exclusivity law.\nThe investor-state dispute settlement chapter includes a \"safeguard\" for legitimate government regulation of health and the environment, including tobacco.\nThough Japan has not eliminated trade barriers, the removal of some tariffs and allowing more foreign beef and pork into its market will assist the government's \"Abenomics\" program to restructure its mollycoddled economy over the medium to long term.\n\"The TPP trade agreement could have some important effects at a sectoral level, though the impact at the national level seems likely to be modest,\" says Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips\nStill, the TPP was never just about economics, especially for the United States juggernaut. The TPP across the Pacific Rim has a strong strategic element.\nAs well as the US seeking to tap into the 3 billion middle-class consumers in Asia expected over the next 15 years, the TPP will help cement the American presence in Asia. The trade partnership is designed by the US to strengthen diplomatic and security partnerships with Asian allies, especially in the face of a rising rival in China.\n\"Under this agreement, we, rather than countries like China, are writing the rules for the global economy,\" Obama said this week.\nWhile the TPP deal was clinched by the US Trade Representative, Mike Froman, the upper echelons of the State Department and Pentagon were also eager for America to economically and commercially cement itself in Asia.\nDisappointment with Hillary Clinton Hence, there will almost certainly be deep disappointment with Hillary Clinton's populist anti-TPP stance, given that she was so instrumental in driving the US \"rebalance\" to Asia as secretary of state in the first four years of the Obama administration.\nIn a speech in Adelaide in 2012 before the accord was finished, Clinton sold the TPP as \"upping our game . . with partners across the region\" including Australia.\n\"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade: the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field,\" she said.\nChina was left out of the TPP because it could not meet the strict rules seeking to level the playing field against state-owned enterprises or preventing IP theft that Chinese hackers have become infamous for.\nBeijing will forge ahead trying to negotiate its Asian region trade pact, though it has not ruled out joining TPP in the future.\nMore broadly, trade wonks say the deal sets the architecture for future multilateral trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) being pursued by the US and Europe.\nThe rules on the environment, labour and tobacco in the TPP will probably form the basis of TTIP.\nIt partly explains the frustration of big business in America for an exception being made in the deal that will stop tobacco firms suing governments for anti-smoking policies. The US business lobby fears the crackdown will spread to alcohol and other areas in other trade deals.\nOverall, Jeff Schott, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says the deal is \"very constructive\" in opening new commercial opportunities and strengthening strategic relations between the 12 countries.\n\"An economist will always argue they didn't go far enough on market access for political reasons,\" Schott says.\n\"We saw some useful incremental increases to trade liberalisation which will allow competitive producers to ship more to major projects like the US, Japan and Canada.\"\nNew Zealand trade minister Tim Groser, a former trade technocrat who helped found the TPP, says the TPP has \"established a direction of travel\" in liberalising trade, even if dairy quotas were only lifted slightly in North America and Japanese beef tariffs were lowered to 9 per cent and not eliminated.\n\"Long after the details of this negotiation on things like tonnes of butter have been regarded as a footnote in history, the bigger picture of what we've achieved today will be what remains,\" Groser says. \"It is inconceivable that the TPP bus will stop at Atlanta.\"\nIf TPP is indeed the start, not the end, of multilateral trade liberalisation, then the accord has made some useful steps enhancing the trade of goods and services, as well as enhancing foreign investment.\nThe real test now will be to overcome political hurdles to legislate the deal in each of the 12 countries.\nObama faces a tough sell to a sceptical Congress, while Canada's New Democratic Party has threatened to block the deal if it wins government at the election this month.\nRobb is hopeful the \"politics\" at play in Clinton's posturing will not kill the deal.\n\"The fact of the matter is that this package on balance will deliver demonstrable benefits for all countries involved, not just in terms of market access but also in promoting peace and stability across the region,\" Robb says. \"I note that Hillary's response does seem somewhat qualified, leaving some wiggle room.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:05:54.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
