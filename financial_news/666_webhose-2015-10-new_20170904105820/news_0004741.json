Monday was also a national holiday in Japan.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was up at 120.05 yen, solidly in the middle of its well-worn range against the Japanese unit.\nOne-month dollar/yen implied volatility, which measures the cost of hedging against sharp swings in the yen, stood at 8.475 percent, its lowest since Aug. 21, and far below two-year highs above 13 percent touched as recently as late August.\nThe euro was steady at $1.1355, after scaling a three-week peak of $1.1397 on Monday.\nAgainst the yen, the euro was flat at 136.29.\nThe Australian dollar edged down 0.2 percent to $0.7344 , after rising as high as high as $0.7382 on Monday, its highest since late August.
