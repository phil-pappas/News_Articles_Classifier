As a result, LMC Automotive is raising its 2015 total light-vehicle sales forecast to 17.3 million units from 17.2 million units and its retail light-vehicle forecast to 14.2 million units from 14.1 million units. \n\"The tenacious pace of auto sales since May, combined with the current favorable position of the U.S. economy, is increasing the level of upside potential to 2015 by 100,000 units, while nearly wiping out any downside risk,\" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive . \"Looking forward, the forecast for 2016 is 17.6 million units, but growing economic stability and consumer confidence could easily push light-vehicle sales toward 17.8 million units next year.\" \nNorth American Production North American production in September 2015 was 1.58 million units, the same level as in August 2015 but a 3.4 percent increase compared with September 2014. Production levels were increased to improve inventory levels to a 60-day supply from a 55-day supply in August, but lower than the 64-day supply in September 2014. LMC Automotive's 2015 production forecast remains at 17.5 million units, a 500,000-unit increase from 2014. LMC is forecasting 2016 to reach 17.9 million units. \nAbout J.D. Power J.D.
