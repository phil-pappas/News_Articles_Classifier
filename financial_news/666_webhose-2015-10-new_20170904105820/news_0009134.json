Demolition of the existing building on the site, the former Scoozi restaurant, got underway in late September. First deliveries are scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLocated at the corner of Huron and Sedgwick, 400 West Huron will feature 25 condominiums with two- to four-bedroom floor plans ranging from 2,144 to 4,091 square feet. The building is designed by Berkelhamer Architects with interiors by SemelSnow.\nAccording to Thaddeus Wong, co-founder of @properties , the sales team wrote over $51 million in contracts, at prices ranging from $1.2 million to $4 million, in less than 10 months.\nWong said one of the keys to the successful sales program for 400 West Huron was a full-scale model and sales center that Smithfield built on site. He also pointed to pent-up demand for luxury new-construction in downtown Chicago, as well as 400 West Huron’s bold architecture and innovative amenities like climate-controlled wine storage, a heated dog run, and private 2- or 3-car garage stalls for every unit owner.\n“The architecture and design at 400 West Huron are truly next level,” said Wong. “We were able to build a lot of excitement around the development, and the market responded in a big way.”\nInterior finishes at 400 West Huron include 24” x 24” marble, slate or limestone tile flooring in living areas; Valcucine kitchen and bathroom cabinetry; 10’ ceilings; Miele integrated stainless steel appliances; 8’ solid-core interior doors with Baldwin hardware; and multi-zone, year-round heating and air conditioning. All units also have expansive terraces.\n“New condominium development in Chicago often looks to the past, but 400 West Huron is about the future. Our buyers were ready for something different, something that doesn’t exist in the current marketplace. This will be a defining building for the neighborhood,” said Bill Smith, founder and president of Smithfield Properties.\n# # #\nAbout Smithfield Properties\nSmithfield Properties, LLC is a Chicago-based real estate development company owned and operated by W.
