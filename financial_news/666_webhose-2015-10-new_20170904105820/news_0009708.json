You might do well to brush up on your prospectus-reading skills, with many of the class of initial public offerings of 2014 and 2015 boasting high single-digit and in some cases double-digit earnings' growth with strong performing share prices to match.\nLow cost phone plan provider Amaysim, patent enforcer IPH, home wares and furnishings company Adairs, web project management company Axonex, farming company Costa Group â€“ all made their respective ASX debuts in the past 12 months and all have share prices holding firm and performing well in the face of volatile markets.\nLast year was the strongest year for IPO supply in a while, with the IPO \"window\" opening halfway through 2013, kicked off by IVF clinic network Virtus Health and leading to a chain reaction of new listings. There is more in the pipeline.\nAnd while the sharemarket has been volatile during the past year, with the ASX 200 losing about 15 per cent since April, sharemarket debutants have performed relatively well as a group.\nThere have been a total 48 listings since the start of last year and the average share price return of this group has been 7.3 per cent, with the 12 IPOs that listed this year returning 19.1 per cent on average to the end of September, according to Deloitte. The average performance of all companies that listed in 2014 during the first half of 2015 was 12.7 per cent, Deloitte says.\nIn comparison, since the start of 2014 the S&P/ASX200 index has shrunk about 4 per cent.\nOne reason IPOs have significantly outperformed in their debut year is because they've been born from growth sectors, says Deloitte head of M&A transaction services Ian Turner. Technology, media and communications, financial services and healthcare are the most heavily represented sectors among the recent floats.\nTechnology, media and communications was the largest sector for floats over the past year and a half, accounting for 47 per cent of the listing values. This was led by the $2.1 billion listing of accounting software developer MYOB Group, followed by the floats of billboard operator QMS Media and software developer Touchcorp.\n Listings of Pepper Group and Eclipx Group led the financial services segment to the second largest represented segment among ASX debuts. Medibank Private's giant $5.7 billion float in November last year pushed health care into the third most popular segment for new listings.\nPhone plan provider excels For fund managers, IPOs are a hunting ground for growth opportunities. One of the best Investors Mutual senior portfolio manager Hugh Giddy has seen for some time is low-cost phone plan provider Amaysim.\nGiddy, a growth-focused manager, says he expects the company to increase earnings 10 per cent or more for three more years at least, a kind of growth he says is rare if not impossible to find in the broader market.\nGiddy took a pre-float allocation to Amaysim and bought more in the (post-float) secondary market. He now owns about 11 per cent of the company, which has a market capitalisation close to $390 million and is a top five holding in Investors Mutual's Concentrated share portfolio.\n\"There aren't a lot of companies growing fast,\" Giddy says. \"The world is a slower growing place and you have to look hard to find these types of growth opportunities.\"\nFunds manager Platypus Asset Management has caught onto the stash of growth companies among the new listings on the ASX.\nWithin Platypus's concentrated portfolio of 33 stocks, the manager has a reasonable stake in six ASX newbies, according to Platypus founder and chief investment officer Don Williams.\n\"In a market like this one, which is bereft of profit growth, we think it makes the IPOs coming out all worth looking at because you know they are coming to market with a good story to tell,\" Williams says.\nIt's not so much the sectors the new listings represent but rather their preparedness for market scrutiny and desire to perform well within their first three years on the ASX that appeals to Williams.\n\"If you are [listing] your business you're not going to be selling it or partly selling it when your profits are declining. You're only going to go to market when you've got a good story to tell so you get a decent valuation and earnings are growing,\" he says.\nWilliams' top tips for picking the best of the bunch based on his last two years of reading every IPO prospectus that's come to market are as follows:\nPick companies with a three-year history of earnings. Beware of \"patchy\" earnings with numbers missing. Stick to growth-oriented stocks: \"In this environment, try to pick at worst high single digit growth or double digit earnings growth,\" Companies where key management has skin in the game are best, either through escrow periods or remuneration based on stock performance. The size of the multiple the company floats its stock at is a subjective assessment, but Williams uses this rule of thumb: \"If you're listing something on a 25-times price/earnings multiple, we argue it has to have a three-year compound annual earnings growth rate of 20 per cent.\" Within the past year, Williams says his holdings of newly listed companies outperformed his broader portfolio holdings by more than 10 percentage points.\nHe believes there are still some potentially attractive opportunities within the IPO pipeline. Later this month superannuation administration company Link Group is expected to hit the boards with an expected debut market value of $2.3 billion, touted as the biggest float of 2015.\nThe ASX website shows 19 companies have made applications to list this month or next.\nCompanies speculated to be \"doing the rounds\" or testing appetite of institutional investors include radiology group I-MED Network Radiology, cancer treatment provider Genesis Care, Aventus Retail Property Fund and residential estate agents LJ Hooker and McGrath.\nSources familiar with some of the plans of this year's IPO hopefuls suggest a few could delay their floats into next year because of concerns over plunging markets. An IPO road show can sometimes result in a trade sale rather than ultimately lead to a market listing, they say.\nNot all floats are going to live up to the expectations the sellers outline in their marketing materials. Some funds managers, such as Lazard Asset Management's co-portfolio managers Rob Osborn and Phil Hofflin, won't even look at a company unless it has at least a three-year listed track record. Lazard's value-oriented screening process eliminates new companies from its investing universe because its model requires predictable earnings and profits.\nListings can tank for any number of reasons, from lacklustre investor demand to the company's story not holding up to public market scrutiny.\nThe heavily touted accounting software business MYOB was one of the recent high-profile floats in the last year to trade below the value its shares were first offered at.\nAfter jumping out of the blocks to be trading close to $4 per share on its first day, MYOB shares are now trading some 15.5 per cent lower.\nPriced too high Williams at Platypus says he believes the Bain Capital-owned MYOB priced its shares too high from the outset. Deloitte's Turner points to investor concerns over the growing market share of rival Xero and other cloud-based platforms.\nInvestors often criticise private equity-backed floats, suggesting much of the value of a company in PE hands can be sucked out before it lands on the public markets.\nThe Deloitte data proves otherwise, measuring the average return of 2014 floats at 15 per cent at the end of the year with 2015 PE-backed floats returning 19 per cent on average at the end of September.\nA big feature of private equity floats over the past couple of years has been their willingness to retain shares in companies they took to the public markets six and 12 months after the float, according to Turner.\n\"This can be critical from a marketing perspective to demonstrate confidence in the IPO as owners are not simply offloading assets that have peaked in terms of attractiveness,\" he says.\nNotable PE-backed floats performing well since mid-2013 include the Quadrant-backed Virtus Health, the Anchorage Capital-backed Dick Smith, Pacific Equity Partners-backed Spotless Group and personal care product manufacturer Asaleo Care, and the Carlyle Group and TPG Capital-backed Healthscope.\nPE players have largely emptied their portfolios following a strong run of PE-backed floats since 2013, says Turner.\n\"The IPO pipeline continues to push new listed companies into those [technology, media and communications, financial services and healthcare] sectors. I'd be surprised if they didn't continue to outperform the index like they have,\" he says.\nThe risk of investing in the relatively unknown can also carry a reward, Turner says.\nIf a company can get through its first year of public trading unscathed and deliver on its pre-float promises, the \"scepticism discount\" its shares tend to trade under post-float can be lifted and further boost its share price, he says.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Matt_JS", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts"], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:19:32.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
