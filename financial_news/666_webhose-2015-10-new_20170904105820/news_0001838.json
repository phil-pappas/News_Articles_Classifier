The Trust’s distribution relates to net profits and overriding royalties generated during September 2015 as provided in the conveyance of net profits and overriding royalty interest. \nThis month’s distribution was $0.3 million, or $0.2 million higher than the previous month ($0.00750 per unit vs. $0.00280 per unit), principally due to higher average realized prices, higher production from the Developed Properties and lower capital expenditures from the Developed Properties, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses. Average realized prices for the Developed and Remaining Properties were $38.38 per Boe, as compared to $37.43 per Boe in August. \nThe current net profits amount from the Developed Properties was approximately $0.3 million. The current month’s lease operating expenses for the Developed Properties, including property taxes, were $3.0 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior month. The current month’s capital expenditures for the Developed Properties were $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior month. The current month’s distribution also includes $45,000 for the 7.5% overriding royalty on the Remaining Properties from 38 Orcutt Diatomite wells, 11 Orcutt Field wells, five East Coyote wells and two West Pico wells. The cumulative deficit of the net profits interest on the Remaining Properties, including the 7.5% overriding royalty payments, stands at $1.8 million. \nTrust administrative expenses and the monthly operating and services fee payable to PCEC totaled approximately $0.1 million and were deducted in the calculation of the total distribution. \nSales Volumes and Prices \nThe following table displays PCEC’s underlying sales volumes and average prices for the month of September 2015: (a) Crude oil sales represented 96% of sales volumes. (b) Crude oil sales represented 100% of sales volumes. \nOverview of Trust Structure \nPacific Coast Oil Trust is a perpetual Delaware statutory trust formed by PCEC to own interests in certain oil and gas properties in the Santa Maria Basin and the Los Angeles Basin in California (the “Underlying Properties”). The Underlying Properties and the Trust’s net profits and royalty interests are described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). As described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, the amount of any periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, development expenses, and the amount and timing of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis.
