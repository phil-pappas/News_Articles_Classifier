The index rose 4.9 points to reach 92.1 for the month of October. October also saw an increase in consumer confidence, which had fallen for three consecutive months. The index rose 5.6% on a month-over-month basis and 6.0% on a YoY (year-over-year) basis.\n\nAs seen in the above chart, the October numbers don’t show a dramatic increase, but they do indicate consumer optimism regarding the future of the economy, which is a positive indicator for retailers such as Macy’s (M), Kohl’s (KSS), Walmart (WMT), and Amazon (AMZN), as the holiday season is right around the corner.\nHow important is the holiday season for retailers? The holiday season, which is the most important season for retailers in terms of sales, starts two or three weeks before thanksgiving. However, in recent years most retailers have sought an early advantage over competitors by kick-starting their campaign long before these days. For example, Walmart (WMT) started its holiday season campaign in early September, and other retailers have followed.\nRetailers have already started ramping up their services to cater to the high flow of orders in the holiday season. Macy’s (M) has stated it will employ close to 85,000 seasonal employees for the upcoming season, and retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are leaving no stone unturned to speed up deliveries to customers.\nThe question is why so much preparation is needed. The answer is that approximately 30% of retailers’ annual sales happen during the holiday season, according to the NRF (National Retail Federation). The NRF has estimated 3.7% YoY growth in holiday sales, which when combined with rising consumer confidence is a highly positive indicator for retailers.\nTo get exposure to US retail stocks, you can invest in ETFs such as the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), the Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary ETF (FDIS), and the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR).\nIn the next article, we’ll have a look at initial jobless claims.\nContinue to Next Part \nBrowse this series on Market Realist: \nPart 2 - Initial Jobless Claims Fall Steeply University of Michigan Walmart Holiday Season", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:32:33.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
