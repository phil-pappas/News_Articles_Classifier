A copy of the letter is in possession of ET.\nCrisil Ratings has downgraded the bonds by five notches to `D' from `A' on September 25, almost three weeks after the company defaulted; raising doubts over rating companies' ability to warn investors on time. It had earlier placed the ratings on \"rating watch with developing implications.\"\nIn case of the Amtek Auto imbroglio too, the role of rating companies in predicting crisis in advance was on question.\n\"Through our ratings as well as rating rationales over the past year and a half, we have been highlighting to investors consistently about the need to watch the process of bifurcation of assets and liabilities between the corporations of two states, and all this while, the payment was always on time,\" said Crisil's chief analytical officer Pawan Agrawal .\n\"The bonds carried a trustee-administered payment structure and in such cases, the role of a trustee becomes very important. In this case the trustee did not invoke the guarantee as envisaged in the structure. The trustee issued the letter indicating shortfall in debt servicing on September 19 and it reached us on September 22. We downgraded the bonds on September 25,\" said Agrawal.\nThe company under the united Andhra Pradesh government raised a total of Rs 3100 crore in three separate bond issues in 2012. The company was supposed to pay Rs 151 crore of interest on these bonds while it had only paid Rs 87.7 crore, resulting a shortfall of Rs 63.3 crore.\nThe bonds were guaranteed by the state government.\nThe trustee said in the letter that it was in the process of initiating steps against the company to safeguard bond holders' interest. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:59:01.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
