One of the fundamental differences between the stock market and the forex market is that with the forex market, traders can either long or short their positions and stand to profit from both appreciating and deprecating currencies”\nThere are also other key differences between the two markets that make the foreign exchange market look attractive to investors and traders.\nNo central exchange – The foreign exchange market has no central exchange and is commonly referred to as Over the Counter exchange. Traders can enter and exit trades from anywhere in the world on their computer or mobile device. All that is required is an internet connection and a trading platform.\nLeverage – The foreign exchange markets offer leverage at a significantly higher level than the stock markets. Some foreign exchange brokers can offer leverage of up to 1:500. However, this can be a double-edged sword because whilst traders stand to make significant profits if the trade goes their way, significant losses can also occur if the trade does not go in the direction intended.\nTo learn more about how to trade the foreign exchange market successfully, USGFX offer a coaching program to provide a structured understanding of forex trading.\nAbout USGFX\nUSGFX is a regulated Australian broker and holds an Australian Financial Services License.
