My name, address and bank details have apparently been compromised. \nIf I lose any money because of the hack, when would I be liable for the losses? For example, do I have to tell my bank and credit card providers? FK, via email \nThis is just the latest scandal that TalkTalk customers have had to endure, many having suffered years of poor customer service - as well as another security breach earlier this year (more on this below). \nThis time, the credit card details of four million customers could be compromised following a “significant and sustained” cyber attack at TalkTalk this week. \nBut fraud losses will not be reimbursed if a customer is deemed to have acted \"negligently\" with their details or fails to report the loss quickly enough. \nA criminal investigation has now been launched to investigate the extent of the hack which compromised customers' names, addresses, date of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, TalkTalk account information, and credit card and bank details. \nIn its letter to customers, TalkTalk said: \"We are continuing to work with leading cyber crime specialists and the Metropolitan Police to establish exactly what happened and the extent of any information accessed.\" \nDido Harding, of TalkTalk, insists its systems are \"as secure as possible\" and that it is providing customers with \"information, support and advice\". \nSo should you tell your bank as a matter of course that you have the misfortune of being a TalkTalk customer? \nThe company is not saying explicitly whether you should or not, suggesting you just keep an eye on your accounts - it is unclear whether this means every day, every hour or every week. \nHere is the company's checklist. \n= TalkTalk tells customers: do this now = *Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and credit card statements \"for the next few months\" *If you notice anything unusual, contact your bank *If you do notice something, tell Action (LSE: 0LQX.L - news ) Fraud *If you are contacted by someone asking for your personal data or passwords, \"take all steps to check the true identity of the organisation\" *Check your credit report with one of the credit agencies, Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) , Equifax (NYSE: EFX - news ) or Call Credit TalkTalk said that customers are responsible for checking their own financial accounts and informing their bank or building society if any money is stolen. \n\"Data thieves sell this information to aggregators, who cross-reference and compile full identities called 'fullz' on the data black market,\" said Ryan Wilk of NuData, a cyber security expert. \n\"With this level of information, fraudsters can create new bank accounts or take out loans under an actual person’s name, causing problems for fraud victims for years down the road.\" \nBut James Daley, a consumer campaigner of Fairer Finance, said: \"Customers shouldn’t be overly alarmed by these kind of stories. British legislation protects customers who are victims of fraud - so you shouldn’t be left out of pocket if your bank account is hacked.\" \nBy law, a customer is due compensation if they notify their bank of an unauthorised payment \"without undue delay\". \nThis must be no later than 13 months after money has been debited from their account, after which redress might not be paid, according to the 2009 Payment Services Regulations . \nBut if a customer fails to keep their \"personalised security\" safe they could be liable to pay up to £50 of any losses that are incurred. \nThis type of compensation only applies if a payment is considered to be \"unauthorised\". \n• Fraud victim: 'Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) made me sign a gag order before returning £2,000 of my own money' \n= Fraud risk: TalkTalk customers 'easy prey' = \nA similar data breach affecting TalkTalk last year resulted in millions of customers being targeted by fraudsters who, using their personal details, can pretend to be their bank or building society . \nBut this type of fraud could be considered as an \"authorised\" transaction, by law, as customers are considered negligent if they are tricked into handing over sensitive details. \nScammers could now prey on TalkTalk customers, using stolen information to lend authenticity to attempts by criminals to request bank details and Pin numbers. \nPreviously, TalkTalk customers who had thousands of pounds stolen after being targeted by criminals posing as company employees said they were refused compensation for their losses, the Guardian reported in March. Data was also stolen from TalkTalk in February. \nIn this situation, the bank has no obligation to refund the money because it counts as \"gross negligence\" under the payment regulations. \nIf a victim is tricked into paying money to a fraudster's account, they must request a refund within eight weeks. But the bank or building society has no obligation to refund the losses in this situation. \n\"Never respond to emails from your bank or building society,\" said Mr Daley. \"Your bank may well contact you by email to tell you about new products or changes to their terms, but they will never require you to disclose sensitive information to them by email.\" \nThe Telegraph revealed earlier this year that 100,000 Virgin non-cable telecoms customers would be forcibly moved to to TalkTalk, a decision which sparked a backlash from people concerned about TalkTalk's poor customer services record.. \n• TalkTalk complaints: all the contact details you need, including Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) handles, email addresses and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) pages \nDo you have a question?
