Times has run large ad units on its front page before. Most recently, “minion” characters graced the top of the page over the actual words “Los Angeles Times” to promote their eponymous film.\nThe ad placement comes during a turbulent period for the paper and its owner Tribune Publishing. On Monday, CEO Jack Griffin sent a memo to employees outlining a buyout program. Last month, the company fired L.A. Times Publisher Austin Beutner just a year after he was hired.\nSome observers on social media said the all-encompassing ad marked a sign of the tough times. One Twitter TWTR 6.99 % user even noticed that a “San Francisco” dateline for a story—which the ad sticks into— was misspelled .\nLarge ads on the front pages of print products have become more commonplace in recent years, including at The Wall Street Journal, as ad dollars shifted from print to digital. Last year, Verizon ran ads on the covers of Time Inc. titles Time and Sports Illustrated, bucking a sacrosanct convention about leaving ads off of magazine covers.\nAn American Airlines spokesperson said the front page ad is part of a larger fall advertising campaign focusing on Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. The campaign also includes digital and out-of-home advertising but “print is still a huge thing for us,” the spokesperson said.\nAccording to Kantar Media, American Airlines spent $3.9 million on newspaper ads last year, down from about $5.5 million the year prior.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/651079997705220097", "https://twitter.com/philwillon/status/651077647145959424", "http://adage.com/article/media/time-starts-selling-ads-magazine-covers/293361/"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T15:17:14.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
