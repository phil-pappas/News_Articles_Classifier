Our 10 commercial offices across the UK have had their best year ever.” \n“The regions have spent several years in the doldrums, but we are seeing the commercial lettings market increase, but it must be said this is against a backdrop that has been terrible,” Mr Elliott said. \nHowever, Knight Frank said that sales of luxury homes had reached a plateau as the market digested the impact of last year’s stamp duty hike. \nUnder new stamp duty legislation the homes costing between £925,001 and £1.5m has resulted in an additional 10pc bill, and properties above £1.5m have been hit with an extra 12pc charge. \nMr Elliott, said that prime property prices were now flat after years of unabated double-digit growth. \n“There’s a period of reflection going on , volumes are weakening and people are more hesitant. It’s a combination of significant price rises over the last few years and the threat of additional taxes. However, there are still some buyers who are interested because of the low interest rate environment and, in some cases, an attractive currency play.\" \nThe group said that its international offices were also performing strongly and demand in its Indian and Australian business was helping to offset China’s slowing economic growth. \nKnight Frank is currently working on the redevelopment of the Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) centre on London’s Southbank which will include 868 homes as well as offices, shops and restaurants. \nKnight Frank, which is one of the biggest partnerhsips in the UK, will split its profits between 65 equity partners, 8,000 staff and reinvestment in the business (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:50:33.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
