Zimmerman's headquarters is located in the business district off Cypress Creek Road in Fort Lauderdale, where tens of thousands of commuters drive past their agency each day. The agency believes lighting up the building will serve as a powerful demonstration of hope for all of those suffering from breast cancer.\nZimmerman was inspired by long-time client/partner AutoNation and its advertising campaign Drive Pink. In addition to advertising, the automobile giant will be giving out hundreds of thousands of pink license plate frames for display to encourage their customers and associates to help find a cure for the disease. \n\"As an agency, our mission is to be relentless in our fight, but never rest in the gloryâ€¦ and this is the most important fight there is. Lighting up our building is something we believe will symbolize our passion for finding a cure and inspire others to do the same,\" says Founder and Chairman, Jordan Zimmerman.\nAccording to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, the disease is the second leading cause of death in women and nearly one in eight will develop breast cancer over the course of a lifetime.
