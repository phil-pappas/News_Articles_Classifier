( http://1.usa.gov/1Gbb31A )\nShares of Twitter, which had about 4,100 employees globally as of June 30, rose as much as 6.7 percent to $30.68 on Tuesday.\n\"We feel strongly that engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" Dorsey said in a letter to employees. \"And the rest of the organization will be streamlined in parallel.\"\nFBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, however, said the company needed to focus also on \"rationalizing sales\" along with engineering to achieve its margin targets.\n \nDorsey, who was appointed Twitter's interim CEO in July after Dick Costolo resigned, has been candid about the company's problems.\nTwitter's second-quarter growth in average monthly users was the slowest since the company went public on Nov. 7, 2013. Its stock nearly tripled to a record high of $74.73 in December 2013, but has fallen about 60 percent since.\n\"The general thinking is that Twitter has a product problem, which is why they picked Jack to come in. You would normally not be cutting in engineering if you have a product problem. So I scratched my head a little bit on that,\" Seyrafi told Reuters.\nSince Dorsey took over as interim CEO, Twitter has rolled out a \"buy now\" button that allows users to make purchases and a feature that highlights the best tweets and content.\nCuts in the engineering department could hurt the company's \"ability to continue growing at a robust pace,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note.\nTwitter said it expected about $10 million-$20 million (7-13 million pounds) in severance costs and $5 million-$15 million in restructuring charges. Twitter expects to record most of these pretax restructuring charges in the fourth quarter.\nTechnology news website Re/code first reported the planned layoffs on Oct. 9.\nTwitter said it expected its third-quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA to meet or top the higher end of its forecasts.\nThe company, which will report its third-quarter results on Oct. 27, has forecast revenue of $545 million-$560 million and adjusted EBITDA of $110 million-$115 million.\n \n(Reporting by Lehar Maan and Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar; Editing by Kirti Pandey)\n \nJack Dorsey Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:30:10.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
