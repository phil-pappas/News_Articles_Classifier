Discerning patterns and insights within the data itself is the bigger opportunity.\nAs the famous Irish ex-international rugby player and team captain Brian O’Driscoll once said: ‘Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad.”\nMaking decisions based on short-term data or too few data points is exceptionally risky, and marketers must constantly assess, reassess and validate all possible marketing and business objectives to drive the type of growth to sustain a brand long term.\nAnother role comes to mind when thinking about the data agility a marketer needs to be successful—air-traffic controller. Their macro abilities to understand patterns and react to emergencies and weather conditions, while providing micro directions [such as] handing off a specific flight safely are very similar to the characteristics of a successful marketer.\nConstantly listening, interacting, questioning and probing by letting your users share both the good and the bad is a necessary first step on the path to being an agile marketer. Using online tools such as communities is a way for these interactions to create the spark for product enhancements or new products all together. “\n—Suzanne Vranica", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:53:17.592+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
