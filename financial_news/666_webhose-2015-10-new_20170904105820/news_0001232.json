To this end, the contribution made by public investment comes at the forefront. Cognizant of this fact, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation said that public investment is of great advantage for Ethiopia in fostering infrastructure development, building capacity as well as expanding skills, knowledge and expertise. This remark was made at a press conference the ministry held with a view to highlighting the significance of public investment. No doubt, creating dependable and competitive institutions would absolutely be a viable means to make the public investment feasible and desirable. Obviously, apart from accelerating Growth Domestic Product, public investment helps attract local and foreign private investment. These days, Ethiopia has been striving to meet the basic needs of the population such as expansion of education, health, social services. It has also seriously eyed on job creation, expansion of export and import substitution as well as enhancing Foreign Direct Investment. Hence, the nation is at this time in a position to effectively utilize the capital secured from financial institutions. Besides, the nation started enjoying outstanding relations with its partners based on mutual trust. This trend in turn does have positive manifestations. For instance, the country has currently secured the green light to get up to 1 billion dollars annually in the form of loans from international financial institutions. The role of public investment in the process of economic growth, in the context of Ethiopia's economy, is found critically imperative. It is largely what allows the Ethiopian workforce to produce more per hour worked than most of the rest of the world, and it is the most invaluable economic legacy the country is going to pass on to future generations. Public investment by federal, state, and local governments builds the nation's capital stock by devoting resources to the basic physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, rail lines, airports, and water distribution, innovative activity, green investments as well as job training that leads to higher productivity. While private actors also invest in these areas, they do so to a much smaller degree, in part because the gains from public investment accrue not just to those who are undertaking the investment, but to a wide range of citizens and businesses. But there is also an enormous amount of economic evidence demonstrating that public investment is a significant long-run driver of productivity, growth in average living standards. A new round of inquiry over the last decade confirmed the large impact of public investment on productivity growth. Hence, the role of public investment in driving broad and long-term economic growth and constructs estimates of how much an increased effort in public investment could boost growth in the years to come. Undeniably, investments in public capital have significant positive impacts on private-sector productivity. Not only has public investment benefits that extend beyond simply increasing measured GDP but is also offers welfare that are more broadly shared by all citizens. In simple and clear terms, public investment produces benefits that cannot be measured, such as safer water and cleaner air. So, increasing public investment is a more urgent policy priority than cutting spending. A significant increase in public investment spending would boost jobs in the short run and pay enormous dividends in more rapid productivity growth. Surely, the basic problem with the economy across the globe today is a shortfall of aggregate spending. Undertaking new projects to build roads and schools, hire teachers and scientists, and retrofit houses and businesses would help remedy that shortfall and create new jobs. In fact, if the returns to public investment are large enough, they can unambiguously improve the welfare of both present and future generations even if they are debt-financed. Hence, with ample investment in the right areas, productivity growth can be sustained. In general, Ethiopia has to capitalize on public infrastructure development as it has been playing a paramount role in beefing up investment in the economy's knowledge and technology based undertakings. And properly targeted public investment can do much to boost economic performance, generating aggregate demand quickly, fuelling productivity growth by improving human capital, encouraging technological innovation and spurring private-sector investment by increasing returns. Though public investment cannot fix a large demand shortfall overnight, it can accelerate the recovery and establish more sustainable growth patterns. Public investment could shift from its current mediocre flight to one of strong and sustainable growth.
