He warned that other nations may siphon away talented entrepreneurs from the U.S.\nRubio said the on-demand economy requires the tax code be overhauled and criticized New York City's recent efforts to cap ride-sharing giant Uber and Airbnb, which helps people rent out properties.\n\"The American people have chosen an economy in which the most valuable retailer in America, Amazon, owns not a single store; the largest transportation company, Uber, owns not a single vehicle; and the largest accommodation provider, Airbnb, owns not a single hotel,\" the senator said.\nRubio, though at one point briefly interrupted by a heckler, was received politely by the young crowd in heavily Democratic Manhattan.\nRubio, 44, is the youngest Republican in the race - though only five months younger than Ted Cruz, also 44 - and pitches himself as the candidate for the future. He's been showing more strength lately in the Republican race.\nOther Republicans, Jeb Bush among them, have also lavishly heaped praise on Uber. Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton has spoken more cautiously about companies like the ride-sharer, warning that they could be practicing \"wage theft\" by misclassifying employees as contractors.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
