Those all are places where $3,000 a month is not unexpected for a one bedroom. But here is the worse news: evidence mounts that you also may soon be priced out of rentals in prime neighborhoods of what have been second-tier cities. Pacing the list are Seattle and Dallas - but lots of towns from Atlanta to Chicago are facing a perfect storm of nothing to buy, no new middle-income apartment construction and a flood of Millennials who want to rent in cities. That means pressures on rental markets are flat-out intense. Don’t expect matters to get better soon. “This is a generational shift in where people want to live,” said Jerry Hoffman, president of Hoffman Strategy Group, a mixed use real estate consulting firm. A few decades ago this demographic maybe wanted a single family home in the suburbs. No more, said Hoffman. “They are moving from homogenous suburbs - where their parents bought - and into diverse urban cores,” he said. John Deely, principal managing broker at Coldwell Banker Bain in Seattle, added that in some cases Millennials just do not want to buy, in other cases they have had trouble getting mortgages because of too much student debt. Either way, said Deely, rents for a one-bedroom in core Seattle now are around $2,000 monthly, “double what it was just a few years ago.” Of course, in Seattle, for instance, Deely said it usually takes two years to get permits for a new multi-family building. Add in construction and time-to-market, and that’s three years away before the project begins to bring in income - a timeframe that makes some lenders skittish, said Deely. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:06:55.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
