That’s the steepest fall since January 2009. Economists had predicted a drop of 0.9pc. \nImports fell 3.1pc to €78.2bn, the biggest one-month drop since November 2012. \n• Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: 'Made (Paris: FR0010328302 - news ) in Germany' lies in the 'gutter' after Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) caught cheating \nThe trade surplus shrank to €15.3bn from €25bn in July, according to the report. \nGermany is grappling with a slowdown in China and other emerging markets, which have been key destinations for its exports. With factory orders from countries outside the 19-nation euro region down more than 13pc in July and August combined, the focus is shifting to strengthening domestic spending fuelled by pent-up investment demand and consumption. \nThe decline is the latest sign that prospects for the economy are deteriorating. Germany’s leading economic institutes are set to lower their growth forecast for 2015 to about 1.8pc from a previous estimate of 2.1pc, Reuters reported. \nThe European Central Bank will publish an account of its monetary-policy meeting on September 2 and 3 later on Thursday. Investors are looking for signs that policy makers are getting closer to increasing stimulus. \nEarlier this week Chancellor Angela Merkel denied the Volkswagen (LSE: 0P6N.L - news ) emissions-cheating scandal would hit German industry. \n“I believe that the reputation of German industry, the trust in Germany as a business location, hasn’t been so shaken that we won’t continue to be seen as a good business location,” Ms Merkel said in a radio interview. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) emerged on September 18 that VW had installed software into certain diesel models that allowed them to circumvent emissions tests in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:50:43.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
