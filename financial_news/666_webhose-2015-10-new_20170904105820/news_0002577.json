A smart mirror, which is comprised of a screen with an integrated computer, will have a virtual wardrobe function so users can try different garments on a model of themselves before getting dressed. \nThe magic mirror can even make polite outfit suggestions, to make sure you’re looking your best before leaving the house. \nThe looking glass can even flag up traffic delays, or show the weather forecast for the day. \nSome retailers are already using smart mirrors, allowing consumers to virtually try on different outfits without needing to step into the changing room. \n= The wi-fi connected shower curtain = \nThat’s right, in the future you could be washing your hair while checking the news. Using flexible display technology, your shower curtain could double up as a screen. \nThis will allow consumers to access social media, listen to music or catch up on emails while in the shower. \nCombining multiple household objects into one will become more popular in future, as consumers increasingly want to make more efficient use of space. \nThe coffee table of the future, for example, is likely to double as speaker and power source. \n= Smart scales that give you a daily diet plan = \nThere are numerous apps that tell you how many calories you should eat a day, but in the near future this could extend to your bathroom scales. \nThe scales would be integrated into a sensor pad in the floor and connected to the shower curtain screen, and could provide you with a detailed assessment of your vital statistics, letting you know many calories you should plan to consume that day. \nOther bathroom inventions include the fold-away toilet. \nFolding away neatly after use, the space-saving fold-away loo occupies much less space than toilets of the past, uses half the water and is even easier to keep clean. \n= Growing vegetables indoors and dry washing machines = \nRising global demand for food will lead to a surge in the use of hydroponic technology, allowing households to have indoor gardens that provide fresh fruit and vegetables all year round. \nThe world will need to produce at least 50pc more food by 2050 to keep the 9 billion-strong population fed. \nPests, climate, soil and disease can all be controlled through a hydroponic system. This form of crop cultivation can also be stacked vertically to save space. \nOther household items will also become more energy-efficient. Drywashers are expected to be in widespread use in fifteen years' time to save on water and electricity. The dry washer will consist of a superconductive ball filled with liquid nitrogen that spins around a ring generating a magnetic field. \n= The advanced 3D home printer = \nExperts expect 3D printers to become as ubiquitous in the home as televisions are by 2030, and that these will radically change the face of consumerism. \nEverything from tools and electronics, to food and clothing, can be printed quickly and cheaply, using just raw material blocks and \"recipes\" downloaded from the internet. \nIn the future we may simply download blueprints of products, which we can then print as many times as we like. \nHowever, this could impact a wide number of traditional industries, and potentially lead to dramatic changes in manufacturing employment. \n• Follow the Back to the Future day live here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:09:55.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
