In fact the backlog is 20 per cent higher than the former record high,\" Mr James said.\n\"The home building boom is mirroring the former engineering construction boom but the benefits are more evenly spread. There are more homes being built in Australia at the moment (over 183,000) than at any point in the past.\"\nYet finding the sites to keep fuelling the developments for big and small investors remains the tough part. Some are being helped through the rezoning of land by local councils, while other lots are coming from new private families and neighbourhood syndicates.\nOne of the most recent was at St Leonards, when JLL sold a superlot of homes for a combined $66 million. The area had been rezoned by the Lane Cove Council.\nAnother deal is by a consortium of private individuals, who are selling a medium density amalgamated \"R4 high density\" residential site in Jannali, a southern suburb of Sydney.\nIt is a site area of 4143 square metres, with the land holding comprising five detached residential dwellings, in Mitchell Avenue and Sutherland Road and is being marketed with price expectations north of $12 million.\nAdviser on the deal, director of Savills residential site sales, Stuart Cox, said the five neighbours got together to sell the site, where the zoning will allow a developer a maximum building height of five storeys.\nMr Cox said developers are now scouring suburbs where high residential zoning is in place and offering to buy homes in a \"superlot\" deal.\n\"We were approached by the five families to formulate a plan for them, after they had a knock on the door from many developers, prompted by the recent rezoning of the area,\" Mr Cox said.\nHe added it was becoming more prevalent for clusters of neighbours to sell in one lot to take advantage of the strong demand from developers.\nA private family has also appointed Savills to market 59 Park Road in Burwood. Occupying a site area of about 1833 square metres, it is zoned medium density and comprises three detached dwellings with approval already achieved for a boutique residential development.\n\"With Sydney's shortage of housing and rising prices, demand for the inner west had dramatically increased which will result in developers keen to snap up this opportunity,\" Mr Cox said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:18:04.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
