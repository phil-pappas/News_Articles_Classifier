Four have been acquired this year, including Whisper Films, the sports production company owned by presenter Jake Humphrey and former Formula 1 driver David Coulthard . \nChannel 4 has set aside £20m to invest in small production companies via its Growth Fund, and half of that pot is still available for further investment. The publicly-owned broadcaster is increasing its influence in indie productions to counter rising consolidation in the industry. \nThe terms of the investment with Mr Baron Cohen’s Spelthorne Community Television, named after an area in Ali G’s hometown of Staines, have not been disclosed. A spokesman said the amount of money invested is “consistent” with all the other eight investments. \nSpelthorne, which launches later this year, will focus on scripted TV comedy written by unknown writers and will be run by Mr Baron Cohen and business partner Andrew Newman. Mr Newman, a producer, has worked with Mr Baron Cohen in the 1990s and until recently was head of Objective Productions, the company behind programmes such as Peep Show , The Cube and Fresh Meat . \nMr Baron Cohen is best known for Da Ali G Show in the early 2000s. More recently, he has appeared in Hollywood blockbusters Les Miserables and The Dictator, a comedy film co-written by the Cambridge-educated comedian. His next film, Grimsby, due to be released in February 2016, has already angered residents of the North Eastern town. \nMr Baron Cohen said: “After more than a decade away from Channel 4, it’s very exciting to come back home and back to the British TV industry that launched my career and those of many of my contemporaries. \n“This is a chance to help establish careers for ambitious people who have yet to make a mark in British television I include among these, Andrew Newman, who, let’s face it, hasn’t done a lot since he worked with me on The 11 O’Clock Show nearly 20 years ago.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:12:52.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
