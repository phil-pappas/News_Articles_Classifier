The group believes a space 11 blocks south of the Mission Bay site is a better location for the arena.\nIf the current proposal wins all necessary approvals, the stadium could be open in time for the 2018-2019 NBA season.\n\"We've been the Bay Area's team for more than 50 years, and this plan keeps us in the Bay Area for the next 50 and beyond,\" the Warriors' Welts said. \"If there were any lingering doubts about our commitment to Mission Bay, purchasing this land should put them to rest. We love this neighborhood; nobody else is getting this land.\" (Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Richard Chang )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:08:54.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
