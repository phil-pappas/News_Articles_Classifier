It is now time for decisive action to address the funding shortage which essentially denies poorer students a tertiary education and therefore an opportunity to improve their lives. The hard truth is that there is not enough money allocated to both students - through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) - and to universities in the form of government subsidies. NSFAS have acknowledged that they are only able to fund roughly half of the young people who qualify for their grants - ie the very poorest - and would need a further R51 billion to be able to fund all those who qualify. Universities are also hobbled by a severe shortage of funding. Their core subsidy has consistently fallen in real terms for twenty years. Student numbers, in turn, have risen dramatically. Furthermore, South Africa's expenditure on higher education accounts for only 12% of expenditure on education as a whole. The rest of Africa and the world it is 20%. Instead of engaging in more talks with stakeholders the Minister should be appealing to the Treasury to urge that the funding crisis is set as a top priority. This will be the only way that this this crisis will be solved, once and for all.
