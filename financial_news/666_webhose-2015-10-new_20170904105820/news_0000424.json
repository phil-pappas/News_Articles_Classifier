Parascript partners like WesTech use Parascript software solutions integrated with M-Files to enable organizations to take the next step in their transactional data processing. Resellers, such as WesTech, easily add advanced document classification and data extraction to M-Files EIM in order to provide automation of both document classification as well as metadata extraction. This enables users to spend more time with their information and less time tagging it. With Parascript Document Classification, document classes and business rules are created dynamically via machine learning that requires little effort. The system is automatically trained so that it is constantly adapting to meet new business needs while simultaneously increasing accuracy.\n“Our customers have a diverse and evolving set of needs so we wanted a product that adapts to address different applications, which is affordable and easy to use,” said Bill West, CEO and Founder of WesTech eSolutions, Inc. “Parascript software allows us to implement small, midsized, and large, complex projects using the same platform. Parascript provides a lot of advanced functionality, but it’s easy to set-up and use, and it scales. Without this level of flexibility and the capabilities of this product, we wouldn’t be able to deliver our solutions to such a variety of clients.”\nTogether, Parascript and WesTech will also be celebrating WesTech’s record sales this year leveraging Parascript automation software with giveaways that include an Epson portable scanner and an Intel Quad-Core Tablet running Microsoft Windows 10. WesTech will be demonstrating Parascript software solutions at the M-Files 2015 Americas Partner Conference.\n“As a boutique firm offering customized services, WesTech has experienced significant growth and success in the marketplace. Its commitment to its customers is unparalleled, and we are excited to be working with such a talented team. With our combined implementation experience, Parascript’s out of-the-box capabilities and the flexibility of our API, we look forward to enabling many new, innovative solutions,” said Mark Gallagher, Vice President of Sales at Parascript.\nAbout Parascript, LLC\nParascript automates the extraction of meaningful, contextual data from image and document-based information to support transactions, information governance, fraud prevention, and business processes.
