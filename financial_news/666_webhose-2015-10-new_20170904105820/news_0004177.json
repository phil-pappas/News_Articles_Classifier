Australian mums are concerned and confused by the labelling of snack foods as 'school canteen-approved'.\nPT2M21S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Dr Kieron Rooney's analysis: see below Food companies are exploiting school canteen guidelines and putting their own, unapproved logos on sugary biscuits and salty chips to promote them as suitable, everyday lunchbox items, sparking calls for a ban for such promotions.\nThe number of logos boasting \"school canteen approved\" – or using similar language – has exploded on children's food packaging in the past two years, with consumer group Choice locating 17 such company-made logos in an investigation.\nTaste testers: Rebecca Jones, Reid Jones, Luca Portwin, Phoebe Myers and Juna Elliott. Photo: Edwina Pickles\nChoice says such logos predominantly feature on processed snacks, and influence time-poor parents' purchasing decisions. Its accompanying survey found nearly half of parents believed products with a logo seemed healthier than similar ones without.\nAdvertisement \"These labels aren't accredited or approved by an independent body, they are created by the food companies themselves,\" said Choice's Tom Godfrey.\n\"The ticks and claims are essentially acting as health halos for processed, packaged foods, manipulating parents into believing that products with them are a healthier option for their kids.\"\nJuna Elliott, 11, tries some Paradise Uglies. Photo: Edwina Pickles\nLogos include \"school canteen – meets amber guidelines\" on Arnott's Tiny Teddies, \"approved by canteen programs\" on Paradise Uglies Choc Chip Bickies, and \"school canteen approved\" with a passing the grade-style tick on Streets Paddle Pops.\nThey reference state and national guidelines, which use the traffic light system, designed to help canteen managers assemble healthier menus.\nDr Kieron Rooney, a nutrition expert at Sydney University, said it was outrageous that food manufacturers were taking a government policy to protect children's health and manipulating it in an attempt to \"health wash\" junk food.\nEight-year-old Luca Portwin tucks into a Paddle Pop.

The companies have taken the guidelines completely out of context.\"\nHe also said the guidelines themselves were weak, based on outdated nutrition criteria that had been surpassed by the front-of-pack Health Star Ratings scheme, launched last year.\nNearly half of the 17 logos found by Choice refer to being \"amber compliant, meaning the product has been classified as \"select carefully\".\nBut when put through the Health Star Ratings calculator, Choice found many only achieved three or fewer stars. Arnott's Tiny Teddy 100s and 1000s and Uglies Choc chip Bickies only received one star each.\nDr Kieron Rooney said many \"amber compliant\" foods just escaped the red, \"not recommended\" category, because they came in exceptionally small serving sizes.\n\"It's true the products are amber, but at the end of the day they are highly processed, discretionary foods arguably driving the obesity epidemic,\" he said.\nChoice's survey of more than 1000 mums and dads also found 43 per cent believe the logos have been approved by an independent authority or government body. They are not, and they are also not regulated.\nAlice Pryor from the advocacy group Parents' Voice, formerly known as Parents' Jury, said the logos had a \"powerful\" effect on time-poor parents in the supermarket aisles.\n\"Parents rely on what's on the pack, and you can't read the full nutritional panel every time. If there are two almost identical products in front of me and one had a canteen approved logo, it's going to have some influence,\" she said.\n\"The logos are misleading. Insert the word 'amber' and many parents aren't going to understand it.\"\nChoice is calling for a ban on logos that reference school canteen guidelines and has launched a campaign.\nThe Australian Food and Grocery Council hit back, saying Choice had traded off a misalignment between measures of \"healthiness\" by confusing two different nutrient profiling systems. Choice's conclusions were therefore wrong, it stated.\n\"Canteen guidelines advise foods considered appropriate for sale to children based on levels of nutrients within the products and serve size. The Health Star Rating is based on risk associated nutrients for adults on a per 100g/mL basis,\" he said.\n\"Choice is well aware that the HSR is not designed for children.\"\nCathy Zeppieri, Uglies' marketing director, said its intention with its logo was to let parents know the product was developed to be lower in energy and meet state-based amber guidelines of less than or equal to 600 kilojoules, less than or equal to three grams of saturated fat, and greater than or equal to one gram of fibre per serve.\n\"We have been monitoring the recent community concerns around the use of school canteen programs and are currently assessing our use,\" she said.\nAn Arnott's spokeswoman said Tiny Teddy 100s and 1000s were amber compliant under state programs but acknowledged the product was viewed as confectionery under the national program.\n\"We recommend they are consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet, which is also called out on the pack. Tiny Teddy are a sweet biscuit and as such, a treat, it is not our intention to portray them as a health food,\" she said.\nA Streets Ice Cream spokeswoman said the canteen-approved logos were only used on products that met the national canteen guidelines. It aimed to be nutritionally responsible.\n\"Our research shows many parents consider Paddle Pop to be a nutritionally sound treat option for their kids. The school canteen-approved logo enables parents to easily identify products that are designed for kids and meet higher nutritional standards than many alternatives,\" she said.\nWhy Dr Kieron Rooney is seeing red\nStreets Paddle Pop rainbow ice-cream\n\"There is a blue front of pack tick claiming 'canteen approved' with little attempt to qualify where this apparent approval comes from or the rating. This was the first product I noticed a few years ago and was particularly striking as it highlights a particular deficiency in the current guidelines, in that sugar content is not assessed and this product is 20 per cent sugar. How much of this is specifically 'added sugars' is not disclosed but with three different named sources of sugar in the ingredient list, it is a concern.\"\nArnott's Tiny Teddy 100s and 1000s biscuits\n\"What is happening here is an industry playing on the ambiguity of the guidelines. Confectionary is a red item. A small enough serve of biscuits can be amber. But because there is no specific guideline on biscuits covered in confectionary, Arnotts have given themselves an amber rating. Also, in the 200-gram box, consumers are not provided discrete serving sizes - despite the box carrying the self-endorsed logo. There is one bag with between 72 to 104 biscuits (depending on the variety). Parents then are expected to do the math and portion out only the appropriate serving size?\"​​\nParadise Uglies Choc Chip Bickies\n\"This logo is particularly misleading - who are the canteen programs that have specifically approved this product? This product is clearly an ultra-processed product with over 16 ingredients and a nutrient panel that really pushes the guidelines to the limit – to be amber you have to have a minimum one gram of fibre and a maximum of three grams of saturated fat – one mini pack of these \"biscuits\" has one gram of fibre and three grams of saturated fat. There is little doubt about it, just one more biscuit here and you are in the red zone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:06:03.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
