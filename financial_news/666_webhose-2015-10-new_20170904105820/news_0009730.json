( 1.usa.gov/1VGyK8U )\nThe hackers stole more than 150,000 unpublished press releases containing financial information that was then used to make trades, allegedly generating about $30 million in illegal profits, the DOJ said.\nBusinessWire said at the time that it was cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\nGoldman is often at the forefront when it comes to Wall Street's presence in social media. The bank's former technology banker, Anthony Noto, is now Twitter's chief financial officer.\nThe bank rolled out a series of recruiting ads on Snapchat last month, becoming the first major U.S. lender to turn to the instant-but-fleeting messaging app for potential hires.
