Arsineh Houspian Share on twitter by Peter Ker BHP Billiton shareholders have been advised to closely monitor the company's short-term incentive structure in the wake of a dramatic fall in its full year profits during the 2015 financial year.\nThe alert was raised by proxy adviser CGI Glass Lewis, whose assessment of BHP has been sent to institutional investors in the miner in recent days.\nCGI was mostly supportive of BHP's remuneration package, and has recommended shareholders approve all motions at the annual general meetings that will be held in Australia and Britain over the next five weeks.\nBut CGI pointed BHP shareholders to the short-term bonus paid to chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, and in particular the part that was linked to the company's attributable profit result in the 2015 financial year.\nCGI noted that Mr Mackenzie's bonus for that item had declined much less than the company's profit did in the 2015 financial year, and could be a sign of a disconnect.\n\"Whereas actual performance reduced by 86 per cent, the CEO's payout under this component only declined by 23 per cent from the prior year,\" said CGI in a note to BHP shareholders.\n\"In general, continued payouts despite a significant deterioration in results may indicate a disconnect between pay and performance.\"\nCGI acknowledged that the 86 per cent fall in BHP's attributable profit to $US1.91 billion was largely driven by factors outside of Mr Mackenzie's control, namely commodity prices.\n It was also affected by the South32 demerger, in which numerous cash-generating businesses were divested in May 2015.\nBut despite those factors, CGI said BHP shareholders would be within their rights to challenge the payout.\n\"In light of the significant reduction in both profit performance and the target utilised to assess such performance, shareholders may reasonably question the appropriateness of the payout under this component, and we believe a more complete explanation of the process employed in setting the hurdle and assessing performance would be appropriate,\" the advisor said.\nIn the annual report filed by BHP last month, the impact of the attributable profit on remuneration was explained thus;\n\"While attributable profit fell from $US13.8 billion in FY2014 to $US1.9 billion in FY15, controllable financial performance was largely in line with targets\".\nMr Mackenzie accepted a smaller fixed remuneration than his predecessor Marius Kloppers upon becoming chief executive in 2013, and his fixed remuneration ($US1.7 million) has not changed since.\nMr Mackenzie earned $US4.58 million during the year to June 30, 2015, which was lower than the $US7.98 million he earned in the previous year, and CGI said his pay was fair when compared to peers at rival big miners.\n\"The chief executive received remuneration in line with corresponding levels at the Company's UK and European peers,\" said CGI in its report.\nBHP's London annual general meeting will be held on October 22, while the Australian meeting will be held in Perth on November 19.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/pgker"], "published": "2015-10-13T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:30:25.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
