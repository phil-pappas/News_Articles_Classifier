The decision comes after prices for the industrial metals have collapsed in recent months, slumping to a five-year low in late September.\nThe news were immediately met with an overwhelming enthusiasm in the zinc market. The three-month price on the London Metal Exchange surged $189.50, or 11%, to $1,856.50 per metric ton, trading around the highest level in two months.\nFutureSource “Production is already set to be scaled back by 100,000 tons in the current quarter. This is likely to significantly tighten the global zinc market, which has been amply supplied so far this year,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.\n“The planned cutbacks in zinc production will also have an impact on lead and silver, as both metals are often mined together with zinc,” they added.\nSilver prices SIZ5, +0.09% jumped 1.2% to $15.96 an ounce on Friday, while lead rose almost 5%. Glencore itself climbed 12% and Boliden AB BOL, +13.75% a Swedish mining and smelting company focusing on zinc, rallied 14%.\nHowever, analysts at Goldman Sachs weren’t convinced the Glencore production cutback will be enough to turn the tides on the zinc market. In a report out on Friday, they cut their fourth-quarter forecast for the metal by 23% to $1,690 per metric ton from $2,200 expected previously. For 2016, they see zinc prices around $1,700, down 32% from their previous $2,500 forecast.\n“News of Glencore’s planned [500,000 tons a year] cuts to production should offer some relief, but are necessary is our view to attain our revised pricing levels,” the Goldman analyst said.\n“However, with the demand risks as they are, we believe it is prudent to wait for major tightening in zinc mine supply before getting really interested.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:07:03.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
