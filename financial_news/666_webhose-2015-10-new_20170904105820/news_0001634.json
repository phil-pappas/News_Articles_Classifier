Now, the Google owned company has just made the service official with the name YouTube Red. Subscription to this service brings almost all YouTube videos available to the subscriber, all for a price tag of $9.99. It brings things like advertisement free playback and even the ability to save almost every video for offline playback. At present, only a limited number of videos were available offline, but this new service allows users to download anything they want. Sponsored Links \nThere will be additional content as well, but specific details of the same have still not been revealed. This exclusive content is said to be produced by YouTube itself, and many famous artists have joined in to create their own shows. The company wants to bring as much value to the service as possible and has revealed that YouTube Red would get as many as 10 original series in the coming months. Even the hugely popular YouTuber, PewDiePie will have an exclusive series on the service and so will College Humor. Users who are subscribers also have access to Google Play Music. \nYouTube Red sounds like a great option for consumers especially since it also comes with Google Play Music subscription all for $9.99 per month. However, it may not be the best option for content creators. Google is forcing almost all YouTube partners to join this service and anyone who does not wish to be a part of it, will have their videos unlisted. The concept is simple – those who upload videos to YouTube and make money of it will also have to take part in YouTube Red. Those who opt out of the service, YouTube will mark their videos as private and they won’t be available to anyone. The company states that this was done to make sure that almost all videos are available to the users who subscribe to the service. \nYouTube Red and YouTube Music will initially roll out in US on October 28. The company is yet to announce any details about its international availability. As for the YouTube Red Original series, the company adds that they will start to roll out sometime early next year. Also, in case you are interested in trying out the service first, YouTube is offering a free one month trial before use to US customers.
