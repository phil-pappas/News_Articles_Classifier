What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about whether a surviving parent can receive benefits based on the deceased spouse's record if their child lives with someone else. Question : I’m representative payee for my deceased sister’s young child, who is under 16. The child is with me because my sister’s husband—the child’s father—has no stable residence. Is my sister’s husband eligible for survivor benefits due to having a child under 16, even if the child doesn’t live with him? Answer : I don’t believe the father can collect a Fathers Benefit if the child is not in his care. The child can collect a child survivor benefit through age 19 if he or she is still in high school, or he or she can collect it indefinitely if he or she is disabled.
