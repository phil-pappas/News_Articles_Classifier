Following a July drop in air cargo volume of 0.6% year-over-year (YOY), “the downward trend in world trade volumes appears to have paused, at least for the time being,” IATA said.\nIATA cited “weaker than expected global economic growth as well as focal shifts in some economies” as causes behind air freight’s tepid 2015 numbers. Year-to-date , the accumulated global air freight volume has risen 2.6% YOY. At this point in 2014, global air freight volumes had risen 4.5% YOY.\nSlow growth this year in the emerging Brazilian and Argentina markets, plus China’s ongoing economic struggles, combined with a shift toward domestic manufacturing and consumption in both the US and China, are driving down the global air freight market in 2015. “If the current trend were to continue,” IATA said, “we would see negative year-on-year comparisons in the coming months.” But export orders have stabilized, IATA said, “a tentative [sign] that things won’t get worse.”\nBy and large the world’s air freight market continues to be upheld by the Middle East, where cargo volumes rose 10.4% YOY in August and capacity grew 14.3% YOY; the Middle East moves 14.2% of the global air freight market. Europe also saw modest improvement in August, as volume was up 0.7% YOY; IATA cited a recent surge in manufacturing business in Europe “could finally be starting to support air freight demand.” Europe holds 23.2% of the global market share.\nElsewhere, air freight volumes in North America, with 20.1% of market share, dipped 3.3% YOY; Latin America (2.6% market share) was down 7.3% YOY; Asia-Pacific (38.5% market share) was down 1% YOY. Africa air cargo grew 2.3% YOY in August, but the region holds just 1.5% of the global market share.\n“After declines in June and July, signs of stabilization in air cargo are welcome, but all is not well ,” IATA DG and CEO Tony Tyler said. “Even though world trade volumes have slightly picked up, the industry will have to work hard to match the strong [4.5% YOY growth] finish to 2014.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:21:35.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
