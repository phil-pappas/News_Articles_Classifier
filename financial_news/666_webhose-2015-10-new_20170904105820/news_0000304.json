Photo: Glenn Campbell\nFrench oil major Total and Malaysian national oil company Petronas have both signalled they are keeping a close eye on acquisition opportunities in the Australian oil and gas sector as the extended weakness in commodity prices throws up a wider and higher-quality range of potential targets.\nThe companies, both partners in Santos' $US18.5 billion ($25.5 billion) GLNG gas export venture in Gladstone, used last Friday's marking of the first exports from the plant to voice interest in further investments in the local sector.\nTotal and Petronas have both been cited by analysts as potential suitors for some of Santos' assets, or indeed for the company itself as it goes through a comprehensive strategic review that executive chairman Peter Coates has stressed will look at all options, given that \"everything is on the table\".\nTotal's new head in Australia, Petter Undemâ€‹, confirmed the French major is looking out for opportunities, while declining to comment specifically on Santos or any other potential targets. He signalled that with investments in both GLNG and in Inpex Corporation's $US37 billion Ichthys liquefied natural gas project in northern Australia, the oil giant is keen to add to its business here, despite the program of cutbacks in capital expenditure and costs announced by the group in September.\nAdvertisement \"Being involved in two LNG projects means we are here for 40 years, and that means of course we will be looking for other opportunities,\" Mr Undem told The Australian Financial Review.\nTotal's recent investment in Papua New Guinea, where it bought into the large undeveloped Elk-Antelope gas fields and has taken over as operator of the fields from InterOil, appears not to have dimmed its keenness also to become an LNG operator in Australia. Its involvement in both GLNG and Ichthys is as a non-operator, minority partner.\n\"Obviously if we can add value as an operator we would like to do that,\" he said. \"We would like to be operator as well.\"\nShapes up But Mr Undem, who took over as head of Total's Australian business in late August, said that Total already has a large portfolio in LNG and whether it would expand in LNG \"will depend on how the future market shapes up\".\nTotal also has interests in Australia in unconventional exploration through a joint venture with Central Petroleum in permits in the Northern Territory and Queensland. Mr Undem, who has extensive experience in unconventional oil and gas from roles with Total in Argentina, said it was still too early to give any assessment of the potential of that acreage.\nMr Undem was also guarded about potential further investment in offshore exploration by the French major, which drilled expensive wells in the offshore Browse Basin in 2013-14 with little success.Total drilled no offshore wells in Australia this year, and has none pencilled in for 2016.\n\"We have been involved in a lot of wells in the past and for the moment we are analysing the results in order to see what is the best way forward for these different permits,\" he said.\nMeanwhile Petronas' head in Australia, Jim Stannard, indicated he is also in the market for potential acquisition opportunities here, where the Malaysian major has previously voiced enthusiasm to expand because of the low country risk compared with other gas-rich regions such as the Middle East.\nMr Stannard was previously with Canadian unconventional oi and gas player Progress Energy which was acquired by Petronas in 2012 for $C5.5 billion ($5.86 billion) and moved to Brisbane late last year from Petronas's Kuala Lumpur headquarters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:52:47.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
