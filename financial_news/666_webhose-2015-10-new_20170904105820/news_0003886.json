WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that the strong growth in empty containers at ports that have reported September figures highlights economic weakness around the world . Outbound ships from U.S. ports often carry large volumes of scrap material—such as metal and wastepaper—that feed industrial production in China. But as the Chinese economy has slowed and the dollar’s strength has driven a wider trade deficit here at home, the demand for those products has fallen. At ports such as Long Beach, the empties are far outpacing the loaded containers, a reflection of slipping U.S. exports that are sending the trade imbalance soaring.\nThe shift in U.S. energy consumption is hitting CSX Corp. CSX -2.33 % hard . The WSJ’s Anne Steele writes the freight railroad reported an 8.8% decline in revenue in the third quarter that was largely the result of falling fuel surcharges and the steep decline in coal volume . CSX still reported a $507 million profit in the September quarter, slightly behind the earnings from a year ago. But the railroad is managing a dropoff in coal demand that weighs more heavily on CSX than on other railroads. On average, rail companies earn about 15% of revenue from coal; for CSX, it is about 20%. With coal volume down 18% in the quarter as cheaper natural gas cuts into demand, the railroad is projecting $450 million less revenue from coal this year. That is a deeper drop than CSX projected only a month ago, and CSX says the coal headwinds will continue into next year.\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -0.88 % is looking outside China for its growth. The WSJ’s Gillian Wong writes that the e-commerce giant will soon open offices in Italy, France and Germany as the company ramps up international expansion . It’s an important step since Alibaba’s home market in China is unsteady and the company is trying to look more like a thoroughly global player. Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said that for this year’s discount Singles Day festival on Nov. 11—China’s biggest online sales day—Alibaba will promote products from other countries to Chinese consumers as well as Chinese products to overseas buyers. With the rate of sales growth in China slowing, those overseas markets appear to be Alibaba’s best bet for the kind of scale the company is seeking.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES ENLARGE Photo: Bloomberg News The $104.2 billion Anheuser-Busch InBev NV pending takeover of SABMiller SBMRY 5.59 % PLC will set a new standard for scale in mergers and for combining global supply chains. The WSJ’s Tripp Mickle writes the deal announced on Tuesday will reshuffle the global beer industry and set the stage for higher beer prices world-wide .It would give AB InBev a dominant presence on every major continent and make it the world’s largest brewer with an estimated 28.4% market share after divestitures with some $64 billion in revenue. The acquisition reflects the strategy that also marks consolidation in the logistics market: with growth slowing, a big purchase is the easiest way to add new revenue. Beer consumption is falling in developed markets but SABMiller has operations across Africa, and AB InBev is likely to invest in production and distribution on the continent while it manages declining production in the U.S.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Africa and Latin America are on fire. ’\n—HSBC analyst Carlos Laboy on SABMiller’s drinks business.\nIN OTHER NEWS Oil prices retreated Tuesday as traders absorbed pessimistic forecasts about lingering oversupply.
