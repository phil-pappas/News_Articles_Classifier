Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) the bank needs to deliver substance,\" said Ingo Speich from Union Investment, one of Deutsche's top 20 shareholders. \nMetro rose 3 percent, after the retailer said it was optimistic for the Christmas trading period as like-for-like sales rose 1.3 percent in the final quarter of its fiscal year. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Germany's Wincor Nixdorf (Swiss: WIN.SW - news ) also surged 15.7 percent after U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . automated teller machine maker Diebold agreed to buy it for 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion). \nMining stocks such as Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) fell after data showed China's economic growth dipped below 7 percent for the first time since the global financial crisis, hurt partly by cooling investment. \nChina's factory output in September rose 5.7 percent from a year ago, against forecasts for a 6 percent increase. September retail spending bucked the cooling trend, growing at an annual rate of 10.9 percent and beating a 10.8 percent forecast. \nNevertheless, some analysts said the Chinese growth figures would still put pressure on Beijing to further cut interest rates and take other measures to stoke activity. \n\"Figures out of China are mixed. However, at this point in time, news that is not exceptionally bad or deteriorating is probably perceived as good,\" Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets, said. \"Markets are in a more optimistic mood as more stimulus out of China is expected.\" \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:00:40.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
