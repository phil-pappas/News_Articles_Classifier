Here is a glimpse into how I spent my money over the last week. Monday 1. Travel to Boston for a financial planning conference: $710.52 I travel frequently for work and have grown accustomed to searching for bargains. Let’s just say my recent trip to Boston was not really conducive to bargain hunting for hotels and the prices were far above my comfort zone. The total flight was $215.59, rental car was $181.63, tolls and parking were $82.50, and a combined total of $175 was spent seeing a game at Fenway and dining out on Lansdowne. (I paid for dinner as a birthday gift to my gracious hosts.)After spending the first two days staying with family in nearby Marlborough to save money (thanks Michael and Bethany), I decided to spend my final night closer to the conference. I found a great deal on [entity display=\"Expedia\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"expedia\" ticker=\"EXPE\" exchange=\"NASDAQ\" natural_id=\"fred/company/1523\"]Expedia[/entity] and was able to use points to help knock my rate even lower ($55.80). Although I’m still a little bummed that my initial goal of spending a few nights on a tall ship in Boston harbor was fully booked, the hotel bill was exceptionally low. Tuesday 2. Co-ed adult soccer league player fee: $45 I have retired from soccer each of the last four seasons only to get reeled back in. This year, I’ll be holding my fictional press conference at The Shelter Kitchen and Bar as I once again announce my return to join BTPU or “Back That Pass Up” in our not-so-competitive soccer league. 3. Goalie gloves: $5.00 My buddy Reid bought goalie gloves for me from the bargain bin at Lloyd’s Soccer the day of our first game. (See the preparation that I put into pre-season training.) They actually only cost $1 but I figured he saved me the time and trouble of traveling across town to buy them so the proper reimbursement includes a finder’s fee in the form of a pint of local craft beer. Truth be told, my body doesn’t really love taking a beating on the soccer field so fingers are crossed that the $5 spent buying soccer equipment doesn’t result in an expensive trip to the doctor. But heck, I know the risk and isn’t that what health savings accounts are for anyways? 4. Haircut: $21.00 I do not like getting haircuts but this was a long overdue item finally marked complete on my to-do list to improve aerodynamics on the soccer field and look a little more professional at work. Wednesday 5. Bacon cheeseburger from Melvins : $12.16 Not healthy, but necessary! Working from a home office can be a challenge. I love the flexibility of working barefoot next to my fearless watchdog Muffy , a Goldendoodle whose bark is much louder than her bite, but I also have a frequent urge to get out of the house and occasionally revert to bad eating habits in the process. Thursday 6. Wine club: $149 A 12 bottle assortment of red wines arrived at my doorstep just minutes after facilitating my last retirement planning webinar of the day. This was a follow up shipment after enrolling in the Forbes Wine Club by Lot18 recently as an anniversary gift. When I eagerly opened the box, it quickly dawned on me that the smallish wine rack in our dining room no longer had the capacity for any extra bottles.Then my wife’s voice appeared in my head asking “Scott, did you remember to put our wine club shipments on hold?” Of course not! Another costly example of how procrastination can have a financial impact. (But at least we have some nice bottles of wine to show for it!) Friday 7. Book- The Future of the Mind : $8.80 After listening to Michio Kaku’s keynote presentation at the Financial Planning Association’s annual conference in Boston, I wanted to read more about his insights into the future and passion for science. My wife and I use the Amazon [entity display=\"Prime\" type=\"organization\" subtype=\"company\" active=\"true\" key=\"prime\" natural_id=\"fred/company/102629\"]Prime[/entity] account regularly for these types of purchases. But the little things like books, apps, and music can add up quickly so we just lump these items into our “Everything Else” category in Mint. Saturday 8. Groceries: $36.75 I have lived in the Lowcountry of South Carolina long enough to expect coastal flooding. But the 1,000 year event that just occurred throughout the Palmetto State has been mind boggling. For some reason, I decided to ride my bike through the flood waters to the grocery store during a break in the 18+ inches of rain that our part of town received. While there, I purchased a few small items and cold adult beverages to get me through a college football Saturday down South.As the rains started back up again it reminded me of how unimportant the stuff in our lives can be during times of crisis. Fifteen people lost their lives and thousands more people lost their property during the flood and the recovery process will take some time. Sunday 9. Sunday brunch at Rollin’ South Kitchen: $43.31 After 4 straight days of rain, our little clan officially developed a major case of cabin fever. We got the bikes back out and went to the neighborhood restaurant . We had a meal ready to go at the house but decided we had some wiggle room in our budget. This is an area of spending that we can get into trouble with if we make these types of impromptu dining out trips too often. Monday 10. Gas: $35.86 It seems like the days of $4 a gallon gasoline are now distant history. I was able to fill up an empty tank for nearly half of what it took just a few years ago. I estimated that after about 8-10 more visits to the gas station, my Acura MDX will reach the 200k mileage mark. While it’s nice to daydream about a replacement vehicle, I have to stop and remind myself occasionally that this car is mine and I enjoy not having to make any car loan payments. In the meantime, I’ll just keep automatically socking away $300 each month into the car repair/replacement fund and hope for another 20-30k miles. Favorite purchase? This little spending exercise reminded me just how much I value experiences over stuff. My favorite purchase was definitely the trip to Boston but it also put the biggest dent in the budget. Any regrets? I spend a lot of money on food, drinks, and entertainment! This is no secret and it’s been a major budget buster since college. The good news is that now I actually track my spending a little more proactively and my wife and I have also learned to roll with the punches when those “life happens” moments occur.
