Jim Rice Share on twitter by Philip Baker Brokers and asset consultants often argue that if you want your investments to do well, you should sit back and take the long-term view.\nBut despite that well-worn mantra, the biggest problem in investment markets is often short-term thinking and short-term behaviour.\nWe all know the drill. For companies, it is about hitting those quarterly earnings targets, then it's all about buybacks and dividends.\nForget research and development. Forget investment in business and equipment. For fund managers, it is about doing well in the quarterly performance tables.\nLike most hot topics, everyone in the investment business talks a lot about \"short-termism\" but no one publicly does much about it.\nThe critics of short-termism, from companies to the sharemarket, say the whole system has lost touch with the ultimate savers and investors, handing over the real power to traders who reward companies, and ultimately their share price, for their short-term approach.\nAcademics in the United States have now latched on to the problem, while politicians are also getting involved with the debate amid new signs of weakness in the world's largest economy that mean the Federal Reserve won't be able to hike rates this year as planned.\nPoor readings on consumer spending, inflation and jobs just has to be the result of all this short-term thinking, doesn't it?\n Indeed, Mark Roe, a professor at Harvard Law School, points out that it all would be bad for the US economy – if it were true.\nBut he says it's not.\nAccording to him, if you look at the topic in a bit more detail, \"the supposed negative consequences of investor short-termism appear not to be happening at all\".\nTaking their time For sure, big-name fund managers do turn and churn their portfolios. But names like Fidelity Investments, Vanguard and other mutual funds have for decades kept to a strategy where they hold stocks for at least 12 to 15 months.\nAs for the argument that those computer traders sitting in front of their screens all day, moving in and out of stocks in a nanosecond, make it nigh impossible for management to look at the long term, he says it's not supported by the facts.\n\"In the US, neither research and development nor overall investment is declining. Indeed, many industries pursue long-term investments, notwithstanding their short-term stockholders.\"\nFor example, drug companies take years to develop a new drug – it can't be done in just one quarter – while it's impossible for oil companies to open and shut oil fields inside three months.\nIt takes years to build and develop new fields. \"And remaining on the cutting edge of innovation demands that tech giants like Apple, Intel, Amazon and Google continue to play the long game. If these industries and companies can take a long-term view, what is stopping other firms from doing so?\" he argues.\nAs for the old chestnut that a chief executive officer's pay packet is linked to the share price, implying that any short-term trading has an impact on it, Roe says, \"Boards can and sometimes do choose to tie managers' compensation to longer-range rather than current stock performance.\"\nAs for the worry that all a buyback does is rip out cash that can be used for investment and research, Roe thinks it can, but points out the firms that do it are very established and no longer the best place for that money.\n\"Indeed, the cash should leave old-line firms with weak futures and end up where it can be deployed more effectively, benefiting the economy as a whole,\" he said.\nIn the past, whenever the issue of short-termism has come up, some experts have said it is all in the mind and just market chatter.\nThey argued that short-termism is not feasible in the efficient market of modern portfolio theory.\nWhile most fund managers are taught about efficient markets that arbitrage away the effects of short-termism, many are still partly ruled by short-term thinking.\nIf short-termism is only a myth based on anecdote, it is an extremely dangerous myth, since it is just possible governments might take action to rectify a perceived wrong and interfere with the market mechanism.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:03:44.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
