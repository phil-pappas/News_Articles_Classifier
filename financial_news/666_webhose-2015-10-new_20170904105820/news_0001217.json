Hitting such a historical low is remarkable considering the U.S. workforce has grown considerably since the 1970s.\nIt was also the 31st straight week that claims remained below the 300,000 threshold, which is usually associated with a strengthening labor market. The Labor Department said there were no special factors impacting last week's claims.\nClaims for the prior week were revised lower by 1,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a more modest decline in claims to 274,000 last week.\nThe four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, dropped 3,000 to 267,500.\nU.S. Treasury yields were little changed following publication of the data, and U.S. stock futures continued their declines.\nWhile businesses appear to have little reason to let workers go these days, in recent months they have not shown much gusto in adding new hires. U.S. employers added just 142,000 jobs to their payrolls in September and 136,000 in August, which was well below the averages in prior months of about 200,000 new jobs added every month.\nThe slowdown in hiring has boosted expectations the Fed will wait until early next year to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.\nThursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose by 9,000 to 2.20 million in the week ended Sept. 26.\nPhoto Caption: Job seekers listen to a presentation at the Colorado Hospital Association health care career fair in Denver April 9, 2013.
