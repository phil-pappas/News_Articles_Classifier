Photo: Anna Kucera\nOutgoing Insurance Australia Group boss Mike Wilkins steered one of the country's biggest insurers through some of the worst natural catastrophes, as well as the global financial crisis, with a steady hand.\nMr Wilkins will cede the top seat at the $12 billion insurer to his successor Peter Harmer next month , after seven and a half years at the top. The 58-year old Canowindra-born CEO will be remembered for pushing the company's foray into six Asian countries, as well as leading IAG through the devastating Christchurch earthquakes and Brisbane floods that cost the insurer billions of dollars in claims.\nHe is also the CEO to have struck one of the biggest insurance acquisition deals in the past decade after snapping up Wesfarmers' insurance underwriting unit for $1.85 billion – a transaction that courted both criticism and praise for its boldness and hefty price tag.\nMost recently Mr Wilkins was at the helm for IAG's high-profile tie-up with Berkshire Hathaway , which saw the insurer sign away 20 per cent of its business to Warren Buffett's company in return for a huge capital boost and increased risk protection.\nAdvertisement Under his watch, the owner of brands such as NRMA and CGU saw gross written premium – or revenue – rise from $7.8 billion in fiscal 2008 to $11.4 billion in 2014-15.\nThe group's underlying insurance trading ratio, a key measure of profitability, more than doubled from 5.2 per cent to 13.1 per cent. Investors reaped the benefits of a 258 per cent rise in underlying ITR profits under Mr Wilkins' leadership.\n\"Mr Wilkins therefore leaves IAG on a strong footing both in terms of profitability and capital,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Kieren Chidgey wrote in a note. \"The challenge from here will be maintaining margins at these levels and deploying surplus capital sensibly amidst an increasingly competitive operating backdrop.\"\nMr Wilkins assumed the top job at IAG in 2008. He was considered a \"safe pair of hands\" to succeed the more outspoken Michael Hawker, who resigned as investor dissatisfaction with the foray into the UK market reached fever pitch, and after the board decided not to put a takeover approach from QBE Insurance Group to investors.\nMr Wilkins said he will be taking a break before eyeing a re-entry into corporate Australia in potential director roles following his retirement.\nIAG's share price rose 64 per cent to $4.98 during Mr Wilkins' tenure as CEO, beating the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index's 21 per cent losses over the same period.\nJason Kim, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management, which invests in IAG, said: \"Overall, I think he's done quite a good job at IAG.\n\"I do have question marks over some of the acquisitions that he's made and it's not just in Asia – but Wesfarmers itself. But he has done well.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/insurance-australia-group-in-deal-with-warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-20150615-ghou2i", "http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/iagwesfarmers-deal-an-insurance-game-changer-20131215-iyfo1", "http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/insurance-companies/peter-harmer-appointed-new-iag-ceo-to-replace-mike-wilkins-20151006-gk2vud"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:58:00.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
