Stocks closed higher in the US as data showed consumer prices fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2% in September, which was in line with expectations but worse than the previous month's 0.1% dip and well below the Fed's 2% target. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) follows weak reports including US retail sales and non-farm payrolls, prompting analysts to push back forecasts for a rate increase. \nA slate of recent lacklustre data from China has also added to hopes of further stimulus measures from the central bank. \nIn another lift to markets, remarks from European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny raised the prospect of additional policy loosening. Nowotny on Thursday said fresh measures were needed to lift inflation towards the monetary authority's target of just below 2%. \n\"We also have to remember that the ECB only embarked on its €60bn a month QE program in March this year, and it is still due to run until September next year, the stubbornly low levels of inflation throughout Europe has prompted speculation that we may see an announcement that could extend the program into 2017, though even that options is likely to present problems in terms of the amount of assets available,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets . \nThe ECB will be closely monitoring the final estimate on September Eurozone inflation due at 1000 BST. Eurostat is expected to confirm the consumer price index fell 0.1% year-on-year in September, down from August's 0.1% rise, as energy prices continued to drag. \nStateside, the University of Michigan's consumer confidence report will be released at 1500 BST. Industrial and manufacturing production figures will be published at 1415 BST. \nOn the company front, Astrazeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) plunged as US health regulators declined to approve its fixed-dose diabetes drug combination. \nOil stocks were higher including BP and Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) as Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate crude futures recovered. \nVodafone climbed after striking a deal to extend its strategic partnership with Russian mobile group MTS and expand its scope in Ukraine. \nRio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) rose as it reported increased production in the third quarter. \nBritish American Tobacco edged up as it purchased the final necessary number of shares in Brazilian subsidiary Souza Cruz, the country's largest cigarette maker, to enable it to take the company private in coming months. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,036.67 +0.57% FTSE 100 6,376.95 +0.60% FTSE 250 17,034.79 +0.50% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 122.25p +3.82% Meggitt (MGGT) 478.60p +2.48% BP (BP.) 387.05p +1.95% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 4,460.00p +1.94% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,809.50p +1.71% Tesco (TSCO) 195.40p +1.69% Capita (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) 1,258.00p +1.62% Royal Dutch Shell 'B' (RDSB) 1,833.00p +1.58% Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) (OML) 210.00p +1.55% Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) (BARC) 251.60p +1.45% FTSE 100 - Fallers AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,088.00p -0.80% Persimmon (PSN) 1,939.00p -0.72% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 755.00p -0.72% Associated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) (ABF) 3,277.00p -0.58% ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 974.00p -0.56% Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) (BDEV) 621.00p -0.40% Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.) 6,105.00p -0.38% Diageo (Amsterdam: DO8.AS - news ) (DGE) 1,827.50p -0.35% Imperial Tobacco Group (IMT) 3,454.00p -0.35% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,053.00p -0.34% FTSE 250 - Risers Evraz (EVR) 97.45p +3.67% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 255.60p +3.23% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 88.85p +2.90% Provident Financial (Other OTC: FPLPF - news ) (PFG) 3,268.00p +2.83% Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) (VED) 580.50p +2.74% Entertainment One Limited (Other OTC: ENTMF - news ) (ETO) 226.40p +2.44% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 138.40p +2.22% AO World (Other OTC: AOWDF - news ) (AO.) 159.00p +2.05% AA (AA.) 277.30p +1.91% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 104.00p +1.86% FTSE 250 - Fallers ICAP (Amsterdam: IA6.AS - news ) (IAP) 450.00p -2.72% Computacenter (Swiss: OXCCC.SW - news ) (CCC) 743.00p -2.24% Bodycote (BOY) 540.00p -1.82% Shawbrook Group (LSE: SHAW.L - news ) (SHAW) 325.20p -1.39% Indivior (Berlin: 2IV.BE - news ) (INDV) 212.00p -1.30% Wizz Air Holdings (WIZZ) 1,836.00p -1.29% Rotork (Frankfurt: RO41.F - news ) (ROR) 179.10p -1.16% Spire Healthcare Group (SPI) 383.00p -1.14% Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) (ACA) 221.30p -1.07% NMC Health (LSE: NMC.L - news ) (NMC (Other OTC: NMCX - news ) ) 805.00p -0.92% FTSE TechMARK - Risers Filtronic (FTC) 7.50p +5.26% KCOM Group (LSE: KCOM.L - news ) (KCOM) 92.00p +2.51% Oxford Biomedica (LSE: OXB.L - news ) (OXB) 7.48p +2.47% Dialight (DIA (Amsterdam: DI6.AS - news ) ) 680.00p +1.49% E2V Technologies (LSE: E2V.L - news ) (E2V) 239.00p +0.84% IShares Euro Gov Bond 7-10YR UCITS ETF (IEGM) € 203.99 +0.12% FTSE TechMARK - Fallers Oxford Instruments (Other OTC: OXGGY - news ) (OXIG) 673.50p -1.82% Consort Medical (Other OTC: CSRMF - news ) (CSRT) 932.00p -0.59% Spirent Communications (Other OTC: SPMYY - news ) (SPT (Taiwan OTC: 8431.TWO - news ) ) 77.25p -0.32% SDL (SDL (LSE: SDL.L - news ) ) 391.25p -0.32%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:44:35.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
