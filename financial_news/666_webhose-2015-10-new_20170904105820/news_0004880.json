The visit has already sealed an estimated 40 billion pounds ($62 billion) of business deals. \nBritain has laid on its highest level of diplomatic charm for the Chinese delegation, including an audience with Queen Elizabeth. But critics say Cameron is overlooking human rights concerns in his push to make Britain the pre-eminent Western gateway for investment from China. \nBritain is courting Chinese involvement in 24 billion pounds of investment projects in the north of the country as part of its plan to regenerate the region, whose development has lagged the more prosperous southeast. \nHainan Airlines Co Ltd will announce the first direct flights between Manchester and China, a deal which Britain said could boost the city's economy by 50 million pounds. \nXi, a soccer fan, will visit an academy run by soccer club Manchester City and a tour of the National Football Museum. \nHe will travel to the city's airport after a meeting with local government representatives and businesses. \nPartnerships to build and finance the regeneration of parts of the city will also be agreed, plus the finalisation of Hong Kong firm Netdragon Websoft (HKSE: 0777.HK - news ) 's 85 million-pound acquisition of educational supplies firm Promethean World Plc (Other OTC: PMTWF - news ) .
