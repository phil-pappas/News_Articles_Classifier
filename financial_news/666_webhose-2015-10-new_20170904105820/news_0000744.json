It may depend on how you’re asked to sign.\nPeople feel less committed when they sign electronically and are more likely to fib than when they sign by hand, new research finds.\nThe study, to be published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology in November, examined several forms of e-signatures, from typed signatures to personal identification numbers and check boxes, concluding that they are “largely ineffective for curbing dishonest behavior.”\nENLARGE People use e-signatures for nearly everything: to file taxes, apply for college and financial aid, bank online and sign up for online services when we check a box that says “I accept.”\n“It’s actually a cautionary tale of the price that we may be paying for convenience,” says Eileen Chou, the study’s author and an assistant professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. “People feel more removed when they’re submitting things electronically.”\nIn one of seven studies Dr. Chou conducted—all of which found that people are more willing to be dishonest when signing electronically—participants were told to complete math problems in exchange for raffle tickets for a $50 drawing. They could collect tickets based on their self-reported performance.\nAfter cross-checking the papers, the study found that participants who were asked to sign their names by hand all reported their scores honestly. Among those who signed electronically, 18% cheated, while among those not asked to sign at all, 15% cheated. This led Dr. Chou to conclude that asking people to sign by hand deters them from cheating, while e-signatures don’t serve as a deterrent at all.\nShould everyone go back to pen and paper? Not quite, Dr. Chou says. Interfaces that allow people to draw their own signatures, using a stylus or mouse cursor, could create more of a connection for signers, she says.\nTom Gonser, founder and chief strategy officer of DocuSign Inc., an electronic-signature company based in San Francisco, says his company found in trials that users who type a signature or check a box don’t feel as strongly committed to a document. Documents sent through DocuSign, which verifies locations of signers, opens up a dialogue box in which users can draw a signature or select signatures in different handwriting.\n“That step is the mental step people need in order to feel like they’re actually signing a document,” Mr. Gonser says.\nMs. Anand is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.
