PFE announced that the FDA has served a complete response letter (CRL) on its supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for oral Xeljanz for the treatment of adults suffering from moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.\nIn the CRL, the FDA asked Pfizer to provide additional safety analyses on Xeljanz and provided specific recommendations related to moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The company stated that it will coordinate with the agency to address its remarks and work on label expansion of the drug.\nAccording to company sources, 7.4 million patients in the U.S. suffer from psoriasis, with plaque psoriasis affecting almost 80% of the patients. Among them, 20% suffer from the moderate-to-severe chronic condition of the disease.\nWe note that a number of drugs are already approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. Novartis’ NVS Cosentyx and Celgene’s CELG Otezla are approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults, who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.\nXeljanz is already approved as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults, who respond inadequately or are intolerant to methotrexate. In the first six months of 2015, the drug generated revenues of $224 million, up 86% from the year-ago period.\nMeanwhile, Pfizer is working on getting an approval for other formulations of Xeljanz. A once-daily modified release formulation of Xeljanz (11 mg) is under review in the U.S. for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with a response expected by Feb 2016. In addition, Xeljanz is being developed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis.\nPfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Novo Nordisk NVO, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
