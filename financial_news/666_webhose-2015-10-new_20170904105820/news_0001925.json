This continues to make us nervous about the direction of the overall index, and particularly for companies that are unlikely to generate positive earnings in any of the next three years.\" \nThat said, price-to-earnings multiples doesn't often capture \"superior growth expectations, which we view as especially relevant for small-cap stocks,\" the note said. \"The recent pullback has created a more interesting entry point for a number of stocks, and particularly for many of those where our analysts expect strong growth over the next few years.\" More Headlines Tesla and 10 Other Companies to Invest In If You Are Optimistic About Driverless Cars \nInvestors like stocks with consistent and sustainable growth \"particularly as expectations have been moving lower for many stocks,\" the analysts write. \"Specifically, we look for compounders -- those that our analysts expect will generate double-digit organic top-line growth each of the next three years, and as a result of operating leverage, will drive a doubling in operating profit (EBIT) by 2017.\" \nThe list denotes small-cap stocks that can double their operating earnings over the three year period from 2014-to-2017, while also posting double-digit sales growth. Goldman defines small-caps as stocks with market capitalization under $4 billion. The stocks are paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nExpected 3-Year EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) Growth: 150% 3-Year Compounded Annual Sales Growth Rate: 11% Goldman Sachs Rating/Price Target: Buy/$63 Upside to Goldman Sachs' Price Target: 26% \nTheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \nWe rate APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC (APOG) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, solid stock price performance, reasonable valuation levels and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income. \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: APOG's revenue growth has slightly outpaced the industry average of 1.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 3.8%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. APOG's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.05 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, APOG's share price has jumped by 28.09%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, APOG should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 167.19% to $41.21 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, APOGEE ENTERPRISES INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of 0.42%.
