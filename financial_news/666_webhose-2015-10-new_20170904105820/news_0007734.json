Photo: Michel O'Sullivan\nThe widespread cost cutting that has become a fixture of the Australian corporate sector amid a sluggish economy is not winding down, despite a weaker earnings outlook, and it could boost earnings growth by up to 3 per cent in coming years, according to Citigroup.\nCiti equity strategists Tony Brennan and Mark Tomlins said during the August reporting season that the weaker earnings outlooks may have given the impression that opportunities for cost-cutting were narrowing.\nCompanies that had public cost saving targets in 2013 compared to 2016 had fallen by 25 per cent, but 37 out of 170 companies covered by Citi still had strategies in the pipeline or under way for the 2016 fiscal year.\nThat represents \"significant savings potential\", Mr Brennan and Mr Tomlins said.\nThe strategists calculated that the savings of the programs, including high-profile targets from Woolworths, AGL, Boral and CSL, could provide the market with a boost of approximately 2 to 3 per cent in earnings-per-share growth, despite revenue growth remaining weak.\n\"Cost initiatives have been a key driver of the stable earnings growth outside of resources in recent years, supporting margins despite lacklustre revenue growth. Without the savings, it is likely that profit growth would have been considerably weaker than that realised.\"\nEPS growth just 4 per cent It comes at a time that EPS for the market ex-resources is expected to grow just 4 per cent in the 2016 financial year, compared with the 6 to 8 per cent growth seen in the previous three years.\nThe lack of growth has stemmed from slowing underlying profit growth among the largest companies on the ASX 200, including banks, insurance companies and supermarkets which are under more pressure from competition. But the cost savings should still be supportive of margins and earnings growth, they said.\n\"There still seems a focus on cost savings, even if in some cases it's an emphasis on 'productivity'Mr – keeping cost growth below revenue growth – rather than outright cost reduction targets,\" Mr Brennan and Mr Tomlins said.\nThe landscape was changing, however, with some companies in sectors which have been under pressure for longer, including mining, engineering and media are seeing less companies undertaking cost-cutting.\nEqually, companies focused on cost cutting in 2013 were now increasing costs to protect their market share and protect their long-term viability, including media, IT, telcos and department stores.\nThe bulk of the cost-cutting activity is coming from the sectors which have more recently come under pressure, including energy, chemicals, insurance, transport, and supermarkets.\n\"The review has given us more comfort that savings can continue to underpin margins and earnings growth while revenue conditions remain challenging for a while longer,\" Mr Brennan and Mr Tomlins said.\n\"And it has eased concerns that companies are running out of options to cut costs after focusing on it for a few years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:29:41.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
