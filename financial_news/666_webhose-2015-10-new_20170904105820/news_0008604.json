Amanda Nugent Jones Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Judge on Channel Ten's Shark Tank – and founder of online \"experience\" gift provider Red Balloon – Naomi Simson told the BOSS /University of Sydney Emerging Leader event that when pitching a start-up, the key is to bring potential investors into your world.\n\"The ones that captured our imagination were the people who came in and painted a story,\" says Simson, who started her online business from home with a second-hand computer and $25,000 back in 2001.\n\"It's their job as the pitcher, whether you are pitching for funding, pitching for budgets or pitching because you are trying to sell something, you want to make sure that you are bringing the other person into your world.\n\"Any time people came out of the tank and said, 'oh they didn't understand it', well that's your job, not our job, to bring us into your world,\" Simson told the event, which also heard from Rebel boss Erica Berchtold, whose career took off after she begged Harvey Norman boss Gerry Harvey for a job.\nExcited for tonight's @AFRBoss #emergingleaders event with @NaomiSimson @ericaberchtold pic.twitter.com/Bh4Da8ckQj\n— Sydney Uni Business (@sydney_business) September 9, 2015 Customer testing Another cardinal sin, according to Simson, is not to test and refine your product on consumers as you go.\n\"The ones that made us saddest were when people came in with a product and had never shown a customer.\n\"They have spent their family fortunes designing the product, one guy had spent $600,000 on a tech app and had never shown a customer. The five of us sat there and said, 'we don't get it'.\"\n Simson – set for the second season of Shark Tank – says the most \"inspiring\" pitch was Scott Boocock from Hegs – a dual-hook peg design – that Simson backed financially, buying a 15 per cent stake for $100,000, plus a $280,000 loan.\n\"He said, 'I was standing in front of the clothes line and I couldn't work out how to hang up my wife's little black dress. It could blow away' and of course, Janine [Allis, the founder of Boost Juice and fellow Shark Tank judge] and I were completely in love. And he said, 'this peg needs hooks'.\"\n\"He said, 'I went inside and drew it up, I took it to an industrial designer, I went to a patent attorney, there were six unique elements, it was worth prototyping. I started manufacturing in China in small quantities'. Then he said, 'I am from Adelaide so how can I help my local community ... and he brought manufacturing to Australia'.\"\nBoocock took the product to the world's largest homewares show in Chicago and the 60,000 supermarkets present ordered 10 million units.\nNine months after Shark Tank, the product is being distributed in five continents, 16 countries and Boocock has won South Australian innovator of the year .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5CRwKEUiWU", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5CRwKEUiWU", "https://twitter.com/ericaberchtold", "http://www.smartcompany.com.au/leadership/45989-shark-tank-recap-how-i-convinced-naomi-simson-to-invest-in-hegs-washing-pegs-with-hooks.html", "https://twitter.com/AFRBoss", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "http://t.co/Bh4Da8ckQj", "http://bossemergingleaders.com.au/naomi-simson-erica-berchtold-ancillary-brains-and-gerry-harvey/", "http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/love_them_wisdom_they_will_leave_Q7VsGycPhSbej30kNJtwJO", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/business/clothes-peg-maker-hegs-named-south-australian-telstra-business-of-the-year/story-fni6uma6-1227437588209", "https://twitter.com/sydney_business/status/641534011056128000", "https://twitter.com/NaomiSimson", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/emergingleaders?src=hash"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:08:10.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
