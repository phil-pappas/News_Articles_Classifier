AP by Katie Walsh Foreign companies in litigious battles offshore are expected to move rapidly to freeze the Australian-based assets of adversaries after the High Court rubber-stamped the activity, lawyers say.\nThe decision, relating to a stoush between Indonesian company PT Bayan Resources Tbk and BCBC Singapore over a joint venture agreement in a coal company, reinforces the increasingly pro-international arbitration stance of Australian courts.\n\"Parties are going to be moving a lot quicker and a lot sooner to freeze assets where it's appropriate, and it'll be a case of first in, best dressed,\" said Holding Redlich partner Nathan Cecil.\n\"From the commercial side it's incredibly important because business is conducted more and more across jurisdictional boundaries. If the court's not going to assist the enforcement in those circumstances then it's not keeping pace.\"\nMr Cecil said the High Court's ruling removed any \"lingering uncertainty\" after a period of \"bated breath\", and was further evidence of the pro-arbitration stance of Australian courts. It leaves untouched the lower court's extension of the principle to awards made under arbitrations, which are becoming increasingly popular in cross-border arrangements.\nCompanies in the resources, commodities and shipping sectors were likely to take advantage of the ruling, Mr Cecil said, given Australia's status as a \"hub\" for asset holdings. It gives them access to what Mr Cecil called a \"valuable weapon\" in an arbitral or litigious battle.\nBCBC is pursuing its JV partner in the High Court of Singapore. Bayan argued that the Supreme Court of Western Australia had no power to make a freezing order against it, as it related to a prospective judgment of a foreign court and was beyond its jurisdiction.\nBut to the High Court, what mattered was that the foreign court would be making a \"money judgment\" caught by national laws dealing with the recognition of foreign decisions.\n ", "external_links": ["http://eresources.hcourt.gov.au/downloadPdf/2015/HCA/36"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:04:32.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
