The November contract expires on Tuesday. \n\"Short-covering has led to a little bit of a rally,\" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress. \nTraders closing November positions ahead of the contract expiry for U.S. crude could also be supporting prices, Le Brun said. \nBut worries over Iran boosting crude production when international sanctions are lifted and weaker economic growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, weighed on markets, Le Brun said. \n\"The fundamentals remain a little bit stressed,\" he added. \nIran plans to increase crude production by 500,000 barrels per day within a week of the lifting of sanctions, a senior Iranian oil official was quoted as saying on Monday, selling the oil to traditional customers in Asia and Europe. \nChina's GDP growth slowed to 6.9 percent in the third quarter, down on a 7 percent rise in the prior quarter, while implied oil demand was also lower, official figures and Reuters data on Monday showed. \nThat came as U.S. crude stocks likely rose for a fourth straight week, climbing last week by 3.7 million barrels to 472.3 million barrels, a preliminary Reuters survey taken ahead of weekly industry and official data showed on Monday. \nIndustry group, the American Petroleum Institute (API) will report its stocks data later on Tuesday, while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release oil inventory data on Wednesday. \nInvestors are also keeping an eye on the outcome of an European Central Bank meeting and manufacturing data from China later this week to give direction to oil markets, Le Brun said. \nThursday's ECB meeting, set against a background of lower consumer spending, could result in a further round of stimulus and asset purchases. \n(Editing by Ed Davies)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:14:00.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
