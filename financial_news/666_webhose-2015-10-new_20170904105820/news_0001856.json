Louise Kennerley by Matthew Smith National Australia Bank is the first of the big four banks to sign up to mFunds, the ASX-operated exchange for unlisted managed funds.\nNAB will include its investment products on mFund, as well as plug in nabtrade, its online equities trading platform. The agreement with NAB was described as a \"significant milestone\" by Marcus Christoe, ASX senior manager, funds and investment products.\nTo date, the banks have chosen to not participate in the managed funds exchange service, which streamlines the application and settlement process for investors to who want to buy and sell units in unlisted funds.\nThe ASX platform, which launched a year ago, effectively disintermediates financial advisors who have traditionally earned commissions by selling managed funds to their clients using technology platforms such as wraps and master trusts owned by the banks.\n\"I think the providers signing up to mFunds see it as a complement to their current business whether that be through financial advisors, ETFs, LICs and the like,\" Mr Christoe said.\nWhile the industry participation in mFunds has been strong – there are 35 funds managers offering 120 funds through the nFunds service – transactions by retail investors is understood to have remained weak. The ASX will release the first data relating to mFunds transactions in November.\nThe addition of mFunds on the share trading platforms of the remaining three banks would likely bolster retail investors' participation in the fledgling managed funds transaction service, Mr Christoe said.\nDiscount brokerage firms including Bell Direct, CMC Markets, Baillieu Holst, Burrell Stockbroking and Pershing Securities, all offer access to the service through their respective platforms.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:51:45.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
