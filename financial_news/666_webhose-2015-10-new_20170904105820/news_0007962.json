Earlier this month, the company said it had sold its Swindon store for £3.5m to an investment fund. \nAnalysts at finnCap said Lok’nStore will continue to manage the store on behalf of the new owner. Guy Hewett, of finnCap, said: “This sale puts further positive pressure on our net asset value forecasts.” \nFull-year results \nCPL Resources (LSE: CPS.L - news ) \nTUESDAY OCTOBER 20 \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in online fashion retailer ASOS (LSE: ASC.L - news ) are down more than 30pc since its peak earlier this year, and although the stock has been rocked by wider market malaise and the resignation of chief executive Nick Robertson, analysts believe the company’s “fundamentals are stronger” ahead of its full-year results tomorrow. \nSales growth of 15 to 20pc is expected for the year, as the group has already reported retail sales growth of 20pc in the four months to the end of June. Analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said: “We expect a significant sales growth acceleration in the fourth quarter, although we highlight that July and August are not particularly big months for ASOS.” \nHowever, the bank said results will be skewed by the fire in the company’s warehouse in Barnsley last year. \nFull-year results \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , Whitbread \nTrading update \nInterContinental Hotels (Other OTC: ICHGF - news ) , Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) \nEconomics \nProducer price index (Germany), balance of payments (EU) \nWEDNESDAY OCTOBER 21 \nHome Retail (Other OTC: HMRLF - news ) , which owns Homebase and Argos, will publish half-year results showing that, as previously announced, sales continued to be adversely impacted in the previous three months of the year. Only last month, John Walden, the chief executive, blamed weaker overall market conditions in August and a poor performance by a number of key electrical product categories. \nSales at Argos are expected to disappoint, touching only £1.7bn in the first six months of its financial year, having already achieved sales of £897m in the second quarter. \nDespite a dismal year, the group has launched a same-day delivery service for Argos. Analysts at Liberum said: “Delivery propositions are often used as a tool for customer acquisition, but also signal the heightened competitive landscape across retail.” \nInterim results \nHome Retail Group, Acacia Mining (LSE: ABG.L - news ) \nTrading update \nReckitt Benckiser (Xetra: A0M1W6 - news ) , Sky \nEconomics \nPublic- sector finances (UK) \nAfter a disappointing August, economists believe that the Government got the deficit back in check last month. \nThey predict that figures released on Wednesday will show the state borrowed £11bn in September, excluding the effects of public sector banks. The month is one of the more costly ones for the Government. \nPhilip Shaw, of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) , expects that tax receipts rebounded in September compared with the same month a year earlier. \nCoupled with a “continued subdued run of spending”, the figures should show that efforts to get borrowing down are back on track, he said. \nHe added: “We suspect that there will be a run of decent data looking ahead will result in the deficit reaching or bettering £70bn this year.” \nWith the Chancellor’s new Fiscal Charter on its way, the Government will need to ensure that its budget is in surplus in 2019-20, as the Charter requires. \nRetail sales data published on Thursday are likely to show that there was a small improvement in September, as consumers enjoyed the benefits of low inflation. \nTHURSDAY OCTOBER 22 \nDebenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) is expected to post its first pre-tax profit growth in four years, boosted by new store openings and new product ranges. Analysts forecast that the UK’s second biggest department store will record an operating profit of £133.9m, having already posted a comfortable £89m in the six months to July-end. \nGiven recent controversy over possible investor unrest, analysts have said they do not believe attempts to unseat its top bosses will succeed. Instead, analysts at Peel Hunt have said: “We find it hard to believe that any retail business would change its leadership so close to peak trading.” \nFull-year results", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:41:51.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
