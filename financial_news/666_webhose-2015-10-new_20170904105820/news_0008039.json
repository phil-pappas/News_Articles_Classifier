That&apos;s not for another six months. Here&apos;s a little something to tide you over.\nThe ‘Netflix tax’ In June, Chicago decided that its 9 percent “amusement tax” should cover Netflix, Spotify, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and other streaming services, to help make up for sales tax revenue lost to falling DVD and CD sales. The decision is being challenged in court.\nThe idea of taxing Netflix didn’t originate in Chicago—which, along with the state of Illinois and other local governments within it, is struggling under billions of dollars in pension obligations. Earlier this year, Australia proposed a 10 percent tax on digital downloads that would go into effect in 2017. In Buenos Aires, a 3 percent tax on foreign online entertainment providers goes into effect Nov. 1.\nTaxing online music, movies, and shows has its critics. In July, under pressure from Alabama politicians, the state&apos;s Department of Revenue withdrew a previous ruling that digital services should be covered by the state’s 4 percent rental tax.\n“If there’s anything that can be taxed, some government agency is going to figure out how to do it,” said Michael Karu, a tax accountant with Levine, Jacobs & Co. “It just depends on whether people will tolerate it, and how much they’re going to complain.”\nSometimes governments try new taxes because they’re running out of money. Other times, they’re racing to keep up with new technology or social trends, or adapting to changes in other laws. The legalization of marijuana in some states led to new marijuana taxes and even, thanks to a quirk in the Colorado constitution, to a one-day marijuana tax holiday there last month.\nE-cigarettes Regular old cigarettes and tobacco products are taxed heavily almost everywhere in the U.S. But most states still don’t know how to respond to the growing popularity of vaping, the use of “electronic nicotine delivery devices.”\nMinnesota was the first state to introduce an e-cigarette tax, in 2012, North Carolina followed last year, and this year Kansas, Louisiana, and Washington, D.C. added taxes. Last month, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel proposed a city tax on e-cigarettes that would generate $1 million a year to support community health services.\nAirbnb Hotels have paid taxes to states and cities for decades, but if you rent out your home through an online service like Airbnb, your tax burden isn’t always clear. Governments have been pushing Airbnb to help collect those local lodging taxes, and the company is starting to do so.\nOn Oct. 15, it began collecting lodging taxes in Washington state. It already has agreements to collect taxes in more than a dozen other jurisdictions, including North Carolina, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Amsterdam. Some of these taxes are hefty. In Rhode Island in July, a 13 percent “short-term room rental” tax went into effect that covers Airbnb and other home-sharing sites.\nUber Chicago&apos;s busy mayor is trying to close a gap in the city budget by raising about $700 million in taxes. Last month, he proposed $48 million of the new taxes come from higher fees on taxis and ride-sharing services. About 80 percent of those new transportation fees would come from Uber and Lyft, the mayor said. City Council members have proposed the taxes automatically double or triple during “surge pricing,” when demand rises and ride-sharing prices spike.\nSoda and junk food Can taxes make people healthier? Last year, Mexico started imposing a tax on sugary drinks of one peso per liter to cut the country’s soda consumption. There’s some evidence it’s working.\nLast November in Berkeley, California, voters approved the first U.S. tax specifically aimed at sugar-sweetened beverages, a levy of one cent per fluid ounce that affects soda, energy drinks, and sweet tea. The Navajo Nation, a 27,425-square-mile semi-autonomous Native American territory in Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, started collecting a tax on junk food. It added a 2 percent tax on food and drinks with “minimal to no nutritional value,” on top of the usual five percent sales tax. It eliminated all taxes on fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.\nBurning Man Fans of large, elaborate Las Vegas shows have long paid a 10 percent “live entertainment” tax on both admission and food, drink, or merchandise. Starting Oct. 1, Nevada changed it to a 9 percent tax on admission only.\nThe state also expanded the tax to cover two of its biggest attractions for the first time: the Burning Man festival , held every year in the Nevada desert, and the Electric Daisy Carnival, a Las Vegas dance festival that attracted 400,000 people over three days this year.\nNevada made it clear that the 9 percent tax also applies to the live entertainment provided by legal escort services. It doesn’t apply to Nevada’s 24 legal brothels.", "external_links": ["http://www.taxrates.com/blog/2015/10/14/mexicos-soda-tax-seems-to-be-working/\\", "http://publicpolicy.airbnb.com/paying-fair-share-washington-state/\\"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:06:09.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
