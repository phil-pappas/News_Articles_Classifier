Kate Geraghty Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The two states that have led the push on tax reform have rejected the notion of them introducing a broad-based land tax as an alternative to lifting the GST, making it more likely an increased or broadened GST will be a central element in the final tax reform package.\nAnd NSW and South Australia continue to be at odds with the government over the purpose of tax reforms, arguing that increased tax revenue was needed to fill the growing gap in health funding.\nThe Commonwealth wants no increase in the overall tax take but believes a more efficient tax mix will expand the economy and generate revenue.\nOn Monday, The Australian Financial Review reported that federal Treasury Secretary John Fraser and his state counterparts were modelling the effect of increasing or broadening existing state taxes as an alternative to a 15 per cent GST or a GST with a broader base.\nThey are looking at broadening or introducing land taxes, ending payroll tax exemptions and adjusting stamp duties and will meet in December before reporting to the Treasurers in early February.\nLooking at all options Treasurer Scott Morrison stressed the exercise was to assure the public that when a decision on tax reform was taken, all options had been looked at.\n\"They may or may not be palatable politically, they may or may not be palatable from a policy integrity point of view either, like the Medicare levy increase, but that doesn't mean that you don't put them all on the table and go 'OK, this is the mix, you've got to make some calls,\" Mr Morrison said.\n \"That why I have John Fraser preparing an itemised list of all the things that could be done in the tax system at a state level. That doesn't mean they'll necessarily do them, but it's so the tax system discussion is not down to the Commonwealth alone.\"\nNSW rejected a land tax when Mike Baird was treasurer and his successor, Gladys Berejiklian, is also unenthusiastic.\n\"The number one priority for NSW remains addressing the looming fiscal gap and finding more stable revenue streams to fund our growing health needs,\" she told the Financial Review.\n\"That is why our preferred option is to increase the rate of the GST to 15 per cent with compensation for households with incomes of $100,000 or less.\nSA Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis noted a land tax was raised in the SA government's tax review discussion paper earlier this year, but he ruled out its introduction.\nThe ACT is the only jurisdiction to have introduced a land tax, which is applied on every residential property in return for a gradual phasing out of stamp duties. But it has seen rates in the ACT almost double in just three years and is causing political headaches for the ACT Labor government.\nAt a meeting of state and federal Treasurers on Friday last week, the states were presented with various models that showed how much revenue could be raised through a GST of up to 15 per cent and with a GST with a broadened base. Mr Morrison also put on the table the Harper competition reforms, which recommend the states open up the human services to the private sector.\nThe states were offered a combination of growing GST revenue and competition payments made as a reward for introducing the Harper reforms.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:03:27.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
