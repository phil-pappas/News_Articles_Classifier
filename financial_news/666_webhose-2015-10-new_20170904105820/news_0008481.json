However, consolidating the interlink between relevant stakeholders helps boost the fight against illegal and contraband trading. \nEstablishing close to 55 control posts by identifying corridors that host heavy contraband flow, the Authority took various steps to raise awareness within the public on the damaging impacts of the situation. Consequently, illicit goods worth a great deal of money have been confiscated in a preventive action the Authority in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders took within five years time. But despite improvements in the fight against contraband, a lot remains to be done to do away with the prevalence of the overall illegal trade. \nTrue, lack of strong interlink between relevant stakeholders and making conditions conducive to get the public actively involved in the issue need to be strengthened with a view to fueling the national anti-contraband campaign. No doubt, illicit actors not only divert opportunities from the legal economic system, they also divert revenue threatening economic growth and development and forestalling the equitable distribution of public goods. But this goes beyond just the economic harm. The illegal scheme also incurs a significant negative social cost. \nThe very important thing which has to receive increased attention in this regard is bringing attitudinal change among the general public. In so doing, it would absolutely be possible to hit the set target along this line. This in turn highly requires augmenting efforts geared towards making contraband-free trading system via entertaining cohesive supervision. Here, coming up with the intended trade target should not be left only to the government and institutions in charge of fostering activities against illicit trade. Instead it badly needs the combined effort of all. Besides, the loose supervision should be carried out optimally to help the nation enjoy legal way of doing running business. Obviously, pushing the informal sector to take the right track helps successfully fight illegal trade. \nCognizant of this fact, taking various steps establishing a task-force at each and every sub-city to supervise the effort against illegal trade such as informal, contraband trade, under-invoicing ones would pay off. Undeniably, countries being exposed to the harms of illicit trade and the illegal economy would deteriorate the peace and security, social cohesion, economic growth and development. So, this should be tackled in no time. At present, the risks posed by illicit networks and markets are highly affecting the smooth market flow of the authorized bodies. Not only embraces illicit trade contraband and unlawful goods but it also incorporates adulterous activities with respect to narcotics, arms trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, the trade in stolen and counterfeit goods, bribery, money laundering, to name just a few. \nAs stated earlier, illegal trading such as distorting local economies, diminishing legitimate business revenues, fueling conflict, and deteriorating social conditions. financial centres nationally, regionally as well as internationally. If the country is to bring about change in all aspects, it has to well level the leeway to outlawed trade moves as illicit networks are infiltrating and corrupting licit markets, reducing productivity, make disincentive investments in research and development rife, jeopardizing public health, eroding social and institutional security, among others. \nIn addition to the direct links among specific illicit actors and networks that are of grave concern, the growing illegal economy and illegalize markets are a greater threat that countries like Ethiopia cannot afford to ignore. Illicit markets are providing not only a safe haven and exploitable sanctuaries for illicit forces but also illicit liquidity for corrupt officials to mingle, operate, and do business with, with one another or on their own. And too often, these condemn-able actors are staging operations without fear of reprisal from law enforcement. \nIn simple terms, in due course of exercising illicit trade, national revenue and assets intended to finance the future of the nation are instead embezzled and stashed away for private gain impairing the ability of communities and businesses to make the investments necessary to create resilient pathways for economic growth and give people hope for a brighter tomorrow. \nHere, critical supervision and follow up is expected to be seriously materialized as it allows the nation drive criminal entrepreneurs out of business, reduce the incentives for communities to resort to illegal commercial activity, mitigate opportunities for organized crime to taint financial system with their ill-gotten gains, and help the government sustain legitimate markets so that businesses that respect regulations can thrive.
