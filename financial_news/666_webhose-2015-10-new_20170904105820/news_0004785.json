A Kenon spokeswoman declined to comment. \nIts shares, in which 29 percent are floated, were up 4.3 percent in Tel Aviv. \nZim said in an emailed response that it \"has been contemplating going public and other financing options since 2007. This strategy has not changed. We have nothing to report at this time and do not comment on rumours\". \nLike many others in the shipping industry, Zim had been hit hard by sluggish trade in recent years and has also borne the cost of upgrading its fleet to more efficient vessels. \nLast year, Zim restructured $3 billion of its debt in which creditors took over 68 percent of the company and committed to take the company public. \nIn the second quarter, Zim posted an adjusted net profit of $23 million, compared with a net loss of $50 million a year earlier.
