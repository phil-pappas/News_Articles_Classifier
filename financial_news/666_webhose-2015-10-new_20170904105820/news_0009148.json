They are paying money to the Government in the hope of boosting their state pension, when it will have no impact whatsoever on the amount they receive. \nThe Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) is bracing itself to issue nearly a million (800,000) pensions forecasts this year, up by 45per cent on last year’s 544,000. Between April and the end of August, 328,600 were despatched. \nThis can be the first warning for many that they are not on track for the pension they were hoping for. Typically, they panic and start making voluntary contributions in the erroneous belief it will boost their pension when it will not. \nThe system of voluntary National Insurance Contributions (Nics) is fiendishly complex, with Class 2, Class 3 and Class 3A. The position has become even more tortuous ahead of the introduction the new higher state pension next April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , with different rules for those retiring either side of that watershed. \nTo cap it all, those who retire after 2016 may qualify for their pension under either the old rules or the new. Even Einstein might struggle to work out which voluntary contributions he needed to make in these circumstances. \nAccording to Government figures released on Tuesday, only 10 per cent of men will qualify for the full new higher pension, but will be paid a pension under the old rules. Overall, 80 per cent of forecasts point to pensions being paid under the old rules, with 33 per cent of women qualifying for a pension under the new rules. \nExperts claim this information is pushing hundreds of thousands into making bad decisions, and blame the poor quality of information coming out of the DWP. \nAlan Higham, founder of online pensions service, Pensionschamp , said: “This is the number one query I receive. People are getting their pensions forecasts, seeing they have a shortfall and are being led to believe they can fill it by paying voluntary contributions. When I tell them they will be wasting their money, they don’t believe me. \n“Not only do ordinary people find the entire system of contributions utterly bewildering, they are not getting the information they need from the Government to make wise choices. This needs to be easy to understand, complete and accurate.” \nTom McPhail, head of pensions research at advisers, Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) , agrees: “The DWP has to get itself into the 21st century. From the information they currently send out, people cannot tell whether they have a gap, if so where it is, or what they will receive if they pay the extra contribution.” \nSo why is your state pension so important? What can you do to boost it and what will that cost? Are there any tax implications and can you pass pension to your spouse? \nWe answer your questions. \n= Why should I look after my state pension? = \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is guaranteed by Government and enjoys privileges not available to any other pension. It rises in line with the annual increase in average earnings, prices or 2.5 per cent whichever is the higher. \nYou currently need to have paid Nics for 30 years to qualify for a full basic state pension of £115, or £6,029.40 annually. \nAfter April, you will need a 35-year record to qualify for a full new flat rate pension of around £155 weekly, or £8,060 annually. \n= Why make voluntary contributions? = \nIf you have gaps in your record, because you have lived abroad, or not worked, it may be possible to fill them by paying Class 3 or Class 2 voluntary contributions for the self-employed. \nTo find out how much pension to expect, you should ask for a pensions forecast. \n(For more information see https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-statement .) \nYour pension statement should tell you how many years you have paid Nics. If you reach state pension age before next April, and you have fewer than 30 years, then you might be advised to consider filling the gaps. So far so clear. \n= Getting to grips with your forecast = \nDiagnosing gaps accurately if you reach state pension age after April is more difficult, because there are likely to be other reasons why you are suffering a pension shortfall not least a deduction for having been “contracted out”. \nThe old basic pension was topped up by an earnings-linked element known as Serps ( State Earnings Linked Pension) or S2P. The new system is supposed to merge these two elements. \nIt was possible to opt out of the State’s earnings-linked top up, into a company or personal pension, in return for a Nics rebate. Where individuals were contracted or opted out, their entitlement under the new regime is reduced accordingly. These deductions can be draconian. \nThis is why many will be better off having their “foundation” amount, which they take with them into the new regime calculated under the old, rather than new rules. \nWhat is happening, however, is that individuals spot they are getting less than £8,060 promised under the new system, but fail to understand this is due to the contracted- out deduction not a gap in their record. In such cases, making voluntary contributions may not help them at all. \nHigham explains: “For example, someone might be getting less than the full £8,060, and also spot that they have a 31-year record rather than the 35 they need to qualify for the full level pension. \n“So they spend £3,000 buying extra years, without realising that because they were contracted out they are better off under the old system, where they are still benefiting from some element of Serps or S2P. \n“Under this system they only need 30 years to qualify for the basic state pension, which they already have. Buying added years offers them no benefit whatsoever.” \nMcPhail adds: “It is all extremely confusing, and the communication around it has not been good.” \n= How can I fill the gap? = \nYou can normally only fill gaps in your record for the past six years. However, those retiring before next April are being offered the opportunity to plug a further six years within six years of retirement. Buying back each year will cost £14.10 per week or £733.20, which will buy you an extra £200 annual pension under the current regime. \nIf you survive for four years, then your investment is made good. \nContributions rates are lower for the self-employed who can make voluntary class 2 contributions at a cost of £2.80. \n= Can I boost my pension if my record is full? = \nThose who reach state pension age before next April, who already qualify for a full basic state pension can get a further state pension top-up by making class 3A voluntary contributions. \nHow much this booster costs depends on your age, but it is not such a steal of a deal. Nevertheless, it could still be attractive to individuals with little guaranteed index-linked retirement income, but who have capital to invest. \nFrom next Monday, a 65-year-old could buy an additional £1 weekly (£52 per year) state pension for a cost of £890, up to a maximum £25 (£1,300 annually) for £22,250. Buying that same £1 under gap filling arrangements costs just £188. \nTo buy an additional £25 weekly index-linked income on the open market would cost £43,300. It is important to remember that you may pay tax on the extra income. \n= I retire after April, can I top up my pension in a similar way? = \nNo, although you may still be able to gap fill. We do not yet know how this will work under the new regime. \n= Can my spouse inherit my extra pensions? = \nThis too is complex. If you buy the Class 3A top ups then you spouse can inherit 50 per cent of this income should you die. \nOtherwise, if your spouse has a full basic pension in their own right, then you cannot pass on to them the benefits of having filled your own gaps. \nWhere they do not have any pension in their own right, then they may be able to use your record to qualify for a state pension, but only before April. \nPensions earned after April do not carry any bereavement or widows benefit. \n• How to give yourself a richer retirement: get our weekly round-up here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:46:04.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
