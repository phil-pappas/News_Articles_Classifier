The Turnbull government has only rejected one of the Murray financial system inquiry's 44 recommendations, but it's being applauded by just about every financial sector lobby group in the land, and that tells you that its reform package is soft in parts.\nThe FSI's most important recommendations – for the banks to increase the amount of capital that underpins their lending – were old news, of course.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison (right), with Kelly O'Dwyer and Malcolm Turnbull, says the government will curb superannuation fund borrowing if necessary. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nScott Morrison's predecessor as Treasurer, Joe Hockey, passed them on unchanged to the bank regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), in December last year when the final Murray report came out .\nAdvertisement APRA hit the ground running. The big four banks have raised $18 billion in new share capital since May.\nWestpac last week blamed a 20 basis point loan rate hike, which its competitors have not yet followed, on the higher capital hurdles.\nA government response to the FSI was about to be considered by cabinet in mid-September when Malcolm Turnbull successfully challenged for the leadership of the government. It is unlikely to have changed materially since then, and in key areas is cautious to a fault.\nThe rejected recommendation was an important one: for a restoration of a general ban on direct limited recourse borrowing by super funds.\nThe FSI found that limited recourse loans taken out by super funds rose almost 18 times from $497 million to $8.7 billion between June 2009 and June 2014.\nIt said continued borrowing posed a risk to the financial system and conflicted with super's role as a retirement savings system.\nHowever, the government says concerns about the impact of borrowing by super funds are \"anecdotal\".\nIt will ask the Council of Financial Regulators and the Australian Taxation Office to monitor the situation and report back in three years.\nMorrison says the government will curb superannuation fund borrowing if it becomes necessary.\nIt almost certainly will: there is no obvious reason why pell-mell growth in super debt won't continue, putting self-managed super funds, in particular, at risk.\nTwo important recommendations have been endorsed, but will enter lengthy consultation pipelines that could water them down.\nThe government says while it agrees with the FSI's finding that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) should be able to ban harmful financial products, there will need to be \"detailed consultation with stakeholders\" to ensure the power strikes the right balance, between giving the ASIC the power in \"exceptional instances\" and not bearing down on financial product innovation.\nGiven the scandals that have rocked the financial advice and wealth management industry in recent years and the calls for the ASIC to be more proactive, that is a soft response. It opens the government up to a sustained lobbying campaign from financial groups opposed to ASIC intervention.\nThe report's recommendation that superannuation funds be required to preselect income products for retirees is also only supported conditionally.\nThe government says it supports the idea, but adds that there aren't enough income products available and \"further consultation is required to develop a principles-based framework\" for them.\nA system that defaults to annuities would be a big change. It would steer Australians away from lump sums, easing pressure on pension payouts and budget finances in the process.\nHowever, the government is looking for a richer suite of products at a time when one player, Challenger, accounts for more than 90 per cent of private pensions sold in Australia. There are also competing funding models and the government doesn't want to compel a switch to pensions.\nIt's all going to take time and the clock is ticking. Legislation that cracks down on excessive credit card fees as recommended by the FSI is not expected before the middle of next year for example, by which time an election may have been held.\nLegislation giving the ASIC the power to block financial products and legislation creating a default superannuation pension option are not expected until the end of next year after industry talks have been held: the Murray financial system makeover has a way to run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:58:56.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
