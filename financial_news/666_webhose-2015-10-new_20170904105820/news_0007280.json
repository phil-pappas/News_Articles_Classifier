Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Treasurer Scott Morrison suggested the big four banks have more scope than banks overseas to absorb costs, which would mean shareholders would have to wear the pain of lower profits.\nHe urged customers to hold their banks to account and not accept the explanation that their decisions in the last two weeks to hike mortgage rates was because \"the government made us do it\" because they are required to set aside more capital to protect against another financial crisis.\n\"No, the government didn't make you do it,\" Mr Morrison said. While it was a \"good thing\" that Australia's banks are strong and profitable, \"equally, they are in a position to actually pass these costs on\".\nHe noted that the return on equity for major banks, which are expected to post combined earnings of about $30 billion this financial year, was around 15 per cent. \"That is almost double what it is in Europe,\" he said.\nThe mortgage rate hikes sparked a debate about whether the cost of the increased capital should be borne by shareholders or customers, or both. The increases could raise their combined profits by $1 billion.\nDeutsche Bank analysts estimated that absorbing the full cost would reduce the average return on equity by 0.90 of a percentage point to just above 14 per cent.\nEurope comparison 'flawed' Stephen MÃ¼nchenberg, head of the Australian Bankers' Association, suggested comparisons with Europe's banks are flawed and that looking at the experience of Canada's banks makes more sense.\n \"The return on equity of banks in Europe is still affected by the financial crisis and Europe's very low economic growth,\" he said. \"Australia's major banks' return on equity is similar to large banks in Canada, and Australia and Canada had similar experiences of weathering the financial crisis.\"\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres said last Friday that the rules have made banks safer and as such investors should require less of a return.\nHowever, bank investors scoffed at the suggestion for being good in theory but unlikely to result in people selling bank shares, not least because the big four lenders dominate the market and can push up costs without fear of losing significant market share.\nThe issue threatens to overshadow next week's Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting, which is expected by markets and economists to see the official cash rate left on hold at a record-low 2 per cent.\nSome analysts and traders believe the out-of-cycle mortgage rate hikes by the big four means the Reserve Bank should deliver an off-setting cut.\nDespite firming up his language against the banks' actions, Mr Morrison was at pains to avoid overtly bank bashing.\n\"I think what I have to focus on is what are the things I can change and what are the things I can do something about,\" he said.\n\"Now, Bill Shorten goes out there and screams at the clouds and carries on about this. I mean Wayne Swan use to do this every time when rates would change, he would pretend that he had some sort of magic wand.\n\"I just think you have got to be up front with people and I think banks have to be up front with people and if they have chosen to increase their rates because they didn't want to absorb a cost, well that is what they have done.\n\"Their shareholders might be happy about that, I suspect they are.\"\nThat is the same for self-funded retirees enjoying higher term deposit rates at Westpac, Mr Morrison told 2GB.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:06:21.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
