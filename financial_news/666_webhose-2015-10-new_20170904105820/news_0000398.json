By Lauren Davidson | Telegraph – 12 minutes ago 14.94 +0.02 \nThere are still six weeks left to go until Black Friday, but you can never be too prepared. Here's everything you need to know. \n= What is Black Friday? = \nBlack Friday is the biggest shopping day of the year , when retailers offer drastic deals and discount on their products to kick-start the Christmas shopping season. \nIf you think Boxing Day gets a little messy, you're in for a nasty surprise. \nLast year, British consumers spent £810m on Black Friday. That's a rate of £9,375 every second. This year, sales are expected to surpass £1bn, with some predicting that's how much UK shoppers will spend just on online purchases. \n= When is Black Friday? = \nThe sales bonanza takes place the day after Thanksgiving, which is the fourth Thursday in November. This year, Black Friday falls on November 27. \nMost sales kick off at midnight or at 8am, although the day is creeping earlier and earlier, with some retailers (particularly in the US) launching the deals the evening before. Last year, Amazon released flash deals every 10 minutes for the full week of Black Friday. \nDon't fret too much if you're tied up on the Friday itself. The shopping weekend also includes Small Business Saturday, Sofa Sunday and Cyber Monday. \n= What is Cyber Monday? = \nThe term Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 to refer to the first day back at work after the Thanksgiving weekend, when people would continue their shopping online on their office computers. This year, Cyber Monday is on November 30th. \nWhile many retailers offer online deals on Black Friday, usually a new trove of internet-only discounts are unleashed on Cyber Monday . Last year, Britons spent £720m on Black Friday. \nThere's also Small Business Saturday, an initiative started by American Express (NYSE: EXPR - news ) in the US that was picked up in the UK two years ago. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) encourages consumers to support their local retailers. \nThen there's Sofa Sunday, a slightly less established term for the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend, when turkey-bloated people who have shopped until they've dropped can continue the spending via mobile devices from the comfort of their own homes. \nAnd if all this consumerism is getting you down, look forward to Giving Tuesday, a day that encourages the more charitable side of things. \n= Why does the UK care about Thanksgiving weekend? = \nA worthy question. \nBlack Friday first arrived in the UK five years ago when Amazon thought it would try its luck bringing the shopping sensation to a new market. In 2013, Asda, which is owned by American retail (Other OTC: ARGB - news ) giant Walmart, participated in UK's version of Black Friday, and last year most major UK retailers including John Lewis, Marks & Spencer (Other OTC: MAKSY - news ) , Argos and even British Airways jumped on board. \nAnd with that, any remaining English decorum flew out the window . Shoppers trampled over each other in their rush to enter stores and police were called to break up fights as consumers grappled over discounted televisions and behaved \"like animals\". \nLib Dem MP Greg Mulholland even tabled a motion in the House of Commons criticising \"large retailers who chose to adopt the American retail custom of Black Friday\" for enabling public disorder and wasting police time. The motion, which was signed by Jeremy Corbyn, called on UK retailers not to engage in Black Friday again . \n= Where did Black Friday get its name? = \nThe term was first used in this context more than 50 years ago by Philadelphia police officers to describe the chaotic day after Thanksgiving when the city was overrun with the traffic of consumers flocking to the Christmas sales and sports fans travelling to the annual Army vs Navy American football match. \nRetailers tried to rename the day \"Big Friday\", but it didn't stick. \nIt is also believed that the name comes from the day when many retailers, which do not make a profit until the Christmas trading period, move from the red into the black. \nDue to the chaotic scenes that have become part and parcel of Black Friday, The Telegraph's front page last year christened the day \"black and blue Friday\". \n= What are the best deals? = \nWith six weeks still to go, retailers haven't started promoting their deals yet (but don't worry, you won't be able to miss it when they do). We'll update this when offers start coming through. \nFor an idea of what to expect, these are the deals that were available last year on Black Friday and Cyber Monday . \nAnd if the weekend comes and goes and you don't manage to cross off your full Christmas gift checklist on Black Friday, Cyber Monday or any of the surrounding days, worry not. There's always Super Saturday .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:58:36.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
