Andrew Quilty by Kate Cowling The Australian Taxation Office is upping the ante on people who use self-managed super funds to reduce or avoid personal tax by more broadly monitoring fund transfers, including investments made overseas.\nThe authority said it would take a more holistic approach to looking at SMSF members' tax affairs, rather than the previous system of watching SMSFs and other tax obligations separately, when transactions creep up into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nPart of that means getting tips from the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission when large transfers are made to \"countries [the ATO] is not comfortable with\", ATO director of SMSF risks and products Nathan Burgess said at an AMP conference in Sydney on Monday.\nMr Burgess said the key targets would be investors who were not using their SMSF for the right purposes, whether it be to avoid tax or boost their estate.\n\"[These] are people who are running an SMSF, but we're not confident it's actually about retirement. We feel that it's about avoiding taxation in their company or trust right now,\" he said.\n\"We're talking about things like dividend stripping, where there is multimillions of dollars where we believe should have been taxed outside of the superannuation system and now it's been pushed into super ... Right now, that's a very big focus.\"\nDividend stripping a concern The ATO is paying particular attention to dividend stripping, especially where companies are liquidated and the benefits are funnelled into the fund.\n â€‹In one scenario, a trustee had taken more than $1 million in credits from a company and then told the ATO they thought the company was worth $10.\nPenalties at the ATO's disposal for tax avoidance include trustee disqualification.\nMr Burgess said while most people viewed SMSFs as retirement savings vehicles, there were still thousands who had been turned away after trying to set up an SMSF for the wrong reasons, such as gambling on horse races and funding a trip to Europe.\nAbout 4000 people have had their inquiries knocked back by the authority, the tax office estimates, with extreme cases including individuals who wanted to fund future bets at the races.\nAlthough the ATO was granted new powers in 2014 to fine SMSFs that did not follow the rules, Mr Burgess said they had been used sparingly, with all financial penalties pardoned in 2014 and just minor penalties handed out.\nOther new powers at the ATO's disposal include rectification directions, where a trustee is given six months to fix a problem within their structure, or education direction, where the ATO helps the trustee fix an issue. Mr Burgess said 54 education directions have been given.\nIn 2016 the ATO will launch a voluntary disclosure framework, where trustees who break the rules can have their fine downgraded if they own up early.\nThe Tax Office was still in the process of consulting the industry on what the new framework would look like, Mr Burgess said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:23.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
