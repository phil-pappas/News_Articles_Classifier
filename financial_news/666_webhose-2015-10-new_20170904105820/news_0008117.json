This has seen Kenya become an attractive investment destination in Africa. A strong economy is boosted by massive infrastructural projects, such as roads, rail, power generation and energy distribution across the country. The government has to raise money to undertake these projects and other obligations like recurrent expenditure. Traditionally when government comes under pressure to raise more revenue, a quick place to turn to has always been the sin taxes that include alcohol. The general trend of raising taxes on alcohol is, however, too important to be left to pass without analysis and thoughtful consideration. One document that policymakers ought to look at every time this discussion comes up is a research paper authored by the former Central Bank of Kenya Governor, Professor Njuguna Ndung'u, and Professor Mwangi Kimenyi. The paper was titled: Beer Taxation in Kenya: An Assessment. In summary it states that if cheaper beers and spirits are taxed excessively, consumers turn to illicit spirits of higher alcoholic potency. But this assertion doesn't tell the whole story, especially if not put into context. INCREASED TAXATION About three years ago, the National Treasury raised taxes on keg beer, a low-end beer, in a bid to boost revenue collection. Prior to this action, demand for the lowly priced Keg beer, retailing at Sh25 per serving, was growing steadily. The product was credited for weaning a significant number of people out of the dangerous illicit drinks. The tax action in 2013 pushed the consumer price to Sh35 per serving. Being a highly priced sensitive product, consumers found this expensive and started abandoning it for cheaper illicit drinks. It had been predicted that consumers would not be affected but this was not to be, as consumption dropped significantly. The crashing demand for Senator keg beer had serious repercussions that reverberated across its entire value chain, negatively affecting the Kenyan economy. The dip in demand for the product caused by the tax increase did not only affect how much revenue was collected in excise tax, but also had a huge effect on the livelihoods of thousands of people who relied on the sorghum value chain. Senator keg is made from 75 per cent local materials, the biggest component being sorghum grown in the semi-arid parts of Kenya. These were farmers who had a market assurance for their produce as they had been contracted by Kenya Breweries Limited to grow sorghum. GRAVE REPERCUSSIONS Many businesses were also affected. Distributors closed shop and retailers closed their premises rendering many employees jobless. Many of these businesses solely and critically depended on Senator keg and the sorghum trade to stay afloat. Before the tax increase, Senator keg supported a thriving value chain comprising over 30,000 sorghum farmers, close to 100 keg distributors and another 12,000 retailers. All the participants were earning good returns on their invested capital, and contributing positively to the growth of the economy. Evidently the value chain provided employment to many more Kenyans through ripple effect. Although the situation has since positively changed after the tax remission on keg beer was reviewed at the beginning of the current fiscal year, there are many lessons to learn from this case. The biggest lesson is the fact that taking huge tax increases on alcohol year on year leads to higher consumer prices that have a negative effect on affordability and demand. This in turn depresses growth across the value chain. VALUE CHAINS The net effect on the economy is therefore negative and the government may not achieve the overall objective of growing revenue collection. There is, therefore, a need for a balanced approach, and perhaps a more critical review of this measure. Kenya needs to grow her economy in line with Vision 2030, projected at 10 per cent each year. This requires that all sectors of the economy must be continuously revitalised to ensure that they are fuelling this growth. Certain key value chains that integrate rural farmers who grow sorghum or barley need to be sustained through supportive policies. This is because these value chains often support many other SMEs who are distributors and retailers of alcoholic beverages. It is also imperative to conduct continuous studies and analyses generating empirical evidence on the impact of tax increases to businesses, consumer purchasing habits and the overall economy.
