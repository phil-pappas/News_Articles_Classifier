The last time the top 200 companies index closed below 5000 was June 2013.\nThe broader All Ordinaries index was down 98.4 points, or 1.92 per cent, at 5032.4.\nThe December share price index futures contract was 108 points lower at 4989, with 34,911 contracts traded.\nAlready down more than 1 per cent due to heavy falls on US and European markets overnight, the local market fell further just before noon.\nThat was caused by a key measure of Chinese manufacturing activity coming in at a new six-and-a-half-year low in September, and indicating the sector is contracting.\nAll sectors were lower at noon, with the big four banks all down more than 1.7 per cent and mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton down more than 2.5 per cent.\nASX final close 4998.1!!!!

Uncertainty about the extent of China’s slowdown has been on the radar of investors, particularly after the Federal Reserve mentioned China as one of its reasons for not raising interest rates last week.\nThe preliminary Caixin/Markit index, which is based on a survey of factory purchasing managers, fell to 47.0 in September from 47.3 in August. Numbers below 50 on the 100-point index indicate contraction.\nIt’s the sixth straight monthly decline for the index, which is at its lowest since March 2009, when the world was gripped by the fallout from the global financial crisis. The preliminary index reading is based on 85 per cent of survey respondents. The final figure, which is often revised, is due by October 1.\nActivity may have been weighed down by temporary factory closures and a two-day national holiday for a military parade in Beijing in early September, analysts said.\nChina’s factories cut output, staff numbers and prices at a faster pace as both new export orders and overall new orders fell, the report said. Chinese manufacturers employ many millions of workers and represent a big part of the overall economy but they are feeling the effects of a weak recovery in major markets overseas.\n“Today’s data highlights the considerable headwinds to growth from soft global demand,” HSBC greater China economist Julia Wang said.\nThe data will add to the pressure on China’s communist leaders as they try to prevent growth from falling too sharply. Service industries have been growing rapidly but economists say Beijing may still need to speed up government spending to achieve the full year growth target of 7 per cent.\nChina’s economic growth held steady at 7 per cent in the most recent quarter, which was its weakest performance since 2008.\nGrowth has fallen from the double-digit rates of the previous decade as Beijing tries to wean the economy off its reliance on trade and investment in favour of domestic spending on goods and services but the transition is challenging.\nPolicymakers in Beijing have cut interest rates five times since November and also slashed bank reserve requirement ratios in a bid to bolster economic growth.\n“The decline indicates the nation’s manufacturing industry has reached a crucial stage in the structural transformation process,” said He Fan, chief economist of Caixin Insight Group.\nJump back to top\nbusiness breaking news 22:27 PM Newcrest shares down after output fall 18:42 PM Aldi plays with trendier store decor 16:57 PM Aurizon's haulage volumes fall 16:57 PM Customers to pay for FSI recommendations 16:48 PM Positive start to year for Beacon Lighting", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausbiz?src=hash", "http://mozo.com.au/credit-cards", "https://t.co/00d8j7yqaN", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://twitter.com/EvanLucas_IG/status/646567803307188224", "http://widgets.mozo.com.au/news/n-business", "https://twitter.com/ANicholson_IG/status/646567748856709121", "http://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPC?a=News", "http://news-assets.mozo.com.au/images/mozo-powered-mini.gif", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/315c29ddd840fd89e7230ebae06f92b2", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASX?src=hash", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-09-24T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:00:31.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
