Years of low interest rates mean many schemes are in deficit and these sometimes need to be filled by the company before the life insurer takes on the risk. \nAon Hewitt said in a report there had been 3.6 billion pounds in bulk annuity deals in the second quarter, compared with only 800 million in the first quarter. \n\"With insurers busy on a substantial number of transactions which could conclude before Christmas, 10 billion pounds is not an unrealistic expectation for year.\" \nBut European Solvency II capital rules to be introduced in Jan 2016 are likely to mean insurers have to set aside more money to cover the cost of bulk annuity transactions and these have been a concern. \n\"2015 has been a period of flux,\" Aon Hewitt said, pointing out that on Solvency II, \"some details have remained obstinately grey\". \nLife insurers are moving to reinsure this business outside Europe to soften the impact of the new rules. \nPrudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) and Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) were the most active in the bulk annuity market in the year to date, the report said.
