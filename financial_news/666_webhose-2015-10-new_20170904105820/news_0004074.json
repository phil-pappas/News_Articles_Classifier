Also, she outlined the business propositions to meet the needs of the local emerging middle classes, for example the consumerization of the Neurobion and Floratil brands as well as the geographic expansion of the Bion brand into Brazil. As a solid signal of Merck’s Consumer Health business commitment to the region, Kemmerich-Keil pre-announced the launch of a new innovative product across almost the entire Latin American region in 2016. Latin America playing growth engine role As the successful implementation of the 3x3 strategy in the region remains the focus – aiming at a minimum of 3% market share and at least 3 leading brands per market – Latin America has been showing the best performance for Consumer Health globally. The region is expected to see the majority of the business global strategic initiatives by the end of the decade. Consumer Health is present in the three biggest categories in the region: a) Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements; b) Cold and Clammy; c) Allergy and Analgesics; all categories experiencing strong market growth of around 5%. Latin America played a key role in the consumerization of Neurobion and Floratil from Merck Serono, the former most contributing to absolute growth in the region. In Brazil, the Floratil consumerization approach drove a 34% net sales growth in 2014 versus 2013 and the franchise is expected to be the second fastest growing in the Latin American portfolio by the end of the decade. Bion is expected to become the fastest growing brand in the region, after the successful launch of Bion3 in 2014 in Brazil. In Chile, thanks to a consumer approach with focus on digital already initiated in 2010, Bion3 has become the 2 nd biggest OTC brand and the best-selling multivitamin with a market share of ~60%. Q2 2015 organic sales growth In the second quarter of 2015, Consumer Health reported net sales of € 227.6 million, indicating a strong 16% organic growth versus the year-earlier period. Consumer Health continues to be the fastest growing business at Merck. All global strategic brands outperformed versus last year with Neurobion, Dolo-Neurobion and Femibion being key contributors. Key geographies with strong growth momentum were Chile and Mexico for Latin America, as well as Indonesia and the Philippines for Asia Pacific.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:13:39.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
