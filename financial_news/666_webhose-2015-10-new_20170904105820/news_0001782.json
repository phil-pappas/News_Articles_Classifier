The fund raising will add about 100 basis points to Westpac's common equity Tier-1 ratio, taking it to over 14 percent on an internationally comparable basis.\nThe move comes after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in July demanded that banks set aside bigger cash buffers against their mortgage books, a key source of revenue, amid fears of a house price bubble.\nWestpac was widely expected to raise about A$3 billion by November after heavy-lifting by rivals earlier this year. But analysts lauded the bank's move to increase variable home loan and residential investment property loan rates by 20 basis points, effective Nov. 20.\nEconomic pain in Australia almost over?\nRichard Jerram, chief economist of the Bank of Singapore, says Australia's economy may have reached comfortable levels on the back of a \"more sensible\" Australian dollar.\n\"What I did like particularly in that was the announcement of the increase in home loan rates ... which I expect the other major banks to follow over the near term,\" said Morningstar analyst David Ellis.\n\"This is evidence that whilst they have to raise capital to meet higher regulatory requirement they are not going to smash their return on equity. That's the key to this.\"\nAustralia's four major banks - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia , National Australia Bank , and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - have now together raised over A$20 billion since May.\nAnalysts, however, still estimate a shortfall of about A$20 billion over the next two to three years as Australian regulators try to bring banks' capital ratios in line with international peers.\nWestpac announced a full-year cash profit of A$7.8 billion, up 3 percent from a year ago, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It expects to announce a dividend of 94 cents a share.\nRead More Australia's August trade deficit widens to A$3.1B\nTrading in Westpac shares has been halted and is expected to recommence next Monday.\nBank shares have fallen 5.7 percent to 12.9 percent so far this year as concerns mount over stricter capital rules and banks' ability to dole out large dividends. Westpac is down 8 percent so far this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:08:42.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
