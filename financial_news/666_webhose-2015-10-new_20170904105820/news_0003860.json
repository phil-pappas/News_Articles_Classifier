This is so because one broker might be the best for a trader but not for an investor and the one who is good for an investor may not be so good for a trader. Let me tell you the difference between a trader and an investor to sort your confusion. Traders buy and sell shares frequently, hoping to make quick profits. But investors hold on to their shares for at least five years and generally a lot longer. If you are an investor, brokerage generally won't make a big difference in your returns while if you are a trader, brokerage can mean whether you end up making a profit or loss. So, a trader would ideally look for the broker with the cheapest brokerage. Now, there are some important pointers to keep in mind as you start your research to find out the broker who suits you the best. There are full-service brokers who would charge you brokerage as a percentage of your trade value. And then there are discount brokers that are much cheaper as they charge you according to the number of trade, irrespective of the trade volume. Some brokers offer online trading services too. If you see money wise, then discount brokers are good for all. But what if you need trading advice too. Discount brokers usually do not offer any research or advisory services. In this case, you will have to turn back to full service brokers who generally provide stock recommendations. After reading all the above mentioned lines, it becomes very clear that in order to get the best broker for yourself, you will have to consider not one but many aspects. Service fee or brokerage is a big factor but not when you just cannot afford to do trading without a broker's advice which you won't get from a cheap, discount broker. Some people prefer to do everything online to save time and money. For such people, online brokers are a boon.To conclude, do a good homework because it all boils down to your hard earned money which you would not like to give in the hands of just any other broker recommended by your family or friend. Recommendations followed by your own research and analysis are what should be your approach towards finding the best broker.
