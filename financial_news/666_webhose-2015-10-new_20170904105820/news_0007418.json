It didn’t.\nAfter threatening to strike, union leaders got FCA to gradually increase hourly wages for more junior workers to more than $29 an hour, from a high of $19.28. The deal will cost the automaker close to $2 billion more over four years, including wages, improved 401(k) plans, bonuses and other benefits, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because those details aren’t public.\nDuring the additional three weeks it took to get the enhanced accord, the UAW also saw General Motors Co. -- its next target for contract talks -- post its most profitable quarter ever. While the Fiat Chrysler deal will be the starting point for negotiations with GM and Ford Motor Co., the UAW will probably seek an even more lucrative deal from them than smaller, weaker FCA. That may mean better profit sharing, bigger bonuses and more jobs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:56:34.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
