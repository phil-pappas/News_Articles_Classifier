But Mr Comyn said it had lost customers and money because it refused to offer zero per cent balance transfers, which can be offered for up to two years.\nHe said the bank agreed with imposing a minimum repayment of interest and principle on credit cards, something that had been introduced in Britain.\n\"We support the introduction of minimum repayment requirements that help customers pay down their debt levels\", he said.\nHe said the minimum repayment should be up to about 2.5 per cent. CBA lifted its own minimum repayment from 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in 2008. He said it found some customers had difficulty reaching the repayment limit, but these difficulties were overcome.\n Senate committee chairman Sam Dastyari has said he favours recommending this option to ensure people don't get into a cycle of long-term debt.\nMr Comyn denied the bank's enthusiasm for banning zero per cent balance transfers was more about reducing the ability of competitors to take its customers.\nHe said CBA competed on other features, including technological innovation such as giving customers the ability to block overseas transactions.\nWestpac's head of its commercial and business bank, David Lindberg (its chief product officer until June), did not support raising the minimum repayment amount, but argued that giving customers the ability to set their repayment period would be more effective in reducing the number of people who got into long-term debt on credit cards.\n\"We don't think [mandatory] minimum repayments go far enough. All credit card issuers should provide an option to pay off their debt within one, three or five years,\" he said.\nHe said those who had been using credit cards \"inappropriately\" as a long-term debt instrument and repaying just the minimum amount for a long period should be offered alternative products to transfer their debt to with lower interest rates.\nHe said Westpac had offered 277,000 credit card customers personal loans instead.\n\"All customers should have an easier method of repayment,\" he said.\nMr Lindberg didn't recommend a ban on zero per cent balance transfers, but said the term of these offers should be limited.\n\"We know that a balance transfer when used properly is to the benefit of our customers. Forty per cent of our customers who take up these offers, do in fact pay off their debt,\" he said. He said the maximum term for zero per cent offers was 20 months.\n\"We are also aware that customers who take up zero per cent balance transfers and they extend and extend and they get to the end of the cycle and have as much and sometimes more. We want to force customers to face the end of the debt.\"\nNational Australia Bank group executive Anthony Cahill argued 0 per cent balance transfers were important for competition.\n\"It was interesting that the bank with the largest market share [CBA] does not support zero balance transfers. We believe they are an important part of the competitive mix,\" he said.\nHe argued these promotions were a useful tool for customers, saying people who took up balance transfer offers were four times less likely to move into delinquency than other credit card customers.\n\"It allows them to consolidate debt, get their finances under control. We don't believe it leads to customers being in financial stress,\" Mr Cahill said.\nNAB has the smallest share of the card market of the big four, at 10.5 per cent.\nMr Cahill said the bank was open to discussing proposals to mandate minimum credit card repayments. But he also pointed to the risk that some changes could have unintended consequences, such as driving customers towards higher-cost payday lenders.\nwith Clancy Yeates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:04:17.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
