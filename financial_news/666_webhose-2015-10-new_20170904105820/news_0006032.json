The new packaging features new custom design elements with updated brand logo and imagery, and a neatly designed ‘BX’ seal that spotlights the brewery’s industrial setting in The South Bronx.\n“While the larger format can was popular on some occasions, most of our fans and retail customers said they’d prefer the standard-sized 12-ounce cans for everyday drinking,” said Chris Gallant. “Their feedback is very important to us, so we felt this was the right time to switch up our packaging, not only to grow our business but to meet the needs of our loyal customers.”\nThe concept behind the new packaging and design is to emphasize that The Bronx Brewery “does one thing and does it right” - crafting the most exceptional pale ales on the east coast. The Bronx is a no-nonsense borough with a long history of thriving industry and commerce, and the new premium can design reflects the same ethos and excellence of the product inside.\n“The Bronx is where stuff is made in New York City. It’s a hard-working and very proud borough, and we wanted to create a straight-forward yet elegant design that represents that spirit,” says Patrick Libonate, VP of Marketing. “We feel this design not only represents The Bronx, but also that our pale ales are brewed with high quality, well-sourced ingredients to achieve bold yet balanced pale ales that we love to make and drink.”\nThe following year-round offerings are now available in 12-ounce cans in the on and off-premise in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut:\nBronx American Pale Ale: Deep amber in color with English caramel & biscuit malts balanced with West Coast citrus hops. (Orange, silver and black packaging)\nBronx Rye Ale: A crisp, golden-orange pale ale with bold rye & piney hops. (Blue, silver and black packaging)\nBronx Belgian Pale Ale: A remarkably intricate South Bronx take on a Belgian classic with notes of tropical fruits and spices. (Green, silver and black packaging)\nBronx Session IPA: An easy-drinking IPA that packs plenty of tropical hop flavor and finishes tart. (Red, silver and black packaging)\nThis week, several NYC accounts will host launch party events for the new cans: Bronx’s Hogs Head Tavern (Tuesday 10/13, 7:00pm) Manhattan’s City Swiggers (Wednesday 10/14, 7:00pm) Manhattan’s Tribeca Taphouse (Thursday 10/15, 6:00pm) and Queens’ Nowadays (Friday 10/16, 5:30pm).\nThe Bronx Brewery’s new packaging comes at a time when canned craft beer has never been more popular—can sales contributed 40% of total craft beer growth in 2014 (Nielsen). For The Bronx Brewery, sales of the 16-ounce cans grew 46% year on year, so momentum is already in place. “We're seeing that consumers are choosing cans more often than ever before,” says Patrick Libonate. “The convenience is great because they are portable, don’t break and stay colder longer. The quality is much more consistent as cans are better protected against light than bottles.”\nFor more information please visit http://www.thebronxbrewery.com .
