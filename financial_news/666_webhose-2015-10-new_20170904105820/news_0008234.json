By contrast, retail funds gather 50 per cent of fees despite holding only 30 per cent of funds under management.\nSelf-managed super funds paid out 25 per cent in fees, with 29 per cent of funds under management.\nAll three groups, however, effectively funnel revenues to the major wealth management groups, which are dominated by the big four.\nComplicated pathways The report suggests that revenue super industry fee revenues flow through complicated pathways that are not always transparent.\n\"It is these interrelationships that have made policy reform within superannuation so complex because many seemingly minor changes to fee disclosure or transparency requirements have had significant ramifications for business models within the superannuation industry,\" Rainmaker said in the report.\nOnly 9 per cent of fees are paid to non-for-profit trustees for administration and operations.\nMr Whiteley urged senators to crack open the structures of banks' vertically integrated businesses and reassure the public that the interests of fund members are placed before profit.\n\"Compulsory superannuation is a foundation of our retirement income system, it should never be a honey pot for the big four banks.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:10:01.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
