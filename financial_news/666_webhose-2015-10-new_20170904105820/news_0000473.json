The sector has exploded in popularity since the 2008 crash due to a drying up of credit and the stagnation of interest rates. \nBI reported on Tuesday that many in the sector are expecting a big clear out of smaller platforms who can't face the cost or weight of regulation . \nIt looks like the clear out is already happening — financial regulation consultancy Bovill says 26% 0f platforms that have applied for authorisation have already abandoned the process, industry website AltFi reports . \nThe FCA have received 114 application and 30 have been withdrawn, with 26 of those \"partial withdrawals\", meaning a company is just giving up peer-to-peer activity but will continue whatever else financial services it offers. \nAltiFi quotes Gillian Roche-Saunders, head of venture finance at Bovill, as saying: \"The high number of withdrawals suggests that the FCA is setting the bar high when it comes to full authorisation for P2P lenders – the process appears to be much tougher and more costly than many firms first anticipated.\" \nNick Harding, CEO of Lending Works, told BI his company has spent over £100,000 preparing its application for the FCA, ahead of the deadline at the end of the month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:33:02.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
