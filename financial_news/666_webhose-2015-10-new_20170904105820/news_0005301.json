The minister was speaking at the end of the International Conference on Investment Promotion for the northern province of Malanje held on 21-23 this month. Rosa Pacavira said that the guidelines of the private investment policy reflect the choice of Angola in pursuing a market economy, as best way to promote economic growth and distribution of wealth. The official recalled that the new law regulating the private investment sets criteria for its distribution, and points out the agriculture, livestock and manufacturing sectors as deserving incentives. According to her, under new legal framework, the law defends that incentives should focus on investments that boost economic growth, promoting the most disadvantaged regions and increase the productive capacity mainly for export of local raw materials. The minister said that in 2014 Angola ranked second with Africa's major destination of foreign investment which stood at 16 billion dollars.
