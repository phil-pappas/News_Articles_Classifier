Other hospital operators also retreated, but pared losses as the overall market rallied. Universal Health Services (NYSE: UHS ) fell 0.8%. Community Health Systems (NYSE: CYH ) lost 2.4%, Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC ) 0.1% and LifePoint Health (NASDAQ: LPNT ) 3.8%.\nHCA's uninsured volume at same facilities grew to 8% of total admissions from 7.3% a year ago, continuing a trend that began in the second quarter. In Q2, uninsured admissions increased to 7.1% of the total from 6.8% in Q2 of 2014, leading analysts to opine that the benefits of ObamaCare were leveling off since enrollment in the Affordable Care Act system began in early 2014.\n  View Enlarged Image \nHCA also signaled troubling signs for its bottom line. Expected Q3 earnings of $1.17 per share were below analysts' views for $1.22 per share. Operating margins were down on higher labor costs and a \"less favorable payer mix,\" the company said, noting that productivity fell, and the use of contract labor rose.\nThe \"most concerning trend,\" said Wells Fargo analyst Gary Lieberman, \"is the continued negative mix shift in its same-facility uninsured admissions.\" In a client note, he said the increase in uninsured admissions \"has been the primary focus of investor concern\" since second-quarter results were released in early August.\nLieberman also chided HCA for its \"significantly higher\" labor expenses in Q3, which amounted to 46.9% of revenue vs. 45.7% in last year's same quarter.\n\" Management should have more control over labor expense, and therefore this statistic is also concerning,\" Lieberman noted.\nMizuho Securities cut HCA's price target to 86 from 103.\nIn other preliminary results, expected Q3 revenue of $9.856 billion, up from $9.220 billion last year, was slightly above views. And overall volume increased 2.9% from a year earlier, while same-facility equivalent admissions increased 3.6% when compared to Q3 of 2014. Same-facility emergency-room visits increased 5.8%.\nHCA's adjusted earnings forecast for the full year was narrowed to $5.20 to $5.25 per share from $4.90 to $5.30 previously. Its new top-end range is four cents below analysts' views.\nHCA said it will report complete Q3 results on or around Oct. 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:55:58.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
