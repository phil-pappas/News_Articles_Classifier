I pay our babysitter $15 an hour and, on a recent Friday night out with friends, my husband and I were asked if we would mind sharing our babysitter. We said yes, as long as it was at our house. We have two children and they have one. They paid $5 an hour, and our babysitter agreed to mind all three children for her usual price. We were all going out together. One of our friends has an injury, so we all had to take cabs, and they paid for the cabs, as we would have gotten the subway otherwise. Do you agree with how we split the cost?\nJackie in New York\nDear Jackie,\nIt’s important to make time to go out with your husband (and friends). With the cost of babysitters, many parents alternate which nights they go out: Dad goes out on Friday night and Mom meets her friends on Saturday night. I can see why: $15 is a cocktail or a delicious appetizer, and every hour that goes by, the night becomes more expensive. No wonder that only one-third of respondents told an UrbanSitter.com poll of 6,000 parents that they only go out one or two times a month (followed by 4 to 6 times a year (32%), weekly (17%), 1 to 2 times a year (15%) and never (3%).\nWhen it comes to babysitters, you should never spring anything on them at the last minute. You did the right thing by negotiating the rate with the babysitter first, and she was very generous to agree to the same rate. In fact, UrbanSitter says most parents pay an average of around $14 an hour for a babysitter to watch one child, $17 for two children, and $19 for three. Babysitting can be hard work, especially with young (and multiple) children. This was expressed beautifully in a recent New Yorker cartoon where the parents tell the befuddled-looking teenage babysitter: “If they give you any trouble, find a good babysitter and go out for the evening.”\nRead: ‘Bridesmaids’ – the sequel. When a bachelorette party goes horribly wrong\nMy colleague Catey Hill recently wrote that parents expect a lot from babysitters. More than half of parents (53%) in one survey by Care.com, a site dedicated to parents and caregivers, want babysitters with first aid and CPR training and, of those who do seek out these additional skills, 80% of parents are willing to pay more for them. Worried parents also want babysitters with years of experience minding kids to make sure their children are receiving proper care – hence, nanny cams.\nYour friend is unlikely to get a babysitter for less than $15 an hour in most major metropolitan areas. You saved one-third of the usual fee and your friend saved two-thirds because you have two children and she has one. That said, I don’t know where your friend could get a babysitter for $5 an hour and that could set an unrealistic expectation for future social engagements. A better solution: Pay the babysitter $20 and split it 50/50. You can always tip the babysitter $10 more at the end of the night. To keep it simple, the cab rides – and how you split them – should not enter the equation.\nAlso see: Can we take our babysitter’s phone back?\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, re-gifting, or any tricky money issues relating to family and friends?
