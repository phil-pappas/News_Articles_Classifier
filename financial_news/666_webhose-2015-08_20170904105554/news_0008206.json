He was speaking on “Coming Global Economic Crisis: Will India Go Down?” at a seminar organised by Moneylife Foundation in Mumbai. Addressing a packed hall, Prof Vaidyanathan—rated one of the most popular teachers among all IIMs—brought alive a host of current economic issues by punctuating his talk with innumerable asides that had the audience in splits. He said: “With global economic power increasingly shifting to the East, India is well poised to emerge as the most favoured destination of foreign investment.” For this he said, “We need reforms, not just in share market, retrospective taxes but also at the state level… We need to do away with numerous restrictions and taxes and provide more credit to the unorganised sector. We also need to close down many useless Central ministries, like education, agriculture and information & broadcasting; and have only 8-10 ministries at the Centre.” Busting several myths about global and Indian economy, the ‘teacher who is interested in learning’ said that the growth of our economy is domestic demand-driven and powered by domestic household savings and not due to FIIs’ (foreign institutional investors) or foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. “Non-corporate sectors, which are community-oriented and family-driven, are the engines of growth in India. But a blind adoption of foreign methodology and definitions has led to the government ignoring the real engine of growth—the unincorporated sector. This sector survives, despite lack of access to formal funding, extortion and harassment from multiple government agencies as well as the police and without access to any form of social security. Yet, they, and individuals, toil and put away money in various assets, giving India’s economy the security of a high savings rate,” Prof Vaidyanathan added. Talking about the Greek crisis, Prof Vaidyanathan said, “The European countries are calling their economic problems as a global crisis, for past several decades. At the most, we can call Greek crisis an Anglo-Saxon crisis. No way is it a global crisis.” The debt-driven model of growth in the West leaves those countries vulnerable to such crises from time to time. The West will take more than 80 quarters to recover,” said he. “In this scenario, it is better for India to be more de-coupled.” According to Prof Vaidyanathan, India must evolve its own strategy which protects its interests. He added that we also need to focus on tax havens in search of the lost and last dollar. It is estimated that nearly $18 trillion is in tax havens and the G-20 countries are trying to regulate or get back this money. Indian money in tax havens is estimated to be between $500 billion and $1.5 trillion. Prof Vaidyanathan’s talk on the economy covered a wide spectrum of issues—the nature of the domestic economy, the role of foreign funds, structure of domestic savings, role of gold, the need to fund non-corporate sector, market and access and political linkages.
