But they must be careful, ­especially if they move in to run the business alongside a long-term management.\n“Most times, they’ll stuff it up,” David Smorgon, one of Australia’s foremost experts on family business and executive chairman of PwC’s Family, Business & Wealth practice, says.\n“It’s a question of clarifying what hat you wear. Family, owner or business? And in family business, people regularly forget which of those they are.”\nThe point here is that members of the family who might inherit the business are not the current owners of the business. So if a family member tries to impose control over a management team that has helped build the business, there is plenty of room for conflict.\nAs Smorgon says: “Succession is a process and not just an event. You have to start with these things 10-20 years ahead of time. They have to train the family well in advance.”\nEspecially in highly technical businesses, or those with key clients, family has to be careful that it does not ­antagonise the professional management that has much of the company’s intellectual or market intelligence.\n“Often there’s a deal,” Smorgon says. “The family might have to sell some equity to keep some control or do a deal so the managers can buy them out. Today there is so much money floating around, a management team can often get funding from outside. It becomes a meltdown and nobody wins.”\nIn these cases, the older generation has an obligation to ensure there’s a plan to maximise the business value.\nA MEASURE OF SUCCESS\nPeter Simonis and Dieter Bolenski founders of PCS Precision / Picture: Melvyn Knipe Source: News Limited\nBALANCING the books means a wholly different thing for 32-year-old PCS Precision.\nOne of Australia’s leading calibration companies, it was created — like so many others — when its principals’ employer was being taken over. Rather than stay, they set up shop for themselves.\nPeter Simonis and Dieter Bolenski set up their business on the back of a truck, and it grew from there. The client base of the Wetherill Park business is remarkably diverse: from Arnotts Biscuits to Unilever; pharmaceuticals companies and supermarkets; the Australia Nuclear Science & Technology Organisation to public weighbridges.\nThe founders realised they needed management in to help them develop the business and allow it to grow. They also needed people who would treat the business as their own. As it turned out, those people were there.\nKaren Biddle wandered into PCS about 10 years after it started, looking for a job. She stayed and became general manager when Peter wanted more time to concentrate on other roles.\nShe sought to put the company on a more commercial footing, along with a calibration manager who has spent 25 years at PCS and a sales manager who has been there 12 years.\n“We treat it like our own business. We have to have the passion and energy to make it work,” Karen says.\nNow, with 30 people employed, the issue of the future will be what happens when the owners think about passing on control to the next generation.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb&h=Staying+afloat+in+a+business+storm", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb&title=Staying+afloat+in+a+business+storm", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb&title=Staying+afloat+in+a+business+storm", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Staying+afloat+in+a+business+storm&c=JUST+like+management+change%2C+new+people+moving+into+a+business+creates+uncertainty+in+staff%2C+suppliers+and+%26%23173%3Bcustomers+unless+managed+well%2C+and+in+advance.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/small-business/training-the-next-generation-is-key-to-maintaining-smooth-sailing-under-a-change-of-captain/story-fn9evb64-1227506634406?sv=8f631f4b865e5a0969da04851b0c17fb"], "published": "2015-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T23:07:06.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
