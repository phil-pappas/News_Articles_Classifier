That means reducing worker hours at stores that have been “scheduling significantly above what has been allocated,” said Lundberg. \nThe push to save on staffing comes as Wal-Mart WMT, -0.38% is pouring money into making stores more efficient, pleasant places to shop. In April, Wal-Mart increased the companywide minimum wage to $9 and plans to boost pay to $10 for many employees by February. \nThe company has also increased store staffing at peak hours so shoppers move quickly through checkout lines and see stocked shelves, said executives during the company’s quarterly earnings call earlier in August. Those efforts contributed to a 15% drop in second-quarter net income compared with a year earlier, said executives. \nThe store managers being told to cut back have been exceeding those already expanded employee hours, said Lundberg. “It’s about watching expenses,” said Lundberg, as well as making sure stores don’t waste funds that could be put into lowering prices for shoppers, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:56:09.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
