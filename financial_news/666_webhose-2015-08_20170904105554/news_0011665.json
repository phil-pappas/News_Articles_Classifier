The way I see it is that this is a bit of a technical correction after things got a bit oversold.\" \nThe currency market was also calmer. The dollar rose against the yen as it pulled out of a four-day long slide that had left it at a seven-month low. \nTraders said a rise in U.S. stock index futures and a brief rebound in Japanese stocks had helped spur dollar-buying against the yen earlier in the day, with the dollar rising to 120.11 yen at one point. \nGerman Bund and other euro zone government bond yields also rose along with those on U.S. Treasuries as the previous day's rush for safety eased, although it was far from plain sailing. \nMainland Chinese shares had another calamitous day, with the Shanghai Composite Index (.SSEC) falling another 8 percent and breaking below the psychological level of 3,000. The index fell 15 percent the previous three days, including an 8.5 percent collapse on Monday. \n\"Global investors are cannibalizing each other. Calling it a market disaster is not an overstatement,\" said Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities. \n\"The mood of panic is dominating the market ... And I don't see any signs of meaningful government intervention.\" \nOil prices also stabilized, however, after plunging more than 6 percent and hitting 6 1/2-year lows. \nU.S. crude futures (CLc1) traded at $38.73 per barrel, up 1.2 percent on the day, while Brent crude futures last stood at $43.03 after having fallen to $42.23 on Monday. Copper nudged up a fraction too to $4,956 a tonne. \n(Reporting by Marc Jones)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T11:08:56.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
