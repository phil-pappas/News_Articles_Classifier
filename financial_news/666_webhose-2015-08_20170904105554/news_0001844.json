All parties will do well out of this, relative to cost.\" \nDr Nahan said he was confident the bill would pass through the Legislative Council when the parliament resumes after the winter recess, despite Liberal MP Nick Goiran calling for it to be reviewed by an upper house committee. \nDr Nahan said Mr Goiran had not been briefed on the matter so probably was not familiar with the particulars, but he would be brought up to date soon. \nHe also said he was not concerned by a planned High Court challenge by a Bell Group creditor, with litigation funder Hugh McLernon enlisting top silk and former WA governor Malcolm McCusker to argue the bill is unconstitutional. \n\"I'm not worried about that. We've put a lot of effort into making sure this (bill) is appropriate,\" Dr Nahan said. \n\"We will get it through. I'm confident. \n\"Of course, we would never even contemplate inhibiting anybody from pursuing a challenge in the court.\" \nDr Nahan said the matter had been bogged down in excessive litigation for decades \"and I'm sure it will face that continuing pressure\". \n\"That's why we're doing it.\" \nBell Group collapsed in 1991 and the ensuing litigation was the nation's most expensive and longest-running. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook RBA happier with dollar and the economy AAP \nThe Reserve Bank appears happier about the economy and the falling Australian dollar, making the chance of another …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:21:34.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
