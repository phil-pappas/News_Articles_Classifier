Written by: Ellen Chang 08/19/15 - 11:34 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Budding entrepreneurs are forced to rely on their personal credit scores when their companies are in their infancies, but developing a business credit score builds a company’s financial history. \nWhen businesses are in the early stages , owners are forced to rely on their personal credit scores, because they have not established a business credit history to obtain financing. \n“Personal credit will help small business owners build better business credit scores by opening doors for them,” said Levi King, CEO of Creditera, a San Mateo, Calif.-based company that gives business owners free access to their personal and business credit reports.

Lenders examine a credit score as a way to gauge your business and its operation -- and that also affects your ability to obtain different types of funding along with interest rates that are lower. \nBusiness credit scores are calculated by using different formulas. Credit bureaus such as Equifax and Experian consider payment history to be the largest factor, and it accounts for nearly 50%, he said. The amount of debt used along with public records such as liens, judgments and bankruptcies are also used to determine the score. Dun & Bradstreet’s Paydex score is only based on payment history, so paying on time every month nets you a higher score. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:17:04.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
