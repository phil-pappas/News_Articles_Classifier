Most mining projects upgrade the bitumen into refinery-ready synthetic crude, while thermal projects tend to blend the bitumen into lower-priced heavy crude such as WCS.\nThe TD research took the average costs of some of the most efficient thermal operations, such as Cenovus Energy and MEG Energy's Foster Creek and Christina Lake projects, and concluded they need U.S. crude above $43 to make money. U.S. crude futures settled on Thursday at $41.14 per barrel.\nAt $41, companies struggle to cover the cost of operating, royalties, transportation and blending.\nMining projects on average require more than $36 a barrel to break even. The analysis did not include Royal Dutch Shell's mining and upgrading operations, but a Shell company spokesman said its synthetic crude production costs were $42.46 a barrel in 2014.\nOn Wednesday Canadian Oil Sands Ltd the largest-interest owner in the Syncrude mining and upgrading project, gave a presentation showing it is losing around $6 on every barrel produced.\nEven so, COS said it would not consider shutting in production, and other oil sands producers are likely to follow suit given the high cost of halting operations and the risk of damaging bitumen reservoirs.\n\"We very much struggle to come up with prices low enough that you would shut in and turn off these projects,\" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter.
