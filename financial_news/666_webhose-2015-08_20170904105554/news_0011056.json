Between 2008 and late 2013, Hays reported a better performance in its British temporary staffing business than in permanent jobs, as companies shied away from major spending commitments. \nThe Confederation of British Industry yesterday said rising confidence and improving retail sales had encouraged expectations for shop staff employment growth to climb to a 15-year high. \nHays said that the UK and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) had delivered strong net fee growth of 11pc to £271.9m. Operating profits also grew by 75pc to £45.7m. \nIn the UK, the IT (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) jobs sector outpaced other areas, growing 22pc, while construction and property jobs were up 14pc and accountancy and finance were up by 13pc. \nThe group is on track to meet its goal of doubling operating profits by 2018, despite a £9.6m foreign exchange headwind last year. \nPre (Shanghai: 600048.SS - news ) -tax profits rose 18pc to £156.1m in the year to the end of June, driven by a 9pc increase in like-for-like sales. Group turnover totalled £3.8bn. \nHays’ results came weeks after rival professional staffing firm Robert Walters (LSE: RWA.L - news ) reported a 74pc increase in half-year profits, driven by a 20pc jump in UK fees. Michael Page beat forecasts earlier this month, too, with a 14pc rise in profits, striking an upbeat note after a series of profit warnings in the past three years. \n“We enter our new year in a position of strength, with unrivalled breadth, scale and balance around the world and the best people and technology tools in our industry”, Hays chief executive Alistair Cox said. \n“We see many clear opportunities to grow further and are focused on capturing these while simultaneously driving profits and cash generation along the way. That combination of delivering short-term results and investing to capitalise on long-term opportunity is unique in our industry today.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T13:18:35.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
