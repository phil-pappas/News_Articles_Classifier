Related Topics Nigeria: Shehu Sani Explains Tweet Showing \"Love\" to Bill Cosby \nShehu was reacting to the statement issued by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Olisa Metuh, that \"the economy is going down\" under the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. \n\"It is ridiculous for any sane government to artificially rebase the economy and claim to transform Nigeria into the largest economy in Africa as the PDP administration did.\" \nHe also said that the defeated former ruling party was artificially manipulating statistics to create the illusion of impressive economic performance record. \nHe said if PDP's claim of economic successes in terms of GDP, employment generation, poverty alleviation and others were genuine, Nigerians would not have voted the party out of power. \nHe said if the former ruling party was doing well, the opposition parties would have found it difficult to defeat it. \nThe president's aide said the PDP assumed performance was nothing more than window dressing, and a detachment from reality. \n\"Nigerians no longer face exploitation at filling stations because the government is taking punitive measures against marketers that punish poor Nigerians.\" \nHe said queues had disappeared at the filling stations and the Naira was enjoying favourable exchange rate. \nAccording to him, the present administration has successfully blocked leakages and other avenues for corruption. \nHe said the administration had also frustrated efforts by corrupt elements to divert public funds to private pockets. \n\"Once the formal trial for corruption begins, the PDP might no longer have the moral legs to stand on. \nNAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T12:35:46.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
