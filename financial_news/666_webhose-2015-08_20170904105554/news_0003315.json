[1] The streamlined procedures require the filing of original or amended tax returns reporting not only for whatever non-US source income was generated in each of the applicable tax years but must also properly report any U.S. source income and deductions for each of the applicable tax years.\nOnce a taxpayer makes a submission under the Streamlined Procedures, the taxpayer may not participate in the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program (OVDP). The original OVDP was created in 2009 around the theory that those who failed to report an interest in a foreign financial account did so with the intent to evade a U.S. tax obligation. This theory ignores the realities of life for most residing outside the United States as well as for many recent immigrants.\nThose directly involved in creating and managing the non-U.S. financial account and assets are the only ones capable of determining non-willful status. If such status is not supported by sufficient objective facts, consider other methods of coming into compliance, including the OVDP.\nFor eligible U.S. taxpayers residing outside the United States, all penalties will be waived under the streamlined procedures. Non-resident taxpayers might be better positioned than resident taxpayers to achieve their goal of a non-willful, no penalty resolution under the Streamlined Procedures. The “foreign” account of the non-resident is actually in their own neighborhood; it is only “foreign” in the sense that it is located outside the territorial boundaries of the United States. The existence of the account does not, by itself, somehow represent an acknowledgment of tax non-compliance by the non-resident taxpayer. The Streamlined Procedures seem to represent the first attempt by the government to acknowledge that at some point, non-resident taxpayers become residents of their home state, emotionally even if perhaps not technically.\nFor eligible U.S. taxpayers residing in the United States, the only penalty under the Streamlined Procedures will be a miscellaneous offshore penalty equal to 5 percent of the foreign financial assets that gave rise to the tax compliance issue (all income tax related penalties associated with the non-U.S. source income will be waived). The Streamlined Procedures do not limit the civil penalties otherwise associated with the reporting of U.S. source income.\nAm I “Non-Willful”? Taxpayers pursuing resolution of a foreign account issue within the Streamlined Procedures are required to certify, under penalties of perjury, that their conduct was “non-willful.” For purposes of the streamlined procedures, non-willful conduct is defined as conduct that is “due to negligence, inadvertence, or mistake or conduct that is the result of a good faith misunderstanding of the requirements of the law.” [2] The relatively more culpable standard of “willfulness” or “willful blindness” is not referenced in the streamlined procedures.\nThe government purposefully defined a more user-friendly “non-willful” conduct under the Streamlined Procedures rather than certification of conduct that was “not willful” (eliminating discussions of willful blindness whereby someone might seek to be intentionally ignorant of their filing and reporting obligations), a distinction that should not be overlooked in the Streamlined process. However, taxpayers and their representatives must be cautious when certifying non-willful status to the government. The vast majority of taxpayers having previously undisclosed interests in a foreign financial account or asset likely believe they are more “non-willful” than not. The issue at hand in the Streamlined Procedures is whether the IRS will agree. Feel lucky?\nThe written Streamlined certification requires that the taxpayer “provide specific reasons for your failure to report all income, pay all tax, and submit all required information returns, including FBARs. If you relied on a professional advisor, provide the name, address, and telephone number of the advisor and a summary of the advice. If married taxpayers submitting a joint certification have different reasons, provide the individual reasons for each spouse separately in the statement of facts.”\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T01:09:06.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
