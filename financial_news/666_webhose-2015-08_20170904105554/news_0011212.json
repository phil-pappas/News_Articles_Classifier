That was up from 44,802 in June and up 11 percent from a year ago. \nThe number of mortgages approved for remortgaging jumped 29 percent and was its highest in four years. \n\"Savvy homeowners are snapping up competitive deals before an expected increase in interest rates,\" said Richard Woolhouse, chief economist at the BBA. \nThe Bank of England has said it getting closer to an interest rate hike after more than six years of record-low interest rates. \nBut economists remain unsure about the timing of such a move, especially as a rising pound and falling oil prices, exacerbated by turmoil in China, are keeping British price pressures in check. \nThe BBA data is generally a good precursor to the more comprehensive BoE lending figures but does not include lending by mutually owned building societies, which account for almost a third of mortgages. \nBoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said this month that the central bank was comfortable about price gains in Britain's housing market which have picked up a bit more speed this year.
