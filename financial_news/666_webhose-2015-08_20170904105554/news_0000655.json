But a stronger-than-forecast private report on the US services sector in July pushed the US dollar to a two-month high and gold close to a late July low of $US1,077, the weakest since February 2010. The greenback later returned lower, easing by 0.1 per cent, but bullion prices remained down. The next main data event is US non-farm payrolls on Friday. \"The non-manufacturing ISM has outweighed the ADP number ... today has not changed the view that the Fed is on track to raise rates in September,\" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. The prospect of the first US rate rise in nearly a decade was backed up by Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart on Tuesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. This would increase the opportunity cost of holding the metal, an asset that does not earn interest. Bullion lost nearly seven per cent in July. On Wednesday, however, Fed Governor Jerome Powell said policymakers had not yet decided whether to raise interest rates in September. \"Statements about the likely date of the rate hike is having only a modest impact on gold prices probably because this must go down in history as the most telegraphed notice of a rate change to fully prepare the market in advance,\" said Ross Norman, chief executive of bullion brokerage Sharps Pixley. Platinum and palladium wallowed near multi-year lows on a global supply glut and prospects of sluggish demand from the automotive sector. Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped further on Tuesday to 21.56 million ounces, the lowest since September 2008. Spot platinum fell 0.6 per cent to $US946 an ounce, close to $US940.50 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2009. Palladium was up 0.1 per cent at $US593, after hitting a near three-year low of $US586.33 in the previous session. Silver was steady at $US14.58 an ounce.
