everything is now paid through IPPIS.\" \nMr. Osaisai who reacted to allegations that CERT and CERD were comatose and underfunded, said massive infrastructure developments were going on in all the centres. \nSome staff of CERT and CERD had on Aug. 27, while briefing newsmen alleged that the two university centres were suffering from neglect by NAEC. \nProf. Mark Oladipo, Research Professor, CERT, who briefed newsmen alongside, Prof. Adeniyi Fasasi, Research Professor, CERD, said the aim of establishing the centres was being defeated by the management of NAEC. \nMr. Oladipo said that CERT and CERT came into existence in the universities in 1976 when the Federal Government challenged universities to bring the benefits of atomic energy to the country. \nHowever, he said that the establishment of NAEC under the leadership of Osaisai in 2006 had brought the atomic energy programme to a state of comatose. \n\"The mandate of CERT and CERD are to \" provide the facilities for the training of Nigerians at all levels in all aspects of energy matters and nuclear technology. \n\"Develop nuclear techniques necessary for the advancement of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes.\" \nMr. Oladipo said that in 2007 when the centres were moved under NAEC for coordinatory roles, progress and development took a downward trend. \nHe said Mr. Osaisai confused coordinatory roles to mean total control of academic, administrative and financial matters of the two centres. \nAccording to him, the overhead allocation to two centres which unusually captured the requirements of the centres has drastically declined since they started receiving funds through NAEC. \n\"For instance, the overhead allocation in 2014 amounted to N900, 000 per month as compared to average N6, 000,000 per month to each of the centres in 2006. \n\"Incidentally, the headquarters retains an average of 76 per cent of the commission's overhead, leaving the centres with only 24 per cent. \n\"This development has grossly affected the discharge of the mandate of the centres,\" Mr. Oladipo said. \nHowever, Mr. Osaisai said that funds that previously went to only CERT and CERD were being shared with other four centres. \n(NAN)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:15:41.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
