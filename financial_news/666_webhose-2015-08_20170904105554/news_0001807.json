That was 5.6% below the initial public offering price of $18 , which was above the expected pricing range of $14 to $16. The stock closed Wednesday at $16.14, or 10% below the IPO price, and near the bottom of the intraday trading range of $16.01 to $17.20.\nChief Executive Tom Ennis said the company is still in the early stages, but it has been showing strong growth within the burgeoning better-for-you (BFY) snack industry.

In fact, all of the proceeds are going to selling stockholders — the company doesn’t get any of that money.\n“We have a great balance sheet….We’re not over levered,” Ennis said. “We think we can do what we need to do with what we have today.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:10:25.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
