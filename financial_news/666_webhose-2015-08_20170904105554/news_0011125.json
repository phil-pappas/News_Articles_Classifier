Those, however, are debates and tasks for others.\" \nFurman said one plaintiff, Great Pacific Securities, may amend its lawsuit against Barclays if it wishes. \n\"We're disappointed that the judge thought the exchanges deserved immunity as to complex order types,\" said Patrick Coughlin, a lawyer representing several pension fund plaintiffs. \"The way they were implemented disadvantaged our clients. We will review the opinion and determine whether to appeal.\" \nBarclays had no immediate comment. BATS and Intercontinental Exchange declined to comment. The other defendants and a Great Pacific lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe case is In re: Barclays Liquidity Cross and High Frequency Trading Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-md-02589.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:13:41.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
