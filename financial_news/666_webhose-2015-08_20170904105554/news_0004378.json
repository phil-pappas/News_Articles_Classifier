The massive growth in number of DIP sub-tenants this year is a sign of the growing reputation of DIP,\" said Omar Al Mesmar, general manager of DIP. \nDIP today boasts over 12,000 residential units, 90,000 residents, 20 million square feet of office space, 25 showrooms, six schools, three hotels, while eight new hotels and serviced apartments are planned to be built in the next few years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:45:37.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
