A spokesman at the ministry in Rome confirmed the comments reported by Italian news agencies.\nGentiloni and Industry Minister Federica Guidi are visiting Iran after a nuclear deal was struck last month. Eni Chief Executive Officer Claudio Descalzi is accompanying the ministers. Eni had no immediate comment.\nEni said earlier this month it would consider investing in Iran after sanctions are lifted and if Tehran offers more favourable contract terms in line with international standards.
