The turmoil came as China devalued its currency for a second straight day to allow the market to play a greater role in setting the currency’s value, sending shockwaves through currency markets.\nIndia’s benchmark indices declined more than 1% and the rupee weakened to its weakest level in almost two years as China’s devaluation of the renminbi sparked concerns about its slowing economic growth and sluggish exports.\nNo positive developments on key reform Bills added to the rout.\nGlobal investors pulled money out of domestic markets for the second day in a row. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold $290.89 million from the equity cash market. On Tuesday, overseas funds had sold shares worth $98.34 million.\nThe Sensex ended at 27,512.26, down 353.86 points, or 1.27%, from the previous close. The Nifty settled at 8,349.45, down 112.90, or 1.33%. Broader markets also witnessed sharp cuts and eight of 11 sectoral indices ended in the red.\nIn Asian markets, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell to two-week lows, while the Chinese benchmark indices, Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite, declined in the 1-2% range. Major indices in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia fell 1-4% each.\nBenchmark stock indices in the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy all declined 2-3% each. US investors were bracing for another bruising session with futures pointing lower. Dow Jones Industrials Average was down 1%.\n“China’s concern over the currency should have an impact on global monetary policy,” said Nomura in an investor note. “Much remains to be seen, assessed, and understood before the full investment implications of Tuesday’s Chinese currency adjustment can be solidly inferred,” the note added.\nOn Wednesday, the People’s Bank of China shocked markets by devaluing its currency for a second straight day. The Chinese central bank adjusted the yuan lower by 1.9% on Tuesday and further 1.6% on Wednesday.\nBack home, market breadth was weak with 23 out of 30 Sensex companies ending in the red. Overall, 2,176 stocks declined against 665 that gained. Real estate, metal and energy stocks were among top losers. The gauge of metal and mining companies, BSE Metal index, fell 4.37% to its lowest level in 52 weeks as the devaluation of the Chinese currency would lead to a possible increase in imports of metals from China, thereby having an adverse impact on Indian metal producers. Shares of banks, automobile, capital goods, and power companies all lost 2-3% each.\n“The devaluation of the yuan has cut short the rally in the US markets. It has also triggered the ‘death cross’ of short-term moving average cutting the long-term average from above, which has a bearish connotations in technical terms,” said HDFC Securities in a note, adding that Nifty’s fall below 8315 would turn the trend bearish in the medium term.\n 13, 2015 12:23 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:24:30.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
