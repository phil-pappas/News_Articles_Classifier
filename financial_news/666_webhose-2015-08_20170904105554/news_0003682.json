Investors, however, appeared less concerned by outflows than delighted by the prospect of new portfolios, including an energy fund and returns in its established funds.\n\"While we have experienced net outflows year-to-date, we do not believe that current flow trends are reflective of the future growth potential of our business,\" Chief Executive Officer Dan Och said on a conference call.\nOch said investors had shown interest in the company's real estate credit and energy portfolios.\nSecond-quarter distributable earnings, which exclude costs from its 2007 initial public offering, rose 5 percent to $95.2 million from $90.4 million a year earlier.\nOch-Ziff earned 18 cents per share, above the analysts' average estimate of 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nAt midday, the company's stock was up 3.3 percent at $12.02, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index was flat.\nOch-Ziff, which invests $46.5 billion around the world and is a favorite with state pension funds like New Jersey's and Massachusetts', delivered performance numbers that topped rivals' returns.\nThe flagship OZ Master Fund has gained 4.8 percent since January. The average hedge fund gained 1.24 percent this year, HFR data shows.\nThe $1.2 billion OZ Asia Master Fund lost 3 percent last month, hurt by China's plummeting stock market, but executives said the company managed risk well and expected to see more gains there. The fund is still up 8.60 percent for the year.\nManagement fees rose 5 percent to $167 million, but expenses climbed 11 percent to $171.2 million.\nStockholders will receive a 14-cent-per-share dividend, less than 22 cents for the first quarter.
