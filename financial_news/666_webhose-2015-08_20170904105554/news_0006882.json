These new tenants include banks, medical centres and leisure, such as nail bars, which offset the declines in the supermarkets.\n\"While Australian supermarket sales growth has slowed, these growth rates are still higher than our listed market peers and above Woolworths comparable store sales growth averages,\" Mr Mellowes said.\n\"The higher growth rates in our centres are due to the relative youth of our portfolio, larger than average supermarket store sizes, and many of the properties being located in growth corridors.\"\nFor the year, the group reported a statutory net profit after tax of $150.5 million, up by 34.9 per cent on the same period last year. The funds from operations, which is a more accurate measure for real estate investment trusts was $80.1 million, up by 14.8 per cent on the same period last year, which was in line with market expectations.\nThe final distribution was 5.8¢, taking the annual payment to 11.4¢ up 3.6 per cent on the same period last year, which will paid on August 28.\nMr Mellowes issued a distributable earnings guidance of 13.3¢ and 2016 financial year cash distributions guidance of 12¢ per security.\n\"We have always said we have locked in the neighbourhood shopping centres, which is traditionally the supermarket anchor with 10 to 15 shops and that really is what our strategy is all about,\" Mr Mellowes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:39:27.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
