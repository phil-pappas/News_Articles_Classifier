A group of lenders claiming to own a majority of the miner’s $1.9 billion term loan sent a letter to Bank of America on Tuesday, asking the agent not to sign off on the debt exchange, Arch Coal said Wednesday in a regulatory filing. The lenders are concerned the swap will dilute their claims on the company’s assets, people with knowledge of the matter said last week.\nWith the bank’s resignation, the lenders will need to select a new administrative agent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter hasn’t been announced.\nThe exchanges are intended to ease the company’s $5.1 billion debt burden after a plunge in coal prices.\nBill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment. Logan Bonacorsi, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Arch Coal, didn’t immediately respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T01:11:22.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
