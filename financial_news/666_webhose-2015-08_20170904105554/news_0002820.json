A lot of these are making their way into pubs and bars. \"Premium imports and craft beers are still doing very well despite overall beer consumption declining over the past decade or so.\" Craft beer is still a very small segment of overall beer manufacturing but Mr Lin says it is projected to grow over the next five years to make up more than five per cent, from the current 3.5 per cent. \"The popularity of this particular alcoholic beverage means there is quite a lot of room still for it to grow.\" While the overall beer manufacturing industry's annual revenue growth has been flat over the last five years, craft beer has enjoyed 10.1 per cent annual growth. Competition has intensified with major brewers Lion and SABMiller (trading as Carlton and United Breweries) now producing the majority of Australia's best-known craft beers. \"These international giants are actually acquiring a lot of our craft beers,\" Mr Lin says. \"These guys are able to churn out a lot more of the product and really compete aggressively with each other.\" IBISWorld says the fragmented nature of the industry has allowed a number of smaller breweries to grow and flourish as consumer tastes changed. It says there is an opportunity for niche makers of craft beer, particularly those producing pale ales and wheat craft beers, to grow strongly over coming years. There are about 150 craft breweries in Australia and IBISWorld tips that number will grow over the next five years. However IBISWorld says the increasing dominance of the two largest beer breweries is a growing concern for smaller, less competitive craft breweries, especially those that compete against Lion and SABMiller to secure tap beer deals in pubs and bars. Mr Lin predicts the big players will eye further acquisitions. \"Over the coming years as these big players continue to strive to grow and capture more of the market share they will possibly look towards the popular craft beers as prime acquisition targets, much like Lion's prior acquisition of Little Creatures which was one of the fastest-growing craft beers within the industry at that time.\" Among those players which IBISWorld believes will be potentially eyeing acquisitions is soft drink maker Coca-Cola Amatil, which re-entered the beer market in December 2013 through a joint venture - Australian Beer Company - with winemaker Casella. Coca-Cola, along with other major companies in the industry, will look to purchase successful boutique brewers, an IBISWorld report says. Australian Beer Company's Yenda craft beer range launched across Australia in March this year, with it noting that while craft is the fastest-growing beer segment, it is under-developed in comparison to the UK and US where it accounts for more than 10 per cent of beer sold. Mr Lin says the future for the craft beer industry is bright. \"Consumer demand for innovative beers is expected to continue increasing, particularly as beer drinkers move away from traditional beers and towards premium foreign and domestic varieties.\" ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7&title=Craft+beers+growing+in+popularity", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Craft+beers+growing+in+popularity&c=AUSTRALIA%27S+craft+beer+industry+is+flourishing+thanks+to+a+change+in+consumer+tastes+from+traditional+full-strength+beers+towards+more+premium+beers.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7&h=Craft+beers+growing+in+popularity", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/craft-beers-growing-in-popularity/story-e6frfkur-1227478264869?sv=2450e64d91eb4f067108acd668664ae7&title=Craft+beers+growing+in+popularity"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T07:54:41.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
