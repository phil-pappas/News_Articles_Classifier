Officials said low oil prices were the reason. Since then, the price of U.S. crude has dropped $1.44 a barrel. \nThe National Ocean Industries Association, an offshore trade group, said in a news release Tuesday that members looked forward to the lease sale \"but do not anticipate jaw-dropping results under current conditions.\" \nThe group cited low prices, uncertainty over new regulations — including stronger rules proposed for equipment designed to prevent oil well blowouts — and an upward trend in lawsuits over permits and leases. \nU.S. crude fell 22 cents Tuesday to $41.65 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price was $43.09 on March 18, when companies made 195 bids on 169 tracts off Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, with $538 million in high bids. \nSome of those bids may be withdrawn or rejected. \nIn last year's sale in the central Gulf, companies offered $850.8 million in high bids. Five were rejected or withdrawn, dropping the total to $845.9 million — from $1.2 billion in 2013 and $1.7 billion in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:32:42.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
