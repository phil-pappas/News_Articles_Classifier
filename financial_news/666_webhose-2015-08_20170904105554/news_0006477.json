We want this matter sent to the police and we will be doing everything to ensure that justice is done. I saw someone making a comment that we were white hot with anger – that's just the start of it.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/lucillekeen"], "published": "2015-08-20T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:50:37.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
