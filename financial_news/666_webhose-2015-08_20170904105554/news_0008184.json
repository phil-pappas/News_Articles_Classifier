The earlier three stake sales had raised just over Rs 3,000 crore.\nThe government is targeting to raise Rs 69,500 crore from disinvestment in the current fiscal.\nPresently, the government holds 68.57 per cent shares in IOC – the biggest oil refining and marketing company in the country.\nIt owns 54.2 million tonnes of refining capacity or roughly one-fourth of India’s total refining capacity of 215.1 million tonnes.\nBesides, it owns and operates 24,405 petrol pumps – a little less than half of India’s 53,419 filling stations.\nShares of IOC closed 0.70 per cent down at Rs 394.45 apiece on the BSE today.\nAt the current market price, sale of 24.27 crore shares, or 10 per cent stake, would fetch the government around Rs 9,500 crore.\nThe decision to sell stake was taken after a ministerial level consultation between Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.\nDue to volatile market conditions, the government has been able to sell stakes in only three PSUs — PFC, REC and Dredging Corp — this fiscal to raise over Rs 3,000 crore.\nThe disinvestment department has its pipeline ready for over two dozen PSUs, including ONGC, NMDC and Nalco.\nBesides, it is planning to sale 10 per cent stake in Coal India. “The seller (Government of India) proposes to sell 24.27 crore equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each of the company aggregating to 10 per cent of the total paid-up equity share capital,” IOC said in the regulatory notice.\nThe OFS will open at 0915 hours on Monday and close on the same day at 1530 hours.\nAt least 20 per cent of the offer size has been reserved for retail investors, who will also get a 5 per cent discount to the cut-off price.\n“No single bidder other than mutual funds and insurance companies shall be allocated more than 25 per cent of the shares being offered,” it said.\nRetail investor has been defined as an individual investor who places bids for shares of total value of not more than Rs 2 lakh aggregate.\nFive bankers handling the share shale – the biggest so far this fiscal — are CitiGroup, Deutsche Equities, Nomura, JM Financial and Kotak Securities.\n 21, 2015 6:15 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:48:56.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
