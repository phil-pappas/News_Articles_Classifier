However, it could also prompt accusations of double standards against its chief executive, Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer who earlier this year called the living wage “irrelevant” and warned of a squeeze on household incomes since the financial crisis.\nRelated: Next raises profit expectations after warm weather helps sales\nNext enjoyed record results last year, with pretax profits of £795m in the 12 months to the end of January, helped by a 12% rise in online sales. Lord Wolfson was paid £4.7m in cash and shares for the performance.\nThe financial results show 2.7 million shoppers used unsecured credit from Next to make purchases through its online and catalogue business, the vast majority of Next Directory’s 3.6 million shoppers.\nThese customers were billed a “service charge” at an annual percentage rate (APR) of 24.99% if they did not repay the outstanding balance on their Directory account and card by a set date each month. The APR is higher than the typical 18% to 20% interest charged by bank credit cards, despite the fact that Next has a default rate of just 1%.\nThe interest income accounted for almost a third of the profit Next made on sales to its 2.7 million Directory shoppers, according to the company’s own figures.\nThe amount that Next collects in interest was found in the small print of its accounts. In the year to January it banked £166.4m, up almost 10% on the previous year’s £151.8m and £126.1m in 2011.\nIn contrast, Next wrote off just £24m of customer debt in the year out of a total of £853m on its books. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Catalogue credit can turn easily turn into catalogue debts. Paying in instalments costs more than buying outright, and can come with higher interest rates than some credit cards.\n“Last year, Citizens Advice helped with nearly 55,000 catalogue and mail order debt issues, with many people struggling to keep up repayments. Customers need clear information when signing up for catalogue debt. Directory and catalogue sellers must not push customers to take on credit they often don’t need, and must make sure customers know how much catalogue credit will cost them.”\nThe consumer watchdog Which? added: “Some ‘buy now, pay later’ deals may charge you very high interest rates even if you’re just a single day late in repaying. People should always consider if in-store credit is right for them and think about how they will repay before signing up for an online credit account.”\nNext said the company offered a “competitive rate” of interest and that the £166.4m did not take into account the cost of running the credit service, such as sending bills and third-party credit checks.\nA spokesman said: “This is a competitive rate in the general unsecured debt marketplace. Customers only pay this rate if they have decided not to pay by cash i.e. via a debit or credit card, and their balance is over, at least, one month from receiving their goods.”\nNext said it uses an “external market-leading credit scoring/credit referencing organisation” to decide whether to lend to shoppers and how much to lend them\nThe spokesman added: “Additionally, Next uses scorecards developed by the third-party credit bureau, to determine the amount of credit a customer is offered.\n“The interest rate is calculated having taken into account the cost of bad debt, account management personnel, account management systems, and the cost of capital invested.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T15:29:43.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
