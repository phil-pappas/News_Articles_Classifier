By Anna White | Telegraph – 57 minutes ago 10.40 -0.05 \nFind out what will happen to monthly outgoings if interest rates rise by 0.5 percentage points a year \nThe prospect of an interest rate rise is upon us. \nThe Bank of England took the drastic step of lowering the base rate to 0.5pc in March 2009, and it has remained there ever since. \nThat has afforded homeowners and buyers the opportunity to borrow cheap money at historically low rates of interest. This, combined with a battle among lenders to win over customers, has resulted in some astoundingly favourable mortgage deals. But such perks of UK economic policy look set to disappear. \nWhile the central bank has signalled that it is unlikely to raise interest rates this year, as the strong pound and further falls in commodity prices keep inflation “muted”, the base rate is now expected to rise in the early part of next year. \n= So, what will a rate rise do to your mortgage repayments? = \nThe property group JLL has taken the average house price for each region of the UK and analysed three scenarios based on loan-to-value ratios of 90pc, 75pc and 60pc. \nResidential analyst Nick Whitten studied current monthly mortgage payments at the best available, variable market rates and projected the increase should the base rate move up incrementally. \nThe biggest jump in monthly payments is for a Londoner with a 90pc loan-to-value mortgage. Under this scenario, the borrower's monthly outgoings would increase by nearly £500 by 2018 as the relevant mortgage rate hits 5pc. \nFor someone living in the capital with a loan-to-value of 75pc, monthly payments would jump by nearly £400, and those with a 60pc loan-to-value would be charged an extra £296. \nFor the average UK homeowner, the most significant jump will be felt by those with a 90pc loan-to-value mortgage. Their monthly payment will increase by £189 in 2018. \nOf course, this doesn't take into account more dramatic hikes, as highlighted by the economist Roger Bootle this week in the Telegraph. \n= A 90pc loan-to-value mortgage = \n2015 when the base rate is at 0.5pc v 2018 when the base rate is 2pc \n= A 75pc loan-to-value mortgage = \n2015 when the base rate is at 0.5pc v 2018 when the base rate is 2pc \n= A 60pc loan-to-value mortgage = \n2015 when the base rate is at 0.5pc v 2018 when the base rate is 2pc \nNote (Stockholm: NOTE.ST - news ) : This analysis is based on a 25-year loan and 12 payments a year. \n= Average house prices per region = \nNick Whitten, director at JLL, said: “For the best part of a decade homeowners have not had to face increased monthly mortgage payments triggered by a rise in the Bank of England base rate. \n\"However, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned of a rise in interest rates from the record-low 0.5pc, potentially by the end of 2015. Rates are likely to rise slowly at around 0.5 percentage points per annum peaking at around half the historic average of 5pc by 2018. \n\"This will have a knock-on effect on mortgage rates with increases particularly hitting homeowners with high loan-to-value variable or tracker mortgages. Although there has been a recent return to real wage growth across the country, household spending will need to be adjusted to ensure rising payments can be made. \n\"An increase in interest rates could also have a dampening effect on the ability of aspiring homeowners to purchase, however this is likely to be offset by higher wage growth and greater job security.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T13:24:32.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
