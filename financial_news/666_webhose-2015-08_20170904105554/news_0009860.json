The government talks of its determination to end dependence on foreign aid by promoting private investments. So why harass and undermine companies such as UTC? Are official actions not contradicting stated intentions? \nAyabatwa describes this new twist as most unfortunate for Rwanda. \"Here is a company seized from its owners when it was a productive corporate citizen fulfilling all its obligations. I neither understood UTC confiscation, nor the declaring of it delinquent by those who seized it without compensation. I cannot think of a worse deterrent to development than what we are witnessing in Rwanda.\" \nAyabatwa is a native Rwandan and successful Pan African businessman with interests throughout the continent and beyond. His Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa Foundation secures internships for young people to launch their professional careers. \nFor more information about Ayabatwa, his businesses and his philanthropy, go to: http://tribertrujugiro.com/ \nContact: David Himbara: ptgpr@fastmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T16:47:49.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
