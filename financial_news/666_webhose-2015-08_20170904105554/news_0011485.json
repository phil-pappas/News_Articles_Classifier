Supplied Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Socks and jocks maker Pacific Brands expects to resume dividend payments in 2016 after a reporting a bottom-line loss of $97.7 million in 2015 - its fourth loss in five years.\nUnderlying net profit rose 5.1 per cent to $37.5 million in 2015, in line with market forecasts, following a rebound in earnings in the June-half, underpinned by strong gains in Pacific Brands' key Bonds and Sheridan brands.\nAfter selling iconic brands such as King Gee, Volleys and Dunlop for $220 million last year, Pacific Brands chief executive David Bortolussi is opening Bonds and Sheridan bricks-and-mortar stores and reducing the company's reliance on wholesale accounts to counter a price squeeze by major retailers.\nSales from continuing operations rose 5.4 per cent to $789.7 million, as strong retail sales growth in Bonds and Sheridan stores offset weak wholesale sales growth.\nMr Bortolussi said the strong sales momentum had continued into the first eight weeks of 2016, with sales to date up 8 per cent.\nHowever, Mr Bortolussi said earnings for the first half would largely be dependent on trading in the key months of November and December and Pacific Brands' ability to raise prices and cut costs to counter the impact of the plunging Australian dollar.\nEarnings before interest and tax before one-off items in 2016 were expected to exceed underlying 2015 EBIT of $64.2 million, which fell 4.8 per cent on the year, he said, although changes in foreign exchange rates \"may impact future earnings.\"\nPacific Brands withheld paying a final dividend, even though the company has net cash of $900,000 compared with borrowings of $249 million this time last year.\n The shares have fallen 28 per cent this year, closing on Monday at 38.5¢, but have recovered from 32¢ lows in June.\nMore to come.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-08-25T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:05:19.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
