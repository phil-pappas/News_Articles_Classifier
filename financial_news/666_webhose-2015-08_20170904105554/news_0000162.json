While this was a strong performance and the distribution was broadly in line with UBS's expectations of 15.76¢ per share, the broker sees the stock as fully priced.\nBased on management's outlook statement, this appears to be a fair call as it pointed to slow global economic growth and continuing low interest rates as macroeconomic factors that are likely to impact the industry.\nWhile constrained interest rates in one respect could be seen as a positive for investors looking to higher yields from REITs, management pointed out that demand for property in such an environment remained strong, making value accretive acquisitions difficult to identify.\nBuoyant property prices worked in BWP's favour in fiscal 2015 as it divested six properties, realising net proceeds of $70.8 million. This was well in excess of the nominal $18.3 million outlaid on acquisitions.\nA review of the entire property portfolio resulted in a net revaluation gain of $108.5 million, contributing to an overall increase of $162.3 million in the value of the group's portfolio, which is now approaching $2 billion.\nGrant McCasker of UBS referred to BWP as a solid vehicle with steady growth, stable income and a proven track record. But he is of the view the market is pricing in significant valuation upside which appears to be fair comment as management has guided to 5 per cent growth in distributions in fiscal 2016.\n While McCasker increased his 12-month price target from $2.64 to $2.72 he maintained his sell recommendation, as the group's shares are trading well above $3.00.\nInvestors have been well rewarded by BWP over the past five years with the group delivering strong distributions and above-average share price growth for the REIT sector. However, this has partly been founded on strong industry conditions within the hardware sector, spurred on by a buoyant property market.\nThere are signs that the residential housing market may be cooling and this could result in a contraction in store rollouts, meaning there will be fewer opportunities for BWP to grow through portfolio expansion.\nThat said, the hardware industry is known for its resilience, as it is not solely reliant on new construction, with a significant degree of revenues driven by renovations and DIY consumers.\nThis is where BWP provides a useful comparison to the other REIT that released its result last week, Ale Property Group.\nAs the owner of Australia's largest portfolio of freehold pub properties Ale is leveraged to consumers spending that can normally withstand challenging economic conditions. In fact, the likes of pub meals and drinks as a low price point form of entertainment/comfort food have in the past thrived during difficult social and economic times.\nIf you overlay the share price charts of BWP and Ale over a five-year period they virtually mirror each other and reflect a share price gain of 80 per cent over that time-span.\nIn the course of delivering Ale's result, management provided data regarding total annual shareholder returns over the past one-year (33.4 per cent), three-year (26.9 per cent), five-year (20.1 per cent) and 10-year (16.8 per cent) periods to June 30, 2015.\nThis takes into account periods of extreme market volatility such as the global financial crisis, and in more recent years a contraction in consumer spending. The statistics speak for themselves in underlining the resilient nature of Ale's portfolio.\nLooking at the group's result for the 12 months to June 30, there were only marginal increases in revenue from properties and distributions per security. However, one of the most impressive developments was the outcome of property revaluations.\nIn mid-July, Ale announced that the statutory valuations of its 86 properties were formerly upgraded to $900.5 million as at June 30, an increase of $78.8 million over the year.\nThis was based on independent valuations of 38 of its properties by global real estate services group CBRE which also indicated that an investor's view of market rent prospects in value may be positively influenced by full disclosure of the tenants operating profitability at each of the properties.\nConsequently, the buoyant nature of the industry is important in terms of assessing Ale's prospects for sustained outperformance. Another positive sign was management's distribution guidance of at least 20¢ a share in 2015-16.\nThis would represent a year-on-year increase in the order of 20 per cent, making the group look attractive even at current trading levels as it implies a yield in the order of 5.5 per cent.\nWeighing up BWP and Ale, the combination of growth and yield offered by the latter, combined with its long-standing resilient performance suggests it may have the edge at the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:10:47.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
