That'll be £2,323' By Ed Monk | Telegraph – 58 minutes ago -0.111 \nThis Suffolk family wanted to upgrade to fibre-optic broadband but were horrified by the cost \nA Suffolk family hoping to have the broadband in their rural home upgraded to a superfast fibre optic connection have been told they’ll need to pay £2,323 for installation. \nSam Watson, 47, from the village of Lavenham, near Sudbury in Suffolk, was quoted the “jaw dropping” sum by Zen Internet. \nZen said it was passing on the costs of connection quoted by Openreach, the BT offshoot that handles telephone and broadband connections. \nThe Watsons' case echoes those of thousands of households across the country who struggle to establish a reliable, fast broadband connection despite bold claims from the Government about rolling out the latest superfast technology. \n• The 'free' broadband deals that cost £203 a year • The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nMrs Watson, who lives with her husband, Simon, also 47, and children Becky, 17, and Mikey, 13, said she contacted Zen because the existing internet connection was struggling to cope with the family’s increased use of TV and film streaming, as well as the demands of running an IT consultancy business partly from home. \n“As soon as more than one person wants to be online, we hit trouble,” she said. \n“Our main problems are bandwidth and reliability our estate was built in the 1970s and the copper wires running to our house are buried underground so we tend to lose connection when it rains, plus we get ants invading the wiring.” \nAfter receiving Mrs Watson’s inquiry, Zen requested that her home be inspected by an Openreach engineer. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) then received a call from Rochdale-based Zen explaining that fibre cables would have to be laid to her house from the cabinet at the end of the street, at a cost of £2,323. \nMost superfast broadband connections involve fibre-optic cables being connected to local \"cabinets\" the green boxes visible on residential streets. The connection from the cabinet to individual homes is then typically via existing copper wires that are already being used for telephone lines and traditional broadband connections. \n• Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) broadband customers presented with a bill for piracy \nThe Government’s roll-out of superfast broadband involves both installing new cabinets and upgrading existing ones to allow for fibre-optic connections. In rare cases, a new line needs to be installed between the cabinet and the home. \n“It’s mind-boggling, even the Zen rep was shocked,” said Mrs Watson, whose case was first highlighted by price comparison website cable.co.uk . \n“I asked if we could just go with fibre to the cabinet, but apparently that’s a different technology and not what our cabinet is enabled for.” \nThe family declined to pay for the upgrade. \nA spokesman for Zen said: \"It’s impossible to predict the quality of pre-existing connectivity ducts installed underground, so when they come to be refurbished or replaced high excess construction charges can be generated, which place significant financial pressure on the user as we see in this particular customer’s case. \n“In scenarios such as this, when a customer is faced with excess construction charges to deliver fibre to the premises, Zen as a service provider transfers the cost from our suppliers directly to our customers without making any additions.\" \nA spokesman for Openreach said: \"In this case, we’d need to excavate a road and install new cabling to connect a single home. Openreach covers the first £1,000 of costs in any case like this, but the remainder is passed to the customer’s service provider.” \nThe Watsons' predicament will be familiar to thousands of households across the country. \"The kids rely on the internet to keep in touch with their friends being rural, even school friends can live 20-30 miles away,” Mrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) Watson said. \n“They also stream online TV and movies as well as gaming there’s not much for teenagers to do here and buses are expensive and infrequent, so being able to connect helps them feel less isolated as well as keeping up with what's going on in their world.” \nThere is £1.7bn pot of money to help pay for fibre-optic upgrades but Openreach, which is handling the work, is targeting its efforts at locations that will benefit the maximum number of people. If residents require a connection sooner than Openreach can do the work, they can face significant extra costs. \nThe telecoms regulator, Ofcom, has set a target of 95pc of homes being able to access fibre-optic broadband by 2017. The 5pc that remain are all in locations that are geographically beyond the reach of traditional cabled broadband. The government is currently testing various wireless and satellite solutions in order to reach them. \n• For money-saving tips, tricks and ideas, get our weekly round-up here \n• Do you have a broadband horror story?
