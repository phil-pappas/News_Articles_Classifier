Wayne Taylor by Nick Lenaghan Corporate marriages are never easy. But the union of two shopping centre giants, Federation Centres and Novion Property Group, turned nasty faster than most.\nThe ousting of Federation chief executive Steven Sewell, who was told to pack his bags by the board last Monday morning , was sudden and brutal. But it was a long time in the making.\nThe immediate cause was a clash of business styles . The new board of the $12 billion property giant, dominated by Novion directors, wasn't getting the information it wanted from Sewell. His presentation of the costs and benefits of a $50 million IT plan was an issue.\nThere was concern too about Sewell's account of vacancy in Federation malls.\nThose numbers needed to be checked, infuriating billionaire John Gandel , now Federation's major investor and the man whose own property empire formed the basis for the Novion trust 20 years earlier.\nBoard concerns And the board may also have become aware of a damning NSW Supreme Court ruling, castigating Sewell as an unreliable witness in his role as head of another listed property trust shortly before he joined Federation.\n\"Boards continuously monitor the performance of chief executives. There were some instances which had caused a bit of discomfort,\" chairman Peter Hay tells AFR Weekend .\n Hay, who chairs Newcrest and was a Novion director, says Sewell's replacement by former Novion chief Angus McNaughton is about the \"risk associated with different management styles\".\nMcNaughton is a safe pair of hands but he had also failed to impress many in the market.\nIn a different, pre-merger context, the board's grievances may have been resolved more happily. The reason they weren't can be found in the very different corporate cultures of the two companies.\nIt was never a merger of equals. Federation was, on the surface at least, swallowing the much bigger Novion and paying close to a 10 per cent premium to do so.\nThe new 11-member board was tilted in favour of Novion, whose directors took six seats.\nSewell paid a control premium without getting control: the board was stacked against him. For a university-trained mathematician it proved to be a fatal miscalculation.\nIt wasn't his only one. Enterprising, energetic and personable, Sewell had presided over the rebirth of the Centro empire. His predecessors, Glenn Rufrano and Robert Tsenin, had wrested the company from its debtors, Sewell had transformed it.\nUnder his watch it was rebranded, co-investors were brought in, providing fresh capital to restart much-needed redevelopment.\nTo his original board Sewell was surely a hero. The merger with Novion - Sewell's idea - was his crowning achievement. As the architect of the deal, he took the prize, the chief executive's post.\nClashing cultures But while the merger put Sewell in charge of a $22 billion retail property portfolio, it is also surrounded him with a culture loyal and respectful to Gandel.\nSewell may not have been aware just how much his work, and words, were relayed back through the ranks to Gandel.\nIt also put Sewell before a stronger board, one more mindful of its major owner.\nThe merger joined Federation, reborn after the credit crisis with a new register of investors, to an older partner, created two decades earlier from the success of Gandel's retail investment. The billionaire was built into the company.\nRetail is Gandel's lifeblood. His parents opened the first Sussan store in Collins Street in 1939. It expanded into shopping centres in the 1960s and 1970s.\nBy the 1980s Gandel sold out and went into property, buying the nascent Chadstone shopping centre, making it the centrepiece of a new retail property empire. Keeping half of his trophy malls in his own name, he took his portfolio public in 1994.\nIt was that original trust, later coupled with a Colonial First State vehicle, that eventually became Novion in 2014.\nMedia splash sticks in craw The extent that Sewell had not properly registered the cultural shift was his participation in a fulsome newspaper profile in July. It stuck in Gandel's craw, especially Sewell's observation that billionaire's role in the company was overstated.\nGandel politely declines to enumerate Sewell's faults. His praise of McNaughton, a trusted steward of his assets once already, is telling.\n\"He's not a status seeker,\" Gandel tells AFR Weekend . \"He does his job and he gets respect. The photo in the paper is not the most important thing. The important thing is getting back to basics and getting the business right.\"\nUproar followed Sewell's departure. Threats to spill the board and launch a lawsuit were aired and just as quickly vanished. Sewell, conscious he has a corporate career to resurrect and a payout to protect, has kept his own counsel.\nThe stock took a hit - 6 per cent over two days - but Gandel had expected that.\n\"It's not like we were bringing very special good news. That's hopefully to come in the future,\" he says.\nThen follows a typically wry observation from the billionaire, who coincidentally was making a $1 million donation to the Melbourne Museum on the very morning his board was excising Sewell from his Collins Street office.\n\"Otherwise a lot of people are going to be unhappy with me and the board.\n\"I've got a few dollars invested myself, so I've got a slightly vested interest.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:08:58.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
