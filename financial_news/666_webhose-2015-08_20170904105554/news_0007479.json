Photo: Ben Rushton\nInsurance Australia Group is resetting its China growth strategy and potentially spending more than $100 million on another acquisition as it seeks a national presence in the world's most populous country.\nIAG, which has a market valuation of $14.2 billion, announced a $60 million write-down of its investment in Chinese motor insurer Bohai during the group's full-year profits. The write-down was due to revised cash flow expectations.\nIAG chief executive Mike Wilkins said the company was seeking a national presence in China and that could involve getting rid of its stake in regional insurer Bohai.\n\"That [selling out of Bohai] is likely given that in any market we like to have one position rather than competing positions. Until we understand what the opportunities available to us [are], it's hard to be totally definitive ... but in all likelihood, yes,\" Mr Wilkins said.\nAdvertisement An acquisition of an insurer with a national footprint would cost more than the $100 million that the group pumped into Bohai in 2011.\n'Meaningful market' \"We still think that China is a meaningful market, if you're going to have a good Asian strategy you've got to be in China,\" he said.\nThe comments come after natural disaster claims and increasing competition took a toll on IAG's earnings, causing the insurance giant to post a $1.1 billion full-year insurance profit, down from $1.6 billion in 2014.\nIAG, which owns brands such as NRMA and CGU, recorded a net profit of $728 million for the year ended June 30, a plunge from the $1.2 billion it made in financial 2014. The group suffered a \"significant increase\" of $495 million in natural peril claims costs, lower net reserve releases and more competition in commercial insurance. The company also announced reserve top ups for its New Zealand business.\nIAG will pay investors a 16¢-per-share dividend, bringing the full-year payout to 29¢ per share – lower than the 39¢ per share posted in 2014.\nRoss Curran, insurance analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said the write-down in China \"may cause some questions to be raised on its Asia expansion strategy\".\nCompetitive pressures Andrew Martin, principal at Alphinity Investment Management, said IAG's results reflected the competitive pressures facing insurers in the market. He also argued the $60 million write-down cast light on the difficulties of growth in China.\n\"It's obviously not a great look when that region is where you want to deploy more capital in the future,\" he said.\nJason Kim, portfolio manager at Nikko Asset Management, is also worried about IAG's moves in China. \"Everyone has their eye on getting something in China because it's such a big market, but there are a lot of strong encumbents. You have to be very patient and come up with a right way of doing it – I'm not sure if they [IAG] are going to be executing properly on that,\" he said.\nThe results come two months after IAG announced its tie-up with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, that saw the insurance giant sign away 20 per cent of its business to the US investment guru's company. In exchange, the company received a $500 million injection and a $700 million reduction in its capital requirements, among others.\nThe funds used for a potential acquisition in China could come from Berkshire's investment into IAG.\nIAG shares have fallen 9.8 per cent to $5.82 in the past 12 months compared with the 7.6 per cent losses of the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-23T14:07:35.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
