The minutes of the 29 July meeting, indicated that the policymakers were still looking to have more confidence in the inflation outlook before raising rates, but saw conditions for a rate hike approaching. \n\"Most members saw room for some additional progress in reducing labour market slack, although several viewed current labour market conditions as at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment,\" the minutes, leaked early by one media outlet, said. \nCapital Economics chief US economist Paul Ashworth said he understood the minutes to mean so as long as the incoming data on GDP growth and the labour market match the Fed's existing forecasts, officials would be confident enough that inflation was going back to its target of 2% in the medium-term to start raising interest rates in September. CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) figures released on Wednesday revealed the rate of US inflation decreased in July, with both the headline and core consumer prices index increasing 0.1% month-on-month, short of consensus forecasts for a 0.2% rise. Year-on-year figures were in line with expectations, however, with headline CPI up 0.2%, and up from the 0.1% annual growth recorded in June. \nOn Thursday's agenda, UK retail sales figures at 0930 BST are expected to show consumers spent more in July as lower fuel and food prices give spending power a boost. \nThe data from the Office for National Statistics is forecast to reveal retail sales rose 4.3% year-on-year in July, compared to 4.2% in June. On a month-on-month basis sales are predicted to have increased 0.4% in July following a 0.2% fall a month earlier. \nAny signs of further economic recovery in the UK are likely to lift expectations that an interest rate increase by the Bank of England is drawing near. \nLater on, the US sees the release of reports on existing home sales and initial jobless claims. \nIn company news, Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) gained despite swinging to a pre-tax loss in the first half, missing analysts' expectations as it took a hit from impairment charges and lower oil prices. However the company maintained its full-year production guidance at 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and said its Solan field was on track for first oil in the fourth quarter of 2015, while the Catcher field is on track for 2017. \nRank Group advanced as it posted a 19% rise in pre-tax profit for the 12 months ended 30 June, with a significant improvement across all the company's brands. \nBritish American Tobacco slumped following reports Australia's Cancer Council of Victoria will fight a freedom of information request by the company to access information from classroom surveys about young people's attitudes towards smoking. \nA batch of miners rallied including Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Randgold Resources and metal prices moved higher. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,119.63 -0.42% FTSE 100 6,378.62 -0.39% FTSE 250 17,346.62 -0.30% FTSE 100 - Risers Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 662.50p +2.24% Pearson (Amsterdam: PR8.AS - news ) (PSON) 1,167.00p +2.01% Anglo American (AAL) 723.00p +1.92% Randgold Resources Ltd.
