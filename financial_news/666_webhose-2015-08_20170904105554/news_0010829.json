So far, their response has been largely the former, deferring to traders’ fits by maintaining or even adding to their stimulus, as China did Tuesday .\nNow, bond traders are betting the Federal Reserve will continue to coddle investors by pushing back the timing of its first interest-rate increase since 2006. Why? Because things look a little shaky right now. Global equity markets lost more than $5 trillion of value in less than two weeks as traders grew increasingly worried about a bigger-than-expected slowdown in China derailing global growth.\nDavid Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPMorgan Funds unit, said it would be a mistake for the Fed to base its decision on recent market moves.\n“It’s a lot like raising a 2-year-old: you have to set limits and be consistent,” Kelly said. “It reduces uncertainty” to stick with a steady message and stay on course.\nSeptember Song Futures traders are pricing in a 26 percent chance the Fed will raise rates from near zero in September, down from 40 percent at the end of July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barclays Plc now sees the Fed making a move in March after previously forecasting September, chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said in a report Monday.\nNothing much has changed in U.S. data in that period, which were either OK or pretty good, depending on which report you look at. What’s different is that China’s stock market experienced its biggest rout since 1996 and commodities plunged on slowing growth expectations.\nNow the Fed must decide what tack it wants to take -- either draw a hard line and keep with its plan of raising rates this year, or push back its timing as it waits for a more emotionally stable time in markets.\nWith markets as with toddlers, there never seems to be an easy time to set limits. But it just gets harder if you don’t do it at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T18:46:03.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
