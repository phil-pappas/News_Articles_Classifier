It is ridiculous that the job cuts programme for fleet, engineering and station staff is also still being bulldozed through against this background. \n\"The night Tube plan has been botched from the off. \n\"The basics haven't been done and those who will pay for this shambles will not only be our members but the London daily travelling public who cough up a fortune and who will find their safety and the reliability of the service compromised from September 12 onwards. \n\"Running Tube services with fatigued and burnt-out staff is a recipe for disaster.\" \nLast week's Tube strike caused severe travel disruption with lengthy delays, queues and traffic jams reported across the capital. \nAs the strike came to a close, evening commuters were caught in 894 separate traffic jams. \nThe navigation software makers TomTom said the traffic jams caused around 500 miles of tailbacks in London. \nLarge queues also built up for the city's buses and trains (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T17:28:49.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
