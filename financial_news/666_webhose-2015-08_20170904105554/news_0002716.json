The new album Compton : A Soundtrack by Dr. Dre features Ice Cube, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Kendrick Lamar and more. The new album replaces the long rumored Detox album that had been on the mind of many hip hop heads through out the last 14 years. \nCheck out the track list below: \n01 Intro02 Talk About It [ft.

Snoop Dogg, Marsha Ambrosius & King Mez]14 Animals [ft. Anderson Paak]15 Medicine Mane [ft. Eminem, Candice Pillay & Anderson Paak]16 Talking to My Diary \nAs mentioned this album will only be available on iTunes/Apple Music . Could this be the big move that Apple is pulling to try and lure customers over? Will exclusive albums really be key to Apple Music's success? Competing streaming service Tidal secured exclusive content from artists like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj to try and seduce consumers over to Tidal. However hours after the content had been posted on Tidal the tracks and videos appeared on multiple social sites and P2P servers that basically null and voided the exclusivity of the content. \nTime will tell if Apple Music is going to be a huge competitor in the streaming service. The three month free trial period appears to be working well and they aren't even on Android yet. Exclusive content will be key to garnering new users and bringing out the big guns like Dr. Dre is definitely a step in the right direction but will it make the customer come and stay for a while or will it be bootlegged as fast as they released it? Only time will tell but Apple is here and ready to play the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:57:11.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
