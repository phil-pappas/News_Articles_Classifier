Secondly, when she was speaking yesterday, in fact, I asked myself: 'Is this the Prasa that I built and led for the past 10 years?',\" he said. \n\"I don't think so. I do not agree, so I'm not saying that as a person I didn't make mistakes, I probably made more mistakes than anyone else at Prasa, but I can tell you on the specific allegations and findings that were made, I dispute all of them because there's no act of maladministration on my side and that's what I want to challenge.\" \nMontana was dismissed on July 16 amid allegations that the state-owned entity put millions of rands into new diesel locomotives, which allegedly do not conform to South African rail line standards. \nA statement released by Prasa on the day did not disclose any details about why Montana was fired. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:31:34.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
