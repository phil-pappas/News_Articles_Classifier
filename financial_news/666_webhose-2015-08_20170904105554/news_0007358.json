Those permissions caused many to publicly deride the streaming-music service for overstepping their bounds, including a public excoriation from Minecraft creator Markus Persson to his 2.4 million Twitter followers.\nThe broad legal language that apps include in privacy policies is a pain point for both consumers, who don’t want to sign over their personal data in exchange for a mobile diversion, and companies like Spotify who face this exact kind of backlash. The solution seems to be separate permissions each time an app attempts to access information on a device, which Apple’s iOS operating system has long supported and Google plans to implement in the newest version of Android .\nSpotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek responded to the hubbub Friday with a blog post in which he apologized and noted that Spotify will offer granular permissions that let users deny the permissions one by one, even if they accept the privacy policy. He also detailed the reasons Spotify is seeking the permissions and said the policy will be updated again to reflect the concerns users voiced.\n“Let me be crystal clear here: If you don’t want to share this kind of information, you don’t have to,” Ek wrote. “We will ask for your express permission before accessing any of this data — and we will only use it for specific purposes that will allow you to customize your Spotify experience.”\nEk explained that access to photos was needed to change a user’s profile photo or to add custom art for playlists, while location would help Spotify share locally trending music. The microphone could be used for voice controls, and contacts could enable sharing.\nSharing with advertisers and wireless carriers was one of the more controversial areas of the new policy, and Ek addressed that last.\n“With regard to mobile networks, some Spotify subscribers sign up through their mobile provider, which means some information is shared with them by necessity,” the CEO wrote. “We also share some data with our partners who help us with marketing and advertising efforts, but this information is de-identified — your personal information is not shared with them.”\nSpotify plans to update the privacy policy to reflect all those facts, Ek said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/notch/status/634659768125231104", "http://bgr.com/2015/08/18/android-6-0-marshmallow-tips-and-tricks-app-permissions/", "https://news.spotify.com/us/2015/08/21/sorry-2/"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T14:51:05.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
