REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nBy Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank at an annualised pace of 1.6 percent in April-June as exports slumped and consumers cut back on spending, a bad omen for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policy drive to lift the economy out of decades of deflation. \nChina's economic slowdown and its impact on its Asian neighbours have also heightened the chance that any rebound in growth in July-September will be modest, analysts say. \nThe gloomy data adds to signs that Japan's economy is at a standstill and may rekindle market expectations that the Bank of Japan will expand monetary stimulus later this year. \nThe contraction compared with a median market forecast of a 1.9 percent fall and followed a revised expansion of 4.5 percent in the first quarter, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday. \nPrivate consumption, which makes up roughly 60 percent of economic activity, fell 0.8 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, double the pace expected by analysts. \nIt was the first decline since April-June 2014, when an increase in the sales tax hike hit consumption, as households spent less on air conditioners, clothing and personal computers, said a government official briefing reporters on the data. \nOverseas demand shaved 0.3 percentage point off growth as exports to Asia and the United States slumped, the data showed. \nMany analysts say weak second-quarter GDP data alone won't trigger an immediate monetary easing. \nBut economists have already sharply cut their growth forecasts for the current fiscal year and expect the BOJ to do so too when it reviews its long-term projections in October. \nJapan's economy suffered a mild recession last year as consumption took a hit from a sales tax hike in April 2014. Growth rebounded this year, only to slow again as exports and consumption remained disappointingly weak. \n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Additional reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Kim Coghill and Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T03:28:57.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
