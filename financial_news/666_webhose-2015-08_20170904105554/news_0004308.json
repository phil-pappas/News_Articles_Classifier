From top left, Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee and from bottom left, John Kasich, Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump and Scott Walker. AP by John Kehoe and Thomas Threlkeld The top 10 Republican presidential candidates face off in their first debate on Thursday night. Who are the candidates, what do they stand for and what are their chances?\n1. DONALD TRUMP (23.4 per cent of vote based on the average of 5 polls)\nThe property and casino mogul has shot to prominence through outlandish public statements and by billing himself as a non-politician. Trump, 69, is appealing to the conservative party's disenchanted base, who are fed up with professional politicians in Washington. His attack on Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists has resonated with many middle-class Americans, who worry about new arrivals stealing their jobs and putting their personal security at risk. And business success makes many believe Trump can run the economy better.\nMost pundits are surprised Trump's meteoric rise has endured and still expect him to burn out through a gaffe or to be shown up for a lack of serious policies. But that hasn't happened – yet. He has turned an enormous – and oft-debated – personal wealth of about $US10 billion ($13.56 billion) into a political advantage, arguing he can't be bought by donors with fat cheque books. The implication is that his GOP opponents can, and The Donald, as he is known, assailed Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz as \"puppets\" at the weekend for attending a retreat with the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, who are key Republican donors.\nThe candidate: Donald Trump reportedly dictates his tweets to staff on his private jet. AP 2. JEB BUSH (12 per cent)\nThe brother and son of past presidents, Bush remains the favourite candidate among establishment, pro-business Republicans. The Bush name has helped him tap into the family's financial donor network and swiftly become the best-resourced Republican candidate. Bush, 62, and his aligned political action committees have already raised more than $US120 million.\nYet his family links also carry baggage. His brother George W Bush's presidency is not remembered fondly, because of the disastrous Iraq War and the onset of the global financial crisis. Relatively centrist positions on some issues might prove an issue, too, with many Tea Party conservatives against a third Bush incarnation because of his pro-immigration stance and support for federal government involvement in state education curriculums.\nFor Jeb, the key pitch is his economic record as Florida governor (1999-2007), where he cut taxes and oversaw a property boom, before real estate went bust.\n Jeb Bush has the support of Republican Party elites and a large campaign funding war chest. But he also has the baggage from his brother's unpopular presidency. Reuters 3. SCOTT WALKER (10.2 per cent)\nThe 47-year-old Wisconsin governor has become a conservative darling by cutting the power of public sector unions, reducing taxes and pruning government spending. Walker is pitching himself as a conservative who has stuck to conservative principles, while wooing voters in a traditional Democrat-leaning state. He has won three state elections.\nThe son of a Baptist minister, Walker is parading his social conservatism on abortion and gay rights. Combined with his small-government economic ideology, he has carved out a sizeable block of voters between more moderate Republicans like Bush and ultra-hardliners like Ted Cruz. Analysts believe Walker has neatly positioned himself to capture the votes of Cruz and Trump if they drop out of the race. Question marks remain over Walker's foreign policy knowledge and ability to transform from a successful state politician to a national political figure.\n4. MIKE HUCKABEE (6.6 per cent)\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker is among the leading contenders to win the Republican Party nomination for the US Presidential election in 2016. Reuters Governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, Huckabee, ran for the nomination in 2008, eventually finishing second behind John McCain. He moved into the media, hosting a popular television show on Fox News and a successful national radio program. While not fully trusted by the party establishment, who consider him unreliable on tax cuts for the wealthy and support for free trade, the Baptist minister is beloved by the party's social conservatives.\nAn opponent of legal abortion even in the case of rape and incest, Huckabee has said the US is a \"Christian nation\", is a vocal critic of equal rights for homosexuals and a supporter of teaching creationism in public schools. After the Sandy Hook massacre, in which 26 people, including 20 children, were gunned down at school, Huckabee, 59, blamed the tragedy on the US for having \"removed God from our schools\".\n5. BEN CARSON (5.8 per cent)\nThe only African-American running to succeed the first African-American president, Carson, 63, is a famous retired neurosurgeon. He rocketed to prominence after his fiery speech in February 2013 at the National Prayer Breakfast, where he repeatedly excoriated the Affordable Care Act, with the author of that law, President Barack Obama, sitting mere feet away.\nCharismatic Marco Rubio holds up his son Anthony while his wife Jeanette looks on after announcing his run for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump notwithstanding, Rubio is arguably the most exciting Republican candidate, one who has been compared with Barack Obama in 2007. AP Carson is a self-made man and his frequent lamentations about the welfare state have struck a chord with Republican audiences. \"We say, 'There, there, you poor little thing. I'm gonna give you health care. I'm gonna give you housing subsidies. I'm gonna give you food stamps,\" says Carson, whose family relied on food stamps for a time. \"You don't have to worry about anything. What that has done is create generation upon generation of people who just live that way, waiting for government handouts.\"\nSince retiring from practice, Carson has written bestselling books about his life and beliefs and appeared on Fox News as a commentator. He has called Obamacare \"the worst thing that has happened in this country since slavery\". He is not considered a serious contender for president, but might be a viable vice-presidential running mate for a Republican trying to appeal to minorities.\n6. TED CRUZ (5.4 per cent)\nThe renegade Texas Senator is arguably the most conservative candidate, socially and economically. Cruz, a Harvard-educated lawyer and former adviser to president George W Bush, infamously led the Republican Party's 17-day government shutdown in October 2013. The associated stand-off over raising the government's borrowing limit took the US to within hours of a sovereign debt default.\nCruz, 44, has repeatedly called for President Obama's healthcare insurance expansion to be repealed and says he wants to abolish the Internal Revenue Service. He was born in Canada, to an American mother and Cuban immigrant father. Despite his immigrant heritage, Cruz is an outspoken critic of illegal immigration, a big problem along the Texan border with Mexico. He is very socially conservative, appealing to Christian evangelicals with his god-fearing messages against gay rights and abortion.\n7. MARCO RUBIO (5.4 per cent)\nThe 44-year-old Senator from the crucial swing state of Florida is perhaps the most charismatic performer in the crowded Republican field. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has unveiled a plan to slash personal taxes, though there are doubts about how it will be funded. A foreign policy hawk who sits on the Senate foreign relations committee, Rubio has criticised President Obama for being weak on the Iran nuclear deal, Islamic State terrorism and for restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba.\nLike Obama, Rubio served in a state legislature for about eight years before being elected to Washington and running for president as a first-term Senator. He served previously as House majority leader and speaker in the Florida legislature, when Jeb Bush was the state's governor and Rubio's mentor. Rubio's pro-immigration position would broaden his appeal among Hispanic voters, who the Republicans must woo if they are to win the November 2016 election.\nHowever, his support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants has concerned hardline Republicans who will vote in the primary poll. Rubio is widely considered one of the GOP's top three contenders. His campaign began well but he has slipped recently in the polls.\n8. RAND PAUL (4.8 per cent)\nPaul is the most libertarian candidate in the race, criticising security agency spying and ridiculing government involvement in the economy and healthcare. He is the son of the famous three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul. A qualified eye doctor, Paul was elected to the US Senate as part of the Tea Party wave of 2010. He is trying to connect to younger voters.\nThe Kentucky Senator is positioning himself as the \"dove\" of foreign policy among the hawkish Republican field. \"I want to be known as the candidate who's not eager for war, who thinks war's the last resort,\" Paul said in the first primary state of Iowa at the weekend. He has accused Hillary Clinton, who as a Senator voted in favour of going to battle in Iraq, of helping start a war. Similarly, he criticised rival Jeb Bush for supporting the National Security Agency's intrusion of privacy through \"sneak and peak\" tactics.\nHe's less dovish on spending, and voted for the harsh cuts that led to the government shutdown in 2013. Paul, 52, has fallen in the polls over the past month or so, casting doubt on whether his more libertarian views can capture enough regular conservative Republican voters.\n9. CHRIS CHRISTIE (3.4 per cent)\nGovernor of working-class New Jersey since 2010, Christie was the original hope of many Republican libertarians for his relatively moderate views on social policy, combined with a ferocious appetite for partisan combat and a record of taking on unions. His first term was dominated by the recovery from the devastating impact of Hurricane Sandy, which ravaged the coastline of New Jersey.\nHis second, however, has been dominated by scandal. When some Democratic mayors refused to endorse Christie for re-election, the governor's administration allegedly engineered horrific traffic jams to punish those mayors. The ensuing investigation into what has become known as \"bridge-gate\" has destroyed Christie's popularity and has been poisonous for his presidential ambitions. Where he once led the field with more than 20 per cent of the vote, he now languishes.\nChristie is positioning himself as a hard-nosed truth teller. He won endorsement from The Wall Street Journal for plans to cut tax rates in return for fewer deductions, slashing entitlements for seniors and raising the retirement age, but those policies will be unpopular with older Republican voters.\n10. JOHN KASICH (3.2 per cent)\nKasich, the second-term governor of Ohio, scraped into the top 10 for the debate after a late presidential campaign launch. He previously served four years in Congress, building a reputation as a serious policy wonk and budget hawk. Outside politics he has dabbled in investment banking and as a Fox News show host.\nThe midwestern state of Ohio is often considered a bellwether for how national elections are decided. Unlike most Republican governors, Kasich accepted federal assistance for Ohio to expand Medicaid, offering healthcare insurance for the poor under President Obama's insurance overhaul. Kasich, 63, also says drug addicts should be treated with compassion and says he is willing to consider an eventual path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. These are unpopular positions with the GOP faithful, but in defence Kasich cites his deep Catholic faith, which he says compels him to consider policies to alleviate the suffering of the poor and unfortunate. However laudable some might consider these deviations to be, they will probably be a serious problem for Kasich in an increasingly conservative GOP primary electorate.\nMISSING OUT*\nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry (1.8 per cent)\nFormer Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum (1.4 per cent)\nLouisiana governor Bobby Jindal (1.4 per cent)\nBusinesswoman Carly Fiorina (1.3 per cent)\nSenator Lindsey Graham (0.7 per cent)\nFormer New York governor George Pataki (0.6 per cent)\nFormer Virginia governor Jim Gilmore (0.2 per cent)\n* The bottom seven will appear in an earlier, non-prime-time undercard debate", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:14:32.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
