The broader All Ordinaries finished 1.6 per cent down to 5383.5.\nThe market followed a weak lead early from the global bourses which reacted negatively to the news that China had devalued its currency by a record 1.9 per cent off its peg to the US dollar.\nSurprisingly positive consumer sentiment data briefly nudged the market into the black in early trade before the People's Bank of China again snipped its currency reference rate , this time by 1.6 per cent, sending the market sliding for the rest of the session.\nAFR Graphic \"In the Australian context it comes down the joining of the dots around concerns where growth in China is going,\" Patersons economist Tony Farnham said.\n\"As the concern from Chinese authorities about growth becomes more evident, that has to wash through to companies that feed off the Chinese strength,\" he said.\nThe miners were savaged in the wake of the devaluation.\nRio Tinto fell 5.4 per cent to $51.65, BHP Billiton dropped 4.3 per cent to $25.2 and Fortescue Metals Group dropped 8 per cent to $1.79.\n \"It's not surprising to see them being sold off to the levels they were today,\" James Kim, sales trader at Saxo Capital Markets said.\n\"Commodities are going to be a lot more expensive for China to import now.\"\nThe banks, excluding Commonwealth Bank which placed its shares in a halt while it raised $5 billion in capital , were up early before the poor sentiment weighed.\nANZ Banking Group lost 1.9 per cent to $29.50, Westpac fell 1.4 per cent to $31.59 and National Australia Bank dropped 2 per cent to $31.80.\nMr Kim said if Commonwealth Bank had traded today, the market may have fallen more than 2 per cent. But he said he did not expect the bank to suffer much more when it resumed trading.\n\"I think the market would be relieved to an extent that they have somewhat been able to raise a big chunk of the funds to satisfy APRA [Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority],\" Mr Kim said.\n\"They were also sold heavily heading into reporting following ANZ's capital raising,\" he said.\nOther heavyweights were also hit, Woolworths fell 2.8 per cent to $26.90, Wesfarmers lost 1.2 per cent to $41.05 and Telstra slipped 1.1 per cent to $6.24.\nA swath of company results largely failed to inspire the market. Among them, AGL Energy's full year profit fell 62 per cent on writedowns and one off charges, but its underlying surged 12 per cent, and the share price finished the day 1.4 per cent down to $16.41.\nCSL's profit growth was limited to 5.5 per cent due to currency fluctuations and one off costs associated with its flu vaccine expansion, the company said. Its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $93.00.\nGlobal share registry Computershare was the most sold ASX200 stock for the day, down 9.3 per cent to $10.60 after it reported a 0.7 per cent drop in underlying profit.\n\"The Computershare results was not received with happiness in any shape or form, and CSL's results didn't prompt strong buying,\" Mr Farnham said.\nEcho Entertainment Group reported a forecast-beating 52 per cent rise in net profit to $219 million, but its share price fell 2.3 per cent after it said its capital investment works would hit its 2016 revenue.\nReal Estate company REA Group's underlying net profit after tax was up 24 per cent, but below analyst estimates. Their share price fell 3.8 per cent to $41.20.\nPrimary Healthcare was the best performer, its shares rose 4.2 per cent to $4.64 after it reported a net profit up 19.1 per cent to $136.5 million.\nIt also lifted the healthcare sector to the best performer for the day, although it still ended down 1 per cent.\nThe worst performing sector was information technology, down a whopping 7.2 per cent on the Computershare sell-off, followed by materials, down 3.5 per cent.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/why-cbas-profit-growth-is-slowing-20150811-gix2fp.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/china/chinas-yuan-devaluation-flags-global-growth-slowdown-20150812-gix54t.html", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-china-spooks-investors-20150811-gix0x9.html"], "published": "2015-08-12T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:05:58.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
