Pat Scala Share on twitter by Philip Baker Retail shareholders of ANZ have certainly paid a hefty price so Mike Smith can sleep at night.\nSmith didn't want to be held hostage to the sharemarket over the next few months as other banks potentially respond to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's new capital rules, so he pulled the trigger on ANZ's $3 billion capital raising to get his money straight away.\nTalk on trading desks on Friday hinted that a disappointing first-half profit report from Standard Chartered this week and concerns Commonwealth Bank will announce a raising next week were reasons that the ANZ were so keen to do this deal.\nOn Thursday Smith said ANZ was acting now because the banking regulator was moving faster than expected.\nWhen asked if small shareholders were getting a rough deal, Smith pointed to its comparative size.\n\"This is a small issue. If it was a bigger issue we probably would have done it through a rights issue, which is always a little bit more fair, I think,\" he said\nANZ's share register is also skewed to institutional investors and \"the easy thing to have done would have been to do the whole thing as an insto placement but we felt we had to give some to retail\".\nShares in ANZ closed at $30.14, below the offer price to institutions of $30.95 in the $2.5 billion institutional component of the raising.\n Deutsche Bank, Citi and JP Morgan now have to convince retail investors it's a good deal to get the remaining $500 million and what they end up paying will depend on how ANZ stock trades in the last five days of the offer.\nThe bank's CEO went head-first into the capital raising, delivering a profit result that failed to meet expectations and signalled the bad debt cycle in Australia is turning.\nLocal fund managers appeared to side-step the share purchase plan and pointed to the skinny 5 per cent discount the shares were offered at, given the earnings report and how diluted they might be as a result of the deal.\nIt all meant Deutsche Bank, Citi and JPMorgan had to turn to offshore investors to get the deal away, which raised concerns about whether they are long-term players or not.\nThe deal has also sent a strong message to hedge funds around the world that short-selling local bank stocks is a low-risk trade.\nSell now and buy back in when they raise the money.\nBank stock too weighty To be fair, many local fund managers have been lukewarm towards the banking sector following its great run over the past three years and worry that at 30 per cent of the major S&P ASX 200 index, its weighting is way too high.\nIn the UK banks make up around 20 per cent of stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange, while they account for 10 per cent of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.\nProfessional managers such as Jason Beddow from Argo Investments said this week it will be tough for bank shares to keep rising over the next 12 to 18 months as they go through this phase of raising additional capital.\nIronically it's the self-managed superannuation sector and retail investors on the hunt for any additional yield that will probably help prop up the sector.\nStill, any retail investors looking to buy bank shares need to be aware that the fully franked 7 per cent to 8 per cent yield comes with bad and doubtful debts at record lows and pressure on interest rate margins.\nFurthermore, credit growth is close to half of what it has been over the past 40 years.\nThe structure of the deals is different, but that National Australia Bank's full-blown rights issue of $5.5 billion was done at a discount of around 16 per cent.\nHowever, retail shareholders, if they are keen, will be able to buy up to $15,000 in ANZ shares through the share purchase plan.\nThe banks have so far tapped shareholders for more than $10 billion in capital in recent months, and that's before Commonwealth Bank is tipped to continue the trend when it reports its profits next week.\nPrior to this deal ANZ had the lowest capital levels of the big four but analysts such as CSLA's Brian Johnson believe the bank will have to raise more.\nHe says the underlying business at ANZ \"remains under pressure with earnings likely having peaked\" and notes the bank's earnings per share growth lags that of the other banks, while he thinks enthusiasm for their Asia strategy is \"quickly fading\".\n\"Exposure to possible corruption issues in Malaysia, continued revenue pressures on their above-peer insto business, potential looming change in CEO and possible further capital requirements all make it somewhat of a challenging investment proposition\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority announced in July that major banks must lift their capital held against home loans by about $12 billion by next July.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-07T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:07:01.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
