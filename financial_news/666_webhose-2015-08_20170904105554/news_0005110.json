The transactions covered by the Proposed Regulations include so-called “management fee waiver” arrangements commonly employed by private equity fund managers, although the Proposed Regulations address any transaction involving disguised payments for services under Section 707(a)(2)(A). \nIn addition, Treasury and the IRS have concluded that safe-harbor relief currently affording tax-free treatment for certain profits interests received for the provision of services to a partnership does not apply to transactions in which one party (for example, a management company) provides services to a partnership and another party (for example, a general partner) receives an associated profits interest. Furthermore, Treasury and the IRS announced their intention to issue future guidance excluding profits interests received as part of a management fee waiver arrangement from this safe harbor. \nThe Proposed Regulations were issued on July 22, 2015. While they technically would not take effect until published in final form, the preamble to the Proposed Regulations (the “”) states that Treasury and the IRS view the Proposed Regulations as generally reflecting Congressional intent as to when arrangements are appropriately treated as disguised payments for services. Management Fee Waiver Arrangements \n“” to which the manager may otherwise be entitled if the fund’s performance exceeds certain thresholds. The Proposed Regulations \nsation). \nObservation: General Rules \n’ide a non-exclusive list of six factors that would be relevant to this determination. \nObservation: “related direct or indirect allocation and distribution” to the service provider, and the Proposed Regulations recite this requirement, a timing rule contained in the Proposed Regulations would effectively eliminate the dual requirement of an allocation and distribution. The Proposed Regulations would require that the proper treatment of an arrangement be determined at the time it is entered into or modified, regardless of the timing and separate risk associated with the receipt of any distributions. Thus, it appears possible under the Proposed Regulations that an allocation would be subject to disguised fee treatment even if the service provider ultimately never receives a distribution with respect to such allocation. The Preamble acknowledges this discrepancy, but explains that Treasury and the IRS believe that recharacterizing an arrangement retroactively is administratively difficult. Determination of Significant Entrepreneurial Risk \nurial risk by clear and convincing evidence. The five factors are (i) capped allocations of partnership income if the cap would reasonably be expected to apply in most years; (ii) allocations for a fixed number of years under which the service providers distributive share of income is reasonably certain; (iii) allocation of gross income items; (iv) an allocation that is predominantly fixed in amount, is reasonably determinable under all the facts and circumstances, or is designed to assure that sufficient net profits are highly likely to be available to satisfy the allocation; and (v) arrangements in which a service provider waives its right to receive payment for the future performance of services in a manner that is non-binding or fails to timely notify the partnership and its partners of the waiver and its terms. The Proposed Regulations also provide that whether a service provider bears significant entrepreneurial risk will be considered in relation to the level of entrepreneurial risk in the activities undertaken by the partnership generally. \nObservation: \nis found to have significant entrepreneurial risk, then the arrangement could still be treated as a disguised payment for services in light of five secondary factors. Under the Proposed Regulations, an arrangement would be presumptively treated as a disguised payment for services depending on (i) whether the service provider holds, or is expected to hold, a transitory partnership interest or a partnership interest for only a short duration; (ii) whether the service provider receives an allocation and distribution in a time frame comparable to the time frame in which a non-partner service provider would typically receive payment; (iii) whether the service provider became a partner primarily to obtain tax benefits which would have been unavailable if the service provider had provided services to the partnership in a third-party capacity; (iv) whether the value of the service providers interest in general and continuing partnership profits is small in relation to the allocation and distribution being evaluated; and (v) whether (A) services are provided either by one person or by persons that are related under Sections 707(b) or 267(b) (such as a general partner and management company that are under common ownership), (B) the arrangement provides for different allocations or distributions with respect to different services (such as general management and oversight by a general partner and investment advice or other management services by a related management company) and (C) the terms of the differing allocations or distributions are subject to levels of entrepreneurial risk that vary significantly. Examples Addressing Management Fee Waivers \nthe IRS do not regard as disguised payments for services, the Preamble highlights as supporting factors (i) the execution by the service provider of a waiver in advance of the period to which the waived fees relate, in a manner that is binding, irrevocable and clearly communicated to other partners, (ii) the receipt by the service provider of a profits interest based on net profits that are neither highly likely to be available nor reasonably determinable at the time of entering into the arrangement, and (iii) the presence of a clawback obligation with which the service provider is reasonably expected to be able to comply. The Preamble further states that, although the presence of each fact described in these examples is not necessarily required to reach the same conclusion, the absence of certain facts (such as a failure to measure future profits over at least a 12-month period) may suggest a fee for services arrangement. Accordingly, it should be noted that, once it is concluded that significant entrepreneurial risk is present, any given arrangement may still pass muster even under the Proposed Regulations. Unfortunately, neither the text of the Proposed Regulations nor the Preamble provide guidance as to what specifically is an effective clawback or otherwise constitutes significant entrepreneurial risk. Additional clarity in the examples would have been helpful. \nObservation: “” arrangements, including typical priority “catch-up” arrangements that are intended to equalize a service provider’s return with priority returns already received by the investors over the life of the partnership. In the case of management fee waivers, however, the Proposed Regulations leave many questions unanswered. Amendment to Profits Interests Safe Harbor \nObservation: Effective Dates Conclusion \nive, while leaving in place a certain amount of uncertainty for all remaining arrangements. Given the position of Treasury and the IRS that the Proposed Regulations generally reflect Congressional intent regarding current law, due care should be given to the guidelines set forth in the Proposed Regulations in reviewing existing management fee waiver arrangements and structuring such arrangements in the future. \n\n2)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:28:17.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
