Simon Letch Share on twitter by Patrick Commins If you're sweating that your shares portfolio is headed for disaster or that your retirement plans are in ruins, a quick conversation with veteran investor Dougal Maple-Brown is just the trick to calm your jangled nerves.\nAnd a bit of soothing is in order.\nAfter all, the ASX on Monday suffered its worst single session since the global financial crisis (GFC). The benchmark top 200 index has dropped 12 per cent since its late-April peak, with the \"safe as houses\" big banks copping the worst of it – have you heard CBA has lost a fifth of its value in four short months? Meanwhile, during an unimpressive earnings season, company share prices have been swinging more wildly than a late-order batsman.\nOverseas, China 's sharemarket looks to be crashing, raising the spectre that the world's second-biggest economy is in worse shape than the experts believed. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is getting ready to lift rates for the first time in almost a decade – are markets ready?\nYou can see the week's tale of woe in the accompanying chart – a disastrous session in one time zone rolled on to the next, creating a negative feedback loop that in the early stages seemed set to roll through the week.\nTake China's \"Black Monday\" (so dubbed by Chinese official media) where the Shanghai exchange plunged 8.5 per cent. That evening the Dow Jones index crashed 1000 points – its biggest drop ever in absolute terms. Wall Street recovered most of that steep early sell-off, but it set the scene for a bad start to the ASX on Tuesday morning – before an incredible 220-point swing left Australian shares with a surprise gain.\nMaple-Brown tells AFR Weekend : \"The brokers are surprised this week when they talk to me – I've been incredibly chirpy because I'm a value guy and valuations have improved.\"\nFrom talking with Maple-Brown, head of Australian equities at Maple-Brown Abbott, and other veteran investors, you glean that maintaining a level head (and staying chirpy) during periods of market dislocation requires two things: perspective and a plan.\n Let's start with perspective. Despite the terrifying headlines, the ASX 200 index is actually up for the week. And as Maple-Brown points out, once dividends are included in the equation, the loss so far this month of 7.2 per cent only slightly outdoes the solid 6.9 per cent total return generated as recently as February. It's not great, but it looks less horrific in context.\nThe Maple-Brown Abbott funds have been putting cash to work this week. \"We've been adding to existing stocks rather than buying a whole lot of new ones,\" Maple-Brown says.\n\"The No 1 rule is 'Don't panic,\" chips in Anton Tagliaferro, another veteran investor and founder of Investors Mutual. He admits this is easier said than done. \"No 2 is step back and try to understand what's happening and why it's happening.\n\"When you get a huge correction like this, you need to look for things to buy, and that's what we did,\" Tagliaferro says.\nThe trick for investors is figuring out the right time to pull the cord and start buying. It's all too easy leaping into the market at the wrong time, only to find yourself (and your stocks) free-falling rather than taking off.\nThe catalyst for Monday's ASX rout came from offshore, and from China specifically, points out PM Capital's Aussie equities portfolio manager, Uday Cheruvu. The main thing that Cheruvu says he needed to understand was whether the collapse in the Chinese sharemarket was a symptom of a similarly dire deterioration in economic conditions.\n\"The sense that I got was the stockmarket went up 50 per cent in the three months before and now it's coming down,\" he says. \"It's hugely sentiment-driven.\n\"We think China is slowing down, but there is no dramatic change between two weeks ago and now.\"\nTagliaferro and his team spent last Sunday putting together a list of the companies they wanted to buy, calculating the valuations – dividend yield and price/earnings ratio – of each at 5 per cent price intervals.\n\"As I've seen in huge market corrections before – like the October '87 crash and the GFC – these things can fall very quickly, and unless you know what the valuation of each particular stock is at different levels, sometimes it's too late to react.\n\"You buy into it progressively, you chip in,\" Tagliaferro says. \"We bought things like AusNet at a yield close to 7 per cent, and Shopping Centres Australasia [SCA Property Group] on a yield close to 7 per cent. We picked up some NAB below $30 on a yield of close to 6.8 per cent fully franked.\"\nBut in the first instance, you need to have the money ready to spend.\n\"Unless you got the cash, there's not much you can do,\" says Maple-Brown. \"And when the market falls, you need to make sure you put some of that cash to work and try to get the right stocks – and that's the harder part.\"\nIn the accompanying table you can see 13 stocks that Morningstar head of equity research Joel Greenwood has nominated as high-quality companies with either a narrow or wide \"moat\" – that is, a sustainable competitive advantage. Each has Morningstar analysts' estimates of fair value. This is a useful starting point for that list of stocks you might potentially like, along with the prices you would be prepared to pay.\nIn other words: a plan.\nWhys and wherefores \"The first thing we try to figure out is why the market is falling and the rationale – whether there's a change in fundamentals that's behind the market fall, or whether it's sentiment-driven,\" says Cheruvu\n\"You need to say, 'These are the stocks that I like and these are the prices I would enter',\" says Cheruvu. \"Sometimes you can be too early, and you need the stomach to go through that volatility if you are, and maybe be prepared to buy more – but you need to have a view.\"\nFor his part, Cheruvu says he did pick up some more of the banks this week, here and globally , but was buying a little and then waiting for prices to fall further. Instead, the market rebounded smartly on Tuesday and Wednesday, and Cheruvu lost that opportunity to pick up as much as he would have liked. So it goes – better to have picked up some than nothing at all.\nIn other words, buying in times of fear is never easy. Things can always fall further, and when headlines are telegraphing tales of imminent disaster, it takes gumption – and discipline.\nMonday's shake-out looks to have passed for now, but that's not to say it's all plain sailing from here. \"It's not the end of the volatility; these things rarely happen and go,\" Tagliaferro says.\nChina's economy continues to slow rapidly, and probably much faster than the official numbers suggest. Expect a dripfeed of bad news. There's no reason why the heavily momentum-driven Chinese sharemarket can't fall further; a repeat of the past two weeks is possible.\nCommodity prices are showing no obvious signs of regaining an upward trend. Most markets – iron ore and oil being the big ones – are oversupplied in an environment where global growth is slow and maybe slowing.\n\"The next major event is potentially going to be the Fed,\" Cheruvu says. \"That's the thing that will potentially be a game-changer and set the trend for the next few months.\n\"You will have data coming out of China, but because the picture is so murky, it's more likely to create volatility rather than a trend.\"\nCheruvu's view is that the Fed will not hike in September. He believes the Fed will weigh not moving and being wrong, and seeing inflation tick a little higher as a result, against hiking only to find, for example, that things really are worse than feared in China, and lose a lot of credibility as a result.\n\"This will be the first really big decision from [chair] Janet Yellen.\"\nMaple-Brown also wonders about the role central banks will play in the coming months and years. He points out that the \"bad news is good news\" dynamic which has been in place since the GFC – essentially the assumption that central banks will bail out investors at the first sign of trouble – may be coming to an end.\n\"It's quite a big change,\" he says. \"There's not much more central banks can do.\"\nThis is quite a \"sobering\" thought for Maple-Brown, and for many investors, as easy money and low interest rates, not earnings growth, has been the driving force behind the Australian sharemarket.\n\"Earnings growth in [fiscal] 2015 for the market as a whole has now gone negative, and we've had zero earnings growth since the GFC. Yet P/Es have gone from 10 to 15 or so, which means all the gains of the past four or five years have been through a re-rating.\"\nTagliaferro believes a good place to start is to \"look at stable stocks like Shopping Centres Australasia and AusNet, which are largely unaffected by these global economic woes and whose yields are pretty secure for the next three or four years\".\n\"Buying those stocks on a yield of close to 7 per cent is not a bad place to start.\"", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/week_that_was_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:13:47.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
