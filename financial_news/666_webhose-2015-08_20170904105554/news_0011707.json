It's just not in their DNA to speak publicly about defence issues.\"\nA defence industry source in Tokyo said the German bid was shaping up as the one to beat.\n\"There is some concern in the Japanese government,\" said another industry source in Tokyo familiar with the proposals.\nBoth sources said Japanese defence ministry officials had informally asked U.S. contractors with close ties to Japanese industry, including Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp , to advise Mitsubishi Heavy on managing its first ever bid to sell military equipment to an overseas government.\nNO SECRET DEAL\nAustralian media has reported that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe privately agreed last year that Japan would get the contract. Both sides have denied the existence of such a deal.\n\"We are not the ones to be blamed for others speculating that there may be a secret deal. So the current situation has us a little bit perplexed and confused why such speculation is still being voiced,\" Masaki Ishikawa, director general for acquisition reform at Japan's Ministry of Defence, told reporters.\nIshikawa and other Japanese officials also declined to be drawn on whether Japan would build the vessels in Australia.\nAbbott has described Japan as his country's \"closest friend in Asia\". The United States is also keen to spur friendlier ties between its two key allies in Asia.\nOfficials in Adelaide, capital of South Australia state, on Wednesday insisted on at least 70 percent local worker participation in the project.\n\"The state government, local defence industry and workers are committed to protecting Australia, by building a strong defence industry, which supports the workers in our shipyards,\" state defence minister Martin Hamilton-Smith said in a statement.\nLiberal Senator Sean Edwards - chairman of the economics committee in the upper house of Australia's parliament - said he had repeatedly conveyed to Japanese officials the political importance of pledging to build in Australia.\n\"They get it,\" he told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.\nEach of the bidders has been asked to provide three estimates: one for construction overseas, one for a partial assembly in Australia and one for a full build in an Australian shipyard.\nAn expert advisory council is expected to deliver its recommendation in November.
