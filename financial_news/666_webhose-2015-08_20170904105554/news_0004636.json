The termination is a national programme. Already some companies have decided to expand and they are going to turn around,\" he said. \nMoyo said labour was one of business' major costs, adding that utility costs also needed to be looked at to restore company viability. \nBut a local economist said companies will not be able to expand even after laying off workers because the real problem is the country's politics. \n\"Pushing volumes in this economy is difficult, hence companies are in survival mode and are putting in place tactics to break even. I don't think after the job terminations there will be any improvements,\" the economist said. \nHe said while companies were complaining about the cost of labour, the bulk of their income was being chewed by a few executives. \n\"The Salarygate scandal is a good example of how executives' salaries are bleeding companies. Another problem weighing down companies is wrong business models and the job cuts have been used to mask the incompetence of some executives,\" he said. \nZimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions president George Nkiwane said the country was focusing on wrong things and termination of jobs would not change the performance of companies. \n\"Terminations will not help in re-capacitating the companies. As a country we must focus on issues that matter. One is the liquidity crunch. No one can borrow internally or offshore and the interest rates are very high and therefore not viable for the repayments of debt,\" he said. \nNkiwane said during the Kadoma Declaration talks, country risk was pointed as the major problem due to government policy inconsistencies. \n\"There is no one who wants to invest in a country that has policy inconsistencies and where policy pronouncements are made at rallies. To me, it does not make sense that one says he is fixing the economy through retrenchments. When an economy is performing you will see by the indicator,\" he said. \nAt a meeting in August 2001, the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF) noted that it was desirable to address the totality of the macro-economic problems including the country risk factor. The TNF tasked the social partners to draft position papers on country risk factors and the points raised in these papers were distilled in the development of the Kadoma Declaration. \nLabour economist Godfrey Kanyenze said the problem was to do with the environment and focus on anything else would be wrong. \n\"Parastatals are not paying salaries and if it was just a case of wages then they should have been performing. They don't want to address structural issues,\" he said. \nAccording to the CZI 2014 Manufacturing Survey, minimum wages, restrictive labour regulations, corruption, power cuts, access to finance and utilities charges were listed as factors adversely affecting business in Zimbabwe. \nThe use of the multicurrency regime in 2009 brought hope for companies as they could now access hard currency which had been elusive in the Zimbabwe dollar era. A number of companies went on an expansion blitz without building a solid foundation. \nMany were stuck with obsolete machinery which needed to be replaced but banks were giving short-term loans at high costs. \nThe retooling that was necessary to bring down the cost of production was not undertaken. The stuttering of the economy caught companies unaware. \nEconomist John Robertson said job cuts would help companies and in the long term create jobs for the general populace. He said companies were failing to rationalise their operations because the labour laws were not flexible. \n\"After streamlining operations some companies will make profit and increase productivity and employment. The move might not increase employment immediately but if the labour market is flexible, more jobs will be created,\" Robertson said. \nIn his mid-term monetary policy review, central bank governor John Mangudya said there was need to reduce the major cost drivers to stimulate export competitiveness. \n\"In this regard, it is important to reduce major cost centres, as well as improve the availability and access to key utilities. It is envisaged that streamlining of charges by the relevant regulatory authorities will significantly impact on the costs of production, leading to a downward review of all prices in the economy, and hence improvement in competitiveness,\" Mangudya said. \nCompanies that have sent away workers include Econet Wireless, Sino Zimbabwe, Moonlight Funeral, Air Zimbabwe, Choppies Zimbabwe, Sakunda Holdings, Zuva Petroleum, Zimasco, Zimsteel Zimbabwe, Pioneer Freight, Crest Poultry Group, Steward Bank, General Engineering Private Limited, Nyadire Teachers' College, Goal Zimbabwe, TN Harlequin and Regency group of hotels.
