But a drop in the price of oil has hurt the Canadian economy. Data released on Friday showed that GDP shrank for a fifth consecutive month in May. \nFiat Chrysler Automobiles' Canadian unit extended its sales lead over Ford in July, as sales rose 2.2 percent to 28,611 vehicles. Growth in truck sales more than offset a decline in car sales, boosted in part by its Jeep brand. Jeep sales jumped 21 percent. \nFord's Canadian sales fell 6.0 percent to 27,182 vehicles, as truck sales dropped 8.2 percent from a year earlier. Chief Executive Dianne Craig said sales are \"on track with the overall business strategy.\" \nGM Canada sales dropped 4.8 percent to 22,826 vehicles as car sales dropped 12.4 percent and truck sales declined 1.9 percent. The company said sales slowed after a strong performance in June. \nToyota Canada sold 18,344 vehicles, up 1.7 percent, as a sharp increase in sales of sport utility vehicles boosted results at Lexus. Lexus sales rose 30.4 percent to 1,863 cars and trucks. \nHonda Canada sales jumped 10 percent to 17,599 vehicles. Sales rose 38.6 percent at its Acura division, boosted in part by its TLX sedan. \n(Reporting by Allison Martell; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish) Consumer Discretionary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:41:42.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
