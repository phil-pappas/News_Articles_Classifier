Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Treasurer Joe Hockey has attempted to reassure nervous investors fearing another day of market carnage, saying the over-$60 billion wiped from the market was a correction not a crisis.\nThe Australian sharemarket suffered its worst day of losses since the global financial crisis on Monday; the ASX200 finished down 4.1 per cent, slammed f urther by sharp losses on the Shanghai composite index .\nThe mood was repeated on US and European markets; London's FTSE was down more than 3 per cent .\nBut on Tuesday, Treasurer Joe Hockey fronted breakfast TV to push for calm, saying \"there is no crisis, it is a correction\" and he was meeting with G20 finance ministers and central bank governors next week \"to deal with these sorts of issues\".\nMr Hockey told the Nine Network he had faith in the economy, arguing the global economy is in better shape today than it was 12 months ago.\n\"I'm absolutely confident that the fundamentals of the Australian economy and the global economy are still good, are still good. Without doubt that is the situation,\" he said.\nMr Hockey urged investors to look to strengths such as soft commodities, saying \"beef the prices are literally through the roof\".\nThe move follows that of White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, overnight who told reporters the US economy is strong, adding officials were continuing to urge China to commit to financial reforms.\nMr Hockey said the Australian banking system is in very good shape, China still has a \"massive economy\" and its fundamentals were strong.\n Asked whether the losses would impact superannuation, and he said it depends on the nature of the super investment.\nThe ASX is expected to plunge heavily when it opens on Tuesday, and market analysts have said volatility will persist until better data or strong policy action on monetary easing emerges.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/us-stocks-plunge-as-market-upheaval-grows-20150824-gj6s1m.html", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-25T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T03:04:16.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
