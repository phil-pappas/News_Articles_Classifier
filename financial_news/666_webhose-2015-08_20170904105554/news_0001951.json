No. Clearly, the ghosts of former EWSA are still haunting the newly created water and electricity agencies. \nAnd if what I am averring about is news to you, please kindly tell me where you live so I shift immediately. \nThree months ago, I interviewed Mr. James Sano, Wasac's Managing Director, yesterday, I briefly played the recording of him making a lot of promises, in one of them, he was telling me water scarcity in Kigali would be history soon, to be exact, by August. Well, here we're. \nBut inconsistent water supply aside, tell me, when was the last time you watched a full news bulletin without being interrupted by electricity blinks? \nFor some weeks now, I have noticed this behavior in electricity supply; you can't call it load shading, no, it's something else. \nHow would you describe a situation where power goes and comes back, almost instantly, in most cases, just after a minute or less and this happens like five times within an hour? \nWith these satellite decoders, it takes about five minutes for it to scan and re-start which costs you an entire news bulletin. It happened a week ago as I watched a very interesting markets analysis on Bloomberg channel. \nI got so mad that I telephoned REG MD Jean-Bosco Mugiraneza; like the case most times, he didn't pick up so I sent him a message explaining exactly my source of frustration. \nHe responded immediately, with a terse line, 'give me your location' which I did. It's been a few days now and I haven't experienced the annoying blinks; they're now longer, almost fit to be described as load shading. \nIt's against this backdrop that the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Authority (RURA) came out on Thursday not to apologise for the annoying services but to instead announce an increase in the existing tariffs for both water and electricity. \nEffective September 1, to stay connected to both unsteady services, tariffs for consumers of low voltage electricity will increase by 35 percent to Rwf182 per kilowatt; this category includes everyone with electricity at home. \nIndustrial tariffs were unchanged at Rwf126; so where electricity is a factor of production, one pays less but where it's a basic necessity, as a source of energy in homes, you pay more. As for water, a 19 percent tariff hike was announced effective next month. \nMany people I have talked to about the new tariffs told me they're less concerned with the price but more interested in knowing whether the increment will also lead to reliable service for both utilities. \nI certainly concur because as you would, am sure, agree, life in urban domiciles literally stops when there's no water or power supply; on one hand, you can't flush the toilet while on the other, perishable foods are wasting away in the fridge for lack of electricity. \nFollow @KenAgutamba", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:26:35.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
