European stocks extend drop after U.S. inflation data Reuters - UK Focus â€“ 12 minutes ago \n* FTSEurofirst 300, Euro STOXX 50 down 1.2 pct \n* Worst day in 4 years for Carlsberg (Other OTC: CABGY - news ) \n* Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) also down after earnings drop \n* Fed minutes due at 1800 GMT \n* Europe bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \n* Asset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v (Adds U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . data reaction) \nBy Sudip Kar-Gupta \nLONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) - European stock markets fell on Wednesday, extending a recent losing streak after U.S. inflation data supported expectations of a rate rise, while brewer Carlsberg slumped after cutting its outlook. \nNews (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) that German lawmakers had voted to back a third bailout for Greece had little positive effect, with the focus firmly on fears of a fresh slowdown for the global economy as China battles with plunging exports and white-knuckle stock-market moves. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which has just suffered its worst week in more than a month, was down 1.2 percent at 1435 GMT. The euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index was also down 1.2 percent. \nCarlsberg was the worst performer on the FTSEurofirst, falling 10 percent after cutting its profit forecast. The stock was set to mark its worst one-day fall in four years. \nMiner and commodities trader Glencore sank to an all-time low after profits fell on a slide in metal and oil prices. The company said capital spending next year was expected to be lower than this year. \nWorries about China have come to eclipse those about Greece's debt problems in recent weeks, with China's devaluation of its yuan currency last week adding to investors' unease about the state of the Chinese economy. \nWith price-to-earnings multiples for European equities well above their historical averages, growth fears are making a dent. \n\"I would struggle to get enthused with the valuations one is being asked to pay in developed-market equity,\" said Nick Lawson (Other OTC: LWSOF - news ) , Managing Director at Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) , in a note to clients. \n\"There is nothing ... that attracts me to the equity market at present except equity (dividend) yield.\" \nChinese stocks reversed sharp declines and ended higher on Wednesday after the central bank injected more funds into the financial system for a second day in a bid to calm panicky markets. \n\"While there is continuing concern that the current slowdown seen in Chinese economic growth might be spreading across the region, it also seems that a lack of confidence that the Chinese government and People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) will take sufficient measures to turn things around are hurting stocks,\" said Peregrine & Black senior sales trader Markus Huber. \nU.S. consumer prices rose only slightly in July but a solid increase in the cost of shelter suggested inflation was probably stabilising enough to support an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve this year. \nThe FTSEurofirst and Euro STOXX 50 both remain up by around 10 percent since the start of 2015, helped in part by economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB). \nHowever, they also both remain nearly 10 percent below their peaks for 2015, reached in April, because of worries about the global economy. \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Kevin Liffey and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:03:38.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
