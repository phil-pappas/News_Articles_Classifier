IDC now expects worldwide PC growth to fall by nearly 9% in 2015 and \"not stabilize until 2017,\" which would mark five straight years of deceleration. It expects the commercial market to lead a broader PC recovery starting in 2017, but expects volume declines within the consumer sector to continue through 2019. Separately, IDC forecast a bigger-than-expected deceleration in tablet sales of 8% in 2015, compared with its previous outlook of a 4% decline. Both Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +2.55% iOS and Microsoft's Windows are expected to gain market share over the next few years, while Google Inc.'s GOOGL, +4.16% GOOG, +4.20% is expected to decline slightly, according to IDC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T18:24:24.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
