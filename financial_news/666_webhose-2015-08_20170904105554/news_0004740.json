View all 15 photos \nCHICAGO, IL – This weekend, many Chicagoans got an early start stirring about the city running errands, while others took advantage of getting extra sleep that only weekends afford them. A faithful group of business hopefuls and established small business owners converged in Englewood Saturday, August 15 to attend the Idea to Launch business workshop, an event that promised to awaken the daydreaming inventor and business owner to action. \nVeteran entrepreneurs Kenneth Coe, founder and CEO of Business Birth and The Urban Genius Foundation, along with Donna Beasley, entrepreneur and digital publisher, led the workshop devoted to anyone with a creative business idea but not sure how to get it to market. Coe and Beasley provided standard to advanced insights and resources to help entrepreneurs from “idea to launch.” \nBusiness Birth and The Urban Genius Foundation Business Birth provides entrepreneurs with expertise in the pre-startup space to build “ideas to launch” products and services, as well as invention market strategies. The Urban Genius Foundation is a multi-faceted, done-for-you platform made up of a plethora of financial, technical, media, manufacturing, legal and marketing resources for entrepreneurs to make their dreams a reality. Coe is charged with the task of raising $10M dollars in donations for the organization, to fund minority entrepreneurs and highlight urban genius in underserved communities. Their publication – Urban Genius Magazine – is available in print, as well as digital download. The publication features case studies, as well as the successful launches of their client base. The Urban Genius Foundation is scheduled to introduce UTV (Urban Genius Television) in September. UTV will also feature the successes and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the launches of their clients. \nStraight out of Englewood Englewood Blue , housed on the fourth floor of Englewood's US Bank Building, located at 815 West 63rd Street, Chicago, IL 60621, is part of BLUE1647 – a long-standing reputable entrepreneurship and technology innovation center located at 1647 South Blue Island Avenue, Chicago, IL 60608 – that fosters economic development in technology and 21st Century skills through classes, technology-focused workshops and events, workforce development (through youth and adult technology programs to prepare individuals for high-demand jobs) and Business Acceleration (through shared co-working services). Both are part of the Greater Englewood Community Development Corporation, an initiative created for the very purpose of bringing business enterprises back into the Englewood community. \nEnglewood Blue hosted Saturday's 'Idea to Launch' business workshop and is just a fraction of BLUE1647’s long-term answer to providing a complete overhaul to the tech and economic viability desert that was once Englewood. This accelerator provides members with office and meeting space, customized business coaching from experts from a resource pool. Members also have access to weekly workshops, seminars and trainings including Cisco Network Academy, Microsoft IT Academy and Accenture for Entrepreneurs. Other small business advantages are access to office printing services, complimentary Wi-Fi, as well as access to other office amenities. \nChicago’s south Roseland community has two incubator openings pending and St. Louis, MO has a location opening pending. \nThree signature components Digital publisher and veteran entrepreneur Donna Beasley, founder of Romance Travel Magazine and KaZoom Publishing , outlined Business Birth’s sales methodology that promises to lead small brands from being virtually unknown to premium seating within their respective marketplace: Idea to launch: seven steps, none of which are instructional, but action-focused Image communications: branding: business name, identity, clear communications: experience, resources Product development: from inception to prototype to market; e.g., assistance with obtaining provisional patents which includes designs and specs. \nSuccess can’t be achieved without motivation, so Business Birth walks clients through the Four C’s of Motivation : Creativity: leaving an indelible legacy Control: crafting your own destiny Challenge: being a problem-solver Cash: necessary capital \nFurther discussions from the panelists covered ground from how both aspiring and established entrepreneurs can clarify their core message, make and market prototypes, gain understanding of their target markets, as well as understanding the importance of having air-tight sales and marketing strategies and a business plan. Knowing which platforms goods and services will be delivered (e-commerce, apps, shipping); how necessary tasks will be funded, as well as deciding the appropriate legal structure and state-relative licensing requirements were also covered. \nMinimum viable product and “mental lottery tickets” From Business Birth’s mission statement, to their unique selling proposition (“saving you time and money from ‘Idea to Launching’ your business”), they believe in keeping things simple. Even their lean startup philosophy is to-the-point: “Keep your day job.” Workshop attendees were presented with questions to get them thinking how to approach the marketability and functionality of their own goods and services, as well as the importance of maintaining their day jobs to ensure their goals are reached. \n“The days of business plans being written down on a napkin are long gone,” Coe said. \n“Business concepts have gone from being outlined on napkins to outright business plans, to ‘Frankenstein’ prototypes to actual market-ready products,” Coe cited when discussing how laborious achieving both funding and success have become over time. \n“I know. Somebody may hate their job or their boss and be all too excited about having a great business idea or venture. In your mind, you may feel like you have this magical lottery ticket that will alleviate you from all of your problems. Whatever you do, don’t quit your day jobs.” \nManufacturing (mass production), raising capital (pitch decks vs. business plans; loans vs. crowdfunding) and marketing plans (deciding upon and researching target market) were the latter focus points of the workshop, with the funding portion served heavily with caveats: \n“There’s a risk associated launching any business venture,” Coe said, with Beasley echoing the sentiment when answering a question from one attendee whose business line of credit was a casualty of the 2008 economic collapse. \nChoose your launch Business Birth provides two done-for-you membership service packages for entrepreneurs to launch: \nThe Idea Plan Define your idea action strategy Define your idea plan objectives Define funding goals Prioritize your idea plan Initiatives Define your idea plan to launch roadmap \nOr, \nThe Idea Plan in Action Help turn your Idea into an invention, product or service Funding strategy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T14:20:44.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
