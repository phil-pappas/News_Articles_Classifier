He disclosed that Melcom Care Foundation had institutionalized blood donation as an annual bleeding exercise and that in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the bleeding exercises yielded 435 pints, 639 pints and 824 pints of blood, respectively. \nHe said the Foundation was set up to reach out and meet needs across board, from children in need to medical care and education support through a well-managed scholarship scheme from primary to the tertiary level of education and expressed the hope that the donation would go a long way to enhance the relationship between Melcom Group and the various hospitals. \nPresent at the ceremony was the Deputy Minister for Health, Dr. Victor Kampoe, who expressed appreciation to the Foundation for the donations, and pledged government's commitment to working with organizations like the Melcom Group. \nAlso present at the ceremony was a representative of the National Blood Service, Dr Justina Ansah, who also thanked the Foundation for the kind gesture over the years and appealed to other organizations to emulate their example by donating blood to save lives. \nThe donation formed part of activities marking the birthday of Mrs Sheila Khubchandani, wife of the Chairman of Melcom Group. \nLast year, the Foundation donated an ambulance to the 37 Military Hospital to commemorate the birthday of the Chairman of Melcom Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:36:08.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
