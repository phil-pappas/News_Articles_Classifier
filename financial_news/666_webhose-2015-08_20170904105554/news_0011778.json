On Tuesday the central bank injected 150 billion yuan ($A32.5 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity. \nBut dealers said the failure to launch the new monetary easing measures, which the market had been hoping for, had knocked confidence. \n\"That shows to investors around the world the Chinese are running out of room in terms of being able to support the market,\" Ankur Patel, chief investment officer at R-Squared Macro Management, told Bloomberg News. \nThe US dollar remained weak at Y119.15, up from Y118.51 in New York trade Monday but dramatically weaker than Y122.06 seen in US trading on Friday. \nThe euro stood at $US1.1550 and Y138.10 in Tokyo compared with $US1.1606 and Y137.55 in New York overnight. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for October delivery was trading at $US38.97 after closing at $US38.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its first below-$US40 close since February 2009. \nBrent North Sea crude for October, the international benchmark, was at $US43.43 a barrel after closing at $US43.04 a barrel in London, its lowest level since March 2009. \nGold traded at $US1,150.75 compared with $US1,154.00 late Monday. \nIn other markets: \n- Taipei added 3.58 per cent, or 265.30 points, to 7,675.64. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co rose 7.39 per cent to Tw$123.50 while Hon Hai Precision advanced 4.17 per cent to Tw$85.0. \n- Wellington added 0.11 per cent, or 5.98 points, to 5,613.29. \nContact Energy rose 2.70 per cent to NZ$5.32 and Air New Zealand was down 0.75 per cent to NZ$2.65. \n- Manila rose 0.58 per cent, or 39.33 points, to 6,830.34 although trading was suspended for much of the day due to technical problems. \nAyala Land was down 0.74 per cent to 33.50 pesos, Universal Robina was unchanged at 180 pesos and BDO Unibank was down 0.95 per cent at 94.10 pesos. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T14:45:41.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
