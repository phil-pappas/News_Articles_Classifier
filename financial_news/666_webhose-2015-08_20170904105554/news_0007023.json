Illustration: David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd When James Packer this week stepped down as chairman of Crown Resorts and signalled his intention to take a $10 million pay packet as an executive director, he busted another Packer family tradition.\nHis late father Kerry did not take any salary from Consolidated Press Holdings, which remains the holding company for James Packer's diverse array of assets, worth about $6 billion.\nA pattern is developing here. Kerry Packer's passion was running the Nine Network. His intuitive brilliance for knowing the tastes of Australian viewers meant Nine was consistently No. 1 in the ratings.\nBut James abandoned that much-loved asset in 2006 with one of the most astute deals in the Australian media over the past 20 years. He sold Nine Network to private equity for $5.6 billion.\nHe capped that off in 2012 with the $2 billion sale of Consolidated Media to News Corp. It gave the Murdoch family full control of Fox Sports and half of Foxtel.\nHowever, Packer has not completely turned his back on his father's playbook. Kerry used to bet big in Las Vegas and now James is doing the same. In fact, one of the main reasons he is going to be spending more time overseas, splitting his time between Israel and the US, is because of the $1 billion investment in a new integrated resort called Alon Las Vegas.\nPacker wants to transform a 14-hectare vacant site in Las Vegas into the world's best and most exclusive casino and entertainment centre, including a six-star Crown Resorts hotel. The other driving force behind Packer heading offshore and spending less time in Australia is managing his burgeoning interests in technology and film.\nHe is a major investor in the technology investment firm Square Peg. Also, he has his own tech investments in Israel and Silicon Valley, including a cyber security company in partnership with former Israeli intelligence officer Arnon Milchan.\n Chanticleer understands Packer has even made a cyber security pitch to Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive Ian Narev. Packer's private and public interests have been intersecting in recent times, to the advantage of both parties. This week, Crown Resorts announced it would buy a 50 per cent interest in part of the Packer family property and operations at Ellerston in the Hunter Valley for $60 million.\nThe gaming company has bought a 1400-hectare site with luxury accommodation, a golf course, a go-cart track, cinema and several swimming pools.\nKerry Packer used to race his Consolidated Press staff around the go-cart track. Legend has it that Kerry's cart had a more powerful motor than those of his employees. Either way, it was not worth beating the boss as it caused too much angst.\nIt is not all plain sailing for Packer. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the $US2.3 billion Studio City resort in Cotai, Macau, owned by Melco Crown, which is one-third owned by Crown Resorts.\nIt is due to open on October 27, but Melco Crown still does not know how many gaming tables it will be allowed to include in the building. The market believes 400 tables would make it a profitable business. but the last new casino opened in Macau got approval for only 150 tables. All Macau's casinos are suffering from a slump in Chinese visitors. Melco Crown said this week the rate of decline in gross gaming revenue in Macau accelerated from 26.8 per cent in the first half to 37 per cent in the six months to June.\nThe decision on the allocation of gaming tables to Studio City coincides with a review by the Macau government and Beijing of Macau's sustainable economic future.\nA Chinese official told Chanticleer that gaming cannot be used as a sustainable approach to support the city and it needs to develop other revenue streams. One possibility is to copy Las Vegas and become an exhibition economy. However, Macau's long-term future is bright. It is closer to China than Taiwan or Hong Kong and is likely to be an important part of China's $US1 trillion \"One Belt One Road\" infrastructure investment initiative.\nExtraordinary Financial Times When Japan's privately owned Nikkei media group paid £844 million for the Financial Times , it sent shockwaves through the media world. The Japanese paid about 2.5 times revenue and about 36 times earnings before interest and tax. Chanticleer reckons this is an extremely smart deal by the Japanese. They have used their virtually zero cost of capital to buy one of the two global business news and information brands. The other, of course, is The Wall Street Journal , which is owned by News Corp.\nTo some extent, the Nikkei purchase is a currency play. The Japanese yen is set for long-term depreciation. The Japanese have shorted the yen while buying an asset that is yet to be optimised.\nAbove all, the Japanese have bought a product that has become essential reading for professionals in financial markets. This core financial markets audience, which is a large proportion of the 737,000 circulation (print of 515,900 and digital 221,100), is largely immune to regular price rises. Relative to other financial news and information products, the FT – at $239 a year for a digital subscription – is cheap. Bloomberg charges about $US35,000 a year for a terminal.\nInvestment doyen Warren Buffett once said that if you gave him $1 billion to buy The Wall Street Journal , he would give the money back. It was a comment that highlighted the depth of the moat surrounding quality business journalism. That remains true today.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/tonyboydafr", "https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-14T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:09:49.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
