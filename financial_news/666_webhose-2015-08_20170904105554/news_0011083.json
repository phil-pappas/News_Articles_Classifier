Where the standard tariff is more expensive than the current deal, households will see an average 8.14% or £90 increase to their annual bills if they fail to shop around and switch to a cheaper supplier.\nFor households in the Norweb region, which includes Manchester, the effect of their fixed tariff coming to an end looks particularly pricey. Customers there who are on the First Utility iSave fixed August 2015 v23 tariff could be hit with a huge £317 (24%) rise when they are switched to the standard tariff.\nEDF customers on its popular Blue+ price promise August 2015 tariff will see a typical increase of £105 a year – or 10% – if they do nothing.\nImpact of tariffs coming to an end on Monday 31 August. Source: Gocompare However, it is not all bad news: customers on the British Gas Fix & Control August 2015 and Fix & Reward August 2015 tariffs, as well as those on the Sainsbury’s Energy Fix & Reward August 2015 tariff will see their bills drop by an average £58 (4.8%). They have effectively been overpaying on those fixed deals. British Gas customers in particular can get a much cheaper deal by leaving the company.\nCaroline Lloyd, energy spokeswoman at Gocompare.com, says: “For a number of years now fixed tariffs have proved popular, due to the fact they have tended to be the most competitively priced deals. Make no mistake – standard tariffs do not represent good value. There are always other tariffs, whether fixed or variable, that will provide better prices.”\nThree suppliers, GB Energy, extraenergy and First Utility, offer fixed gas and electricity tariffs that come in at less than £900 a year for an average house. Ovo Energy’s better energy fixed (all online) deal at £918 is the Guardian Money pick at the moment, largely because it has a proven customer service record.\n• Households should always check which is the best deal for them.
