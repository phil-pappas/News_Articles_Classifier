This year the festival falls on August 22, 2015.\nThe name Bonderam originates from ‘Bandeira’ – the Portuguese word for flag. During the Portuguese rule there were frequent disputes between the villagers on the Divar island over property issues. Thus the Portuguese introduced a system by putting up flags to demarcate the boundaries.\nBonderam Flags\nThe otherwise laidback island of Divar comes alive on the day of the Bonderam festival. The day begins with a Flag Parade from the main Divar junction, which is accompanied by a Brass Band. After this the Bonderam festival is officially declared open. Later in the day there is a fancy dress competition followed by the traditional float parade and a live musical performance featuring the famous music bands of Goa. The festival begins close to noon and concludes late in the evening.\n 12, 2015 5:24 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:00:42.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
