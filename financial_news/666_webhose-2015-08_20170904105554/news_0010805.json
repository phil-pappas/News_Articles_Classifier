An Internet-based startup boom in the country has also seen increased adaptability on smartphones, bolstering the demand for high-speed data. \n4G services typically make it much faster than 3G services to surf the web on mobile phones, tablets and laptops. \n(Reporting by Nivedita Bhattacharjee in Mumbai; Editing by Anand Basu)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T15:05:02.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
