We want to take (the turnover) much higher to Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in next 5-7 year period,” Ghose said.\nDuring the April-June quarter, company’s finance cost increased to Rs 113.58 crore from Rs 103.44 crore in the same quarter in the previous fiscal.\nTata Chemicals, part of over USD 100 billion Tata Group, is world’s second largest producer of soda ash with manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. Besides chemicals, the company also manufactures chemicals, fertiliser, salt, pulses, besan and spices.\n 05, 2015 9:22 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:34:24.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
