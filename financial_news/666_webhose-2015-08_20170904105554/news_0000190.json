But again, that is only an inkling, not conclusive. Facebook is so narrow a path to arrive at a conclusion on one's character. \nJamie \nThere's a saying, what we say reflects what is inside us; our true character. Social media is where true colours come out to play. All one has to do is read between the lines. \nThere's a false sense of security some people get when they are hiding behind a screen. They think they can then say or post whatever pops into their heads. There are men who will clearly show their positions on child abuse, spousal abuse, their indecision on a political candidate or even the issue of privacy where relationships are concerned. \nThis they can do even without spelling out the words. It is not for nothing that intelligence gathering organisations celebrate the introduction of social media. \nEugene Mugisha \nThis is another trick question kabisa. In regards to men, social media is a medium for creating a personality that they would wish to be, but are not in real life. Most of the men who are very loud on social media are actually introverts, and well, let me say not that bold in real life. But, on social media, they create a personality that is quite formidable. \nWe who know the guy wonder, 'what happened to that fella, he used to be such a chicken!'. And he still is, just that with Facebook, he can pretend to be what he is not. Okay, that is too harsh, no offence intended. \nJamie \nYou know, Eugene, that's so true. I know a guy who's so quiet in real life, hampered by an auditory problem which makes conversation in groups hard for him. On social media, he rules. \nBenjie \nI have always argued that in reality, people are who they are even on social media - just that they would not had the chance and circumstances to discover those traits about themselves. If someone is a bully, flirt, vile and vain, show off or whatever, it will occasionally come out. \nYou could post inspirational quotes and verses to disguise who you are or paint a picture of who you want to be but if someone were to pay attention, they would notice the sort of stuff you are into. So in all honesty, whoever you are online, given the same surroundings offline, you would be the same. \nOf course, there is the keyboard warriors who will blast anything and anyone because they are protected by the \"anonymity\" but even those, if in real, it is what they really feel but are just cowards. \nAndrew Wallace \nI think our social media behaviour mimics how we really feel and behave in real-life. People will only post and say things that have actually been on their minds. Its only in rare cases that one posts something totally out of their trend of thought. It is fast becoming a psychology playground for all of us (both Men & Women). So if you want to know your man's real 'colours', just take some time and analyse his facebook wall. It won't defer much from who he really is offline. \nIf he is the type that posts selfies all the time, my new this... my new that, chances are you're dealing with an attention seeker with an inflated strong sense of uniqueness and superiority... a narcissist! You don't need a specialist to tell you this. \nThe guys \nJamie, the realist: 36. Married, father of two. \nIvan Okuda: 21, at University. \nBenjie: 27, single \nEugene Mugisha: 29, the dating guru. \nAndrew Wallace: 30, recently married.
