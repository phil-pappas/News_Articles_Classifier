Contagious, with a market capitalisation of 18 million Canadian dollars (£8.9m), is much smaller than Sportech, which was valued at £143.6m on Friday night. \nThe British company, which also runs sports bars in Connecticut and provides betting technology to the horse-racing industry, is engaged a long-running £97m battle with the taxman over VAT on its Spot the Ball game, with a Court of Appeal hearing on the matter scheduled for November. \nIf the company wins its fight with HM Revenue & Customs and Contagious takes Sportech over, its shareholders will receive about half of the money and the rest will go to its new Canadian owner. \nHowever, Sportech warned its investors that there are a number of obstacles to overcome before a deal with the smaller firm is completed. \n“The proposal is subject to due diligence, Contagious Gaming raising suitable financing and… receiving a significant level of support for the proposal from Sportech shareholders,” it said. \nThere is also the possibility of a counterbid. In May, Sportech confirmed it has received an approach for the football pools business from an unidentified buyer, which it rejected for being too low. It is understood that the suitor for pools business was not Contagious. \nThe first football pools coupons were sold in 1923 by Littlewoods, which was followed by Vernons two years later and Zetters in 1933. Sportech went on to buy all three and rebranded them as The Football Pools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:02:57.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
