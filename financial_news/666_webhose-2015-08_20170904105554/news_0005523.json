Peter Braig by Trevor Hoey After last Friday's fall of more than approximately 130 points in the S&P/ASX 200 index and a substantial decline on Wednesday the index is now sitting nearly 3 per cent lower than where it was when I compiled my portfolio as at January 30.\nWhile stocks in the portfolio haven't been immune to the sell-off, the overall decline of 2.4 per cent sees me slightly outperforming the index.\nThe biggest mover in my portfolio over the last week has been Greencross, a group that had been sold down substantially over the last six months after a slight earnings downgrade and indications from some analysts that the integration of substantial acquisitions could bring the company unstuck in fiscal 2015.\nHowever, as I have mentioned a number of times in previous months I was confident regarding the long-term outlook for the group given substantial consolidation opportunities in a highly fragmented industry. Furthermore, management's decision to build on its vertically integrated business model appeared strategically sound.\nThe likes of pet food and animal care have very similar defensive qualities to groceries for human consumption and essential health services. The group's entry into the pet food and goods industry through the City Farmers acquisition and its subsequent expansion of the Petbarn retail arm provides another revenue stream as well as increasing the company's defensive qualities.\nAll of these factors and more underpinned the quality full-year result released on Tuesday which saw the group's shares open at $6.96, representing a 16.4 per cent increase on the previous day's closing price of $5.98. They subsequently traded as high as $7.25 on Wednesday, but there was some retracement as the broader market sell-off took its toll.\nWhile some bottom fishers may have managed to buy into Greencross around its 12 month low of $5.00, there is still potential upside at current levels. Analysts at Macquarie noted the headline numbers were all largely in line with its forecasts and that the group had maintained good momentum since the last update.\nThe broker values Greencross at $8.60 on a discounted cash flow basis and has set its 12 month price target at $7.60. Macquarie highlighted Greencross was trading at a discount to the market and peers with a far better than average growth outlook.\n Consequently, an outperform recommendation was maintained with the broker forecasting a net profit of $44.9 million in fiscal 2016, representing earnings per share of 39.7 cents.\nBased on these metrics, Macquarie's price target of $7.50 implies a price-earnings multiple of 19 which appears appropriate given forecast compound annual earnings per share growth over the next three years is in the order of 15 per cent.\nThe company appears to have started fiscal 2016 well with revenue growth of 19 per cent achieved in the first five weeks and like-for-like sales growth of 6.2 per cent. Management said the strong margins achieved in fiscal 2015 had been maintained.\nThe last 12 months has been a transformational period for Greencross, but one in which it had to invest heavily in order to position itself as a more vertically integrated operation with a strengthened market share. This impacted operating cash flow which fell from $24 million in fiscal 2014 to $14.7 million.\nAs at June 30 Greencross had net debt of $234 million, slightly below Macquarie's expectations of $239 million. The group's current leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) of 2.5 times reflects the rapid expansion during 2015.\nManagement expects the company's underlying cashflow conversion rate will improve in fiscal 2016 as it returns to traditional levels of growth related investment, with the prospect of moving towards self-funded expansion.\nGreencross expects to open 20 new retail stores in fiscal 2016 and to date it has opened five stores and secured 14 leases. The group is also targeting 12 co-located clinics, an important factor in terms of creating cross selling opportunities.\nVet acquisitions could be more measured in fiscal 2016 with management targeting $20 million in annualised revenue from the addition of new practices.\nOver the next 12 months the group will benefit from the 35 per cent increase in outlet numbers achieved in fiscal 2015. Not only will a full-year contribution from these extra outlets boost revenues, but there should also be evidence of improved margins as Greencross takes advantage of increased scale, buying power and supply chain efficiencies.\nThe key factor to keep in mind is that while Greencross is the largest of the consolidators in the veterinary practice industry, its market share is less than 10 per cent. This leaves substantial scope to achieve the group's target of expanding its position to 20 per cent.\nTake into account the fact that the value of the addressable market is estimated to be $9 billion, increasing at a rate of 4 per cent per annum and you get a real feel for the opportunities that lie ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:05:02.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
