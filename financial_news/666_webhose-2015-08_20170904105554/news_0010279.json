It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) added almost £6m to its position in Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) . The firm, the world’s biggest fund manager remains a major investor in all three. \nAxa (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) , meanwhile, sold off a third of its holding in BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , one of the world’s biggest miners, which has suffered as commodity prices have fallen on worries that Chinese consumption was slowing. \nUBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) sold BHP shares worth almost £30m, while adding to its stake in the rival miner Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) . \nThe dangers of a slowdown in the Chinese economy have made themselves apparent to British manufacturers, one in 10 of which is reviewing business plans as a result, the industry body EEF said. \nA poll of 284 companies by EEF found that 47pc are concerned about China’s prospects, against 30pc who are nervous about Russia’s economic woes. The EEF pointed out that almost one in six road vehicles exported from Britain make their way to China. \nAs volatility in the financial markets spiked to levels last seen during the eurozone debt crisis, some blamed computer-driven trading programs for amplifying the movements in prices. \nNigel Brahams, a partner in financial services and markets at the law firm Fox Williams, said: “High frequency trading doesn’t ultimately change the direction of the market but it accelerates and exaggerates it. With less people in the market in August, it takes fewer of them to move the market.” \nThe week ended with the FTSE 100 closing 60 points above the previous week, leaving some traders to suggest the rush to sell had been overdone. Others are bracing themselves for a more pronounced fall in the value of shares in the near future. \nMr Fitzgerald said: “We’ve had the third longest period in the last 90 years without at least a 10pc correction in the US equity markets. Investors have become a little bit immune to volatility. It’s [caused by] a bit of quantitative easing and a bit of machines running trades, and a group of investors who have not been through a correction.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T23:14:57.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
