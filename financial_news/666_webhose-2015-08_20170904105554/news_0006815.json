So keep watching,\" Ms Lawson said. \nCURRENCY SNAPSHOT AT 0700 AEST ON THURSDAY \nOne Australian dollar buys: \n* 73.76 US cents, from 72.62 cents on Wednesday \n* 91.62 Japanese yen, from 90.61 yen \n* 66.11 euro cents, from 65.53 euro cents \n* 111.42 New Zealand cents, from 111.24 NZ cents \n* 47.25 British pence, from 46.62 pence \n(*Currency closes taken at 1700 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T02:22:45.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
