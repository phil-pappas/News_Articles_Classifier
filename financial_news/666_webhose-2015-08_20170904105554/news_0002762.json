(Nasdaq: EQIX), the global interconnection and data center company, has announced the roll-out of phase two to expand its data center in Singapore. \nThe data center, known as SG3, already boasts 1,000 cabinets, which house the company’s high-performance, low latency computer systems, components and equipment. The data center allows companies to collaborate via secure, reliable and internetworked connections. \nThe second phase would see the expansion of the company’s largest data center in Asia-Pacific, adding another 2,000 cabinets, bringing its total operational capacity to 3,000 cabinets. This brings Equinix’s total investment in Singapore to over $350 million thus far. \nDedicated fibre networks connect SG3 with three data center facilities located in close proximity. The firm expects that the expansion of SG3 will provide increased capacity and network opportunities for new companies to join in and gain direct access to SG1, which is Singapore’s most network-dense data center. \nWith a gross floor area of approximately 385,000 square feet, the long-term plan for SG3 envisages up to 5,000 cabinets at full-build. \nWhile the data center company indicates that most of the rising demand for interconnection services stems from Cloud and IT service providers, Singapore remains a global financial hub. The data center facility therefore caters to capital markets and the associated electronic trading ecosystem. Indeed, the company’s facilities host a robust collection of interconnected execution venues and trading platforms, market data vendors, service providers, and buy-side and sell-side firms. \nSince March, Equinix has opened five new data centers across four continents with locations in New York, Singapore, Melbourne, London and Toronto. \nCommenting on the second phase expansion of SG3, Clement Goh, Managing Director at Equinix South Asia, said: “We hope to support Singapore’s vision [to become a Smart Nation] by providing our customers with direct access to established business ecosystems … SG3 phase two was launched to help companies ensure that they are in a solid position to support their customers’ needs.” Got a news tip?
