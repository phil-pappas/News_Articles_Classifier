Alex Ellinghausen by Alan Mitchell If the Abbott government manages to do everything recommended so far by the Productivity Commission , it will achieve an important improvement in the job- and income-generating capacity of the labour market.\nNevertheless, the commission's review of workplace relations has been criticised for not exploring fully the logic of more comprehensive industrial relations reform.\nThe commission, which began its 1000-page draft report with the observation that \"labour is not just an ordinary input\", seems to have largely accepted and worked within the existing paradigm.\n\"There is a strong policy rationale that the regulation of labour markets should continue to be separated from the regulation of other markets for goods and services,\" it says.\n\"There is a human dimension to labour that means that the market for labour does not always operate in the same way as markets for goods and services. The outcomes of labour markets (unlike those of most goods and service markets) are not just about economic performance; they also involve ethical and social considerations.\"\nYet there remains a question of whether the industrial relations system provides the best avenue for achieving society's objectives.\nLabour markets might be different to other goods and services markets, but they have some important features in common. For example, if we set the price of unskilled labour above its market-clearing rate, the eventual result is likely to be increased unemployment of unskilled workers.\nOnly such anti-competitive devices as statutory minimum wages, union-inspired restrictions on the use of cheaper contract labour, or organised resistance to investment in labour-saving capital are likely to sustain such an arrangement.\n Interventions have costs But those interventions have costs: the gains of the employed unskilled will be achieved at the expense of the unemployed.\nWhen, in 1907, an arbitration court judge set wages at the Melbourne Sunshine Harvester factory according to the cost of living for a worker and his family, there was no alternative social safety net. Nor was there a taxation system capable of supporting one. Federal and state taxes together amounted to only about 5 per cent of gross domestic product.\nBut there is a highly sophisticated system of government taxation and transfer payments in place now.\nA former Productivity Commission chairman, Gary Banks, argued that proponents of anti-competitive labour market regulation \"should be required to demonstrate that there are public interest benefits that exceed the economic costs, and that such benefits to society could not be achieved in more cost-effective ways\".\n\"This is not saying that regulation should never favour fairness over productivity in the workplace, only that the justification for this needs to be transparently tested,\" Banks argued.\nIt's hard to see the flaw in Banks' argument. If the benefits of intervention exceed the costs, and there is no better way of achieving the community's objectives, then the regulation should stay. But if not, governments should explore the alternatives.\nThat is no more than the decision ruling that both sides of politics agree should apply to government regulation in general.\nYet the net cost of Australia's complex system of internationally high minimum wages almost certainly exceeds that of redistributing income via the tax-transfer system.\nNet cost Indeed, the net cost of some award conditions would be greater than that of doing nothing.\nEmployers, be they coffee shop owners, hair dressers, retailers or manufacturers, will keep hiring workers and expanding their output as long as it is profitable to do so. Setting artificially high minimum wages and conditions for the least-productive labour effectively lowers the point at which further hiring becomes unprofitable.\nWhere the jobs lost are, in effect, training positions for unskilled workers – youth, women, migrants and retrenched older males – who are struggling to find their footing in the labour market, the long-term cost to society can be well in excess of the wages involved.\nThere is of course an important practical difference between policy reform and clean-sheet policy design.\nWith the Howard government's WorkChoices rejected by voters in 2007, Tony Abbott promised to limit himself to making Labor's industrial relations regime work better. That promise is reflected in the commission's terms of reference.\nBut, while the terms of reference might effectively restrict the scope of the commission's recommendations, they should not preclude an analysis by the commission in its final report of the issues that remain to be addressed.\nSuch an analysis would help prepare the way for future reform, which is likely to be deemed necessary as Australia finds itself in a period of prolonged sluggish growth.\nIndeed, by acquainting the public with the bigger picture, it could make an important difference to the way the government and the Fair Work Commission respond to the commission's detailed recommendations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:14:25.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
