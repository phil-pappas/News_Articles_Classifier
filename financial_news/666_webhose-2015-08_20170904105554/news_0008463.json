With a consistent decline in the PC units shipped to end clients, there are two segments within this space that are bucking the trend. \nTwo technological giants are stealing the show from traditional PC manufacturers with impressive growth figures. Both Apple and Google have managed to penetrate the traditional Windows PCs market with the OS X based Mac platform and Google’s Chromebook which is growing at impressive rates. \nIn order to target this still relatively new segment, brokers need a new solution which does not rely on Windows PC at its core. \nReaching out to the growing side of the PC market is crucial for new and established brokers \nForex On The Go (FOTG) has already been active in mobile, yet today the company is launching what just might be the product necessary to cover this new demographic. The company has introduced four new products that could shake up the platform space when it comes to Mac, Chromebooks and Linux. \nThe solutions include Safari and Chrome add-ons, a native Mac OS X app and a Webtrader version of the FOTG platform. All of the products are delivered through the respective app stores making them easy to install alternatives to a variety of complex products which require a tech savvy user in order to be installed. \nThe rationale for brokers to adopt such a native solution is that they can easily target customers using a Mac, typically higher value clients, and at the same time make way into one of the new personal computer gateway devices which is the Google Chromebook. \nMac and Chromebooks sales in 2015 are growing at 12% and 27%, amid a PC sales slump 10% \nChromebook sales have been growing briskly in recent years, estimated by research firm Gartner to have reached 7.3 million units this year alone, which is higher by 27 percent when compared to 2014. At the same time, Apple’s Mac sales have been growing at an annual rate of about 12 percent, while the broad PC industry sales have contracted by 10 percent. \nThe solution by Forex On The Go can be white labeled by brokers in a cost effective manner. The company is offering two packages which cater for different brokers – the FOTG Express Trader pack includes all of the FOTG features and aside from the four newly launched solutions also provides iOS, Android and Blackberry MT4 compatible products. Designed with small brokers in mind the solution can be priced depending on the usage by a broker’s clients. \nA Custom Trader package is available for those larger brokers who are willing to get a solution with their own brand and logo. The package assures that a broker’s brand be featured on six app stores and allows customized requests and additional development to tailor the solution to the specific requests of the broker. \nFOTG is already being used by a number of MT4 brokers worldwide.
