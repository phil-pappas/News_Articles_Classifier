That then gets added to their order. \nNaked Wines works a little like crowdfunding — users pay a £20 a month subscription that then gets used by Naked to fund independent wine makers around the world. \nCustomers' money acts as a piggy bank, storing up for when they want to buy wine, and in return for putting the money up, they get discounts on the list price. \nThe \"Text for Wine\" service is being piloted in the UK but if successful will be rolled out across Naked's US and Australian operations. \nUK MD Eamon Fitzgerald says in today's statement: \"Initial uptake has been very encouraging and it's easy to see this service being particularly useful for busy customers who don't have time or access to the website.\" \nBulk retailer Majestic Wine bought Naked for £70 million in April and Naked founder Rowan Gormley was named the new CEO of Majestic at the time. \nHe says in today's statement: \"Access to Naked's digital marketing skills was a clear benefit for Majestic following the acquisition, and the launch of \"Text for Wine\" is a fantastic demonstration of these skills in action.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T16:14:33.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
