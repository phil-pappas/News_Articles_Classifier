Gaidica, who stepped down from daily weather newscasts in 2014, has been tapped to co-host WDIV-Local 4's entertainment and lifestyle morning show \"Live in the D\" beginning on September 28. \n\"Live in the D\" which premiered in August 2013, explores how culture, entertainment and lifestyle, affect life in Metro Detroit. With new hosts, \"Live in the D\" will become a faster paced program that will still highlight the best of Detroit while providing advertisers showcasing opportunities. \nThe show's current hosts, anchor and reporter Guy Gordon and anchor and investigative reporter Karen Drew, will continue to host the program through the end of September. \"For the last two years, Karen and Guy have done such a great job launching 'Live in the D' and helping to make it a great reflection of the spirit of our community,\" said Marla Drutz, Vice President and General Manager of Local 4. \"But we need their journalistic chops covering the hard news and supporting our all-important newscasts and web content.\" \nJoining Gaidica will be Tati Amare, an award-winning host and producer based out of New York City. Amare grew up in Los Angeles and has hosted and produced local lifestyle, food and travel programs. \n\"Finding the right person to sit next to Chuck was no small feat. Thank goodness we met Tati. She combines intelligence with a natural curiosity and talent,\" said Jamie Kaye Walters, Creative Services and Programming Director. \"It's going to be exciting to explore Detroit through her eyes.\" \nViewers still catch Gaidica during his \"Force 4 Good\" reports on Local 4 News and on the station's big event programming. \n\"Being part of 'Live in the D' was an unexpected but happy opportunity for me to connect with the people of Detroit in a new way and still have time to serve our community,\" said Gaidica. \nAlong with the change of hosts, \"Live in the D\" will air an hour earlier at 10 a.m. Below are the details of Local 4's new daytime schedule beginning September 28. 4:30-7 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T10:43:47.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
