For many majors, they actually earn more. \nAny early advantage disappears, however, once workers hit mid-career, with men earning 15 percent more than women across the board. Even in majors where women earned more during the early years of their careers, men earn more by age 35. \nMore from The Fiscal Times: You've got to see this GOP hawk's grisly ad opposing the Iran deal \nResearchers point to several potential reasons for the reversal, including possible gender discrimination and women's tendency to scale back their careers to bear and raise children. \n\"Because raising a family often requires more flexible schedules, those with family responsibilities who have difficulty satisfying time-sensitive work demands may face lower wages in these types of jobs,\" the authors write. \"In fact, in jobs where such time demands are largely absent, and more flexibility is possible, the pay gap has been found to be much smaller.\" \nFor some women, that means leaving the workforce entirely. The percentage of women age 25 to 54 who are working has fallen to 69 percent since peaking in 1999 at 74 percent, following a 60-year climb.
