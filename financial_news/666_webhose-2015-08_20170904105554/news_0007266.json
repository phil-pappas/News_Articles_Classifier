James Davies Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith Perth-based technology services player ASG Group has exited a trading halt to announce it has signed a new five year deal with Victorian energy provider United Energy and Multinet Gas, which is worth more than $22 million.\nThe news comes a day after the company announced a 6.3 per cent increase in annual net profit after tax to $9.5 million, on revenues of $164.3 million, which were up 2.6 per cent over the year.\nShares in the company went into a halt at 96.5¢ on Tuesday afternoon ahead of the announcement of the contract win. The deal followed on from a $40 million utilities sector win with Western Power at the start of August.\nSince exited the halt around midday on Wednesday with the new deal announcement, shares in the company initially rose, but were back at 96.5¢ at 1:00PM.\nThe new contract with United Energy and Multinet Gas (UE & MG) is for infrastructure managed services, and has three one year extension options built in. The company said the work was based on ASG's New World Service offering, and had been awarded following a competetive tendering process.\nFuture wins Investment in the program, called New World services, began in 2011, and represented a significant shift for the company to address what it saw as a fundamental change in the way ­businesses and government departments wanted to buy technology-based services.\nRather than being an infrastructure as a service cloud-computing player, which sells basic computing capacity, ASG invested in the infrastructure on which it provides outsourced technology services, such as business analytics or enterprise resource planning software.\n ASG's chief executive Geoff Lewis said the new deal, which extended existing work being done by the company at UE & MG, was a result of its growing reputation in the energy and utilities sector.\n\"ASG have proven their capabilities at UE & MG, and we believe this award is testament to the quality of work that ASG have been delivering,\" he said.\nIn the company's results presentation on Tuesday it gave guidance of estimated increased revenue in 2016 to $180-190 million. It said ASG has signed over $200 million worth of contracts in the last 12 months, which would drive the continuing revenue growth.\nThw company said it has a current pipeline of future work worth in excess of $340 million and forecast it would sign new deals worth another $50 million in the first quarter of the 2016 financial year.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-08-19T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:05:05.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
