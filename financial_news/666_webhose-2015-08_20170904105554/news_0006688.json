Rob Homer Share on twitter by Kate Cowling The ave rage retiree's income could drop by $4000 a year if the dividend imputation system is scrapped, modelling from the peak super body shows.\nFranking credits add around 13 per cent to pension income, when credits earned both before and after retirement are taken into account, according to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.\nIf an average retiree has a 30 per cent allocation to Australian shares over their working life, they would end up with a superannuation pool of $540,000, the super lobby group points out.\nThis would give them an income of $40,000 a year, $31,000 from super and the rest from the part pension.\nBut if the system was to go - something that's been the subject of recent tax reform debates - the retiree's income would drop by $4000 and they would take on a greater share of the part pension, ASFA's report finds.\nTaxpayers to pay Around half of the cost of the change would be borne by the taxpayer, the report says.\n\"Initiatives like franking credits help to incentivise Australians to put money away for retirement as early and as often as possible,\" says ASFA chief executive Pauline Vamos.\n \"If we remove this benefit, it will have the most negative impact on retirees and low to middle income Australians who will see the tax rates on their superannuation earnings raised from 0 and 15 per cent respectively to 30 per cent across the board,\" she says.\n\"Even with the benefit of dividend imputation, only 35 per cent of Australians are retiring with enough superannuation to live a comfortable lifestyleâ€”we clearly need to be helping Australians to bolster these savings instead.\n\"It is imperative that we take a long-term view when considering tax reform and adequately cater for our growing retiree population.\"\nNow read Chanticleer on dividend imputation myths", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-10T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:30:21.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
