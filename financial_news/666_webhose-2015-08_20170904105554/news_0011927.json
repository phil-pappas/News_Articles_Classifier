Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Katie Walsh The nation's largest law firms are in the grip of a tough market that saw demand for their services slump for the third consecutive year, triggered in part by a growing trend of companies taking more work in-house.\nThe overall drop of about 2 per cent was underlined by more dramatic falls in core areas including banking and finance (11.7 per cent) and dispute resolution (6.4 per cent). The painful data was revealed in a Melbourne Law School and Thomson Reuters report that warns Australia's lawyers appear to be lagging behind their cohort in the northern hemisphere in recovering from the global financial crisis.\n\"Firms that choose complacency and mediocrity will rapidly find themselves on the outer,\" Melbourne Law School dean Carolyn Evans said.\n\"The environment is too competitive to allow firms to engage in business as usual while their clients are demanding innovation and cost containment – if clients are not finding their demands met, there are plenty of old and new firms with a hunger for the more limited work available.\"\nThe market disruption is happening against a backdrop of growing numbers of law graduates, Professor Evans warned. In contrast, enrolments in the United States are plummeting.\nProfit figures remained strong due to the slashing of partner numbers by 5 to 10 per cent over the past three years: profit per equity partner edged above $700,000 among big eight firms and $750,000 at global firms.\nGlobal firms – which include heavy hitters Allens, Ashurst, Herbert Smith Freehills, King & Wood Mallesons, Norton Rose Fulbright and DLA Piper – maintained the biggest collective hit to demand, down by 4.7 per cent compared to just 1 per cent for domestic firms. Although some firms reported significant profitability spikes in the past year, including HSF and Ashurst, Australia-specific data was not made public.\nBarolsky Advisers managing director Joel Barolsky said that the domestic firms seemed to be \"winning\" in litigation, intellectual property and general corporate advice; whereas global firms were ahead in M&A and property.\n Investment in technology \"It begs the question whether a global brand puts a firm at a disadvantage in targeting work perceived as domestic or jurisdiction-specific,\" he said.\nFirms are reacting by investing in technology, project management and offshoring routine work. Corrs has a freelance network, Allens recently opened a new start-up arm, Accelerate, and a number of the global firms have offshore processing hubs.\n\"Law firms are banking on technology to make step-change improvements in efficiency and effectiveness,\" said Mr Barolsky.\nThe report covers the nation's eight largest firms plus selected big commercial law firms. The final quarter of the 2015 financial year recorded a marginal increase in demand – measured as total billable hours worked by all fee earners – but the report hesitates to predict that it is the mark of a turning tide.\nMr Barolsky said that recruitment spending was up by 10 per cent for the year; a promising sign after an 11 per cent drop in total lawyer headcount in the big eight firms over the past three years.\nPartner levels at most of the large firms have dropped. Allens fell from 176 to 148 partners over the three year period; Clayton Utz from 198 to 178; and DLA Piper fell below the century mark with 89 partners down from 111.\nAs partner numbers at firms fall, law firm numbers continue to rise.\nForeign firms have flooded the market in the past five years, whether by merger, link or new footprint. Entry has slowed but they continue to arrive, including Pinsent Masons and Hogan Lovells in July. In the past 18 months, more than 20 boutique firms were set up in Australia, including small outfits Talbot Sayer in Brisbane – which topped M&A league tables a year after opening doors – and Clarendon Lawyers in Melbourne, who poached Allens managing associate Susie Stone this week and K&L Gates partner John Mann earlier this year.\n\"Rather than having a profession that's crowded or too big or too small, what I think you have at any given time is a dynamic market and some firms that are reading the market better than others,\" Allens chief executive partner Michael Rose said.\n\"Three or four years ago [foreign] firms were making decisions based on Australia being at the top of the resources boom, future of growth in China and a strong Australian dollar.\nCircumstances have changed \"They made decisions to meet that market and all of those circumstances have changed to some extent. Some will be thinking the market is overcrowded, some will be adjusting.\"\nNew entrants and clients taking more work in-house were more a change in market dynamics than a disruption, Mr Rose said.\n\"The real areas of disruption for the future are going to be technology and the extent to which technology changes the way in which people work.\"\n\"Technology is going to make people's careers more episodic.\n\"We are changing our business processes to increase our use of collaborative technology, and we are looking at various different mechanisms of delivering our services to clients.\"\nClayton Utz chief executive partner Robert Cutler said that the \"intensely competitive\" market was ultimately for the benefit of clients, and was not overcrowded.\n\"The disruption really demands firms to be more commercially responsive - not only time responsive but commercially nuanced,\" he said.\nThe firm is plying money into training senior lawyers and partners to better understand businesses and operate in a commercial manner.\n\"We must innovate.\"\nThis is the first in a weekly series looking at the disrupted legal services market in Australia.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@katiepwalsh"], "published": "2015-08-27T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:11:15.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
