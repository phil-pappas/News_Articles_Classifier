We have the chiefs who have the lands. We should be committed to building our own homes. We need dedicated people who are centred on the issue of solving the problem,” he stressed. \nMr. Sarpong added that with a minimum of GH¢5, investors or can invest into the fund as much as they want. \nMr. Sarping noted that the Home Investment Fund is an asset-backed investment fund with guarantees; investors will receive a minimum of 40 percent on their investment in five years. \n“What is unique about this is that the real estate market is a viable sector but lots of Ghanaians do not know about it. You can contribute as little as GH¢5 and the yield is most often higher than investing in stocks,” he added \nMr. Yaw Sarpong said with as little as GHÈ¼80,000 an individual can own a two-bedroom house at ASN properties. \nStory by Ghana/Myjoyonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T20:57:25.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
