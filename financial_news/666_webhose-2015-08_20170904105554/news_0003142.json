It’s a day when it’s just as likely for you to get a 404 Error when navigating to an e-commerce site as it is to fill up your cart with those Dr. Dre Beats headphones on the cheap. \nBut performance issues aren’t unique to retail by any stretch — in fact, just last month, The New York Stock Exchange, United Airlines and The Wall Street Journal all experienced some major performance events of their own. Not exactly mom-and-pop brand names, and not exactly a pattern of industries. In other words, web performance doesn’t discriminate. \nAnd now, we’ve graduated to the point of Internet maturity where a 5-second load time (that you wouldn’t think twice about in the 1998 AOL era) is an eternity — an annoyance on par with that 404 Error you experienced on Black Friday.

And this adoption of the approach is not happening in small numbers — in fact, a whopping 91% of Best-In-Class organizations surveyed have already, or plan to, implement an end-to-end approach in their organization. \nSome of the benefits these companies are seeing as a result of end-to-end monitoring are found in the following data from Aberdeen: \nWith all of these benefits of an end-to-end approach, remember how they’ll proactively aid you in your approach to performance monitoring when 5 seconds to your site’s users basically means your site is as good as dead . \nIn 2015, slow is the new downtime. \nIf you weren’t able to make the live webinar about online performance last week, have no fear — the full session of Building a Valuable Presence Through Online Performance is available on-demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:17:06.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
