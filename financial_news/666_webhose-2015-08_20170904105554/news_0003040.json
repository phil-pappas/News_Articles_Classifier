David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd As Telstra chief executive Andy Penn prepares to launch a video streaming service called Telstra TV he will have to think through the potentially damaging implications for his pay TV partner, News Corp .\nBoth Penn and News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson know that Telstra's bundling of Foxtel's pay TV service has been the secret to its growth over the past 12 months.\nHowever, instead of being transparent about the real growth in full service Foxtel subscriptions, the partners opted for a Panglossian perspective.\nTelstra and News said that Foxtel lifted its subscriber numbers in the year to June by 227,000 to 2.8 million , which is a market penetration of about 31 per cent.\nBut later in the day Foxtel admitted that it was now including subscribers to its $10-a-month Presto streaming service as part of its subscriber numbers. Telstra and News said 9 per cent growth in subscribers was thanks to \"the new pricing and packages, lower churn and Telstra entertainer bundles\".\nIt was a little cute of both companies not to give a breakdown of the Presto subscribers versus those paying full freight for the premium Foxtel package.\nThis lack of transparency not only reflects badly on both companies, it serves to highlight the relentless downward pressure on Foxtel's revenues.\nFoxtel is a powerful cash-generating machine. It reported a 1.9 per cent increase in revenue to $3.16 billion, an 8 per cent decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to $900million and a 12.7 per cent decline in earnings before interest and tax.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements One of the reasons given for lower financial returns from Foxtel in 2015 was the higher charges imposed by Fox Sports, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of News Corp.\nNews Corp said Foxtel would return to EBITDA growth in 2016.\nBut its prospects are clouded by the shift from premium pay TV products charging $90 a month to a wide range of streaming video services charging $10 a month such as Netflix and Stan, which is half-owned by Fairfax Media and Nine Entertainment.\nAfter Telstra dumped its T-Box set-top service it aggressively packaged Foxtel in its fixed-line broadband product bundles. It was this promotional and bundling activity which helped explain the 180,000 rise in Foxtel subscribers in the six months to June.\nIndustry sources estimate that at least 100,000 of the Foxtel subscribers were customers taking the Presto service. That takes the growth in premium subscribers to a much lower level.\nPenn told Chanticleer that Foxtel is an important provider of content to Telstra customers.\nHe says internet protocol (IP) is simply an alternative distribution network and Telstra plans to take advantage of that with its own stream service called Telstra TV .\nThere will be a strong incentive for Penn to ensure that Telstra TV is a success given that we are moving to a new IP world revolving around the NBN's multi-technology mix wholesale service.\nHowever, if he bundles his own stream service ahead of Foxtel it will have implications for the value of his half share in Foxtel.\nSome bullish on Foxtel's future Some analysts are bullish on Foxtel's future. In a recent in-depth analysis of video streaming, Citi analyst Justin Diddams said Foxtel would prosper despite the onslaught from Netflix and Stan.\nHe estimated streaming video households will reach 3 million by 2018.\n\"Foxtel is using Presto for lead generation and incremental monetisation of content, to lift penetration of Foxtel, we view streaming video on demand (SVOD) as complementary to Foxtel,\" he said.\nBut Diddams' own report contained some worrying numbers for the those trying to sell the premium pay TV product.\nA survey conducted as part of the research for the report found that only 4 per cent of non-subscribers to Foxtel would want to subscribe to Foxtel in the future. Also, the survey showed that about 21 per cent of non-subscriber have had Foxtel and cut the cable.\nAnother piece of data which will likely shape Telstra's approach to marketing its Telstra TV product is that survey finding that out of those considering a streaming video service about 14 per cent would consider Netflix and 4 per cent Foxtel.\nOne conclusion that could be drawn from these numbers is that Foxtel's future is bound up with the bundling by Telstra. The problem with that conclusion is that it involves selling products with almost one tenth the revenue.\nA pessimistic view of the world would point to Penn reviewing Telstra's ownership of Foxtel and possibly trying to capitalise on its current earning capacity before it slips into a long-term structural decline.\nBut News Corp would not want to lose its Foxtel partnership with Telstra given the importance to it of the bundling packages offered by the company.\nOptus looking up Allen Lew, chief executive at Optus, is confronting the issue of digital disruption free of the fears of cannibalisation of a partner. His video streaming partner is FetchTV.\nLew is taking a different tack to Penn when it comes to streaming by focusing on the growth in mobile downloads.\nHe sees a strong future for video streaming on hand-held devices and is hinting at launching a service for Optus customers.\nThe latest Optus results showed the willingness of parent company SingTel to invest in the business. Capital expenditure this year will be $1.8billion. That investment is a necessary precursor to offering services requiring heavy downloads.\nPacker goes global James Packer's decision to stand down as chairman of Crown Resorts makes sense. He can spend more time on building his global casino brand.\nRob Rankin will be an able chairman. The move is recognition that Rowan Craigie is doing a great job managing the Australian assets.\nPacker said: \"Crown remains my number one business priority and passion. I am extremely proud of the company and look forward to continuing our efforts to build a global luxury brand.\n\"Crown has a pipeline of resorts globally and this is where the majority of my time will be spent. Rob Rankin has my complete trust and respect as an executive and he will do an outstanding job as chairman. Given our global growth and aspirations, this is the right time for the company to make this change. I look forward to working closely with him.\"\nPacker's friend David Gyngell reckons the changes will allow Packer to focus on growth opportunities and his other private interests in technology in Silicon Valley and Israel.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-13T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:06:26.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
