The acquisition of HB360 is very strategic as Our vision is that every developer uses the platform to bring down their sales and operating costs. This will help in reduction of property prices eventually benefiting the consumers,\" Housing.com iCEO and COO Rishabh Gupta said. \nWith this acquisition, Housing.com is now the only online real estate listing platform to own a developer CRM company. \n\"Leveraging this unique platform, developers and agents can streamline the entire sales lifecycle, by tracking inventory, managing customer relations and in effect drive efficiencies in their sale operations. \nThis will help reduce costs for over 20,000 developers in the realty ecosystem. This acquisition will also fortify Housing.comÂ’s Data Science Lab (DSL) with rich data on inventory and transactions in the real estate sector,\" he said. \nHousing.com is consolidating its leadership position as a comprehensive online realty player and a game changer striving to bring positive change in the real estate industry through its consumer centric products and solutions, Gupta added. \nRajat Kothari, Founder and CEO HomeBuy360 said: \"Indian real estate sector is witnessing tremendous growth and traction but it is still highly unorganised, posing significant challenges for the entire ecosystem. \nWith less than 10 per cent of developers currently using CRM for their back end and customer connect operations, we have a huge market opportunity ahead of us. \nHousing.com's strong developer network pan India will allow us to further scale our business nationally. \" Housing.com now has more than 2,551 employees in over 100 cities across India. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T16:54:50.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
