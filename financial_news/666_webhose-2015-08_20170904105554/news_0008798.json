A large portion of traders had been betting the Fed would raise rates, which have hovered near zero since the financial crisis, as early as next month. That shifted to December, and then to next year, as China's economy slowed and U.S. markets plummeted in the past few days. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark index of 30 blue-chip stocks, lost more than 1,100 points on Friday and Monday, about 6.6% of its value. \"I don't have a view on why the stock market is doing what it's doing,\" Dudley said. \"The stock market has to move a lot and stay there for it to have implications for the economy.\" \nPredictably, stocks got a temporary bounce Wednesday from Dudley's indication that a September rate hike might be less likely but the gains faded as it became clear he wasn't ruling out an increase altogether. \nThe New York Fed president emphasized that both financial-market developments and global economic conditions will be important parts of the interest-rate calculus, along with U.S. data such as consumer confidence, home sales and durable goods orders. The domestic figures have been \"pretty positive,\" Dudley said. \nMore broadly, though, \"international developments have increased the downside risk to U.S. economic growth,\" he said. \"The slowdown in China and the sharp fall in commodity prices are increasing the strain on many emerging market economies, and this could lead to a slower global growth rate and less demand for U.S. goods and services.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:33:47.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
