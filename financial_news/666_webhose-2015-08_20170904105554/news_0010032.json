The Teachers Service Commission has to consult,\" he said in an interview. \nOBEY THE LAW \n\"TSC has to obey the law. There is a process of how to get funds. It is Parliament that appropriates funds to the Executive, Legislature, Judiciary and county governments.\" \nMr Ruto said the pay rise issue would be addressed alongside the implication it could have on the larger Public Service. \nThe TSC and Parliament, he said, have to exercise their roles because the Budget had already been passed. \nMr Ruto said implementing the pay rise would involve reviewing the budget afresh. \n\"There will be a process before we reach there. The institutions have to build consensus to determine how to implement the court ruling,\" he said. \n\"Let teachers give opportunity to various institutions that are handling this matter to exercise their mandate.\" \nThe government had engaged teachers since 2013 and addressed most of their requirements, including increasing allowances, he said. \nHEALTH CRISIS \nAt the same time, Mr Ruto aid the health function would be administered by county governments as the Constitution stipulates. \nAlthough the sector is facing some problems, he said, county governments can reverse the situation with proper planning and allocation of funds. \nThe Deputy President said some health workers who were opposed to the function being devolved were pushing for its return to the national government. \n\"The Constitution is very clear and the government supports the provision that the health function will be administered by county governments. We cannot change this,\" Mr Ruto said. \nMr Ruto said it was crucial for the county governments to oversee the function to bring service closer to the people.
