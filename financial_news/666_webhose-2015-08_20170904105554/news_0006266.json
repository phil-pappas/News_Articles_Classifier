Nicolas Walker NKW by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell Superannuation funds expect Archer Capital will be next cab off rank in private equity fundraisings should the firm find its $1 billion-plus exit for private hospital operator, Healthe Care.\nSome of Archer's biggest backers, who are in close contact with the private equity firm, expect Archer would use the pending exit and return of money to launch another $1.5 billion-plus offering, Archer Capital Fund 6.\nInvestors said Archer's fourth fund, home to the likes of Healthe and V8 Supercars, had re-paid the bulk of its capital commitments, with investors still awaiting spoils from remaining investments.\nFund 5, which was a $1.5 billion offering raised in December 2011, is understood to be more than half invested following deals including Allity, Dun & Bradstreet and Aero-Care. Archer would also expected to use the fundraising to herald a new era at the firm, capping the rise in seniority for partners including Ben Frewin and Peter Gold.\nExpectations of the fundraising come as Archer and advisers Luminis Partners and Morgan Stanley entertain potential buyers for Healthe.\nIt's understood Healthe is in the middle of presentations and site tours to offshore interested parties such as China's Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, Malaysia's IHH Healthcare and Beijing-based Jangho.\nSources said domestic bidders, including Healthscope, Ramsay Health Care, Evolution Healthcare and Intermediate Capital Group-backed Cura Group were to be shown the asset next month when the information memorandum is due. [Evolution is currently seeking to clearance to buy the rest of New Zealand Acurity Health].\nElsewhere, more details are emerging about the Foreign Investment Review Board intervention into TransGrid's sale.\n Further to Street Talk's piece on Tuesday , it is understood FIRB chairman Brian Wilson took the unusual step of phoning potential bidders to talk them through his organisation's wishlist.\nTop of the list is domestic ownership. It's understood FIRB said it would like to see at least half the equity remain in Australian hands - be that an Australian superannuation fund or ASX-listed entity - and see two truly independent and Australian directors on TransGrid's board.\nBidders took it as a firm line in the sand for all future Australian regulated asset deals.\nOthers reckon the wishlist did not go far enough and should have included TransGrid's operational staff, not just management and directors.\nCountries such as the Philippines and Italy have restricted the amount of technical people the likes of State Grid Corporation of China can have working on their utilities. There is no such requirement for TransGrid.\nFinally, fund manager Michael Glennon's new listed investment company will begin trading at 11am on Friday having raised nearly $22 million with the help of brokers State One Stockbroking, PAC Partners and Shaw and Partners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:16:37.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
