Despite the two-day rally, shares in Kaz remain down over 25 percent this year. \n\"We would expect local inflation and wage increase demands to offset the weaker currency to undo much of the localised benefit in the months ahead, as happened the last time the Tenge devalued,\" analysts at Investec Securities said in a note. \nBritain's FTSE 100 was down 23.33 points, or 0.4 percent, at 6,380.12 points by 0749 GMT, touching its lowest level since January. \nThe index is now over 10 percent below an all time high of 7,122.74 points hit in April. \nAmong top fallers in percentage terms were Mondi, British American Tobacco and Hammerson, all around 2 percent lower as they went ex-dividend. \nTesco dropped 1 percent to its lowest since Jan 8, while Sainsbury fell 0.5 percent. Both grocers are down around 4 percent since Tuesday, when peer Asda, owned by Wal-Mart reported a 4.7 percent slump in quarterly sales, raising renewed concern about the challenges that established supermarkets face from discounters. \nTop risers on the FTSE 100 were miners with exposure to precious metals, such as Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) . \nThey rose around 2 percent, benefitting from a rally in the price of gold to a 5-week high after minutes from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month signalled that a hike in U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . interest rates in September may be unlikely, cooling demand for the dollar, a fellow safe-haven asset. \n(Reporting by Alistair Smout; Editing by Dominic Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:21:30.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
