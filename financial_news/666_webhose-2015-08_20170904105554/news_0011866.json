She is recognized with this prestigious distinction for leadership in wealth management. NAPW is the nation’s leading networking organization exclusively for professional women, boasting more than 700,000 members and over 200 operating Local Chapters. “I’m pleased to present Sally with this important honor,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “Her knowledge and experience in wealth management are valuable assets to her clients and community.”\nMs. Domingo has over 25 years of entrepreneurial experience in three industries. She began her financial career in life insurance, and has a strong commitment to helping others navigate their finances. “Following the sudden death of my husband from cancer, I felt called to help families prevent the emotional and financial trauma that surrounds the death or long-term care of a family member,” she says.\nIn January 2015, Ms. Domingo founded Women Wealth Mastery to help professional women realize their full potential through one-on-one coaching as well as group coaching. “My biggest accomplishment has been to begin speaking in public forums to empower women to achieve their dreams of a balanced life and career,” she says. She finds the most rewarding part of her career to be her ability to help women better manage their finances.\nGoing forward in her career, Ms. Domingo plans on making a positive impact on a global scale, and share her unique experience and encouraging outlook on wealth management with as many people as possible.\nAbout NAPW\nNAPW’s mission is to provide an exclusive, highly advanced networking forum to successful women executives, professionals and entrepreneurs where they can aspire, connect and achieve. Through innovative resources, unique tools and progressive benefits, professional women interact, exchange ideas, advance their knowledge and empower each other.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbS91c2Vycy9zYWxseS1kb21pbmdv", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy53b21lbndlYWx0aG1hc3RlcnkuY29t", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T08:20:38.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
