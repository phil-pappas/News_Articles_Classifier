Daniel Munoz by Tim Dodd Ann Coote, a year 11 student at Sydney's Hills Grammar School, says that US entrepreneur and author Peter Shankman gave her a new insight when he spoke to a group of high school students last week.\n\"He said the private sector could be used to make change if used in the right way,\" she said.\nMs Coote, whose ambition is to make a difference and can see herself in politics one day, said she hadn't thought before about companies being agents of change.\nThe talk by Mr Shankman, a successful entrepreneur and angel investor, was arranged the NSW Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards.\nMr Shankman said school students today were in a new era.\n\"They are the first generation in which entrepreneurs are not looked down on,\" he said. \"The flip side of this is responsibility to understand they do have the power to change the world, but it has to be for the right reasons. If they happen to make billions, that's great, but their goal has to be to make the world a better place.\"\nValue people Ms Coote said that he told the group that companies and managers who valued people did well, telling the group: \"If you are a nice person, people are going to want to work for you.\"\n \"Peter didn't speak down to us. He spoke to us like we were equals and he could learn as much from us as we could from him,\" she said.\n\"He said he wanted us to fail. Failure was the most important thing.\"\nWanyu Tang, a year 10 student from Sydney Boys High School, said Mr Shankman told them \"he would never hire a person who said they had never failed because such a person had never learnt anything\".\nAnother student, Mohamed Elmassri in year 11 at Amity College, said he was impressed by the rules Mr Shankman set for himself: to use his time wisely, be early for appointments, be presentable and be nice.\n\"One hundred per cent, he changed my thinking,\" Mr Elmassri said.\nRecovery from failure Ms Coote said Mr Shankman talked about how he recovered from failure, having started seven business, with three successes and four failures.\nMr Shankman's major entrepreneurial success was a website helpareporterout.com , which allows people to register to share their expertise with journalists who are looking for sources.\nOn Wednesday, August 19, Mr Shankman will speak to Startup Grind, a global start-up community, in Melbourne.", "external_links": ["http://www.helpareporter.com/"], "published": "2015-08-16T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:10:51.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
