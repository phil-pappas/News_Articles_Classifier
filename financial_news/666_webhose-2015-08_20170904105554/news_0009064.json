The number of rigs seeking oil rose by 6 to 670 for a third weekly gain, Baker Hughes data show. \nMeanwhile, Societe Generale SA and JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news ) cut their price forecasts on weaker demand growth and oversupply. \nOil has slumped more than 25pc since this year’s peak in June amid signs the global surplus that drove prices into a bear market will be prolonged. \nOPEC’s largest members have sustained record output , while US inventories remain more than 90 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. \n“It’s still a supply story,” Jonathan Barratt, the chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance Securities in Sydney, said. “There is not a lot of upside for oil.” \nDrillers in the US, the world’s biggest oil consumer, have added rigs to fields for the fifth weekly gain in six. While the number of active machines has climbed to 670, the total count is still down almost 60 percent since December. \nChina’s crude oil imports rose to a record on a monthly basis driven by buying from small, private refineries who sought to capitalise on low prices. \nOverseas purchases increased to 30.71 million metric tonnes in July, equivalent to about 7.3 million barrels a day, according to preliminary data released by the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs on Saturday. \n“The Chinese look to buy on the dip,” said Mark Pervan, head of commodity research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Melbourne. “In this market, where the demand conditions aren’t so strong, they’ll be very opportunistic. We’re expecting oil prices not to recover at all in the second half .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T11:37:46.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
