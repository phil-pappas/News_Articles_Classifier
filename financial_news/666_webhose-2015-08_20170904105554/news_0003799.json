Reuters by Joanna Mather They're two boys from the country. One is a Liberal-voting doctor and the other is a card-carrying member of the National Party. And they're married. \"I'm a true Coalition supporter and proud of that,\" says Michael Kauter, who married partner David Gracey in New York last year. \"But I just want this government to get out of my personal life and concentrate on the economy and jobs.\"\nEvents in Canberra this week would have you believe there's hardly a National Party supporter in the country who backs gay marriage. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been accused of using his Coalition partner as cover for quashing a free vote on marriage equality among Liberals. If the Liberals had been alone in the party room there might have been enough support to give the green light to a free vote.\nBut with the Nationals crashing the party, Abbott knew he had more than enough \"no\" votes (although it has since been asserted that even among the Liberals the decision would have been to keep the status quo).\nWhile the decision to put the issue on ice might have delighted hard-right South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi, who doesn't face a vote until towards the end of the decade, it makes life much harder for someone like Malcolm Turnbull.\nMaking gay marriage legal will not make adoption or surogacy easier for gay couples. James Alcock Turnbull is the member for the urbane electorate of Wentworth in Sydney and, as a frontbencher, couldn't cross the floor even if gay marriage did come to a vote. He will face an election next year.\nTensions were still running high on Friday, with senior members of the Coalition squabbling over what should happen next.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison, who does not support gay marriage, wants a referendum. But he was slapped down by frontbench colleague George Brandis, the government's top lawyer, who said marriage had nothing to do with the constitution. A plebiscite is firming as a preferred Coalition option.\nAll the while Labor is watching gleefully from the sidelines.\n Kauter grew up in what he describes as a conservative family in Armidale. He served as deputy campaign director for the Nationals in the lead-up to the 2013 federal election, but says he can no longer hold his tongue.\nHe was dismayed when two members of the Sale branch of the Nationals tried but failed to have MP Darren Chester disendorsed over his support for marriage equality.\n\"Some of the younger generation within the Nats are giving the party such a great future,\" Kauter says, who now runs Strategic and Political Counsel, a government relations firm. \"It's disappointing that they're being held back by some warped views of a very small minority who really are failing to represent their communities.\"\nKauter is 35 and lives with husband David Gracey, a 42-year-old kidney transplant specialist originally from Western Australia, in Woollahra, in Sydney's eastern suburbs.\n\"I appreciate that ... gay marriage is not an issue that elections are going to be won or lost upon,\" Kauter says. \"However, the real danger is that while this issue is on the agenda and the Coalition is wedged by it, they are not going to be able to get messages on the economy through.\" Kauter urges Abbott to look to conservative leaders in New Zealand and the UK, where same-sex marriage is now legal.\n\"[NZ Prime Minister] John Key and [British PM] David Cameron allowed a politicians' vote on marriage equality,\" he says. \"Not only did the world not end, they were returned to office with stronger majorities.\"\nThere is no doubt that events overseas have built momentum. In Ireland, the business community played a large and vocal role in securing a 62 per cent yes vote at the May referendum.\nAustralia is following suit, with more than 550 companies officially supporting the campaign by Australian Marriage Equality. The list is a who's who of Australia's leading businesses from banking, professional, legal and financial services, telecommunications, sporting codes, fast food and retail. Big mining and resources companies are thus far absent, as is Fairfax, the publisher of this newspaper.\nOne of those instrumental in getting companies to sign up to the cause is former JPMorgan investment banker Janine Middleton. Last September she wrote to Australian Marriage Equality to volunteer her services.\n\"I said, 'I'm straight, I'm an ex-investment banker, I wear pearls, I live in Mosman and I'm Catholic',\" she tells AFR Weekend. \"My point to them was that nobody [in my circles] is talking about this. I said, 'You need to get into the mainstream and I can help'.\"\nMiddleton says it was her experience as managing director of JPMorgan's London outfit that helped turn her into a gay marriage campaigner. \"I thought I was doing a good job as manager but the gay guys in my team would never come out to me,\" she says. \"I just saw them edit their lives constantly. They left part of their personality at the door. If they came to the pub they came alone, you never quite knew what they did on holidays and you just knew that this must have been very difficult for them living these sorts of double lives.\"\nAnd then something happened that upset her. Middleton when to see a dying work colleague in hospital. \"As I went into the room my colleague was holding this woman's hand. She took one look at me and pushed this poor woman's hand away.\n\"I'm standing there thinking about saying goodbye and you're still self-editing your life because I'm the managing director and you're worried about what I'm going to think?\"\nBoston Consulting Group has been an open supporter of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and intersex (LGBTI) community for at least a decade. Andrew Dyer, the head of BCG's financial services practice in Australia and New Zealand, says legalising same-sex marriage is a matter of dignity, respect and equality. But there are practical considerations too.\n\"It's access to talent,\" he says. \"BCG looks to attract the brightest and the best and frankly you don't want to miss out on parts of the community simply because their preferences are different,\" he says.\n\"Same-sex couples are generally more affluent and are very attractive customers so it's good business sense.\"\nHigh-profile business leaders with gay children have also been vocal. The Snow family, who own and operate Canberra Airport, last week lit up the terminal in rainbow colours to leave politicians returning for parliamentary sittings in no doubt about which side they support.\nTom Snow married Brooke Horne in New Zealand last year and the couple has two young children.\n\"I think what businesses are saying is, 'Give people a fair go,\"' Snow says. \"You see Wesfarmers [chief executive] Richard Goyder standing up there doing the right thing and that will be good for Coles. A lot of gay people are really afraid of being out at work. But unfortunately for a lot of gay and lesbian people, because we're not equal we can't stand up at work.\"\nThe fight is also personal for Aussie Home Loans chairman John Symond, whose son, Stephen Symond, married Ed Smith in a civil union, although the family does not like that term.\n\"Equality just makes good common sense,\" John Symond tells AFR Weekend.\n\"It matters to our staff and it matters to so many of our customers. I know most Australians would agree.\"\nOf course, not everybody does agree. In the wake of last Tuesday's six-hour partyroom debate, NSW Liberal Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells said she believed there was a \"silent majority\" of Australians who did not want to change the definition of marriage. \"My sense is the view in the Parliament will reflect the view of the majority of the Australian public,\" she told the ABC. \"That is marriage is between a man and a woman.\"\nAfter 150 businesses put their names to a full-page newspaper advertisement in The Australian in June, the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney wrote to some, warning that many of their customers and employees would be Catholics who do not want the Marriage Act changed. \"For corporations to speak on such issues ... is indeed overstepping their purpose and it is to be strongly resisted,\" says a letter sent to the Maurice Blackburn legal firm.\nThe Australian Marriage Forum responded with its own full-page ad last Monday. The ad featured lines such as, \"Is it loving to destroy the primal love between mother and baby?\" and \"Is it right to force homosexual education on all our children?\"\nChannels Ten and Seven refused to run a 30-second Australian Marriage Forum ad showing same-sex marriage as the tip of an iceberg. Foxtel, which is a signatory to the Australian Marriage Equality campaign, showed the ad and received complaints.\nAbbott has been accused of pandering to the far right and Australian Christian Lobby. But in the process he, like the Nationals, may be alienating some voters.\nGay marriage is the last thing Abbott and his colleagues want to be talking about. But by preventing a free vote in Parliament this term and raising the spectre of a popular vote beyond the next election, Abbott has put the issue front and centre for a long time to come.\nThe issue will not go away, for politicians or business. On the latter, consider what happened when the National Australia Bank was the only one of the big four banks not to appear in the Australian Marriage Equality's full-page newspaper ad. Insiders say NAB was on board, but had missed a print deadline. Management was forced to email staff to quell the unrest.\n\"Young people get this,\" Tom Snow says. To illustrate, he recounts a recent occurrence at his alma mater, a well-known Presbyterian school in Canberra. \"I got a message from the headmaster that he'd addressed the school about marriage equality. He got a standing ovation from 950 students.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:04:51.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
