The class of ship allowed to transit the waterway isn't being limited, only the amount of cargo larger ships can carry. \nA corrected version of the story is below: \nPanama Canal to limit cargo because of drought effects \nPanama Canal to temporarily limit cargo on bigger ships as drought lowers waterway's lakes \nPANAMA CITY (AP) -- The Panama Canal Authority said Friday that next month it will temporarily limit the amount of cargo for larger ships using the waterway because drought has lowered water levels in Gatun and Alhajuela lakes. \nThe restrictions, which are the first such hold-down because of weather in nearly 20 years, takes effect Sept. 8 and had been expected by shippers. Only a minority of ships now using the canal will be affected, the authority said. \nRainfall over the watershed feeding the lakes at the midsection of the waterway has fallen sharply as a result of the El Nino weather phenomenon, lowering the lake levels. Similar problems occurred in 1997-98. \nThe authority said ships will be limited to a maximum draft of 39 feet (11.89 meters) beginning Sept. 8. It added that the limit might be further reduced to 38.5 feet (11.73 meters) on Sept. 16. \nOnly about five or six of the 36 ships now using the canal daily will be affected, the authority said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:14:41.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
