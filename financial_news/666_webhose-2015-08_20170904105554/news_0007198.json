The chamber will not allow such hindrance and will safeguard the integrity of the Proceedings,\" it made clear. \nThe defence had argued that the prior recorded statements shouldn't be admitted into evidence as they were not taken under oath nor was there the threat of liability for false statements. \nBut the chamber found that the fact that the witnesses appended their signatures to the statements \"to the best of their knowledge\" the statements could in fact be admitted into evidence. \nThe defence also challenged the reliability of the statements on the grounds that they were written in English but when those who'd recanted their statements took the stand, it was clear that they were not fluent in the language \"and (testimony) ended up being in Swahili with English interpretation.\" \nThe motivation for making the prior recorded statements, the defence also argued, was suspect as a number of witnesses, when they took the stand, testified that they were motivated by the promise of an easier life in the West in exchange for their testimony. \nBut the chamber stated that it would exercise its discretion in determining the truth of the statements.
