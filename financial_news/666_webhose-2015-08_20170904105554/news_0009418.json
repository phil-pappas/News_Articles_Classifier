Wal-Mart should also benefit as gas prices continue to move lower, putting more money in consumers' pockets. \nTurning to Micron ( MU - Get Report ) , Cramer pointed out that analysts are mixed on the stock. Some say more downside exists due to a continued imbalance between supply and demand, while others say the worst is over. \nMust Read: The Bulls Are in Danger of Turning Into Lemmings \nThe stock's valuation looks cheap, but that's only predicated on the PC industry improving, Cramer said. \nSo while shares of Micron look attractive, he's not ready to pull the trigger just yet. Cheap stocks have a tendency to stay cheap for a while. At the time of publication, Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS had no position in companies mentioned.
