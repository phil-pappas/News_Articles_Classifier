Everyone is waiting to see what (China) will do next,\" he said. \nThere was some temporary volatility in the Aussie during a speech by Reserve Bank assistant governor for economics Christopher Kent, who said unemployment had peaked early, thanks largely to the glacial pace of wage growth. \nMr Tjahja said next week markets will focus on US inflation data and the minutes of the RBA's August meeting to search for any clues on upcoming interest rate decisions from the US and Australian central banks. \nAt 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was at 91.83 Japanese yen, up from Thursday's close of 91.66 yen, and at 66.17 euro cents, down from 66.18 euro cents. \nThe Australian bond market has softened amid a quiet day of trade with no major economic headlines. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia fixed income quantitative strategist Philip Brown said the market opened with a slight selloff following a weak US bond tender overnight. \n\"We had our own bond tender today, which didn't go terribly well either,\" he said. \nThe Australian government sold $900 million of April 21, 2026 Treasury bonds on Friday in a sale that attracted bids totalling $1.605 billion and had a coverage ratio of 1.7833. \n\"It had the lowest coverage ratio in about two years,\" he said. \nMr Brown said that indicated overall demand was weaker than previous weeks and months. \nAt 1630 AEST on Friday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.185 (implying a yield of 2.815 per cent), down from 97.230 (2.770 per cent) on Thursday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.030 (1.970 per cent), down from 98.060 (1.940 per cent). @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T10:40:44.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
