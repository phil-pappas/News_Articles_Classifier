But investors were offered no formal guidance on the expected pricing and size of the deal.\nFund managers were however informed the deal would be launched on Thursday with expected pricing on Friday. The bonds would also be offered in two parts – with the longest maturity up to seven years.\nGoldman Sachs, Commonwealth Bank and Deutsche Bank are managing the bond sale for the technology giant that currently has around $US50 billion ($68 billion) of bonds outstanding.\nMost expected Apple would target a deal size of between $500 million and $1 billion, a size that would represent just 2 per cent of its total debt. The company derives around 6 per cent of its revenues, or $US3 billion from the Asia-Pacific region.\nA deal of that size would break the record for the largest \"kangaroo\" corporate bond – a sale in the Australian dollar market by a foreign corporate entity. So far BHP Billiton holds the record for the largest corporate transaction having issued $1 billion of five year bonds in October 2012, a feat it repeated earlier this year.\nThe deal would also be the first corporate Kangaroo bond of the year with $20 billion issued so far by state-backed supranational, sovereign and agency borrowers and $5 billion issued so far by international banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Global brewer SABMiller which now owns iconic Australian brewer Fosters raised $700 million just last month but the deal was sold out of a local entity.\nMotor giant Other companies appear to be lining up to follow Apple. Japanese motor giant Nissan appointed ANZ Banking Corp and Westpac to arrange fixed income investor roadshows.\nThe Apple bonds are likely to appeal to fund managers seeking high-rated alternatives to Australia's big four banks. Apple has a AA+ credit rating – two notches higher than the AA- rating of the major banks. But Apple may offer attractive pricing compared to the banks based on where their bonds trade in the United States.\nThis means there's a strong likelihood of a win-win for investors keen to buy highly rated companies outside of the banking sector and Apple which can achieve a competitive cost of funds versus other markets.\nA sign of how strong the demand is for AA rated corporate bonds can be observed in the education sector. Earlier this week the University of Sydney which has the same rating as Apple raised $200 million of 10 year bonds at just under 4 per cent of 95 basis points over the bank rate. That level is about the same rate paid by the major banks for five-year funding.\nApple's seven year US bonds convert to a rate of around 120 basis points over the bank rate of around 2.80 per cent, implying that once they offer a new issue concession they could pay between 4 and 4.50 per cent for seven-year money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:58:30.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
