He said he would confer with the speaker of parliament to make the call after the 45-day period to form a government ends Sunday night. “God willing, Turkey will experience a repeat election,” he said.\nThe president’s declaration stands to send the nation back to the ballot-box less than six months after voters delivered Turkey’s first hung parliament since 2002, curbing Erdogan’s bid to expand his powers and unleashing a torrent of political uncertainty.\nWith his move, Erdogan is poised to become the first president to trigger snap polls since Turkey became a republic in 1923, highlighting the extent of his ambition to transform the country’s governance by taking on executive authorities.\nErdogan’s push for early elections comes amid a backdrop of soaring risks as Turkey prepares for joint strikes with the U.S. against Islamic State in Syria, fights an escalating Kurdish insurgency spreading into urban areas, and faces persistent financial volatility that is sending the lira to record lows and stoking economic concerns.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/turkeys-president-erdogan-calls-snap-election-1440167987?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:13:59.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
