This is the second straight day the rate was left largely unchanged.\nMr Capurso said the yuan was becoming a \"fading issue\" for the Australian dollar.\n\"People are barely noticing it anymore, after a few days of excitement last week,\" he said.\nMs Lawson said traders were watching emerging markets which had come under enormous pressure from the yuan devaluation. But for the major currencies, the yuan had gone to the backburner.\n\"After the initial adjustment, this is fairly typical, in the first couple of days the markets are grappling with the new rules, as its not clear how it is going to work,\" she said.\n\"But it has become more market oriented and they get used to it, it goes to the backburner and we go back to watching potential policy moves and the economic [data],\" she said.\nMs Lawson said she expected trading to remain quiet ahead of the US Federal Reserve minutes, due to be released early Thursday morning Australian time, as foreign exchange traders looking for further hints of an interest rate rise in September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:51:13.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
