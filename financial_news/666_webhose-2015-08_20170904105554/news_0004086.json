Mobile money is transforming the way people access financial services,\" researchers at London-based GSMA said in a report. \n\"Traditional 'bricks and mortar' banking infrastructure struggles to make the business model work to serve low-income customers, particularly in rural areas,\" the association added. \nKenya -- the cradle of mobile money, where M-Pesa was launched in March 2007 -- posted a nearly fivefold growth in volumes in as many years to hit $23.7 billion last year; about 39 per cent of GDP. \nUgandans transferred $7.14 billion through mobile phones in the year 2014 while Rwandans moved $0.96 billion from their cellphones over the same period, corresponding to 27 per cent and 12 per cent of GDP respectively. \nTanzania moved $13.9 billion in 2013 -- the latest data available -- which is equivalent to 28 per cent of its GDP. \nKenya is ranked the biggest economy in East Africa with a GDP of $60.94 billion followed by Tanzania ($49.18 billion), Uganda ($26.31 billion) and Rwanda ($7.89 billion), according to a World Bank statistical database dated July 2015. \nBritish telco Vodafone -- which owns a 40 per cent stake at Safaricom and a further 82.2 per cent in Vodacom Tanzania -- said the continued growth of mobile money is attributed to the fact that it services consumers at the bottom of the pyramid who cannot access banking services. \n\"It is not enough to persuade unbanked customers to start using a bank account, nor does it overcome the hurdles that frequently deter customers from having a bank account -- price structure, availability and trust. Mobile money addresses these issues,\" a spokesman at Vodafone said. \nCustomers are also wooed to mobile money due to its extensive network of agents, and the frequent addition of innovative financial products such as micro-insurance, mobile loans and savings accounts. \n\"Mobile telecommunications infrastructure is more reliable and extensive than the banking infrastructure,\" said Stephen Rea, a research assistant at the Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion at the University of California, Irvine. \n\"People adopt whichever services make the most sense for them,\" he said in an interview. \nWidespread \nThe World Bank 2014 Global Findex report says that mobile money is most widespread in East Africa, where one in every five adults has a mobile money account. \nKenya tops the globe with the highest number of adults with a mobile money account, at 58 per cent, followed by Somalia's 37 per cent thanks to its well-entrenched mobile-based Hawala system; Uganda is at 35 per cent and Tanzania 32 per cent. \nAbout eight out of every 10 Kenyan adults are banked -- through banks and mobile money accounts -- ahead of Uganda's 44 per cent, Rwanda's 42 per cent, Tanzania's 40 per cent, and Burundi's seven per cent. \nCross-border mobile money remittances and retail payments for school fees, agricultural products and payment of wages via mobile cash are now seen as the next frontier in the mobile money industry. \n\"Providers are now serving a growing number of verticals such as retail merchants, utility companies, governments and other third parties using mobile money as a payment channel,\" GSMA said.
