Investors sentiment surrounding commodity prices is at its lowest level in decades — but some analysts believe that a rebound is on tap.\n“Investor sentiment for commodities has rarely, if ever, been more negative,” said Julian Jessop, an analyst at Capital Economics, in a note Wednesday. But there are “plenty of reasons to take a contrarian” — and more positive view on commodities.\nYear to date, prices for Brent crude LCOV5, +0.97% have suffered from a loss of more than 24% on the ICE Futures exchange, while West Texas Intermediate crude CLV5, -0.97% was down roughly 27% on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nMetals prices have also seen sizable losses with gold GCZ5, -1.21% down around 4.9% and copper HGU5, -2.12% dropping more than 20% on Comex for the year so far. Palladium PAU5, -1.30% has lost around 34% and platinum’s PLV5, +0.74% down about 19%.\n“This is currently the longest bear market for overall commodities going back at least to 1970,” said Alan Konn, managing director of Price Asset Management and co-chairman of Price Holdings Inc.\nPrice Asset Management, Bloomberg LP A table he provided, comparing annual total returns, shows that the Bloomberg Commodity Index Total Return BCOMTR, -1.32% was down 17% in 2014, compared with a gain of 13.7% for the S&P GSCI Total Return SPGSCITR, -1.25%\nIn broad-based market selloffs, “there can be a lot of selling not necessarily tied to the near-term to intermediate-term demand and supply conditions,” Konn said. “Fear, liquidation of inventory, credit tightness and even margin calls can all lead to additional selling.”\nHe said the commodities selloff began in earnest in early July, starting with a possible default in Greece and its potential to cause slowing in Europe—then slowing growth in China.\n“The fact that the so many commodities and all the sectors together have been selling off together is unusual,” he said. They “may have been partly discounting the actions out of China to devalue the yuan as well as the currency selloff occurring across the globe [resulting] in strength for the dollar, which is generally negative for commodity prices.”\nBut “eventually, commodities will all trade on their own fundamentals of demand and supply,” said Konn.\nContrarian view Indeed, Capital Economics’ Jessop was upbeat on the outlook for commodities.\nHe referred to the fears surrounding China as “grossly overdone,” pointing out that “recent economic data from China have been mixed rather than unrelentingly negative, and have yet to feel the full benefit of additional policy stimulus.”\nChina’s central bank moved to ease the economy further on Wednesday , a day after it cut its benchmark interest rates and lowered the reserve-requirement ratio for banks in the wake of the country’s recent stock-market turmoil.\nJessop said he expects sentiment for commodities to recover slowly over the remainder of the year as the news from China, in particular, improves.\nAnd in the meantime, the “additional weakness in commodity markets will accelerate the cuts in production necessary to rebalance supply and demand at higher prices in the future,” he said.\nGiven all that, he’s expecting some “pretty sizable gains in the prices of most industrial commodities over the coming months.”\nCapital Economics plans to update its commodity forecasts soon but for now, reiterates its year-end targets of $55 for Brent crude and $6,250 per metric ton for copper.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:10:59.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
