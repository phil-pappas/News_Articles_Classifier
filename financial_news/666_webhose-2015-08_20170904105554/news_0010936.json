We need disciplined minds oriented to hard work and caring for the environment' he added. \nMr George Prah, National President of the FGBMFI, Ghana said the objective of the convention is to renew the old days is not because the organisation relish in nostalgia but to reinforce the core values of the fellowship as enshrined in its vision and mission statements. \nHe said the nation needs leaders of integrity, selfless, people's centred with sound morals who would shun bribery, dishonesty, divisiveness in both private and public life. \nHe said corruption has become endemic and undermining the developmental effort as a nation. \nHe said leaders would not emerge until there are disciples in our society to disciple each other. \nMr Prah also announced that the fellowship at this year's convention would unveil a three- year strategic plan to achieve a seven-fold membership for the group. \nHe said the fellowship also intends to increase its local chapters by four-fold. \nHe said for the first time the convention would host a youth summit, which is aimed at building the leaders for tomorrow's Ghana. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T12:34:02.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
