RBS had to be bailed out urgently, but it doesn’t have to be sold off at the same speed.\" \nMr Osborne announced in his Budget last month that he would offload at least £2bn of the bank's shares by next April. \nA Treasury spokesman said: “UK Financial Investments (UKFI) today advised the Chancellor it would be appropriate to conduct the first sale of the Government’s shareholding in the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Chancellor agrees with that advice and has authorised the process to begin. \n“The government set out its objectives for its shareholdings in the banks in the Chancellor’s annual Mansion House speech in June 2013 – getting the best value for the taxpayer, maximising support for the economy and restoring them to private ownership – and as set out in that address, the government will only conclude a sale if these objectives are met. \n“In his Mansion House speech in June this year, the Chancellor announced his intention to start returning RBS to the private sector in the coming months, following advice from the Governor of the Bank of England.” \nLast week, RBS unveiled a half-year loss after taking a string of charges for mis-selling and restructuring, and signalled that dividend payments would not restart until 2017 at the earliest. \nMr Osborne is determined to head off criticism about the sale of an initial tranche of RBS shares at a loss. \nIn a report he commissioned from Rothschild, the investment bank, his advisers concluded that disposing of the taxpayer's entire stake in the bank would crystallise a £7bn loss if fees paid to the Treasury since 2008 were taken into account. \nThey added, however, that the Government could make an overall profit of £14bn from its bank rescues, which included the emergency bailouts of Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock. \nThat view was immediately challenged by Andrew Tyrie, the Treasury Select Committee chairman, who argued that the projected surplus did not include the cost of financing the acquisitions. \n\"The start of a sale programme can send a strong signal that the bank is making strong progress in its restructuring and is well on the way to recovery,\" Rothschild said in its report recommending that the Chancellor kicks off the sale. \n\"Any residual impression amongst investors that the bank may not be run for purely commercial purposes is likely to evaporate very quickly\". \nRBS, the Treasury and UKFI all declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T22:43:31.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
