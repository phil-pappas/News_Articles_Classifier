Mexican and Chilean stocks rose slightly, though a decline in Brazilian bank shares dragged the broader MSCI Latin American stock index to a 1 percent loss. The region's currencies had been trading higher in the early afternoon but reversed course after the newspaper reported that Lockhart said it would take \"significant deterioration\" in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September. Higher interest rates in the world's largest economy are expected to draw funds away from riskier emerging markets such as Colombia and Chile. Both saw their currencies reverse early gains following the report. Meanwhile, Brazil's real hit an over twelve-year low of 3.48 per dollar. Brazilian police on Monday arrested former government minister Jose Dirceu, one of the most senior members of the ruling Workers' Party to be detained so far in a corruption scandal engulfing state-run oil company Petrobras. Traders said the deepening investigation could make it more difficult for the government to achieve the political backing to reach its fiscal goals and get the shrinking economy back on track. Brazil's Bovespa stock index fell for the third session in four. Shares of Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Brazil's largest non-government bank, dropped 3 percent after the company reported a bigger-than-expected jump in loan defaults for the second quarter. Other banking shares followed suit, with rival Banco Bradesco SA and state-run Banco do Brasil SA down 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Yields on Brazilian interest rate futures <0#DIJ:> climbed across the curve as traders demanded higher returns due to the higher political risk scenario.
