The company's efforts are reinforced by its recent survey which showed educators continually reach into their own pockets to make sure they have the supplies to teach their students. \n\"As a company focused on helping educators reach their financial goals, we want to limit the amount of personal resources teachers have to spend in the classroom,\" said Marita Zuraitis, Horace Mann's President and CEO. \"As we start a new school year, we pledge our continued support to DonorsChoose.org, and encourage others to get involved as well.\" \nIn the May 2015 Horace Mann Educator Survey , a quarter of teachers reported spending more than $400 a year of their money. 14% - $600 or more a year (13% - 2013) 13% - $400-$600 (13% - 2013) 30% - $200-$400 (30% - 2013) \nTeachers reported buying general supplies (51%), math and science tools (41%), reading and language materials (38%), and various other supplies. In the 2015 survey, more than 80 percent of teachers reported abandoning at least one project due to lack of funding. \nHorace Mann's \"Seventy in 70\" giveaway in September will fund 70 DonorsChoose.org projects, celebrating Horace Mann's 70 years of serving educators. That giveaway follows Horace Mann's funding of 52 projects in high poverty schools, marking the first time those schools have had a DonorsChoose.org project funded. \nHorace Mann began its partnership with DonorsChoose.org in 2011, and since that time has funded more than $3 million in projects. DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit organization connecting teachers to donors who support classroom projects. Horace Mann agents have introduced teachers to DonorsChoose.org and taught them how to post projects. \nYou can find more details on the programs and how to contact our agents at horacemann.com and on our Facebook page. \nAbout the Horace Mann Advisory Panel \nThe Horace Mann Educator Advisory Panel has been in place since 2004 and consists of educators from across the country.
