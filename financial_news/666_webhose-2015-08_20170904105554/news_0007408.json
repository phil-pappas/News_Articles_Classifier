Still, all three categories remained above where they were a year ago.\nGfK says uncertainty largely comes from the \"unstable international situation\" and that domestic German conditions remain favorable, so \"there is a good chance that the consumer climate will stabilize.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
