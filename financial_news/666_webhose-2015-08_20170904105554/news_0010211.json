The four aircraft arrived at Spangdahlem Air base in Germany on Friday.\n\"The U.S. is conducting reconnaissance of abilities of operating this type of aircraft at an allied airport,\" Polish army spokesman Artur Golawski told Reuters. The planes landed at a military air base in Lask, in central Poland.\nEarlier this month, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh James said the F-22's deployment in Europe would allow U.S. forces to train with NATO partners across Europe, testing the ability of the jets to communicate and fight together with the Eurofighter and other advanced warplanes.\nJames said the deployment would also give F-22 pilots more experience with the European terrain. The Air Force has previously deployed the jets in Japan and South Korea but not in Europe.\nThe stealth tactical fighter aircraft was designed by Lockheed and Boeing Co as a fighter, but it can also be used for ground attack, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence.\nThe jets formally entered service in December 2005, with the last F-22 delivered to the Air Force in 2012.
