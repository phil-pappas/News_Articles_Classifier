But Sanders is just 7 points behind at 30 percent. Vice President Joe Biden – who has not yet entered the race – received 14 percent. A political expert – appearing on CBS' Face The Nation – says Sanders is tapping into the same demographic that helped Barack Obama win in 2008.\n\"So he is losing by seven points. He leads by eight points with people who say this would be the first time they participated in the caucus. He leads by over 20 points with people who say they consider themselves independents and people who are under age 45. Now, that is the Obama coalition. Those are the groups he put together that surprised Hillary Clinton in 2008,” said Ann Selzer, an Iowa pollster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T05:27:57.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
