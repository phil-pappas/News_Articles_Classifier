Shellfish and sea life fossils embedded in the polished stone add a level of refined timelessness to this world class space\".\nA report released by real estate group Colliers International in February cited demand for facilities like bike racks and end-of-trip areas as one of the key drivers of demand in Australia's CBD property markets. Other Sydney CBD buildings to featuring modern end-of trip facilities include Telstra's headquarters at 400 George Street and the proposed $100 million Barrack Place development at 151 Clarence Street.\nGrosvenor Place Management executive director John Derrick said he expected tenants to use the facilities for a range of purposes, from changing after sport to getting ready to go out for evening functions.\n\"The end of trip facilities will provide the highest level of amenity for the building's tenants, invoking a feeling of decadence,\" Mr Derrick said.\nHe said the $9.3 million upgrade was part of a broader vision to revitalise the building to meet the changing work habits.\nIn addition to the lavish changing facilities, particular attention has been paid to those who ride to work through the dust as George Street undergoes its transformation to a pedestrian zone in coming years.\nThere will be 230 bicycle racks and a bike repair room housing a universal bike repair stand equipped with tools and an electric pump.\nA drying room with 54 lockers includes a lycra spinning machine designed to dry clothes in eight seconds, while a vending machine stocks cycling products such as lights, tubes and locks alongside healthy snacks and energy drinks.\nOpened in 1988, Grosvenor Place is jointly owned by several major property players including DEXUS Property, Investa and the Commonwealth Super Fund, run by Arcadia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:58:49.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
