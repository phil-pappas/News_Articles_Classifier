Perspectives Robotics is known for creating Fotokite Pro, a $10,000 drone that uses a tether to provide an unlimited power supply from the ground. Its users include journalists from the BBC. Now the company is targeting hobbyists looking for a small, portable drone to bring on hikes or to picnics.\n“With the broadcast version, you’re looking at high-quality video,” founder Sergei Lupashin said. “With this, you’re looking at affordability and making them accessible.”\nYou can now follow MarketWatch on Yo: The Fotokite Phi is the only consumer drone on the market that doesn’t rely on remote piloting or GPS. Instead, the user points the leash in the direction they want to go and the drone follows.\n“It’s a cross between an airborne pet and a steadicam in the sky,” Lupashin said.\nAt 12 ounces, it’s the lightest GoPro-carrying quadcopter on the market, and it folds into a compact carrying case about the size of a two-liter soda bottle. The leash extends 26 feet, which is about two and a half stories high.\nSally French/MarketWatch Prev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1501/26/wolf.01.html"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T19:33:31.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
