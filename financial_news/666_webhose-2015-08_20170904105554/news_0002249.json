Lifting of sanctions would open up banking channels and Tehran is likely to seek past oil dues.\nIndia is keen that the repayment of dues that have accumulated since February 2013, be done in staggered manner so as to avoid a run on the rupee.\nThe official said RBI will detail out the banking channels as well as payment schedule with its Iranian counterpart.\nSince February 2013, Indian refiners like Essar Oil and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) have been paying 45 per cent of payment due on purchase of crude oil from Iran in rupees through Uco Bank, Kolkatta. The remaining has been accumulating, pending finalisation of a payment mechanism.\nThey had last year paid nearly USD 3 billion in six instalments through a limited payment channel following start of nuclear talks between the West and Iran. The outstanding has since climbed to over USD 6.5 billion.\nEssar Oil owes USD 3.34 billion, MRPL USD 2.49 billion and IOC USD 581 million to Iran. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL) owes USD 97 million and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) another USD 29 million.\nBesides, about Rs 17,000 crore was lying in Iranian account with Uco Bank.\nIndia is keen that Iran continue to give Indian refiners favourable terms – like insurance and shipping as well as 90-day credit period, on oil it sells to India, its second biggest customer after China.\nUnder US pressure, New Delhi has restricted import of Iranian oil at 11 million tonnes in past two fiscals. But with easing of sanctions, it will look to increase imports provided Tehran continues to extend the fiscal terms, the official said.\n 05, 2015 6:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:22:36.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
