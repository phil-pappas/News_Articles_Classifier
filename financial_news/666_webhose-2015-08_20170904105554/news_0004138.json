Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) has agreed to pay $129.5 million, a person familiar with the matter said. \nThe Wall Street Journal in June reported that HSBC would pay $285 million while Barclays would pay $375 million. Those numbers remain unconfirmed, and the banks on Thursday either declined comment or did not respond to a request for comment. \nThe plaintiffs previously announced $808.5 million settlements with four banks, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in May disclosed it had reached a deal without announcing the terms. \nInvestors including hedge funds and pension funds accused the banks of having impeded competition by conspiring to manipulate the fix in chat rooms, instant messages and emails. \nAs part of the scheme, the plaintiffs said, traders at the banks from 2003 through 2013 used chat rooms with names such as \"The Cartel,\" \"The Bandits' Club,\" and \"The Mafia\" to communicate with each other \nThey said traders manipulated prices through tactics such as \"front running,\" \"banging the close\" and \"painting the screen,\" using disguised names to swap confidential orders. \nThe class action settlements came after four of the banks -Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C - news ) , JPMorgan Chase & Co (Xetra: 850628 - news ) , Barclays and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) - pleaded guilty in May to fraud charges for trying to manipulate foreign exchange rates. \nIn total, U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . and European regulators so far have extracted more than $10 billion in settlements with seven banks over the alleged manipulation schemes. \nIn the class action, previously announced settlements include $99.5 million from JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) , $394 million from Citigroup, $180 million from Bank of America Corp and $135 million from UBS AG (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) . \nThe case is In re: Foreign Exchange Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-07789.
