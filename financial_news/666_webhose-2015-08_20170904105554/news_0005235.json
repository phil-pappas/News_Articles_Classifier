Michael, Ethiopian Airlines Area Manager for Ghana, says the airline is poised to serve its customers better with the introduction of new routes in its network in recent months. \nShe said the new routes would provide passengers with more connectivity and flexibility in their travels. \nSpeaking at an awards dinner held by the airline to award its top performing travel agents, Ms Michael said Ethiopian Airlines is performing very well on the Ghanaian market with the introduction of its new aircraft, the Boeing 787. \n'We are performing very well, we have a better load now,' she stated adding that the load factor for the aircraft is now about 70 per cent. \nMs Michael attributed the good performance to interventions including downward revision of its fares, increase of commissions for travel agents as well as advertisements. \nShe said the award dinner was held to show the airline's appreciation to the travel agents who have helped to boost their performance. \nThe airline presented checks with undisclosed amounts to 20 travel agents at the ceremony held in Accra. \nThe agents included Graceland Travel and Tours Limited, Accra Air Travel Centre Ltd, H&M Travel and Tourism, Kenpong Travel and Tourism, African Origin Travels, Johnson Travels, Kumasi Travel Agency, Plus 1 Travel and Tour, And Jokar Travel and Tours limited, among others. \nEleven out of the 20 agents also received certificates for their outstanding performance. These were Satguru, Afro Wings, Travel Matters, Doscar, FJ Travel and Tours, GS Plaza, Jubilee Travel and Tours, Pozar Travel and Tours, Platinum Tours and Travel Limited, Stellar Travel and Tours and Melcom Travel and Tours Limited. \nMr Ikechi Uko, guest of honour at the event, urged the agents to work harder in order to help propel the airline and their businesses forward. \nHe said the event would be held two to three times a year. \nMr Uko said Ethiopian Airlines was the most profitable airline in Africa and 18th most profitable in the world as well as the 30th biggest airline in the world and was the first after Japan airlines to use the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. \nIn the past three months, it has started new routes through Manila, Japan, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Goma, Dublin and Cameroun, bringing its routes to 91 and hopes to fly to over 100 destinations. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:09:05.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
