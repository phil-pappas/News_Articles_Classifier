Bloomberg Share on twitter by Kate Cowling The self-managed super fund industry has hit back at claims the funds they represent have a hunger for short-term yield, which will end up slowing down the economy.\nEconomist Stephen Anthony, the incoming chief economist for Industry Super Australia, told The Australian Financial Review small funds were \"in a flight to short-termism\" , often flocking to domestic shares for their tax benefits, but overlooking the impact on economic growth.\nA Credit Suisse analysis released in May said that of the around $600 billion in self-managed funds, $260 billion is invested in equities and that was expected to increase at the rate of $1 billion a month. \"Selfies remain imperative in driving investor demand for dividends,\" the note said.\nMr Anthony's remarks added to a growing debate about whether Australia's investment and corporate management cultures have become anti-growth and overly defensive â€“ effectively threatening the next wave of potential economic opportunities.\nBut the industry said the comments contradicted research about how self-managed funds invest.\n\"It's not supported by any evidence that I've seen,\" Graeme Colley, technical director of the SMSF Association, said.\nMr Colley was previously tasked with monitoring investment patterns for the industry and said the only time he saw what could be described as short-term reactive behaviour was during the global financial crisis.\nStrong sticklers to equities, loans \"We used to do surveys [which showed SMSF investors] were pretty strong sticklers to equities and loans and they certainly didn't jump around,\" he said.\n\"Out of 500,000 funds, there are some that do trade, but for the most part they're pretty stable.\n\"We're now we're seeing a greater proportion of payments coming out of [SMSFs] as pensions, which further demonstrates they're there for the long term, because they need to have enough cash to pay their pensions.\n\"Then once they get into retirement, it's a stable investment strategy because they want the money to be there for the rest of their life.\"\nDarren Kingdon, a director for the Self-managed Independent Superannuation Funds Association and a financial planner at Kingdon Financial Group, called for evidence to back up the \"flight to short-termism\".\n\"I don't think there would be any statistics that could quantify that claim,\" he said.\n\"There's a strong property flavour to the SMSF investment world, but I don't see an awful lot of clients chasing short-term return through the active trading of shares. I've seen that very rarely.\"\nHis colleague, chairman Michael Lorimer added \"if SMSFs have got a little too much cash at a certain point in time, it's not a reflection of short-termism, [but] where they are in the cycle\".\nInvestment philosophy Mr Lorimer said self-managed funds tend to be invested in growth assets, but do so for the long term and don't move in and out of them based on the potential for immediate gain.\nAndrew Zbik, a senior financial planner at Omniwealth, said in his experience, self-managed fund investors often have large holdings in assets such as residential property, which aren't quick or easy to sell, and so, he stressed, matched their investment philosophy.\n\"What we see, is those [SMSF] savings being used to buy assets that are illiquid and need to be held over the long term,\" he said.\nMr Anthony said industry super funds outperform their retail and SMSF counterparts partly because of their allocation to infrastructure and other unlisted asset classes that tend to look long term when investing.\nIt is difficult for small funds to invest in infrastructure given the high dollar threshold, but SMSF Association managing director Andrea Slattery told a conference last week she had been lobbying for the market to be unlocked.\n\"The large infrastructure investments don't offer anything less than $100 billion and they are not producing anything that's lower. It's a real problem because a lot of Australians would like to invest directly into infrastructure and that could and should be the opportunity,\" she said.\n\"SMSF trustees invest long term, they're very sticky; once they trust something they'll invest in it for a long time.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:56:28.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
