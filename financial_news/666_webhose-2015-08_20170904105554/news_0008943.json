RBS had to be bailed out urgently, but it doesn’t have to be sold off at the same speed.\" \nMr Osborne announced in June that he would begin reducing the Government's 79% stake in RBS in the coming months, while his Budget last month pledged to offload at least £2bn of the bank's shares by next April. \nThe initial sale is likely to comprise between £2bn and £3bn-worth of shares, equating to a roughly 6% stake in RBS. \nLast week, RBS unveiled a half-year loss after taking a string of charges for mis-selling and restructuring, and signalled that dividend payments would not restart until 2017 at the earliest. \nMr Osborne is determined to head off criticism about the sale of an initial tranche of RBS shares at a loss. \nIn a report he commissioned from Rothschild, the investment bank, his advisers concluded that disposing of the taxpayer's entire stake in the bank would crystallise a £7bn loss if fees paid to the Treasury since 2008 were taken into account. \nThey added, however, that the Government could make an overall profit of £14bn from its bank rescues, which included the emergency bailouts of Bradford & Bingley, Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock. \nThat view was immediately challenged by Andrew Tyrie, the Treasury Select Committee chairman, who argued that the projected surplus did not include the cost of financing the acquisitions. \n\"The start of a sale programme can send a strong signal that the bank is making strong progress in its restructuring and is well on the way to recovery,\" Rothschild said in its report recommending that the Chancellor kicks off the sale. \n\"Any residual impression amongst investors that the bank may not be run for purely commercial purposes is likely to evaporate very quickly\". \nA senior fund manager at one leading City institution said on Monday that RBS shares were \"unattractive\" at the current level and that he would not be participating in a Treasury sale. \n\"We think Ross (McEwan, RBS chief executive) is doing an excellent job, but the shares have already priced in the profit recovery for the next two years, and without a dividend supporting them, it's just not a sensible level to invest at,\" the source said. \nRBS, the Treasury and UKFI all declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:53:11.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
