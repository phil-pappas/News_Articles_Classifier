Supporters claim the A1 protein is actually responsible for the discomfort many attribute to lactose intolerance.\nPart of the show’s criticism was of a Curtin University study in support of the health claims which was funded by a2 Milk.\nManaging director Geoff Babidge said the company has just completed new clinical trials in China around milk sensitivity, with the results submitted for publication.\n“We had a view that certain aspects relating to that program were potentially misleading and deceptive,” he said. “The company is [now] funding significant research and support of clinical trials around issues of dairy sensitivity.”\nAsian consumers traditionally report higher levels of sensitivity to milk than western consumers, and Mr Babidge believes the China trials prove the company is uniquely positioned for growth in those markets.\na2 Milk Company (Frame content direct link: http://markets.news.com.au/embed/A2M/640 .)\nIt comes as the New Zealand-based milk producer posted a 40 per cent increase in revenue to $155.109 million for the year ended June 30.\nMr Babidge said the result was largely off the back of huge demand for the company’s a2 Platinum infant formula, which was the fastest-growing grocery brand in the last quarter in Australia.\nTotal sales for the infant formula were $41.671 million, up 445 per cent on the previous year. That was largely through sales to China, but Australian sales increased 650 per cent in the same period.\nMr Babidge said in the first two months of this financial year, infant formula sales in Australia were already an estimated $13 million.\n“You can get a flavour of the growth coming through,” he said. “We continue to get substantial feedback from consumers both in China and Australia that infants appear to be able to much more comfortably digest our formula compared to other brands.”\na2 increased its share of the Australian fresh milk market to an estimated 9.3 per cent by value, with sales up 10 per cent on the previous year.\nDespite the revenue boost, the company posted a full-year net loss of $2.091 million as it absorbed the costs associated with listing on the Australian Stock Exchange and employee share scheme expenses.\nOn the basis of FY15 performance, a2 Milk is forecasting FY16 revenue to increase by 72 per cent to $267 million, and before-tax earnings to rise a massive 150 per cent to $12 million.\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=a2%26%238217%3Bs+secret+weapon+in+the+milk+wars&c=THE+a2+Milk+Company+has+just+posted+a+massive+increase+in+revenue%2C+and+it%26%238217%3Bs+largely+thanks+to+a+new+product+which+is+flying+off+the+shelves.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7&h=a2%26%238217%3Bs+secret+weapon+in+the+milk+wars", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7&title=a2%26%238217%3Bs+secret+weapon+in+the+milk+wars", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/a2s-secret-weapon-in-the-milk-wars/story-fnkgdftz-1227491739283?sv=c5f486835a34d0d90fa9fd2a35aadde7&title=a2%26%238217%3Bs+secret+weapon+in+the+milk+wars"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T09:12:00.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
