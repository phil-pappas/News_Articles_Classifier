Ben Rushton by Ben Potter EXCLUSIVE Brian Parker, the top construction union official in NSW, allegedly told a project manager at a school building site that \"you will do what I f**king say\" and \"we want the Chinese [workers] to stop\", a new federal court action by the building industry watchdog claims.\nMr Parker, NSW state secretary of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, Rebel Hanlon, the assistant state secretary and the union face 11 charges that they made baseless claims that entitlements were not being paid and illegal-immigrant workers were being used in order to gain access to the building site in July and August last year.\nFair Work Building and Construction (FWBC) director Nigel Hadgkissâ€‹ said allegations of union officials unlawfully entering a site and then trying to sign up members were very serious.\n\"Under law all building industry participants have a right to be or not be a member of a union or employer association,\" Mr Hadgkiss said. The CFMEU told the Australian Financial Review it will defend the latest action.\nThe fresh civil charges join a record caseload of 52 separate actions that FWBC is juggling in courts across Australia. Most of the charges are aimed at the CFMEU, which is also the main target of the Heydon royal commission into unions.\nThey come as the Abbott government prepares to resubmit legislation to the Senate this week reviving the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which the former Labor government downgraded to a division of Fair Work Australia with reduced powers.\nThe revival of the commission is part of a campaign against the militant construction union by the government, which includes support for developer Grocon and building materials group Boral in their battles with the union and the Heydon royal commission.\nThe royal commission's interim report recommended Mr Parker be referred to prosecutors for possible charges, and that the union should investigate if he had engaged in gross misbehaviour and should be removed from office.\n In the case FWBC alleges that when asked for his right of entry notice, Mr Parker puffed out his chest and said loudly, \"Do you understand who I am and what my position is? If you don't get the workers together I'm going to do it,\" and, \"You will do what I f**king say and don't f**k me around.\"\nMr Parker and Mr Hanlon allegedly told the project manager that contractors on the $65 million project to build three schools at The Ponds, NSW, were not paying workers and employing illegal immigrant labour.\nMr Parker allegedly told a meeting of about 30 workers they needed to pass a resolution to \"pull up the job\" to help the union resolve the issues, FWBC says.\nHe allegedly said he would let them back to work if they passed the resolution, adding, \"But if we need to stop work on the job until we sort it out, then I will go back into management and say to them, 'The guys are back to work but we want the Chinese to stop'.\"\nEarlier Mr Hanlon attended the site and told the workers to stop work and that they \"must join the union\", the action alleges. FWBC says allegations of non-payment of entitlements and illegal labour were found to be baseless.\nThe construction union faces six civil charges under the Fair Work Act. Mr Hanlon faces three charges and Mr Parker faces two charges. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of $51,000 for the union and $10,200 for the officials.\nThe union's battles against FWBC, Grocon and Boral have cost it more than $7 million in damages, fines and penalties in the past year alone, in addition to legal costs \"north of $2 million\" at the Heydon royal commission.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:56:12.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
