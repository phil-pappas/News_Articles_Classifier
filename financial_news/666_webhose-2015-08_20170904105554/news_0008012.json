Jewellery and other apparel were also hard hit.\nOverall food and specialty stores, including giftware, pharmacy and cosmetics, pets, discount variety, tobacconists, florists and toys, were up 4.4 per cent in sales, while department and discount department stores were down.\nHowever, the low Australian dollar has been an advantage, as there are fewer online sales and less overseas travel, meaning more domestic visitors to their local shopping centres.\nThe group's portfolio, which includes The Glen, Chadstone, which will have the first Legoland Discovery Centre in Australia, and Emporium, Melbourne and Chatswood Chase, Sydney, has high occupancy at 98.9 per cent.\nFederation and Novion Property merged earlier this year, which under a scheme of arrangement required a vote of approval from Novion investors, but has seen a majority of Novion executives taking over from Federation staff.\nThat included at the top with Novion's chief executive, Angus McNaughton replacing Federation's Steven Sewell, together with the finance director Tom Honan, Mark Wilson and Kerrie Lavey​.\nAt the results on Wednesday, Mr McNaughton said direct comparisons for net profit were difficult, but the aggregated 2015 financial year underlying earnings were $683.1 million, up 6.2 per cent.\nThis is not comparable to the 2015 financial year forecast for Federation Centres.\nA final distribution of 8.5¢ per security will be paid on August 27, taking the full year distribution to 16.9¢ per security.\nWhile it was hard to make any comparisons with last year's earnings, UBS analysts said \"all appears on track and confirms that there is nothing sinister from change in management\".\n\"Given recent sell off post management change, relative valuation looks attractive, and likely to close post result,\" the analysts said.\nMr McNaughton said the results were boosted by the development pipeline, a focus on asset management and a \"smooth\" transition between the groups.\n\"The strategic focus or strategy of the business has not changed. We've already achieved over 60 per cent of our operational cost synergies on a run rate or annualised basis,\" he said.\nOn the proposed fund he said the group has long-term relationships with \"some of the best investors in the market across the globe\".\n\"One of the things we'll evaluate is whether we should take some assets off the balance sheet and set up an open-ended retail fund.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:35:26.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
