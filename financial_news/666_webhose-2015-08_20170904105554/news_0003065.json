Reuters Oil and copper prices slumped to six-year lows and other commodities tumbled on Tuesday after China devalued the yuan, raising concerns that a persistently weaker currency will choke demand in the world's top consumer.\nAdding to a weeks-long summer selloff that has rattled raw material investors and producers, major commodity markets fell 3 per cent or more after China's central bank made what it called a \"one-off depreciation\" of nearly 2 per cent in the yuan after a run of poor economic data, which sent the currency to a three-year low.\nThe dollar gave up immediate gains made after the devaluation, which ordinarily would boost dollar-denominated assets, but such is the importance of China to commodities demand that investors overlooked any weakness in the US currency.\n\"When you have the biggest customer for oil and commodities devaluing, then obviously you find your product coming under pressure and that is really how the day has panned out,\" said Saxo Bank commodities strategist Ole Hansen.\n\"We've see this kind of competitive devaluations (in other currencies) over the last year, which left the (yuan) relatively over valued and they are reacting to that because their economy cannot sustain a strong currency at this stage,\" he said.\nChina's decision followed weekend data that showed a steep fall in exports and a slide in producer prices to a near six-year low in July. China's strong yuan policy, partly designed to foster its use as an international currency, has hurt low-end export manufacturers.\nThe devaluation could be the first shot of a global currency war.\nBenchmark Brent crude oil futures fell 2.4 per cent to $US49.18 a barrel. U.S. prices fell 4 per cent to $US43.08, the lowest settlement price since 2009.\n Adding to the pressure on crude was a monthly report from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in which it said it expected no extra demand for its crude oil this year despite faster global growth in consumption.\nConcern about a slowing in the Chinese economy has been compounded by a rout in its equity market that has wiped 8 per cent off the value of blue-chip stocks so far this quarter.\nChinese consumption of oil accounts for more than 10 per cent of global demand, while demand for copper equates to between 45 to 50 per cent of total consumption for the metal that is the backbone of the electronics industry.\nThree-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell by 3.5 per cent to $US5125 a tonne, its lowest since 2009.\nChicago corn futures slid 3.3 per cent to $US3.76-1/2 per bushel, while new-crop November soybeans fell 2.3 per cent to $US9.71-1/2 a bushel, with prices also pressured by easing concerns over dry US weather.\nThe fear among investors is that China's decision is not a one off, but rather has the longer-term aim of making its exports more competitive.\n\"The intention is to encourage exports and the government may figure out several solutions for that, not just the exchange rate,\" said Wang Li, a consultant at CRU Group in Beijing.\nCredit Suisse said \"it would take much bigger action to ease the pain among exporters, but in our view, that is not on the high priority list of the decision makers.\"\nSpot gold, which tends to benefit from heightened investor uncertainty, rose 0.4 per cent to $US1108 an ounce.\nGold has been under pressure this year from an impending hike in US interest rates and has struggled to hold above $US1100 since a July 20 rout that pushed it down to $US1077 on July 24, its cheapest since 2010.\nBut the prospect of an all-out race to the bottom among exporting nations enticed some safe-haven buying.\n\"Gold is benefiting from fears that this is a new round of 'currency war',\" Macquarie analyst Matthew Turner said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:12:28.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
