Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Peak welfare and business lobby groups – locked in intense negotiations with unions and other major groups ahead of next week's reform summit – have joined forces to urge Canberra not to rule out changes to capital gains tax, negative gearing and superannuation reform.\nBoth the Australian Council for Social Services and the Business Council of Australia are calling for \"all options\" to remain on the table to ensure the tax system becomes more efficient and equitable, even though many of these have already been ruled out by the government.\nWriting in Thursday's The Australian Financial Review , ACOSS chief executive Cassandra Goldie says the nation won't progress on tax reform as long as the debate is framed by \"simple slogans such as 'lower taxes'.\"\n\"The reality is that, as the population ages – and our reasonable expectations of the healthcare system increase – governments will need more revenue to provide this and other essential services.\"\nMs Goldie writes that there should be a debate about increasing the GST to ensure clarity over what the extra revenue would be used for, but said the case for using the proceeds to lower income tax \"is weak\".\n\"ACOSS accepts that all options should be considered to strengthen our revenue base,\" she says. \"But we should first explore more equitable ones than raising the GST such as restoring the personal income tax system for people over 65.\n\"Less than one in five older people now pay any income tax, due their higher tax free threshold and the sheltering of income from tax through superannuation.\"\nShe argues in favour of other solutions such as closing tax shelters, replacing inefficient stamp duty with land taxes and treating investment income consistently.\n \"In this way, governments can raise more revenue, and do so more fairly and efficiently.\"\nThe remarks suggest ACOSS has found common ground with another major group, the BCA, who earlier this month backed winding-back the 50 per cent discount on capital gains, arguing it can distort investor behaviour at times of rapid asset price gains.\nCommon plan Both groups, as well as the Australian Council of Trade Unions and two major thinktanks – the Grattan and Menzies Institutes – are working to produce a common plan for reform at next week's reform summit, co-hosted by The Australian Financial Review and its rival, The Australian .\nWhile there are signs of consensus between the BCA and ACOSS on tax, differences between the two thinktanks hired to support the summit have become more marked.\nA paper released this week by the Menzies Research Centre takes the Grattan Institute to task for arguing in its submissions to the summit that budget reform must involve an increase in taxes.\n\"All tax increases impose economic costs,\" the centre says in the paper. \"However, the Grattan Institute ignores those costs, with the result that it underestimates the damage its proposals would inflict on growth and jobs.\"\nCalls by the Melbourne-based Grattan institute to wind back ballooning superannuation tax concessions are condemned as \"poorly thought through\" and likely to trigger \"significant unintended consequences.\n\"Far from being low, effective tax rates on long held superannuation are high, both in absolute terms and by international standards,\" the Menzies' paper says.\nFundamental problem The Menzies centre's basic assertion is that Australia's fundamental problem is that public spending has increased far more rapidly than gross domestic product, a charge the Grattan Institute counters by pointing out that the claim is selectively based on the years since 2008, when the surging terms of trade boosted nominal growth – effectively driving down the expenditure-to-GDP ratio.\nGrattan chief executive officer John Daley concedes spending-to-GDP is higher than it was, but this ignores all the new demands being placed on the budget, which remains seriously in deficit.\n\"We're now trying to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme and a lot of health expenditure. And it's worth remembering when we're funding a lot of health expenditure that over the last five or six years life expectancy has gone up.\n\"The [Menzies argument that ] you can't possibly look at the tax lever until you can absolutely prove 100 per cent that every dollar of expenditure isn't wasted is not realistic.\n\"As a matter of practical reality you need to look at both the tax and the spending side.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-19T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:56:03.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
