It is dated August 2015 and does not indicate when the expansion could take place.\nThe CME is considering the change, along with other adjustments to its corn futures contract, based on feedback from focus groups, according to a note at the beginning of the survey.\nThe Chicago-based company periodically reviews all CME and CBOT agricultural products to ensure they meet customer trading and risk management needs, the note says.\n\"Several themes emerged over the course of many conversations, including locational differentials, storage rates, quality differentials, and delivery territories,\" it says.\nThe CME is planning to update the way delivery costs are calculated on the Illinois River to reflect higher shipping costs, according to the survey.\n(Reporting by Tom Polansek ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:35:47.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
