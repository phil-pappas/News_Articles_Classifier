The SPX closed higher last week, marking six consecutive weeks alternating between gains and losses,\" Jonathan Krinsky, the Chief Market Technician at investment firm, MKM Partners, based in Stamford, Conn., wrote in an Aug. 16 note to clients. \"It remains in the narrowest trading range in history, and as a result, the SPX's weekly Bollinger Bands are as narrow as they have been in over twenty years.\" More Headlines 8 Back-to-School Stocks for an A+ Portfolio \nThe S&P 500 index is up 2.07% this year. The Index has not registered a 5% pullback all year. \"Since 1928, there have only been five years without such an occurrence, and only one in the last 50 years ('95),\" Krinsky wrote. \n\"Until the trading range can break decisively, we recommend continuing to buy relative winners, and sell relative losers,\" the note said. \nFrom a technical standpoint, the stocks all have charts that are generally are \"below all of their rising moving averages, and have poor relative strength vs. the S&P 500. The presumption is they continue to underperform in the intermediate-term. In many cases, however, they are quite oversold, so we would prefer to wait for some sort of bounce before selling,\" Krinsky wrote. \nHere's the list. And when you're done be sure to check out the 24 stocks to sell before September , according to MKM Partners. TheStreet added ratings from TheStreet Ratings for another perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on Aug. 18, 2015 closing prices. \nIndustry: Consumer Goods & Services/Auto Parts & Equipment Market Cap: $10.7 billion \nBorgWarner Inc. manufactures and sells engineered automotive systems and components primarily for powertrain applications worldwide. \nTheStreet Ratings: Buy, B TheStreet Said: \"We rate BORGWARNER INC (BWA) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, good cash flow from operations and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had lackluster performance in the stock itself.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.49, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. To add to this, BWA has a quick ratio of 1.64, which demonstrates the ability of the company to cover short-term liquidity needs. Net operating cash flow has slightly increased to $286.60 million or 2.43% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, BORGWARNER INC has also modestly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -1.97%. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Auto Components industry and the overall market on the basis of return on equity, BORGWARNER INC has underperformed in comparison with the industry average, but has exceeded that of the S&P 500. BORGWARNER INC's earnings per share declined by 21.7% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, BORGWARNER INC increased its bottom line by earning $2.86 versus $2.71 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($3.01 versus $2.86). BWA, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 5.3%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly dropped by 7.5%. Weakness in the company's revenue seems to have hurt the bottom line, decreasing earnings per share.
