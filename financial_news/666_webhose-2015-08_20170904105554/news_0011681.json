The result was below analysts' forecasts around $7.73 billion. \nNet profit dropped 86 percent, as BHP took $2.9 billion in post-tax charges that it flagged previously, mainly on its U.S. shale and Nickel West businesses. \nBHP said it had achieved $4.1 billion in cost cuts, two years ahead schedule as it looked to protect its investment grade rating, and said it would generate more savings in the year ahead by working its operations even harder. \nThe miner spun off the company South32 to shareholders in May with a string of unloved assets as it sought to simplify down to four main commodities - iron ore, copper, coal and petroleum - but has been hit by sliding prices for all four due to slowing growth in China. \nBHP raised its full year dividend to $1.24 from $1.21, which was less than analysts' forecasts around $1.27. \n(Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T12:22:40.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
