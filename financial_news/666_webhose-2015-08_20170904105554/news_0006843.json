At the prior auction, they bought 32.26 percent.\nOverall demand at the auction improved from the last auction. The ratio of bids submitted to the amount offered rose to 2.58, up from 2.27 at the prior auction in April and the strongest in four auctions.\nThe reopened five-year TIPS cleared at a yield of 0.305 percent, compared with a yield of -0.335 percent in April and the highest since the 0.395 percent at the December auction.
