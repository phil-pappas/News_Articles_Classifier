Sean Davey Share on twitter by Karen Maley Are investors of the future likely to shun financial advisers and turn to \"robo-advisers\" when they want advice on shaping their investment portfolios?\nCertainly, some of the world's biggest fund managers are preparing themselves for the possibility that more and more of their clients will gravitate towards digital, rather than personal, investment advice.\nThis week US giant BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, acquired FutureAdvisor in a deal estimated to value the San Francisco-based automated advisory group between $US150 million and $US200 million ($278 million).\nBut while BlackRock is the first leading fund manager to acquire a robo-adviser, other big fund managers have already shown an enthusiasm for online financial advice. Last year, Fidelity began offering a product from the robo-adviser Betterment to financial advisers who use its Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services division. Vanguard Group and Charles Schwab Corp have launched services that offer online advice, although this is augmented with access to individual financial advisers.\nThat top players in the global funds management industry are embracing technology is a vindication for early investors who stumped up venture capital for the fledgling online advisory sector. For decades, start-ups have been trying to develop software to manage the investment portfolios for retail investors, who often find it inconvenient or too expensive to use a traditional financial planner.\nThey're also trying to appeal to millennials who are likely to choose a smartphone app over a face-to-face conversation with a financial planner. Typically, robo-advisers perform many of the same functions of a traditional financial planner, using information about a client's age,income, risk tolerance and investment goals to build an investment portfolio.\nThe computer software also allows for new deposits to be made for the account, and for the portfolio to be automatically rebalanced should asset weightings diverge too far from the original plan. Because no human is involved in the asset allocation process, robo-advisers charge significantly lower fees than traditional financial advisers. For instance, after filling out a questionnaire on FutureAdvisor's website, individual investors receive a recommended portfolio of index funds. For an annual fee of 0.5 per cent, the firm makes the recommended trades, and its computer model automatically monitors the portfolio, rebalancing where necessary.\nInvestors managing their own savings can get investment recommendations free.The lower fees mean that robo-advisers are likely to appeal to the\"mass-affluent\" segment of the market â€“ people with investable funds of between $100,000 and $1 million. Many top-end financial planners require that their clients have at least $2 million to invest.\n The growing popularity of robo-advisers has defied many pundits in the financial services sector who argued that when it came to their hard-earned retirement savings, people would insist on dealing in person with their financial advisers, rather than using a digital service. But with their investment portfolios struggling to deliver satisfactory returns, many investors are looking to reduce the amount they pay for their investment advice.\nAt the same time, regulators in several countries are moving to tighten up the rules on financial advice, which is pushing up costs.\nSome, however, warn that there are potential risks in relying on robo-advisers. Many of these services have very short records, which means that they have not been tested across a variety of market conditions. What's more, each robo-adviser uses its own proprietary software model, which means that the performance of any investor's portfolio will depend on which robo-adviser they choose.\nAnd some robo-advisers fail to take into account an investor's existing holdings of shares and bonds when they work out the asset allocation.\nDespite these limitations, there seems little doubt that Australian savers will likely make greater use of automated investment advice, including robo-advisers, in deciding how best to manage the $2 trillion in retirement savings they've accumulated.\nThe final report of the Financial System Inquiry, which was headed by former Commonwealth Bank chief David Murray, highlighted the potential for technology to reduce the cost of financial advice. The Murray Inquiry noted that Australian consumers showed a conspicuous lack of trust in the financial planning industry, with research undertaken by Roy Morgan showing that only 28 per cent of participants gave financial planners \"high\" or \"very high\" ratings for ethics and honesty.\nTo improve the quality of advice, the Murray Inquiry recommended that financial advisers be required to hold higher educational qualifications and undergo continual professional development.\nBut many in the financial planning industry are worried about the costs of raising education standards. And the Murray Inquiry itself noted that \"raising the minimum competency standards may increase the cost of advice for consumers\".\nTo counteract this cost pressure, the Murray Inquiry pointed out that \"various cost-effective market developments are emerging\" in financial planning, including using technology to deliver financial advice. And it encouraged financial advisers \"to develop new models for delivering advice more cost effectively to sit alongside existing comprehensive face-to-face advice models\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-08-28T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:14:30.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
