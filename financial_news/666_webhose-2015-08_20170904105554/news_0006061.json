This is a huge deal for small business owners and lenders, and a great sign for the future of the economy.Maria Contreras-Sweet said in a statement the SBA released, “We have seen record levels of lending this year, showing us that America’s small businesses are thriving and yearning to grow.“While the SBA isn’t the biggest source of capital for the small business owner, it’s a really great indicator of how the small business market is doing.The number of businesses looking for a small business loan is a great indicator of future growth for the economy. Experian has partnered up with Moody’s in recent years to release a quarterly index showing the health of the small business sector and you guessed it, it’s growing.“The Experian/Moody’s Analytics Small Business Credit Index (SBCI) added 1.5 points to reach 116.7 from a revised 115.2 in the third quarter (previously 114.8). The index measures credit conditions for firms with fewer than 100 workers, and last quarter’s move puts it at an all-time high. This is the third consecutive quarterly gain for the index amid swiftly improving small-business credit conditions.”Between the raised cap and the index, I’d say now is a great time to be a small business owner, and it’s only going to get better. Not only is the raised cap a great sign for the economy it’s also a great thing for small businesses in the short term. The SBA provides government backed loans that allow lending institutions to lend to small businesses that they might not otherwise lend to. With the government taking on the majority of the risk, the interest rate can be lower, and more small businesses can find capital.While some people complain about the SBA and the raised cap, saying that it’s money wasted, people have to realize that when you help the small business sector, you help yourself. When small businesses grow, jobs are created, and when jobs are created, more people have money to spend, boosting the local and national economies.Though I love the SBA, there are some things that they can definitely improve on, and one of those is expanding beyond banks. After banks left small businesses behind in 2008, alternative lenders rose up and found ways to finance the business owners that the banks wouldn’t touch. Not only that, they found ways to make the underwriting process faster and simpler, making it easier for these small business owners to get the loans they need to grow.So why don’t alternative lenders play a bigger role in these SBA loans?Gene Marks recently wrote an article in the Washington Post talking about four ways the SBA could improve. One of these suggestions was expanding to include alternative lenders in the government backed loan process. “The SBA should continue to expand its partnerships with the private sector, from online lenders to crowdfunding sites to large corporations who also offer grants and financing to small businesses. “Maybe it’s regulatory, or it requires an approval process, but the benefits of having alternative lenders participate far outweigh the cost. Lenders like OnDeck, Lending Club, and DealStruck have found really innovative ways to fund these small businesses quickly and efficiently, so adding them into the mix would only benefit small business owners.While banks and community credit unions continue to do great things to support their local economies, it’s hard for them to innovate and create new underwriting processes. This keeps them moving at slower paces than alternative lenders. I’m convinced as the alternative small business lending space grows, the SBA will start incorporating them into the space.It’s a great time to be a small business owner, and the future looks bright. The economy is taking off in a great way, and while we still have work to do, I’m certain that small business owners are going to continue growing and innovating.What are your thoughts? Are you involved in the small business lending space? If so, I’d love to hear from you.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2015/07/02/commentary-four-suggestions-to-make-the-sba-more-relevant/", "http://www.experian.com/business-information/small-business-credit-index.html"], "published": "2015-08-18T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T13:37:58.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
