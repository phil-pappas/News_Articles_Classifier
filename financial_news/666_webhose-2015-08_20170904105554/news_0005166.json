Prasa's chief executive' Lucky Montana' was recently dismissed. He subsequently laid fraud and criminal charges against a number of Prasa executives \n\"Given the revelations of the recent past concerning the Passenger Rail Agency, I am of the singular view that an independent institution such as the office of the Auditor General, is better placed and empowered to look into financial affairs at Prasa with a view to identify areas of weakness and recommend corrective measures. \n\"I have been in consultation with the Board and senior management of PRASA in the past weeks. I have asked several questions, the responses of which largely inform my decision,\" said the Minister. \nShe said the Auditor General's office had previously produced reports regarding financial management at Prasa. \n\"I have thus requested the Auditor General's office to look into those past reports and immediately attend to identified areas of concern. As the executive authority I take primary responsibility for the affairs of state owned entities that are administratively and politically accountable to the Ministry of Transport,\" says Minister Peters. \nThe Board of Directors of Prasa, management, staff and other relevant stakeholders are expected to cooperate with and provide support to the Auditor General's office in its execution of the brief. \nMinister Peters encouraged the leadership of Prasa to remain focused on ensuring that trains continue to run daily and the efficient delivery of the new rolling stock programme.
