Benchmark 10-year yields hit a session high of 2.22 percent after hitting a more than two-month low of 2.14 percent on Monday. Yields move inversely to prices.\n\"Lockhart is more of a moderate, and that probably has more to do with the reaction in the bond market than anything,\" said Ellis Phifer, market strategist at Raymond James in Memphis, Tennessee, in reference to the impact of Lockhart's comments.\nAnalysts said the comments renewed expectations that the Fed would hike rates in September. Recent weakness in U.S. economic data, including data on July 31 showing labor costs rose in the second quarter by the smallest margin on record, had led some to believe the Fed would delay hiking.\nTraders also sold Treasuries to collect profits after Monday's rally in prices as a precautionary measure ahead of Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls report for July, analysts said.\nEconomists expect U.S. employers to have added 223,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters poll. Traders expect the report to influence the Fed's timeline for hiking interest rates.\n\"We're going into the employment report, so that kind of motivated some people to take chips off the table,\" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last down 17/32 in price to yield 2.21 percent, from a yield of 2.15 percent late Monday. U.S. 30-year bonds were last down 22/32 in price to yield 2.90 percent, from a yield of 2.86 percent late Monday.\nThree-year notes were last down 7/32 to yield 1.06 percent, from a yield of 0.97 percent late Monday.\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index was last down 0.20 percent.\n(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:49:51.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
