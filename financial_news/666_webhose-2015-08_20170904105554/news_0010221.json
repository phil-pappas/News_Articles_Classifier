Chris Pearce by Lucille Keen Building-materials group Boral was so on the defensive over a black ban imposed by the construction union that it offered one customer a $20,000 discount to buy its concrete.\nOceania, a concrete laying company, was given a $20,000 \"incentive\" to \"push\" the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union to allow Boral to supply concrete to a building site at Williams Landing in Melbourne's west, Boral's southern region executive general manager, Paul Dalton, told Victoria's Supreme Court,\nMr Dalton said the company was forced to cut prices for cement in Victoria because Boral was trying to \"capture as much volume as we could\" to \"offset the volume loss\" from the CFMEU ban, which the union denies implementing.\nThe company is seeking $20 million in damages. It rejected a $2.4 million offer from the CFMEU to settle the c ase.\nThe CFMEU's barrister, Rachel Doyle, last week told the court Boral was forced to reduce its prices and had suffered a downturn because of \"prevailing market forces\".\nMs Doyle said Boral was forced to reduce prices after it increased them higher than competitors, and the business suffered as a result.\nOn Monday, Mr Dalton said the companies advertised prices were \"aspirational\" and \"don't bear reality in the market place\". He said advertised prices were trying to \"warm our customers\" up but they were not achieved.\nBoral alleges it was targeted by the union because it supplied materials to construction group Grocon, a company that has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with the union since 2012.\n Mr Dalton said as a result of the ban the company was forced to focus on building houses, over which the CFMEU did not have control. From a business point of view it was \"not replacing like for like\".\n\"We had seen a whole segment of the market closed to us,\" he said. \"We were looking to make that up in other sectors.\"\nMr Dalton told the court the company began to see the financial impact of the ban in May 2013 and it \"crystallised the view that we needed to respond\".\nThe company claims it has lost more than $2.5 million as a result of being forced to reduce prices in order to obtain work.\nThe trial, which is in its second week, is expected to run for four weeks, with Boral customers to give evidence about the ban in the next few days.\nThe CFMEU also faces Federal Court action by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over the alleged boycott and is facing up to $10 million in fines.\nWitnesses have also appeared before the Royal Commission on Trade Union Governance and Corruption.\nBoral's legal team has struggled to get customers to give evidence but won a court battle to have access to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's transcripts of interviews with witnesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:55:30.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
