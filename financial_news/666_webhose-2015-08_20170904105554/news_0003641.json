Despite some softening due to declining trailer volumes, domestic containers buoyed the overall domestic market segment with 3.5 percent growth. “International volumes displayed one of the largest increases since IANA began keeping records in 2000,” said Joni Casey, president and CEO of IANA. “While much of the strong performance in Q2 was due to the recovery from the first quarter’s port congestion issues, strengthening imports also played a role in pushing international volumes higher. We are also optimistic that the domestic market will continue to show gains, as the over-the-road segment begins to tighten.”\nThe seven highest-density trade corridors, accounting for 65.8 percent of total intermodal volume, rose 4 percent this quarter, just below the 4.5 percent industry average. Growth rates for each individual corridor varied widely. The intra-southeast corridor, positively impacted by stronger imports through southeastern ports, led the way as intermodal volumes jumped a full 23 percent during the quarter.\nThere were less swings in regional growth than usual. Notable exceptions were the South Central and Southeast regions, where strong international growth surpassed industry averages, and Mountain Central and Eastern Canada regions, which failed to see intermodal volumes climb. Excluding these four areas, most regions recorded intermodal growth in line with the industry average.\nIntermodal Marketing Companies (IMCs) posted strong year-over-year Q2 volume growth. Intermodal loads jumped 4.5 percent, and IMC highway volume soared 8.2 percent, which was three times the pace of overall highway trailer loads.\nIntermodal Market Trends & Statistics is published quarterly by IANA and is available on a subscription and individual copy basis. Members of the press may request a sample copy of the 2015 Second Quarter Intermodal Market Trends & Statistics from Tara Mullen at tara(at)intermodal.org. The report features detailed analyses and reproducible graphical representations of Q2 2015 results.\n###\nAbout IANA\nIANA is North America's only industry trade association that represents the combined interests of the intermodal freight industry.
