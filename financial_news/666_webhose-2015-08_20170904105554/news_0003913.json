The metal touched a three-week peak of $1,126.31 on Thursday, helping it end a seven-week losing run.\nU.S. gold for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,117.30 an ounce.\nChina’s devaluation of its yuan last week helped gold recover some lost ground, pulling it up from a 5-1/2-year low of $1,077 reached during a late-July rout.\nLee said there is a chance gold could rise as far as $1,150 if the Fed does not raise interest rates at its next policy meeting in September.\n“We’re not sure anymore whether (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen will be comfortable raising interest rates in September with what China has done. (China) is exporting deflation and she may not be too comfortable with it at this point,” said Lee, who rates the probability of a rate hike next month at 50-50 against 60-40 earlier.\nMinutes from the Fed’s July 28-29 meeting due on Wednesday will offer vital clues about its plan to hike rates for the first time since 2006. Rebounding retail sales, solid jobs growth and rising construction all point to next month as gross domestic product stays above trend for the world’s largest economy.\nMizuho Bank senior economist Vishnu Varathan said the Fed minutes may “re-sensitize markets to U.S. data and solid prints may ignite firmer U.S. dollar and knock-on softer yuan fix.” A stronger dollar could weigh on gold.\nSpot silver gained 0.4 percent to $15.27 an ounce after scaling a one-month high of $15.61 on Friday. Platinum rose 0.7 percent to $996.20 an ounce and palladium added 0.3 percent to $617.28.\n 17, 2015 12:09 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:56:57.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
