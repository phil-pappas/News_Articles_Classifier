A litre of diesel was sold at GH¢3.00 from GH¢2.90 formerly. Allied Oil was selling a litre of petrol at GH¢3.43 from GH¢3.30 while its diesel sold at GH¢3.00. At Total and GOIL, no new prices were displayed and some officials interviewed there said they were yet to receive confirmation of the new prices from their superiors. \nCedi's fall cited At the bottom of the fuel price rise is the usual pummeling of the local currency by the major foreign currencies on the forex market. \nThe local currency (cedi) has depreciated further against the major foreign currencies on the forex market. \nAs at press time yesterday, the Ghana cedi was going for GH¢4.11 to a dollar as against GH¢3.92 on Friday. \nThis meant buyers had to commit GH¢4.11 to get a dollar and GH¢6.41 for a pound. \nThe Bank of Ghana's website quoted GH¢3.92 for a dollar and GH¢6.12 for a pound. \nThe BoG previously pumped $14 million per week onto the market - a move which several economists predict was not sustainable, but increased it recently to help shore up the cedi significantly. \nThe local currency started depreciating against the major foreign currencies at the beginning of January last year and continued until July 8, this year when it appreciated temporarily against major foreign currencies. \nNevertheless, the price of crude on the world market hit below $42 dollars a barrel at the end of last week but has managed to rise up to $42.50. \nBy Nii Ogbamey Tetteh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:09:08.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
