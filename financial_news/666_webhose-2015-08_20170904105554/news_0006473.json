Reuters by Lisa Murray China's push for the yuan to be one of five reserve currencies has been delayed at least a year. The International Monetary Fund said any changes to the existing basket won't take place until October 2016.\nThe IMF reviews the basket of reserve currencies included in its special drawing rights (SDRs) every five years. A decision on whether the yuan will be added to the US dollar, the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the euro is expected around November.\nHowever, even if the IMF decides to add the yuan to the basket in November it now says actual inclusion will be delayed by nine months to allow more time for markets and countries to adjust.\nTemporary freeze The temporary freeze on the current basket of reserve currencies comes just a week after Beijing's surprise decision to devalue the yuan by about 3 per cent and change the way it sets the exchange rate.\nThe People's Bank of China on August 11 announced henceforward it would consider the previous day's yuan close before setting the daily reference rate, a move it says will allow the market to play a greater role.\nWhile it was welcomed by the IMF and is generally seen as a positive policy change, traders said the PBOC has still been intervening in the onshore yuan market to guide the currency to an acceptable close.\n\"The intervention is ongoing but it has become a more market-based intervention,\" said Ken Peng, Asia Investment Strategist at Citi Private Bank.\n Mr Peng said there was a \"high chance\" of the yuan becoming a reserve currency because of China's growing share of foreign exchange markets and as more central banks opt to hold yuan assets.\nVolatile trading However, volatile trading on the Chinese sharemarket and the yuan depreciation have rocked Asian markets over recent weeks and raised questions about the stability of the country's financial system. The Shanghai Composite Index fell by 3.4 per cent on Thursday following a 6 per cent fall earlier in the week. The fall was attributed to confusion about whether the state-backed equity buying spree and regulatory changes, which stabilised the equity market earlier in the year, will be continued.\nOn Friday, China's securities regulator flagged a policy of winding down the recent intervention.\n\"It's unfortunate the equity bubble burst when it did and that we are on the cusp of a [US Federal Reserve] rate hike, which along with a weak China, is scaring investors away from emerging markets,\" said Mr Peng.\n\"But this is all normal for the global business cycle.\"\nSlowest pace since 1990 The Chinese government is targeting economic growth of 7 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 1990. However, a run of weak economic data has raised the prospect even this lower target may not be met.\nIn another sign of a slowing economy, the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday profit declines in the public sector were accelerating. The profits of state-owned enterprises fell 2.3 per cent in the seven months ended July, compared to a drop for the first six months of the year of just 0.1 per cent.\nUBS economist Tao Wang is forecasting China's economy will grow 6.8 per cent this year.\n\"We don't expect any major new stimulus package, but see the government continuing to intensify policy support to stabilise growth at [6.5 to 7 per cent], focusing its efforts on mobilising resources to fund and implement government investment,\" she said in a research note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:46:59.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
