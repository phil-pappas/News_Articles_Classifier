David Mariuz Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey South Australian Liberals are quietly hopeful that Tony Abbott's $39 billion decision to build the next fleet of patrol boats and frigates in Adelaide will mitigate the anger against the Coalition in the state but fear voter scepticism may be difficult to overcome.\nMost party figures and officials contacted by The Australian Financial Review in the wake of the Prime Minister's three-day visit say while the decision can only be viewed as positive, they are still bracing for a backlash should the government confirm as expected that the next fleet of submarines are not built there.\nThe Liberals hold six of the 11 seats in SA and anger towards the Coalition has put three – Hindmarsh, Sturt, and Boothby – both at risk while Mayo, the Adelaide Hills seat held by Minister Jamie Briggs, is also considered vulnerable.\nSA independent Senator Nick Xenophon, who is hugely popular in the state, has threatened to run candidates in all Liberal seats and direct preferences away from the Coalition to protest the broken promise on submarines.\nNick Xenophon is very popular in SA. Alex Ellinghausen A union-commissioned poll released last week showed a Xenophon candidate in Sturt would spell the end of the career of Education Minister Christopher Pyne.\nIt was telling that Mr Pyne was front-and-centre at the shipbuilding announcement and was eager to claim the success as his own.\n\"It is great news for Adelaide and I am absolutely delighted as the Cabinet Minister to have delivered it to my state,\" he said.\nMr Pyne is the most senior and enduring SA Liberal but also one of the most polarising. He became synonymous with the unpopularity of the government early last year, so much so that the Labor government used him in its ads during the state campaign.\n \"We used Pyne gratuitously,\" said pollster Tony Mitchelmore, who along with the late Neil Lawrence, masterminded the unlikely Labor win.\nMr Mitchelmore said every campaign and polling exercise he had conducted in SA showed uncertainty over the economic future and jobs was the most prevalent concern.\nThis had become hypersensitive in recent years following BHP Billiton's decision to mothball the Olympic Dam expansion, the demise of the car industry and the Abbott government's reneging on a promise to build the next fleet of submarines there.\nHe said Mr Abbott's announcement \"couldn't hurt\".\nThe ships decision will see work begin in 2018, a full eight years before any work would begin should the subs be built there, a fact one Liberal said would be a good selling point.\nBut, said another, \"not until there is a decision on subs will there be clear air\".\nOne Liberal said the biggest hurdle facing the federal government was scepticism given the voters had been let down before.\nThe ship jobs were at least one election, possibly two, away and before then the car industry would have collapsed along with thousands of jobs.\n\"Whether this is going to turn this around, I don't know,\" he said\nHe said the first year of a government was important because first impressions were important. \"We had a disastrous first year and I'm not sure people are buying what we are selling,\" he said.\nHe said voters in SA were generally distrustful of both major parties but held Senator Xenophon in high regard.\n\"Nothing will knock him off his perch. People want someone they can can trust and they don't trust the major parties.\n\"We won't win any seats. It's about how many we don't lose.\"\nOn one aspect, all were agreed: \"There's no way we will be going to an election in a hurry.\"\n​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:05:44.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
