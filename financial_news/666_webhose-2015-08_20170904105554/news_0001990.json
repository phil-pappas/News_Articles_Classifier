It is currently investigating the incident and plans to give customers new bars after that, although it said the investigation could take weeks. \nModels with other serial numbers have not seen any overheating issues, the company said. \nThe Power Bar acts as a battery pack when users are out and about and low on battery. It contains a USB port to which one can affix a charging cable, and claims to have enough capacity to fully charge a smartphone once. \nInside the Power Bar is a typical lithium-ion battery, the type used in almost all of today's portable gadgets. Although overheating is rare, small failures can cause a chain reaction that leads to explosions. \nAround 1.5 million Power Bars have been made available, although only some are affected by the recall. \nEE announced the Power Bar scheme , which gives EE, Orange and T-Mobile customers the portable chargers, in April. It has faced huge demand for them, which has limited supply at times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T16:39:20.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
