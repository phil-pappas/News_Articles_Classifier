Eventually, authorities said they found the drone pilot in a Rite Aid parking lot. The man was taken into custody for interfering with police work, and the LAPD confiscated the drone. Authorities did not release the drone pilot’s name according to ABC7, but the man was questioned by the police and will face further scrutiny. The Federal Aviation Administration will reportedly question him as well, and a forensics lab will examine the video captured by the drone to determine whether this encounter was on purpose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T07:34:20.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
