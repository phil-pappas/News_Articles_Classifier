I still expect this rally to only be short-lived and the sellers will resume control in due course, but for now the move is strong,” he added.\nThursday’s move came on the back of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest meeting, which showed some policy makers felt inflation was still too low to justify an interest-rate hike. This dovish assessment hampered the dollar , which erased all of its gains from the last three sessions after the release of the minutes.\nThe minutes came out after gold prices settled for the Wednesday session. Commodities have been pressured by rate-hike expectations, as higher interest rates increase the cost of storing commodities, making them less attractive to investors.\nOn Thursday, gold futures were also lifted by a continued selloff in global equity markets, as it increased the safe-haven demand for the metal. The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -3.42% closed 3.4% lower, European stock markets SXXP, -1.03% were lower almost across the board, and U.S. stock futures traded in the red.\nIn other metals trading on Thursday, high-grade copper for September delivery HGU5, +1.78% rose 1 cent, or 0.6%, to $2.29 a pound, rebounding slightly from a more than six-year low. Palladium for the same month PAU5, +0.98% added $8.35, or 1.4%, to $618.10 an ounce, while October platinum PLV5, +1.11% gained $6.30, or 0.6%, to $1,019.40.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:27:49.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
