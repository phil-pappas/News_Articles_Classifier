As it turned out, the Huawei P8 was also voted as the best consumer smartphone for this year. \nUnveiling the phone, Stanley Chyn the Managing director Huawei Uganda, said one of the P8's competitive advantage is its ability to connect more efficiently to different mobile networks. \n\"The best device is of little use if it cannot hold a signal. The P8 has been developed to hold and amplify even the weakest connection. The mandate was to design devices that inspire creativity, and the P8 stands in a category of its own,\" Stanley Chyn, said. \n\"It can be summarized as collaboration between technology and design. We wanted to make a statement. Building on the success of its predecessors, the P8 embodies a classic yet inspiring design, class-leading technology and ease of use that is bound to amaze and inspire its users,\" he added. \nThe Huawei P8 delivers a new level of usability for applications impacting everyday life - at work and at play. With craftsmanship that pushes the bounds of possibility and new revolutionary light painting modes, the Huawei P8 provides consumers with an inspiration for creativity. \nSpeaking at the launch event, MTN Uganda CEO, Brian Gouldie said, \"We are very delighted to partner with Huawei to unveil this year's best smartphone so far. Smart phones are definitely the future of this industry. \nLast month, MTN Uganda launched its nationwide 4G network, further demonstrating its commitment to its vision to deliver a bold new Digital World. MTN is delighted to work with partners that provide 4G-ready devices to deliver a truly world-class experience. \n\"The Huawei P8 is built to offer a world-class user experience, something we, as MTN, emphasize in everything we do. Because we believe in making the customer the champion. With our country-wide 4G network, this phone will deliver that,\" he added. \nThe P8 breaks new ground by combining the best of fashion and technology to give consumers the perfect blend of technology, style, usability and revolutionary low light camera features. The P8 embodies a new philosophy for camera design that leverages a combination of hardware, software and proprietary algorithms to help users capture beautiful photographs, even in the worst lighting conditions. \nIts outward appeal lies in its sleek, classical design that reflects its users' sense of style and appreciation of performance and usability. Combining elegance, craftsmanship and durability, the P8 is manufactured using the latest nano-injection moulding technology to deliver a one-piece aluminum body.
