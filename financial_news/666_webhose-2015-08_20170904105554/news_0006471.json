The award was presented to MTN Ghana at the CIPS Pan African Procurement Award event held in Johannesburg, South Africa. \nReceiving the award on behalf of MTN Ghana, Mrs. Evelyn Sam, the General Manager for Procurement Services, MTN Ghana, expressed her outfit’s gratitude to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply (CIPS) for the recognition. She noted that, “the award serves as a confirmation of MTN Ghana’s commitment to employing the highest quality standards and innovation in our procurement and supply practices.” \nCIPS is a professional body with focus on Procurement and Supply Chain professionals with a membership and exclusive community of more than 114,000 in 160 countries. It is the worldwide centre of excellence on Procurement and Supply Management issues. \nMTN Ghana is the first MTN OPCO to receive a CIPS award. The category MTN Ghana won rewards Procurement and Supply chain teams that have used technology in an innovative way to improve performance or efficiency. \nThe award is an attestation of the rigorous changes MTN Ghana embarked on to ensure fluidity and efficiency in its processes. A part of the citation reads “Since January 2014, MTN has embarked on a back office transformation initiative with simultaneous implementation of the leading industry Oracle Enterprise Business Suite, Enterprise Resource Planning. With this development, the end-to-end management of Procurement from Budgeting through to Requisition Approval, Sourcing, Purchase Order Creation/Approval and even Order transmission to vendors is seamlessly and digitally managed in a single Enterprise Resource Planning process.” \nThis has resulted in an almost paperless Procurement process in MTN Ghana, a clear transaction audit trail, efficiently reduced cycle times and effective management of resources. \nMTN Ghana dedicated the award to all their customers.
