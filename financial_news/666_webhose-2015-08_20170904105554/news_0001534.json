Photo: Bloomberg\nA big week in central banking leaves the United States Federal Reserve well ahead of the Bank of England as both look to raise interest rates soon but it seems only the Fed is likely to have cause to hike this year.\nThe Fed's communications strategy has been so effective in keeping the long-end of the US yield curve and thus borrowing costs low that it has earned Federal Reserve chairman Janet Yellen the title \"best dentist the bond market has ever had\" from fixed income fund Pimco â€“ the idea being that while that first rate rise could be as painful for the market as a trip to the dentist, Ms Yellen has so far kept markets comfortably numb.\nWith one more monthly payrolls report left before the Fed's September meeting, Friday's US jobs figure was sufficient to leave the door open for a September rate rise even though the data was far from bullish.\nThe unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 per cent and 215,000 jobs were created in July. That is slightly below market consensus but more importantly, extends a trend of consistent jobs growth.\nSince March 2014, the US economy has added more than 200,000 jobs a month every month except for in March and April of this year.\nWestpac economist Elliot Clarke said the US was basically at full employment and that if wage growth can be achieved consistently, it should incentivise people to come back to the workforce, lifting the participation rate. The US participation rate is at late 1970s levels, a concern for policymakers but not enough to preclude hiking.\n\"The way to look at it more so is if you continue to get prints about two hundred [thousand] that's pretty decent growth in annual terms,\" he said. \"You're still outpacing population growth, you're still seeing the labour market tighten.\n\"That would imply that wages growth will pick up.\"\nIt also means the jobs market is no barrier to a decision to raise rates as soon as next month, or as economists call it, \"start the normalisation process\" of getting interest rates above zero and climbing.\nOutlook for future rate Mr Clarke said that it was the outlook for future rate rises that would matter once the Fed achieves lift-off.\n\"The whole process will be very much data dependent, it really depends on how the economy reacts and how financial markets react as well,\" he said. \"It's not just about those initial rate increases but what market participants price into the curve.\"\nThe Fed will hope to lift the short-end of the curve without disrupting the long-end, which is more relevant to the cost of a mortgage in the US. Once it begins, \"it's going to be month-by-month or quarter-by-quarter situation, it's not like in the past, this is going to be very much data dependent,\" Mr Clarke said.\nPimco saw that strategy as successful so far, noting the yield curve is \"where the action is\".\n\"Janet Yellen is proving to be the best dentist the bond market has ever had,\" said Pimco strategist Tony Crescenzi in a report. \"She and her colleagues are succeeding in preparing markets for the possibility of an interest rate hike, numbing investors against any pain at the first appointment, by convincing them to focus more on both the speed and distance of the path of future rate hikes.\"\nThis would keep a lid on market volatility, he argued, though other strategists see some disruption to asset prices greeting the first Fed move upward.\nMeanwhile, any move from the Bank of England, which has guided towards a rise in interest rates but does not have the inflation to support higher rates, would be highly surprising if it comes in 2015. Last week, it was revealed that only one vote out of nine votes on the policy committee was in favour of raising interest rates from 0.5 per cent.\nThe BoE also downgraded its inflation forecast again last week as price growth remains stubbornly hard to achieve. It now sees 2015 inflation rising to 0.3 per cent; currently it is at zero.\n\"There's been a lot more structural improvement in the US than Europe,\" Mr Clarke said. Westpac does not expect the BoE to move until the second-quarter of 2016.\nBoE governor Mark Carney also backtracked on previous comments that were interpreted at the time as hawkish, resetting expectations that the BoE won't hike until 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:35:50.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
