The Board of Governor (BoG) of IIT Delhi desired that in the larger interest of the institute, Shevgaonkar should continue as Director. Therefore the board endorsed the resignation which was accepted on June 1, 2015.”\nShe also talked about the Vice Chancellor of University of Hyderabad, saying he submitted his resignation on personal ground and demitted office on January 28.\nVice Chancellor of Assam University also submitted that he was unable to continue in the office because of some personal and family considerations and requested to be relieved and treat the request as letter of resignation, the minister said in her reply.\n 03, 2015 11:10 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:06:36.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
