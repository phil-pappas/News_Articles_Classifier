The fifth annual event held on Saturday, August 8 involved more than 200 volunteers including youth from area youth groups. The event originally started through the efforts of Steve Craig, CEO of Craig Realty Group, owners and operators of the Citadel Outlets . \nThe volunteers gathered just after 6 a.m. with a burrito breakfast and coffee supplied by Ruby's. Shuttles were available to take teams to various job sites throughout Commerce. \nMany were involved in past clean up days. High school student Alex Gamboa was with two friends from teams at the Brenda Villa Aquatic Center and he told me this year was his third consecutive Clean Up Day. \n\"It helps keep the city clean and we get money for our swim team.\" Alex, a student at Schurr High who swims the 500 and 200 meters, was joined by two friends who play club water polo at the center. \nEach year, Steve Craig donates $100 per volunteer to the nonprofit organization the person represents. \nMayor Lilia Leon said the students develop community spirit and surrounding property is preserved. \n\"We've seen a reduction in vandalism since the first year when the Federal Express building was cleaned up. It's a principle that if you allow one broken window others will soon follow. \n\"And even though kids might be getting funds for their programs, they're also here because they care. Everything looks better and feels better and they get to see the fruit of their hard work.\" \nThe day was a multi-generational event and was made possible by local companies including The Citadel Outlets, A1 Party Rentals, Fullerton Electric, and Waste Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T19:57:18.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
