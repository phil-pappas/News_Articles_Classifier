But it logged its largest weekly gain in a month, and was well above a seven-month low of 92.621 plumbed a week ago as fears about China sent global equities markets plunging.\nThe dollar was down about 0.4 percent at 121.28 yen, down about 2 percent for August, but well above a seven-month low of 116.15 touched a week ago.\nThe euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1215, below last week's high of $1.1715 but still up more than 2 percent for the month.\nInvestors awaited the key nonfarm payrolls data on Friday for clues as the whether the Fed would take its long-awaited step to raise interest rates. U.S. business surveys, factory orders and trade data will also be released this week.\n\"The release of U.S. ADP employment on Wednesday and non-farm payrolls on Friday will be key in analysing the quantum of a September rate hike,\" Angus Nicholson, market analyst at trading services provider IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note to clients.\nFed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said in a speech at the annual central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Saturday that U.S. inflation will likely rebound as pressure from the dollar fades, allowing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates gradually.\nMarkets were pricing in a more than 1-in-2 chance the U.S. Fed would raise interest rates in October, after Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart suggested the Fed could consider such a move.\nLockhart said a 50-percent probability at its Sept. 16-17 meeting seems reasonable, though rates indicated expectations for a September hike at about 37 percent.\nThe latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed speculators pared back bullish dollar bets in the latest week to their smallest in more than two months.\nThe dollar's net long position fell to $23.99 billion in the week ended Aug. 25, from $32.26 billion the previous week - the first time in four weeks that the net dollar-long figure came in below $30 billion.
