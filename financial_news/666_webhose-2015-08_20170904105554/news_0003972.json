MUMBAI: The country's foreign exchange reserves declined by $113.5 million to $353.347 billion in the week to August 7 on account of a fall in foreign currency assets (FCAs), a key constituent. The reserves were down by $187.6 million to $353.46 billion in the previous reporting week. They had touched a life-time high of $355.46 billion in the fortnight ended June 19. FCAs, a major component of overall reserves, fell by $78.2 million to $329.797 billion in the reporting week, the RBI data showed. FCAs, expressed in dollar terms, include the effect of appreciation and depreciation of non-US currencies such as the euro, pound and the yen, held in the reserves. Gold reserves stood at $18.250 billion. The special drawing rights with the International Monetary Fund were down by $9.4 million to $4.019 billion in the week under review, while India's reserve position with the Fund also declined by $25.9 million to $1.280 billion, the apex bank said.
