The growth was mainly due to rise in the Foreign Currency Assets (FCA).\nThe share of FCA grew substantially from 67 per cent in June 2014 to 73.9 per cent in June 2015. In case of domestic assets the situation was just the opposite. RBI financial year runs from July to June.\nThe domestic assets (including gold) constituted 26.07 per cent in June 2015, down from 33 per cent a year ago, according to RBI annual report released today.\nThe increase on the liability side was mainly due to a rise in notes in circulation and deposits.\nRBI said as in the previous year (FY14), no amount was transferred to the Contingency Fund. However, the Central Bank transferred Rs 1,000 crore to the Asset Development Fund for infusing capital into the National Housing Bank (NHB). The surplus of Rs 65,896 crore was transferred to the Central Government.\nThe balance in the currency and gold revaluation account (CGRA) dipped by 2.27 per cent from Rs 5,721.31 billion in June 2014 to Rs 5,591 billion at end of June 2015, on appreciation of dollar and fall in value of gold.\nKeeping with best international practices, unrealised gains and losses on the valuation of FCA and gold are not taken into account. They are recorded under balance sheet head as the currency and gold revaluation account (CGRA). It represents the net balance of unrealised gains arising out of valuation of FCA and gold. Hence, the balance varies with the size of asset base, movement in exchange rate and price of gold.\nInvestment Revaluation Account (IRA) \nThe foreign dated securities are marked to market on the last business day of each month and the unrealised gains/ losses arising there from are transferred to the IRA. The balance in the IRA as on June 30, 2014 declined to Rs 3,214 crore from, 2015 Rs 3,791 crore as on June 30, 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T17:02:12.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
