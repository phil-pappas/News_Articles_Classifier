There's been a lot of reports in the news, and stock markets swinging, and worries about China and about Europe,\" Obama said in a speech.\nLawmakers have been away from Washington for a summer break for about six weeks. When they return on Sept. 8, they will have less than a month to resolve fiscal issues that have become entangled in the campaign for the next presidential election in 2016.\nObama said the U.S. budget should end automatic cuts to military and domestic spending known as \"sequestration\" and instead invest in the military, infrastructure, schools and research.\nHe said Congress should avoid attaching to the bill \"unrelated partisan issues,\" a reference to a tactic to use the must-pass budget bill to tag on issues such as ending funding for Planned Parenthood or killing Obama's healthcare law.\n\"My message to Congress is pass a budget, prevent a shutdown, don't wait till the last minute, don't worry our businesses or our workers by contributing unnecessarily to global uncertainty,\" Obama said.\n\"Eventually we're going to do it anyway, so let's just do it without too much drama,\" he said.
