Manufacturers' morale hit its highest in a year, helped by food processors, oil refiners and steelmakers as oil and other commodity prices fell.\n\"We are able to smoothly pass on costs from inputs to the selling price. Thanks to a shortage of materials, we have reduced losses stemming from bargain sales of excess inventory,\" said a manager of a food processor.\nSome retailers said in the Reuters monthly poll that sales on the existing-store basis have risen from a year earlier as the pullback from last year's sales tax hike has finally faded.\n\"The number of customers is rising at our stores nationwide. Moreover, the supply network is improving,\" said a retailer. Another retailer noted: \"The long heat wave has spurred sales of summer goods.\"\nThe Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose from 14 to 17 in August, the highest reading since it hit 20 in the same month a year ago. The index is seen improving further to 19 in November.\nThe service-sector index rose three points to 27, after tumbling from a record high 36 recorded in June. The index is seen holding steady in November.\nRetailers bounced from zero to 18 in August, a good sign for private consumption, which accounts for roughly 60 percent of the economy.
