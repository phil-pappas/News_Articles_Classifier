Photo: Louie Douvis\nNewly listed online marketplace AHALife has developed an app that promises to boost sales by eliminating the angst of buying gifts, and credit card uncertainty at the checkout.\nThe app sends users a reminder when close contacts have a birthday, offers gift suggestions based on their gender or profile, sends the birthday boy or girl a link to the gift and offers them the opportunity to exchange it for another of the same value – without offending the sender.\nThe sender receives a text or email saying their gift has been accepted and only then are they asked for their credit card details. Chuffed at their own thoughtfulness, they're less likely to abandon the sale.\nAHALife chairman and Ironbridge Capital partner Mike Hill believes the app, which will be launched in September, will help the five-year-old online marketplace disrupt the $US124 million ($170 million) global gift card market and dramatically accelerate sales growth.\nAdvertisement \"This is potentially the game changer or the accelerator,\" Mr Hill said. \"We can market this app to our existing customer base and it will have a significant impact on revenue growth.\"\nBackdoor listings New York-based AHALife listed on the Australian stock exchange on Friday after raising a higher than expected $20.4 million from investors. The shares, which were issued at 45¢ each, traded as high as 49¢ before flat on debut.\nMr Hill, AHALife founder and chief executive Shauna Mei and chief technology officer Sachin Devand believe the app will attract new customers, dramatically reduce shopping cart abandonment rates, which can be as high as 99 per cent, and boost conversion rates.\n\"Because you don't pay upfront and you've been thanked for your gift, it dramatically increases the conversion rate,\" Mr Devand said. \"People only use apps if you're addressing a problem – this app gives a gift on the run in 60 seconds.\"\nAHALife is one of almost a dozen US-based technology stocks seeking to list in Australia through backdoor listings or initial public offers, taking advantage of strong investor appetite for early-stage growth companies and easier listing requirements.\nThe company sells upmarket goods such as accessories, beauty products, sculptures and homewares on behalf of more than 2600 designers and operates a drop-ship model to avoid holding inventory.\nThe average order value is $US180 – seven times that at online handmade goods marketplace Etsy – and AHALife's margin is 50 per cent.\nMs Mei said funds raised would be used for customer acquisition, mainly in key US markets such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami.\n​The offer, underwritten by Blue Ocean Equities, was two times oversubscribed. However, the sharp fall in the Australian dollar since the investor roadshow kicked off in March had reduced the value of funds raised by about 16 per cent in US dollar terms.\nLoss-making AHALife has a market value of about $70 million, representing 18 times 2014 revenue.\nMr Hill says the valuation reflects the strong growth potential of the company, which boasts a team of high-profile backers including wellness guru Deepak Chopra, former Saks Fifth Avenue chief executive Steve Sadove and former LVMH chairman Renaud Dutreil and curators including Wendy Deng, Lauren Bush and New York Fashion Week founder Fern Mallis.​\nRegistered users rose 61 per cent to 345,000 in the year ending June and revenues in the June quarter rose 52 per cent.\nAustralia is AHALife's third largest market and Ms Mei is looking for Australian \"taste makers\" to join the team of curators. She has also signed up several new local brands, including Cashmerism, which sells cashmere pashminas and scarves, and Code Love, which makes Morse code cufflinks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:14:06.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
