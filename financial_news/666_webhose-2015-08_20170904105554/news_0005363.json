The deal is worth $6 billion, excluding assumed debt, and CF will become a subsidiary of a new holding company headquartered in the United Kingdom. \nCoca-Cola Enterprises —CCE is combining with two other large Coca-Cola bottlers to form a new company called Coca-Cola European Partners. The new entity has signed a 10-year bottling agreement with Coca-Cola, with an option for a 10-year extension. \nL Brands —The Victoria's Secret parent reported a 3 percent increase in same-store sales for July, better than the 2.3 percent consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. \nCostco —Costco reported comparable-store sales were flat in July, a better performance than the 0.6 percent drop that analysts were expecting. \nMondelez International —Mondelez now has activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square as a stakeholder, with the firm taking a 7.5-percent stake worth about $5.5 billion. The maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies issued a statement saying it welcomed Pershing as an investor. \nBecton Dickinson —The medical products maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.05 per share, 4 cents above estimates, with revenue essentially in line. Becton also raised its full-year forecast, and said the integration of Carefusion following purchase of that company is going well. \nMobileEye —The maker of autonomous driving technology beat estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 10 cents per share, with revenue beating estimates as well. The company also raised its full-year forecast. \nViacom —Viacom matched estimates with quarterly profit of $1.47 per share. However, revenue missed as the company did not release any major movies during the quarter. \nKeurig Green Mountain —The single-serve coffee company reported adjusted quarterly profit of 80 cents per share, 1 cent above estimates.

Keurig also lowered its sales and earnings forecasts and announced it would cut 5 percent of its workforce. \nGenerac —The maker of power generators missed estimates by 9 cents with quarterly earnings of 50 cents per share, and revenue was well below estimates as well. The miss came amid what the company calls a record low level of power outages. \nCBS —CBS reported adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue essentially in line. CBS benefited from higher subscription fees and increasing revenue from affiliates. \nFitbit —Fitbit reported that its profit margins fell during the second quarter and would likely stay at current levels for the rest of the year.
