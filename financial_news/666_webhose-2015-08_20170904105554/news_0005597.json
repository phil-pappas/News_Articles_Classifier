Hill family associates control some 53 per cent of thecompany. The retailer, which has expanded from a single store in Whangarei in 1979 to 296 stores across Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US, increased annual profit 11 per cent to $A27.8 million ($NZ31.03 million). However, it is cutting its annual dividend for the first time in six years to five cents per share, from 6.5 cents in 2014, the first decline since 2009. \"The reduction in the full-year dividend is a reflection of the flat earnings growth for the year together with the group's ongoing growth ambitions,\" it said. MHI intends to boost its store numbers in Australia to 175 by the 2018 financial year, from 167 at present and expects to add an extra store to its 52 in New Zealand in the 2017 financial year. In Canada, the company opened seven new stores, taking the total to 60 and it expects to open eight stores this year, and six in each of the following two years, taking the total to 80 stores by the 2018 financial year. It said its Canadian unit had now reached a critical mass allowing increased spending on marketing and brand awareness. Meanwhile, in its fledgling US operation, the company's loss widened to $US1.9 million from $US1.7 million the year earlier, which it said was in line with expectations. It expects to increase US stores to 19 by the 2018 financial year from nine currently. The retailer said its Emma & Roe brand is still being tested, with seven stores in Australia and one in New Zealand. No financial details were given for the chain.
