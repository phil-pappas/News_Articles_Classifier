The company was producing 21 tonnes daily compared with its capacity of 840 tonnes daily as per July 15 statistics by AFFA, translating into 2 per cent of its capacity with no sugar left in its stocks. \nNzoia and West Kenya are producing at 88 per cent of their capacity each. Chemelil, Sony and Muhoroni are producing at 30 per cent, 55 per cent and 45 per cent of their total capacity. Transmara, Kibos and Sukari companies are producing at 70, 75 and 58 per cent respectively. \nAccording to AFFA's Alfred Busolo, while firms are producing at an average of 50 per cent, there should be a shortage but this is not so. \n\"Currently there is adequate sugar in the market from the EAC, Comesa and smugglers. We have discussed the issue with the Kenya Police, Kenya Revenue Authority and Kenya Bureau of Statistics to find a lasting solution,\" said Mr Busolo, saying it is not in the government's mandate to control the retail prices. \nAFFA is drafting stiffer penalties on counterfeits. \n\"The penalties will be several times the value of the counterfeit consignment,\" said Mr Busolo. \nKEBS is currently sourcing a technology that will provide a secret code on the branded sugar packets that can be detected by the factory of origin. A swipe of the packet should produce the dates of packaging and the supervisor in charge on the given date. \nKenya produces 600,000 tonnes of sugar annually, against a demand of 800,000 tonnes. The country produced 591,658 tonnes of sugar in 2014 (year ending June), a 1.4 per cent drop from a record harvest of 600,179 tonnes in 2013, blamed on low cane supply and companies' inefficiencies. \nMeanwhile, Mumias is hoping to regain the confidence of the farmers by clearing the Ksh680 million ($6.8 million) owed to the farmers. \nThe firm required Ksh3 billion ($300 million) to clear its short term debts whereas its outstanding debt is estimated at Ksh6 billion ($600 million), partly expected to be cleared in a rights issue. \nThe company's share price had slid to Ksh2.10 ($0.02)by close of Thursday from Ksh3.20 ($0.03) in January.
