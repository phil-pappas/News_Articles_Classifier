The fund posted net outflows of $39.1 million in June and $11.7 million in May, Morningstar said.\nTotal assets in the fund were $1.47 billion at the end of July, Morningstar said.\nThe fund, whose trailing one-month return was up 0.81 percent, is posting year-to-date returns of 1.53 percent and surpassing 77 percent of its peer category.\n\"The fund has had relatively strong performance this year compared to Lipper peers and the Barclays Aggregate index, which we think combined with broader management resources has helped the asset base stabilize,\" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research at S&P Capital IQ Global Markets Intelligence.\nGross, known as the \"bond king\" for his decades-long run of successful returns, shocked fixed-income markets last September when he quit Pimco, the firm he co-founded and had built into a $2 trillion powerhouse, for Janus.\nA Janus spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
