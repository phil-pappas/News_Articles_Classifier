Related Topics Burundi: Emergency UN Security Council Meeting Calls for Talks \nThe authorities have now completed a comprehensive review of Dahabshiil Kenya's operations, policies and practices. They are satisfied that the company complies fully with the law, and operates strict anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing practices. \nThe Gazette notifies the public that no order should be made specifying Dahabshiil Kenya, amongst others, after it was provisionally listed as part of a blanket review of all licensed remittance providers in Kenya.

Our services provide a vital lifeline for people to feed, educate and otherwise help their families and loved ones, and to run businesses, thus creating jobs.\" \nDahabshiil makes significant contributions to the Kenyan economy. It helps create hundreds of thousands of jobs, either by providing direct employment, or by enabling the transfer of investment funds, which creates more jobs, and further helps reduce poverty. Dahabshiil supports communities in the countries it serves, including Kenya. It invests 10 per cent of its profits in humanitarian and community regeneration projects, including building schools, hospitals, and providing safe drinking water.
