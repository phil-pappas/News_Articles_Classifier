He has since gone to parliament, which is dominated by his party, to weaken the requirements of transparency as well as checks and balances - the very tenets of democracy - by making himself the centre of all key factors in the use of our marine resources. \nRather than address the criticism from the Namibian Chamber of Commerce and Industry about his lack of consultation in changing the law, Esau has decided to attack the chief executive of the NCCI, Tarah Shaanika, accusing him and the previous minister of being puppets of the old fishing companies. \n\"Tarah Shaanika is being a puppet of the highest order,\" Esau told The Namibian, claiming that the business representative was bought off by Namsov, one of the oldest and biggest players in Namibia's fisheries sector. \nEsau further accused the aggrieved firms of perhaps having had the previous minister in their pockets, which apparently won't happen with himself. \n\"Maybe they controlled the previous minister. We fought for this country and for the fair distribution of our resources. I was not born to cowards and I won't be a coward,\" Esau added. \nSome questions might help us get to Esau's motive for changing the law soon after reports emerged of the dubious way in which he allocated fishing licences: Is it a coincidence that many major beneficiaries of the fishing rights and the fishing quotas are people closest to Esau such as relatives and people from whom he has benefited materially, like in the case of the Brazil trip and perhaps in other undisclosed ways? \nWhy has he not strengthened the parts of the law in which his decisions will not only be subject to professional scrutiny but that there is also a public and transparent process? \nWhere is the information we have been requesting that he opens up to the public as the old law requires? \nIs he then not in the pocket and/or at the beck and call of the people from whom he recently benefited and some of whom have openly rewarded him with privileges? \nThe tactic of changing laws when they don't suit politicians, rather than for reasons of the national interest, spells disaster in the long-term, especially when laws are changed to allow decisions to rest with one person or a closed group of a few individuals. \nEsau has correctly asked why the likes of Namsov and NCCI do not demand that there be a tribunal or similar open institution in the allocation of the seven to 10-year fishing rights. So why has the minister not made that provision in the latest changes to the law that he has fast-tracked? \nIf the minister is honest about taking his decision in the best interests of the public rather than to prop up his cronies, we urge him to put transparency and democracy at the centre of his mandate. He must not be hypocritical. Namibia \nPresident Hage Geingob has been credited with extending an olive branch that paved the way for former Rally for … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Namibian.
