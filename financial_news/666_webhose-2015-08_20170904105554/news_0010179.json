( EPAX ) concerning possible violations of federal securities laws by certain officers and directors. The investigation concerns whether certain statements made by Ambassadors Group regarding its business and prospects were false and misleading, resulting in significant investment losses to shareholders.

This news shocked the market and sent the company’s shares into a free-fall—losing approximately 31% in pre-market trading on July 14, 2015, from $2.40 to approximately $1.75 per share on intraday trading July 14, 2015.
