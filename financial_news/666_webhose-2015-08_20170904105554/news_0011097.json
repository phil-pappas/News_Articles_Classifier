Officials said it would be signed at a later date. \nSmith spoke after he and other senior officials from President Barack Obama's administration met with representatives of China's National Energy Administration during an industry forum in Billings. The discussions took place near one of the largest coal reserves in the world - the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming, where massive strip mines produce roughly 40 per cent of the coal burned in the US. \nBut clean-coal technologies are expensive, and efforts to develop them for commercial use have struggled to gain traction in the US Some critics describe clean coal as an impossibility and say money being spent on it should instead go toward renewable energy. \nChina leads the world in coal use. It produces and consumes about four billion tons annually, four times as much as in the US. \nShi Yubo, vice administrator of China's energy agency, told delegates to the forum that coal will continue to play a role in China's developing economy. \"But we need to pay special attention to developing clean coal technology,\" he added through an interpreter. \nShi said China was seeking to develop more demonstration projects that capture carbon to prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere. He acknowledged that efforts to put the greenhouse gas to beneficial use \"are still far behind\". \nMeanwhile, the US coal industry has suffered a beating in recent months, with major mining companies going bankrupt. \nThe Interior Department is proposing hikes on coal royalties and possibly lease payments for publicly owned reserves of the fuel in areas such as the Powder River Basin. Also, cheap natural gas is squeezing out demand for coal, and Obama has made reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants a key component of his climate policy. \n\"You've got to develop wind and solar and develop nuclear, but you also have to deal with the challenge of reducing the greenhouse gas impacts of coal-fired power plants,\" Smith told The Associated Press. \"It's positive if those projects (to capture carbon) get built here. It's positive if those get built in China and India and Europe and around the world.\" \nAlmost one-third of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the US come from burning coal, equivalent to 1.6 billion tons of the gas in 2014. By comparison, two clean coal projects that Smith described as closest to completion - the Petro Nova project in Texas and the Kemper project in Mississippi - would capture less than five million tons of carbon dioxide annually. He said the interactions between his agency and its Chinese counterpart created opportunities for companies from both countries to come together on ways to meet ambitious plans to cut emissions. \nMontana Governor Steve Bullock opened Tuesday's forum by telling delegates from the two countries that \"climate change is real\". The Democrat pointed to the smoky skies outside the meeting hall - caused by record-setting forest fires to the west - as an indication of how its effects are manifest. \nBullock later was joined by Wyoming Governor Matt Mead, a Republican, who said that regardless of his personal belief on whether climate change is real, economies around the world already are reacting to it. He rejected the notion that clean coal is a pipe dream. \n\"In the climate change debate, we have gotten sort of stuck in the mud, calling each other names. We need to move beyond that,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Stan is holding its own, says Nine AAP \nNine says its Stan streaming service is growing much faster than expected, but no one knows if it will ever turn …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T06:29:24.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
