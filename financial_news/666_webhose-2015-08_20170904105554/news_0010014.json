He then cancelled those trades and bought the contracts at the lower prices, reaping a roughly $40 million profit on his trading, U.S. authorities allege.\nHe has denied wrongdoing, telling the Westminster court in May: \"I've not done anything wrong apart from being good at my job.\"\n(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T13:29:44.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
