Unless the market regains some poise, a repeat of Monday's sharp moves cannot be ruled out,\" Moneycorp analysts said in a note to clients. \nChina's benchmark stock index fell 1.27 percent to 2,927.29 points, after veering wildly between losses and gains of around four percent during the day. \nOther Asian shares were mixed, with Tokyo rising 3.20 percent, Seoul closing up 2.57 percent and Sydney adding 0.69 percent, while Hong Kong followed Shanghai down to close 1.52 percent lower. \n\"The equity market rollercoaster continues,\" said TrustNet analyst Tony Cross as Frankfurt, Paris and London were down between 0.25 percent and one percent in mid-afternoon trades after Tuesday's strong gains. \n\"We're still seeing some big market swings today... (but) the rate cut from (China's) central bank was clearly not enough to put investors' concerns at ease,\" said Craig Elam, senior market analyst with trading firm Oanda. \n- 'Full-blown crash' - \nChinese stocks have lost more than 40 percent of their value since a year-long, debt-fuelled rally collapsed in June, prompting Beijing to unleash unprecedented market support measures, including using state-backed vehicles to buy up shares. \nSome analysts see Beijing's handling of the market slump as a further test of the government's ability to guide the economy to a more market-oriented model after the shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago. \n\"If problems on China's financial markets and real economy deepen, and the authorities fail to contain the situation, a full-blown financial and economic crash in China could ensue,\" said Christophe Donay, chief strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. \n\"This is currently the biggest risk for the global economy and financial markets.\" \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) (PBoC) cut its benchmark lending and deposit interest rates by 0.25 percentage points each, and its reserve requirement ratio by 0.50 percentage points. \nThe bank has now cut interest rates five times since November in a bid to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount that it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year. \nBut international investors said more must be done to fully reassure markets, especially as the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by the end of 2015. \nWhile this week's slump in Shanghai may have a limited impact on the broader economy, it reflects some investors' views that the sky-high valuations of quoted companies are not justified.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T20:11:07.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
