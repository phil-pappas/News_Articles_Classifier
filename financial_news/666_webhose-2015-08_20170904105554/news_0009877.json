The announcement comes as a major boost for the North Sea oil industry, where production and investment has suffered amid tumbling oil prices. Oil, which was driven lower last week amid fears over the Chinese economy , fell below $50 on Monday morning, against more than $115 little more than a year ago. \nThe field was discovered in 2008 but Maersk said the project had been made possible by major North Sea incentives announced by George Osborne in the 2015 Budget . In March, the Chancellor cut tax rates on production and introduced a generous investment allowance to spur the industry, where thousands of jobs are being lost. \nMonday's announcement is the first big commitment to the North Sea to take advantage of the tax cuts. \n\"The allowance supports the development of high pressure, high temperature projects - which typically have considerably higher capital costs - and encourages exploration and appraisal activity in the surrounding area\" Maersk said. \nThe company expects production to continue for 13 years once it begins in 2019, with output peaking in 2020/21 before plateauing at 60,000 to 90,000 barrels a day. The project will directly create 400 jobs and Maersk said it would help support an estimated 6,000. \n\"Despite challenging times, this government has backed the oil and gas industry at every turn, introducing a vital package of support to help it to protect and create jobs,\" Mr Osborne said. \n\"Today’s announcement sends a clear signal that the North Sea is open for business. Already the UK’s oil and gas industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country and this £3bn investment comes on the back of massive government support for the sector. \nAndy Samuel, the chief executive of the Oil & Gas Authority, said: \"Maersk Oil and partners’ £3bn investment to develop the Culzean discovery is excellent news for the UK during a period when the decline in global oil prices has created difficult operating conditions for this critical sector of our economy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:14:44.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
