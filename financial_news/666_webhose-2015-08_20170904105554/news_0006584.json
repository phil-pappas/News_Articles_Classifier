For the first time, the private equity and venture capital investors have managed to exit investments worth $6 billion or Rs 38,000 crore in the first seven months of the year between January and July, a Venture Intelligence report said Wednesday. \"This seven month figure is 33 per cent higher than the $4.5 billion realized by investors in the previous best (full) years of 2010 and 2005,\" the Venture Intelligence study said. Industry trackers say that the healthy exit figures also give confidence for investors to pump in more money in the country.
