That was a slower pace than in June, but perhaps not slow enough to give the Federal Reserve pause as it considers lifting key interest rates for the first time since 2006.\nGold futures inched lower after the ADP report was released at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time.\nDecember gold GCZ5, -0.63% is off $2, or down 0.2%, at 1,088.60 an ounce after settling at $1,090.70 on Tuesday.\nSeptember silver is on a winning streak, gaining 2 cents, or 0.1%, to trade at $14.58 an ounce, after closing up 0.3% on Tuesday at $14.56 an ounce.\nGold came under pressure after Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, said he supports a interest-rate hike as soon as the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting in September, speaking in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

That could detract from gold, which typical gains momentum as buyers seek safe assets.\nIn other metals, October platinum PLV5, -0.96% lost $2.80, or 0.3%, to trade at $955.20 an ounce, after finishing at 958.50 an ounce Tuesday, while palladium PAV5, -0.76% gave up $1.80, or 0.3%, $596.80 an ounce.\nHigh-grade copper HGU5, -0.66% was little changed at $2.36 a pound.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-feds-lockhart-fed-is-close-to-being-ready-to-raise-short-term-rates-1438709252?tesla=y"], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:07:35.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
