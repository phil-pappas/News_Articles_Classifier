But he's no witch doctor or oil seller. Quite the opposite.\nHe's a dedicated Australian scientist who is trying to save lives against the odds. I've spent two days in Papua New Guinea this week.\nI first visited PNG in 1977 and remember an extraordinarily happy and generous people, lovingly referred to as the fuzzy wuzzy angels of WWII.\nMany Australian servicemen owed their lives to them and, were it not for the bravery and commitment of the people of New Guinea, our country could have easily come under much greater threat.\nAdvertisement My visit saw a nation bravely adapting to a challenging world. Over the past 40 years, this country of seven million people has seen its income boom from immense natural resources.\nIt's a rich country, with some of the world's poorest people – but they are happy. Yet thousands of them are dying from easily preventable diseases – including snake bite.\nAnd that's where David Williams, the snake doctor of Port Moresby, comes in. Back in 1996, as a PhD scholar from Melbourne University, David was standing helplessly beside a PNG woman (let's call her Mari), who was dying before his eyes from snake bite in a ward of the Lae hospital.\nMari's bewildered husband was holding her hand and trying to control five children under the age of seven, as his young wife slipped away.\nShe, like many others, had been bitten by a Papuan taipan – one of the most venomous snakes in the world. Mari died as tears filled his eyes.\nMore than 1000 people die of snake bite in PNG each year. In Australia, with our dangerous snakes and nearly three times the population, the number dying in hospital is zero and outside hospital you can count the numbers on one hand.\nWhy? Because the anti-venom that would have saved Mari's life costs US$2000 a dose and requires constant refrigeration.\nSo David Williams got to work – and now he's done it! He's developed an anti-venom, at a cost of US$143 a dose, with a shelf life of six months in jungle heat. But he's struggling.\nHe needs US$150,000 to complete the development of the serum, plus around half a million dollars to distribute it.\nNot that much when you consider that our aid budget to PNG is over A$500 million a year – and that's apart from the half-a-million a head we spend on each of 1000-plus people detained on Manus Island.\nBut of course, snake bite is just one of PNG's problems. On the human development index, PNG is ranked 157th out of 200 countries, the literacy rate is 60 per cent, and life expectancy is 62 years compared to our 80.\nAnd while it has abundant natural resources, it is held back by the rugged terrain and high costs of infrastructure. Governance is always an issue.\nIn spite of these impediments, PNG was the eighth fastest-growing economy in the world in 2011. However, its estimated growth rate of 8.9 per cent only delivers a gross domestic product per capita of US$2834.\nThe result is that around 37 per cent of the population is always struggling to make ends meet.\n\"But who isn't?\" says Louise. \"We all have our problems.\"\nAnd as all of this is happening, news has arrived that El Niño is here and PNG's current drought could well become one of the worst on record.\nThere's no doubt conditions will deteriorate very seriously. Essential crops are already being killed by the frosts, and shipments of food and water are being trucked to communities. Schools have been told to reduce hours or close completely.\nThese fuzzy wuzzy angels stood by us. We now need to do the same for them.\nBut for me, coming from the mountains of Victoria where I never got used to snakes, I at least knew that our local hospital had the anti-venom that would save my life.\nNo Papua New Guinean has that assurance. Let's help David Williams save up to 1000 lives a year.\nIt's easy to get overwhelmed by the scale and range of the problems we face around the world, but that should never stop us fixing what actually can be fixed. Let's fix snake bite in PNG for starters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T23:43:12.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
