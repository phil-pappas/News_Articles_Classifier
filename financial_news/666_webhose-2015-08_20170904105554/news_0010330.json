S&P 500 futures fell 0.8%. Changes in futures don't necessarily accurately reflect moves after the opening bell.\nThe pan-European Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 0.8% early in the afternoon.\nThe mixed picture in global stocks reflected investors' uncertainty after a week of sharp swings, said Guy Foster, head of research at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.\n\"There are a lot of irrational moves going on in markets as a result of investors not really knowing how to read what's happening,\" he added.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index ended 4.8% higher Friday as some analysts suspected the government had stepped in to support the market.\nBeijing took several measures over the past few days to try to spur growth in the world's second-largest economy, including an interest-rate cut and liquidity injections. Earlier this month, authorities devalued the yuan, sending shock waves through global markets.\nOn Monday, Chinese stocks suffered their worst single-day percentage loss in more than eight years, sending the Dow tumbling to an 18-month closing low. The Stoxx Europe 600 posted its biggest one-day percentage decline since December 2008.\nBoth the Dow and the S&P 500 have recouped all the losses suffered over the past week. The Dow is up 1.2% through Thursday and the S&P is up nearly 0.9%. For the week, the Stoxx Europe 600 is little changed and the Shanghai Composite fell nearly 8%.\nWhat the Chinese market needs in order to stabilize \"is evidence that the economy is still growing,\" said Chris Iggo, chief investment officer for fixed income at AXA Investment Managers, in a note to clients.\nElsewhere in Asia on Friday, Japan's Nikkei rose 3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1%. Both are in negative territory for the week.\nA strong reading of U.S. gross domestic product Thursday--showing expansion of 3.7% in the second quarter, up from an initial estimate of 2.3% growth--led oil prices to soar more than 10% to their biggest percentage gain in years.\nLike stocks, commodities and emerging-market currencies also experienced sharp swings this week on China concerns.\nOn Friday, Brent crude was down 0.8% at $47.16 a barrel.\nBarclays economists wrote in a note to clients that markets haven't yet reached \"the end of the storm.\" \"Concerns about China's economy continue to act as a major weight on [emerging-market] sentiment,\" they wrote, adding that any rebound in those assets may be difficult to sustain.\nIn currency markets, the euro rose 0.3% to $1.1276 and the dollar was 0.2% lower against Japan's yen at Yen120.80.\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasurys was slightly lower at 2.166%. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\nLater in the session, investors will monitor a conference of central bankers from around the world in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that is set to last into the weekend. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen isn't scheduled to attend, but investors will be following other policy makers for hints of when the Fed might start raising interest rates.\nThe recent market turmoil has prompted many investors and strategists to push back their expectations on the timing of a rate increase.\n\"Unless things improve very quickly and substantially in China over the next few weeks, September is pretty much off the table,\" said David Tan, head of the global rates team at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.8 trillion in assets.\nThat said, the Fed will want to raise interest rates later this year because the economic data in the U.S. has been \"reasonably robust,\" said Mr. Tan.\nPhoto Caption: Wall Street opened lower on Friday, suggesting investors were wary of taking big positions into the weekend after days of tumultuous trading (Reuters)\nTweet", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share", "http://twitter.com/home?status=Look%20what%20I%20found%20on%20BaltimoreJewishLife.com!%20"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T15:58:11.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
