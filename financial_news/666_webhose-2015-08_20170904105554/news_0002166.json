ADVERTISEMENT Gallup said the index began dropping in February, however, after slow economic growth in the first quarter and continued to drop during the Greek financial crisis.\nThe index averaged -11 during the last week of July, Gallup said. \nGallup's Economic Confidence Index is the average of two things: the public’s rating of the current economy and whether people believe the economy is improving or getting worse. \nA quarter of people described the economy in July as “excellent” or “good” while nearly a third said it was “poor.” Thirty-nine percent said the economy is improving and more than half said it’s getting worse. \nThe poll surveyed 15,185 adults between July 1 and 31 with a 1 percent margin of error.
