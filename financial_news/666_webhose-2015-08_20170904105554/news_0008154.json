The program also has new automated systems that more accurately determine the eligibility of applicants. \nThe savings follows Gov. John Kasich's (KAY'-siks) expansion of Medicaid to cover more low-income people, as allowed under the federal health overhaul. \nEnrollment under the expansion was higher than expected, though state officials said fewer enrolled in traditional Medicaid. \nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com \nThink your friends should see this?
