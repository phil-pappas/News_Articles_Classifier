James Davies by Trevor Hoey Ansell's full-year result was below the expectations of some brokers and at the bottom end of consensus. The group's share price fell from $24.75 on the previous day to trade as low as $19.42, a decline of more than 20 per cent.\nWhile there appeared to be recognition the shares had been oversold with a rebound occurring on the following day, subsequent market volatility resulted in further downward pressure.\nThe question now needs to be asked as to whether this is a buying opportunity for the diversified manufacturer and distributor of industrial and consumer goods. There is no doubt this is a tough one to call, given the impact of external factors beyond the control of management that are likely to affect earnings in fiscal 2016.\nChief executive Magnus Nicolin flagged a $30 million hit to earnings before interest and tax in the coming year as a result of fluctuations in currency rates. Foreign exchange issues placed a drag on fourth-quarter earnings in fiscal 2015, and similar conditions are expected to prevail for the full year in 2016 resulting in a substantially stronger impact.\nAnsell's revenue of $1.6 billion was below UBS's expectations of $1.7 billion. James Davies Drag on group result From an operational perspective, the consumer goods and medical products divisions achieved solid growth, but with the industrial business segment accounting for 41 per cent of revenue, a 7 per cent decline in sales and lower earnings before interest and tax placed a drag on the group result.\nWhile overall sales were up 9.3 per cent in constant currency terms, revenue of $1.6 billion was below UBS' expectations of $1.7 billion.\nThe broker downgraded its earnings per share forecasts for fiscal 2016 by 10.7 per cent and lowered its price target from $26.25 to $23.40. However, with the share price having fallen substantially UBS upgraded its recommendation from neutral to buy.\n Deutsche Bank also pointed to the lack of organic growth and it downgraded its fiscal 2016 net profit forecasts by 14.3 per cent, as well as lowering the 12 month price target by 15.4 per cent to $21.70. The broker has a hold recommendation on the stock.\nTrevor Hoey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:55:46.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
