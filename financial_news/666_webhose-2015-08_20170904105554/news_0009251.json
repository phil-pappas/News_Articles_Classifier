At the time, the regulator estimated the closure would cost its deposit insurance fund $3 billion. \nThe Bank of New York Mellon lawsuit concerned 12 mortgage-backed trusts issued by Bear Stearns Cos' EMC Mortgage Corp unit and by Countrywide Home Loans Inc in 2005 and 2006. \nJPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) bought Bear in 2008, and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) bought Countrywide in the same year. \nAs bond trustee, BNY Mellon \"shirked its duty\" to ensure the loan documents were not incomplete or defective, the FDIC said. \n\"While BNY Mellon stood idly for years, the sponsors kept defective mortgage loans in the covered trusts, servicers reaped excessive fees for servicing the defaulted loans from the covered trusts, and plaintiff was left to suffer enormous losses,\" the lawsuit said. \nA spokesman for Bank of New York Mellon had no immediate comment. US Bancorp spokesman Dana Ripley declined to comment. \nSince 2013, the FDIC has secured $1.83 billion in settlements with financial institutions over mortgage-backed securities sold to banks it took into receivership. \nIn July, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) agreed to pay the FDIC $24 million to resolve a lawsuit filed in a Texas state court, according to a settlement agreement on the regulator's website. \nThe cases are Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v. The Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 15-06560; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp v U.S. Bank NA in the same court, No. 15-06570. \n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Nate Raymond; Editing by Christian Plumb and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T04:52:36.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
