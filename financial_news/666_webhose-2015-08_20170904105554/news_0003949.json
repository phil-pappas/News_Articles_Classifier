Anglo American Platinum, Impala Platinum and Aquarius Holdings own mines in the country. \nAnglo's Unki Mines unit said during March it would take two years to build a new smelter to comply with the government's demands. Unwrought exports of PGMs were worth an average of $130m p.a. during 2011-14 with a mean production of 10,000 tonnes p.a. \nThe central bank's mid-term monetary policy statement released on August 5 stressed the importance of export earnings in growing the country's monetary base and bank deposits in the absence of a sovereign currency. \nThe statement pointed to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe's (RBZ) desire to provide affordable pre- and post-shipment export financing through normal banking channels. \nExport diversification is also an issue being investigated by the central bank due to the country's vulnerability to a weak tobacco crop (as seen in 2015). \nThe RBZ would also like to see the synchronising and streamlining of export permit issuance by various regulatory agencies in order to reduce export barriers and delays. \nRevenues from tobacco exports will be lower this year. The auction season started a few weeks later than usual due to the impact of adverse weather conditions delaying the maturity of tobacco crops and the drying process. \nAuctioning started on March 5 and the official selling window closed on July 15. Contract and auction sales of flue-cured tobacco reached 188.5 million kilogrammes by mid-July, down 8.5% from last year's 206 million kilogramme haul. \nThis was also the first decline in tobacco crop volume in almost ten years and will have an adverse impact on overall economic growth in the country - half of all Zimbabweans are directly or indirectly dependent on the tobacco sector for household income. The value of this year's tobacco sales declined by just over 15 per cent to $441 million. \nThe country's export revenues are expected to decline to the lowest level in five years during 2015. \nThe government is now trying to boost foreign earnings by undoing some questionable restrictions on mineral exports implemented in recent years. This is in an attempt to boost a fragile economy that we currently think could grow by less than 1 per cent this year. \nAt the same time, Zanu PF is juggling the fallout from a crackdown on street vendors in the capital, a Supreme Court ruling making it easier to dismiss workers, and plans to make (over time) a significant cut in the public sector payroll. \nWe believe that Zimbabweans' extraordinary patience and resilience is wearing thin, and amidst a moribund economy and regime excesses, one of these straws will one of these days break the camel's back. \nChristie Viljoen is a senior economist at NKC African Economics.
