GLENN HUNT by Matthew Cranston Larry Schlesinger The tightening of credit by big banks for apartment developers will prevent an oversupply in the residential market, which might have ended with crashing values, Deloitte Australia's real estate practice says.\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tightened its lending to apartment developers as new capital requirements could increase the failure of buyers to finalise off-the-plan apartments, raising the riskiness of such projects.\nHowever, Deloitte's national director for real estate James Walsh said tightening by banks would help ensure the health of the development sector.\n\"The tightening of credit for development funding to less-experienced development groups will be a positive for the residential development market by limiting supply and lengthening the cycle,\" Mr Walsh said.\n\"We continue to see increased appetite from family offices, as well as domestic and offshore funds seeking to partner with quality developers of residential projects and provide the additional capital needed to offset lower lending ratio's being provided by the major banks.\"\nDevelopers have shown some concern that the tightening by banks, driven by new rules on investor lending from the Australian Prudential and Regulatory Authority, could halt projects.\nMosaic Property Group's managing director Brook Monahan said from an off-the-plan apartment developer's perspective the greatest concern now was around settlement and valuation risk.\n\"[This] can manifest itself in many different ways, including a decrease in consumer market sentiment and projects simply not proceeding,\" Mr Monahan said.\n \"From a settlement risk perspective it will now become critical that developers have been appropriately qualifying their investment purchasers during the sales process to ensure they will have the financial capacity to settle their purchase.\n\"While time will ultimately convey the true impact of the recent APRA regulations, it would appear that now, more than ever, developers and financial institutions will definitely need to place a higher importance on quality investment purchasers.\"\nListed Malaysian developer Fajarbaru Group and Melbourne-based Beulah International received financial backing in August from Maybank, Malaysia's biggest bank, for their $77 million joint-venture Gardenhill apartment project in Doncaster in Melbourne's eastern suburbs.\nBeulah International executive director Jiaheng Chan said he had met Australian banks and the pre-sales requirements from Maybank was not too dissimilar to the Australians.\n\"Gardenhill has achieved 80 per cent in apartment pre-sales, more than what was required,\" he said.\n\"We definitely have an advantage from a funding perspective but we are still a local developer and operate with a local perspective.\"\nWith Larry Schlesinger", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:10:05.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
