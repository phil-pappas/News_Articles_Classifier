Rauner says he won't lockout state workers, negotiations with union 'stuck' \nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 8/5/15 1:10 pm EDT - Updated: 8/5/15 1:14 pm EDT \nSPRINGFIELD, Illinois â€” Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner says he won't lockout state workers, but says contract negotiations with the largest public-employee union are \"stuck.\" \nThe Republican said Wednesday: \"I hope we don't have to take a strike, but I don't control that.\" \nThe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees' contract expired June 30. The union and Rauner have agreed to keep workers on the job through September, though contract negotiations have been contentious. \nAFSCME wants lawmakers to override Rauner's veto of legislation that would block public-employee strikes and management lockouts and send any contract-negotiation impasses to binding arbitration. \nRauner says the bill is \"a declaration of war\" on taxpayers. \nAFSCME spokesman Anders Lindall says Rauner's \"actions have not matched his words.\" He says Rauner's \"extreme demands\" could force a strike. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:25:44.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
