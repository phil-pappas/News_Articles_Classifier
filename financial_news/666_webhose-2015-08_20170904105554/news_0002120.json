The People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) cut the daily fixed rate to the dollar by 1.9% to 6,228, the most on record. \nOanda analyst Craig Erlam added: \"Devaluing the yen should support exporters at the expense of other exporting nations in the region so we can probably expect similar easing measures in the coming days.\" He said the move will now raise further questions about whether the US Federal Reserve can still seriously consider raising rates this year. \"The process of competitive devaluation among numerous countries that are easing monetary policy is effectively exporting deflation to those that aren't, particularly those contemplating rate hikes. Any move by the Fed to now raise rates could strengthen the currency by more than previously expected. Whether that will be enough to encourage the Fed to delay such a hike isn't clear but if they were not sure before, this certainly won't help matters.\" Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fisher on Monday told Bloomberg he doesn't expect the first interest rate hike in nine years to occur until inflation returns to the central bank's 2% target. His remarks placed doubt on a September rate increase. \nCloser to home, Bank of England policymaker David Miles said on Monday he was close to voting for higher interest rates at the policy meeting last week as he saw a reasonable case. However, he did not find the arguments conclusive. \n\"Sterling had gone up a bit, oil prices had fallen a bit, there were somewhat ambiguous signals from the labour market, but on balance it was a set of economic news that probably reduced at least the near-term inflation profile by a non-trivial amount,\" he told Bloomberg . \nHowever, he warned that the longer the Bank leaves rates at 0.5%, the faster they may need to rise in the future. \nIn other UK news, British retail spending increased at a slower annual rate in July as wet weather hurt spending on food for barbecues. Retail spending climbed 2.2%year-on-year last month after rising 2.9% in June. \nMeanwhile, Greece and its creditors have reached an agreement on a third bailout for the country on Tuesday morning after a marathon session of talks. The Hellenic nation reached an outline agreement on a €86bn deal, after agreeing a budget with a primary deficit of 0.25% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015, improving to a 0.5% surplus in 2016, a 1.75% in 2017 and a 3.15% surplus in 2018. \nIn company news, Ladbrokes (LSE: LAD.L - news ) edged up slightly despite posting a 44% drop in adjusted first-half profit to £24.7m, reflecting lower betting on football. \nSerco advanced after maintaining its full-year profit guidance and reporting a better-than-expected fall in revenue in its first half. \nStandard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) slumped on news it was the second biggest bank to walk away from the Carmichael coal mine in Australia in a week. \nRio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) was on the back foot after the chief financial officer told analysts that costs could be further reduced amid a challenging market. \nJust Retirement Group rallied after saying it plans to merge with Partnership Assurance in an all-share deal worth £669m. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,219.69 -0.24% FTSE 100 6,715.02 -0.31% FTSE 250 17,754.38 -0.04% FTSE 100 - Risers Randgold Resources Ltd.
