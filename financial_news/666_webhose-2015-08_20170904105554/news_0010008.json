My short-term indicators are telling me that we hit a bottom in the market earlier this week,\" said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu.\nThe FTSEurofirst remains down by around 10 percent in August due to the alarm about China, and the index is at risk of its biggest monthly loss in four years.\nHowever, some fund managers said stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB) will offer medium-to-long term support for Europe's economy and financial markets.\nAccording to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, 58 percent of the companies on the pan-European STOXX 600 index have beaten or met expectations with their second-quarter results.\nData on Thursday also showed an unexpected rise in French industrial morale in August.\n\"Regional equities are attractive and well supported by the fundamentals today, notably Europe, the U.S. and Japan where earnings multiples are in an inexpensive range of 12 to 18 times currently,\" said Lorne Baring, managing director at asset management firm B Capital.\nToday's European research round-up\n(Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:55:20.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
