Slide 1 of 8 A problem at the parks?\nWe love our theme parks, but they don’t always love us back. Consider how attendance at the top 20 U.S. parks increased a respectable 2.2% to 138 million in 2014, according to a report by the Themed Entertainment Association and market researcher AECOM. But also consider that this summer has seen a number of headline-grabbing accidents and incidents at parks throughout the world, from fights to a deadly fire to ride malfunctions. The park industry maintains that safety is a top priority and the headlines don’t tell the full story.\n“Nearly 1 billion people safely visit amusement parks throughout the world each year and incidents of any kind are extremely rare,” says Colleen K. Mangone, spokesperson for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. Still, the list of park scares seemingly grows.\nHere are seven examples since the start of the summer season.\nGetty Images The Formosa Fun Coast amusement park after an explosion on June 27, 2015. Slide 2 of 8 Formosa Fun Coast blast\nHundreds of revelers were enjoying themselves at a June 27 “color party” at Formosa Fun Coast, a water park in Taipei, Taiwan. But the festivities turned deadly when a colored powder used at the event ignited, resulting in an explosion that killed nine and injured at least 300 more , according to press reports. The park has been shut down and an investigation into the explosion is still ongoing, reports also say. In an interview with local media a couple of weeks after the blast, park owner Chen Po-ting said he felt “very sorry for the victims” and that he “will take whatever responsibility” he should.\nChristopher Furlong/Getty Images The Smiler roller coaster at Alton Towers Resort on June 2, 2015. Slide 3 of 8 Alton Towers roller coaster crash\nA June 2 crash involving two cars (one occupied, the other empty) on the Smiler roller coaster resulted in serious injuries to four riders at this theme park in England. (Two of the riders had to have limbs amputated as a result of their injuries.) The ride has been closed for the summer, and coasters at other parks owned by the same company, Merlin Entertainments MERL, +0.58% , were temporarily shut down. The company estimates the accident could result in losses of more than $100 million, due to a decline in business. “It took the momentum out of our season just at the time [we] should have been on full throttle heading into the summer holidays,” Merlin chief executive Nick Varney said recently . A company spokesman said that Merlin has “accepted responsibility” for the accident and is “deeply sorry,” adding that “we have done our best to provide appropriate support to those involved and we will continue to do so. The safety of our visitors is our fundamental priority and we have a strong safety record at Alton Towers and across the Merlin Entertainments group. After the accident, we further enhanced our safety standards by issuing an additional set of safety protocols and procedures that reinforce the safe operation of our multicar roller coasters.”\nMatt Stroshane/Getty Images Guests ride the Test Track at Walt Disney World's Epcot park. Slide 4 of 8 Walt Disney World fight\nDisney DIS, -0.02% likes to think of its theme parks as “this happy place.” But things got a bit unhappy this past weekend on the line for the Test Track attraction at Disney World’s Epcot park in Florida. A fight broke out among three patrons, with the whole incident captured on cellphone video. No arrests resulted from the incident, according to press reports.\nShutterstock Slide 5 of 8 Kennywood melee\nThe opening day of the season at Kennywood, a historic amusement park outside Pittsburgh, proved to be a memorable one — for all the wrong reasons. On May 2, a fight broke out among 50-plus teenagers at the park, causing the park to close 45 minutes early, according to press reports . (The fight started in the park’s Kiddieland area.) The incident resulted in charges being filed by police against nine teenagers , according to reports. Kennywood officials say they have beefed up security since the May 2 melee, working with local law-enforcement. “The first and foremost priority of Kennywood is providing a safe and family-friendly atmosphere for our guests and team members,” park officials said in a statement released in May.\nShutterstock Wisconsin Dells, Wis. Slide 6 of 8 Mt. Olympus Theme Park catapult mishap\nTwo Wisconsin residents were ready for the experience of a lifetime when they got buckled in for the catapult ride at Mt. Olympus, a park in the Wisconsin Dells, a popular resort destination. But the ride was cut short, literally, when a bungee cord snapped, with the whole July 8 incident captured on cellphone video . No one was injured, but the ride has since been removed from the park, according to press reports. Carrie Sueker, one of those aboard the ride at the time of the mishap, told local media she rejected the park’s offer of another ride. She added: “You go to these places and you’re trusting and you think everything is safe. But it was pretty scary.”\nCedar Fair Entertainment Company Slide 7 of 8 California’s Great America roller coaster accident\nCalifornia’s Great America calls itself the “Bay Area’s most exciting theme park.” But the excitement nearly turned deadly when a ride worker and rider were injured in an accident on June 12. The worker was retrieving a dropped cellphone at the Flight Deck coaster when he was struck by the ride , according to press reports. The ride was closed for an investigation following the accident, according to reports. “Safety is at the heart of everything we do and remains our highest priority,” said park officials in a statement released after the accident.\nBloomberg Slide 8 of 8 Coney Island roller coaster breakdowns\nThe Coney Island Cyclone is arguably the most famous roller coaster in the world and has been a fixture at this Brooklyn, N.Y., amusement park since 1927. But the ride may be showing its age. Since the park’s opening this season, the coaster has broken down twice — including on the park’s opening day — forcing riders to make their way down from the top by foot. “It was a little scary. I mean, you look down and you’re pretty high up,” said Matt Levin, one of the stranded riders, speaking to the press after the second shutdown. But for those who are willing to brave it, the Cyclone is up and running again.\nPrev Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Next Page You Might Like", "external_links": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/alton-towers-crash-smiler-remain-6149349", "http://www.kare11.com/story/news/local/2015/07/09/woman-teen-avoid-injury-after-wisconsin-dells-ride-snaps/29947447/", "http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201507270019.aspx", "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/NATL-NY-Cyclone-Gets-Stuck-Forcing-Riders-to-Climb-Down-for-Second-Time-This-Season-307262851.html", "http://www.nbc15.com/home/headlines/Ride-breaks-at-Mt-Olympus-313101891.html", "http://nypost.com/2015/06/13/riders-forced-to-climb-down-cyclone-after-it-breaks-mid-ride/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=NYPTwitter&utm_medium=SocialFlow", "http://www.wftv.com/news/news/local/brawl-between-3-women-epcot-caught-video/nm63R/", "http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201507080029.aspx", "http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_28312970/great-america-ride-remains-closed-following-accident", "http://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2015/05/09/Park-security-increased-at-Kennywood-a-week-after-fight-in-park/stories/201505090127", "http://www.aecom.com/deployedfiles/Internet/Capabilities/Economics/_documents/Theme%20Index_2014_v1_5.PDF"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T23:32:35.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
