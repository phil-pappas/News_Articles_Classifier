Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray\nChina's central bank further weakened its currency on Wednesday, announcing the second-biggest cut to the yuan's daily fixing rate in two decades.\nThe People's Bank of China set the yuan reference rate at 6.3306 to the US dollar, a drop of 1.6 per cent from Tuesday's surprise record devaluation .\nThe fall is consistent with the PBOC's announcement on Tuesday that it would consider the previous day's market close before setting its daily reference rate, a change that was welcomed by the International Monetary Fund.\nHowever, the weaker yuan is likely to spark concerns about deflation and the health of the Chinese economy. It has also reignited fears about renewed global currency wars .\nThe IMF said in a statement that the new fixing system announced by the PBOC was: \"a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate\".\n\"We believe that China can, and should, aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate system within two to three years,\" it said.\nChina's state-owned newsagency Xinhua said: \"China is not waging a currency war; merely fixing a discrepancy.\"\n \"The central parity rate revision was designed to make the yuan more market-driven and in line with market expectations,\" it said in a comment piece published on its web site.\n\"The lower exchange rate was just a byproduct, not the goal.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-08-12T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:16:55.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
