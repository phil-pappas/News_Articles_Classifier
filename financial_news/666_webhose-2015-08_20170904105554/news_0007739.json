Whether you’re trying to wish someone a happy birthday, or to cheer them up as they sit at home ill, there’s not much worse than discovering that your thoughtful gift was actually a bit rubbish.\nEarlier this year, delivery firm Yodel was forced to apologise after Mother’s Day flowers from customers who ordered from Marks & Spencer, Moonpig, Waitrose and Interflora failed to arrive. It wasn’t the only firm to come under fire . Floral delivery firm Interflora was lambasted on social media a year ago, when Valentine’s Day bouquets were never delivered, arrived dead or wilted, or customers complained that they looked completely different to the pictures online.\nOne of the problems (for customers at least) with disappointing flowers is that the person who received them is unlikely to be the person who ordered or paid for them, so many problems are likely to go unreported.\nHaving to tell someone that the gift they have sent isn’t up to much is tricky. Miriam Phillips, who lives in Dorchester, found herself in this position when she was sent some flowers: “My mum ordered them for me from a large retailer; they arrived dead. I told Mum and she complained, and they sent us two new bouquets, one each. They were both also dead,” she says.\n“I found it really awkward telling my mum, because I knew she’d be disappointed and it was supposed to be a nice surprise. The whole thing just ruined the gift, really. I now use a local florist, who is always amazing.”\nConsumer campaigner Helen Dewdney, author of How to Complain: The Essential Consumer Guide to Getting Refunds, Redress and Results , says you shouldn’t feel bad about raising the issue.\n“The trouble is that people don’t like to upset the person sending the flowers. However, it’s important you do, because you don’t want your friend or relative wasting their money,” she says. “I always have the person I’ve sent flowers to email me a photo once they’ve arrived; it then puts it in my court whether or not to complain.”\nImportantly, the person who orders the gift is the only one who can make a complaint, so you will need to speak up if you want your sub-par gift replaced, or you want the firm to refund the money.\nIf you order flowers, just as with any other goods, you are covered under the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994, commonly known as the Sale of Goods Act , and its rules mean you have a form of redress, including getting all your money back, should things go wrong. These rules state that items must be “of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, as described and last a reasonable length of time”. This means that if your flowers arrive and they are dead or not as pictured, you can insist on a full refund, including the cost of delivery.\nIf you ordered your flowers online or over the phone, rather than in store, you’ve got additional rights under the Consumer Contract Regulations. For example, if you paid extra for delivery on a specific day and they didn’t arrive, then you might be able to ask for extra compensation on top of a refund.\nThis is a bit of a legal grey area, but it’s worth asking the company for compensation for any inconvenience or distress caused. You may also be entitled to compensation if you incurred extra costs because you had to go out and buy a replacement bunch of flowers. Call the company and state your reasons. If that doesn’t work, write a letter of complaint. At the very least you’re entitled to a full refund including the cost of delivery.\nPetalon will deliver flowers by bike in London, and make a £1 donation to Capital Bee. The retailer may offer credit or a replacement bunch of flowers, but you can refuse this and ask for a full refund.\nIf the flowers do not ever arrive then you are entitled to a full refund, including delivery costs. If any damage takes place to your goods en route, it is still the responsibility of the retailer to sort this out.\nDewdney says that from her own experience you can ask for more than just a refund – she once complained about flowers she sent to her sister-in-law, which failed to turn up. “The customer services representative gave a full refund and asked if I would like a bouquet sent to the recipient or myself. I told her both (and got them),” she says.\nA bunch of alternatives\nFind a local florist You may find that a local florist is better because the blooms have a shorter distance to travel, meaning they are fresher. Use Yell.com/florists or locatemyflorist.com to find one. Don’t forget to check online reviews, or ask friends and family to recommend a local florist that they’ve used before. You can always call up to get a Quote: and compare prices before ordering.\nBouquets by bike If you live in London, you might be interested in an original flower delivery service, Petalon .\nFlorence Kennedy, 28, started her “bouquets delivered by bicycle” business in the summer of 2013. Kennedy, who lives in east London, offers two seasonal bouquets each week through her website. They cost £28 per bouquet including delivery (or £45 for a bigger bunch) and she donates £1 per order to Capital Bee , which promotes bee conservation.\n“I had found ordering beautiful flowers through a florist came with a hefty minimum spend, and sending flowers through supermarkets or large internet companies just never looked like much thought had been put into it,” she says.\nThe flowers are chosen from New Covent Garden market at the start of each week and orders can only be fulfilled on weekdays, often with Kennedy delivering them herself – on a bike.\nFlowers through your letterbox Bloom & Wild uses Royal Mail to deliver thousands of bouquets around the UK each week but with one special twist – it uses letterbox-friendly boxes, so the blooms arrive straight to your doormat. There are 10 different bouquets to choose from, with prices ranging from £30 up to £85 for a three-bouquet bundle.\nYou have to select a “letterbox” bunch, as some are hand-tied in bigger boxes and won’t fit through a standard letterbox.\nOrders for next-day delivery must be placed before 2pm the day before. The floral firm has an overall customer service rating of 4.79 out of 5 on Reviews.co.uk.", "external_links": ["http://www.petalon.co.uk/", "https://www.bloomandwild.com/", "http://www.capitalbee.co.uk/", "http://www.locatemyflorist.com/"], "published": "2015-08-18T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T11:25:46.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
