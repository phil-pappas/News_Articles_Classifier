Reuters by Karen Maley What changes should investors make to their portfolios in the wake of this week's surprise move by China's central bank to devalue the yuan?\nThis seemingly simple question has divided analysts, with some arguing that investors are best advised to stick pretty much to the same strategy – favouring high-yielding stocks (such as banks and telcos) and avoiding commodities – that has worked for the past year.\nBut other analysts take a decidedly more pessimistic view, arguing that the Chinese decision to enter the global currency wars will inevitably push the United States into a deflationary recession, which will be extremely negative for global equity markets.\nWhat analysts of both persuasions agree on is that this week's fall in the Chinese currency is yet more bad news for commodity prices, which are already under pressure from the combination of feeble global demand and surging supplies.\nAFR graphic Indeed, in the wake of the yuan devaluation, prices for commodities such as oil, aluminium, copper and nickel all dropped to levels not seen since the financial crisis, putting pressure on the share prices of major Australian resource companies such as BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Woodside Petroleum.\nReading China's move\nInvestors are worried that Beijing's decision to devalue the currency suggests that the Chinese economy – which consumes about 50 per cent of the world's zinc and around 40 per cent of its copper and lead – is far weaker than the official statistics suggest. What's more, the weaker Chinese currency will make commodity imports, which are priced in US dollars, more expensive in Chinese markets, which is likely to further crimp demand, putting yet more downward pressure on prices.\nAt the same time, analysts argue that the lower yuan is also likely to translate into even lower inflation in the developed world, which is likely to result in a further drop in global bond yields.\n This is because Chinese producers – who account for just under 20 per cent of global manufacturing exports – will likely respond to the lower yuan by cutting the prices of their goods in US and European markets.\nThe lower yuan also puts intense pressure on China's competitors – countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and India – to allow their currencies to fall in order to ensure that their products remain competitive with the keenly-priced Chinese goods.\nWhat's more, the lower yuan could also hurt countries such as Germany and Japan that boast large automotive and machine tool industries, by making their products more expensive in the important Chinese market. The risk is that the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, which are already engaged in a battle against deflation, step up their monetary stimulus even further in an attempt to maintain market share.\nUS and European bond yields edged lower this week as investors anticipated that China's move to push its currency lower will exacerbate deflationary pressures and put downward pressure on global interest rates.\nASX may get boost\nIn a research note released this week Credit Suisse research analysts point out that China's devaluation has some major repercussions for Australian investors.\nThey argue that China will be exporting deflation through the lower yuan, which should hold down local bond yields as well as increasing the pressure on the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates further. Falling bond yields should enhance the attractiveness of the local bourse, which remains the highest yielding market in the world.\nAt the same time, because the Australian dollar is likely to weaken in tandem with a falling yuan, this should benefit local companies that generate a large proportion of their earnings offshore.\n\"Aussie stock beneficiaries of a weaker yuan include those exposed to the dividend trade (National Australia Bank, Macquarie Group and M2 Group), those with international earnings (Aristocrat, CSL and ResMed) and those with a proportion of costs from China (JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Breville)\", the Credit Suisse analysts argue.\nIn contrast, they say, \"we expect stocks to suffer from further yuan weakness will include the commodity producers (Iluka, Origin, Santos), those competing with Chinese companies (Arrium, Bluescope and Sims Metal) and those selling to Chinese consumers (Crown and Treasury Wines).\"\nBut some analysts believe that investors are under-estimating the destructiveness of the deflationary forces unleashed by the fall in the Chinese yuan.\nPessimistic prediction\nIn a note released this week, the extremely bearish Societe Generale strategist Albert Edwards warned that China's currency devaluation would accelerate the decline in the currencies of emerging market countries, leading to a broad drop in prices in the United States and Europe that will further erode corporate profitability and eventually lead to recession.\n\"Make no mistake, this is the start of something big, something ugly,\" Edwards wrote in a note this week.\nEdwards has long argued that the global economy is on the cusp of an \"Ice Age\", similar to what the Japanese economy went through in the 1990s. He points out that despite years of aggressive monetary policy by the central banks in the US and Europe, economic growth remains anemic, and highly vulnerable.\n\"We expect the acceleration of emerging market devaluations to send waves of deflation to the west to overwhelm already struggling corporate profitability and take us back into outright recession,\" he warned.\nHe cautioned that 10-year US bond yields, which are presently trading at around 2.2 per cent, could fall below 1 per cent as investors realise that the policies of the world's main central banks have failed to foster either growth or inflation.\n\"Prepare for sub-1 per cent 10 year Treasury yields and another financial crisis as policy impotence is soon revealed to all,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:03:12.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
