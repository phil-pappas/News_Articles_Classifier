HSBC promotes rising star Antonio Simoes to Europe chief By Tim Wallace | Telegraph – 19 minutes ago +8.5000 \nRising star Antonio Simoes could be a successor to group chief Stuart Gulliver \nHSBC has promoted its UK chief executive Antonio Simoes to head its European operations, with the title of chief executive of HSBC Bank. \nMr Simoes takes the job on September 1 and will also join the group executive board, in a major step up for the banker who is seen as a rising star and potential group chief executive. \nHe joined the bank in 2007 from consultancy McKinsey, working first in strategy and mergers and acquisitions. In 2009 he became chief of staff to the group chief executive, before becoming head of retail banking and wealth management for Europe in January 2012. \nMr Simoes was quickly promoted again to chief executive of the UK bank in November 2012. The latest promotion sees him replace Alan Keir, who will retire in March 2016 after a 34-year career at HSBC. \nMr Simoes' new job will still give him oversight of the UK, and he will be responsible for building HSBC's ring-fenced bank in Birmingham , as its British retail operations are hived off into a separate unit in the Midlands. \nThat shift will see 1,000 staff move from Canary Wharf to Birmingham, and lead to a re-brand of high-street branches, potentially reviving the old Midland Bank name. \nInvestors and analysts see Mr Simoes as a potential big player in the sector in the coming years. \n“He is talked about as a potential successor to Stuart Gulliver ,” said Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) . \nStuart Gulliver, HSBC group chief executive \nFilippo Alloati at debt investor Hermes Investment Management added: “He has a good track record as UK chief executive. [But] Stuart Gulliver nonetheless still has some work to deliver, so it is a bit too early for him to pass the baton.” \nMr Simoes was also appointed chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority’s practitioner panel this week, having been a member of the panel for the past two years. The group aims to represent the financial services sector’s interests to the regulator a major task at a time when banks in particular feel squeezed by fines and compensation costs for past wrongdoing. \nIn addition, he works with the Banking Standards Board , a private-sector initiative that aims to improve behaviour in the industry. \nMr Simoes is also well known as one of the most senior gay bosses in the City , and was named the number-one LGBT executive in 2013 by the OUTstanding Awards in 2013, as well as being honoured at the European Diversity Awards. \nHe has spoken out on the topic, urging other gay business figures to come out publicly, to promote diversity and meritocracy in the workplace. \nEarlier this year he told Portuguese newspaper Expresso that his sexuality helped him professionally: \" Being gay is an advantage for me . It made me a more authentic person with better empathy, better emotional intelligence. If I wasn’t gay, probably I wouldn’t be CEO of the bank,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:08:14.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
