The good things are confidence and motivation for more,” said Mourinho.\nChelsea played a free-flowing style in the first half of last season but when injuries, suspensions and loss of form kicked in after Christmas they started to adopt a more cautious, pragmatic approach in order to grind out results.\nMourinho’s men have been big spenders in the past but they have been almost frugal with their close-season expenditure compared to Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool and Mourinho said it would be a “great challenge” to try and retain the title.\nWhile City, United and Liverpool have splashed out vast sums of money to strengthen their resources, the Londoners have merely tinkered with their squad.\nClub favourites Petr Cech and Didier Drogba have moved on to pastures new and been replaced by former Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and Monaco striker Radamel Falcao who had an indifferent spell on loan at United last season.\n“I have only one objective and that is to win the next game,” said Mourinho. “I have no other objective apart from trying to improve and improve and improve.\n“It’s a great challenge to improve our team basically without new players, apart from Begovic and Falcao. I’m more than happy with that and the players are receiving this challenge with open arms.\n“Every day we work really hard to try to improve and I see great motivation in the players. They are happy because we are the same group…because myself and the club have shown loyalty to them,” added Mourinho.\n“We’ve said, ‘You are the champions, you made us champions, we trust you. Even if the other clubs have made huge investment we stick with you, we believe in you’.”\nChelsea, who have won the Premier League four times in 11 seasons, meet Cech’s new team Arsenal in Sunday’s Community Shield, the traditional curtain-raiser to the new campaign.\nMourinho’s men then kick off their league fixtures with a home game against Swansea City on Aug. 8.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 9:33 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:26:09.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
