Harvey Nash plans to create and launch the pilot platform in Vietnam in the coming months, with the ambition to extend the initiative to engage other ASEAN countries. \nPaul Smith, Chairman of Nash Tech, a division of the Harvey Nash Group, says, “As one of the largest technology companies in Vietnam, Harvey Nash believes it is important to lead the way and build on the technology industry’s entrepreneurial drive. By developing a new platform that supports and encourages links between the UK and ASEAN, we believe the technology communities will find many new ways to interact, trade, and innovate. \n“The development of Tech Hub, which is supported by Lord Francis Maude, UK Minister of State for Trade and Investment, will significantly increase the export of services from Vietnam over the next two years, bringing valuable new jobs for the ICT and consulting industry and bringing new skill sets and experience to the workforce.” \nVietnam presents a huge investment opportunity, as the second most popular investment destination in Asia Pacific (behind China) with foreign direct investment projects more than doubling last year ( according to fDi Markets, 2014 ). Vietnam boasts healthy GDP growth (the economy grew 6% last year) and benefits from a sizable, skilled population, due to the Government’s focus on education and investment in skills and technical acumen. \nHarvey Nash first invested in Vietnam over 15 years ago, and is now the largest foreign investor within the Vietnamese technology sector having built one of the leading technology and BPO businesses in the country. \nFor more information on the tech hub initiative, please visit www.nashtechglobal.com or call +44(0) 207 333 8778. \nAbout Harvey Nash \nHarvey Nash is a global pioneer in executive search, professional recruitment and IT outsourcing, committed to delivering the very best talent and IT solutions to a broad base of international clients.
