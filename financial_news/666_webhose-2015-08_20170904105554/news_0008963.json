The five most vulnerable sectors are refineries, iron, steel & products, fertilizers, aluminium and power. The other significant net importers are oil exploration, engineering, plastic products, telecom services and auto ancillaries.\nThe net forex earners are the IT sector followed by pharmaceuticals, textiles, two wheelers and commercial vehicles. Companies have to keep a watch on the rupee movements and take a call on whether the present disturbance in the forex market is transient or permanent. The rupee is likely to settle at a higher level than earlier and it is unlikely that it would revert to the less than Rs 64 level.\nA range of Rs 65-66 may be expected if fundamentals remain sound. But presently, a range of Rs 66-67 may be expected to prevail until the volatility settles.\n 31, 2015 12:06 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:36:54.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
