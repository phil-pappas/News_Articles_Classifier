Column: For whom and at what cost? To see or not to see. In the land of the Kama Sutra, the Union government has decided that you cannot watch pornography even from within the confines of your bedroom. In a 17-page order issued over the weekend, the DoT has been asked to notify ISPs to block access to 857 adult and porn websites under Section 79 (3)(b) of the Information Technology Act 2000 as the content hosted on these websites relate to morality, decency as given in Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India. That was done after the Supreme Court last month refused to impose a ban on online pornography on the grounds that it led to sex-related crimes. The court was of the opinion that individuals should be free to access such websites in private.\nThis is not the first time that a ban on online pornography has been sought. In 2013, Indore-based lawyer Kamlesh Vaswani filed a PIL reportedly stating that pornography is “worse than Hitler, worse than AIDS, cancer or any other epidemic.” Vaswani, whose petition comes up for hearing in October, wants watching pornography to be made a non-bailable and cognizable offence. The ban on the 857 URLs could be challenged in court. But, one thing is for sure. Expect the millions of IT brains in the country to quickly find a way to bypass the blockade. After all, only the URL is blocked and not the IP address.\nFirst Published on August 04, 2015 12:25 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:51:41.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
