Payments bank might have a cheaper cost structure,” Bhattacharya said during the Ficci Banking Conclave.\nShe said payments banks would be ahead of the regular banks when it came to their reach in rural households.\nSBI already has about 56,000 business correspondents, operating through point-of-sales machines, across the country. The bank will also soon open customer service points in 500 unbanked gram panchayats in West Bengal.\n“We are also coming up with the lower cost model. Therefore, we feel that technically there is a lot of competition. And whenever there is competition, the advantage goes to customers,” said Bhattacharya.\nThe Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) has granted in-principle nod to 11 payments bank applicants, including four large business houses, a couple of telcos and the Department of Posts.\nThe SBI chairman said payments banks would handle small remittances and reach out to rural customers, but these financial institutions would be of limited help to regular customers. “Payment banks would not be interested in credit history as they cannot offer loans to customers.
