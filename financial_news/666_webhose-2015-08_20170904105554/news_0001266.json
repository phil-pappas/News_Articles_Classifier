That's well below the 600 or 700 allowed under the new law creating the program. \nState lawmakers passed a bill this spring giving businesses a tax credit if they donate to an eligible scholarship organization. Those organizations then disburse up to $7,775 per student. \nThe state can give up to $5 million each year in tax credits. \nThe program has garnered less attention than new Education Savings Accounts, which allow an unlimited number of students to claim their state per-pupil funding allotment and use it for private school. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:41:14.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
