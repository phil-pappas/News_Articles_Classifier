The list of affected countries was expanded this year and Russian regulators have also restricted Dutch flower imports, citing health risks.\nThe extent of the withdrawal of foreign detergent brands was not immediately clear. Local media said it would only affect some products rather than entire product lines.\nRospotrebnadzor said it was carrying out further tests on household chemicals and detergents of other producers but did not elaborate.\nHenkel said it had not received any notification from Rospotrebnadzor and that all its products had passed toxicological checks in Russia and had a state certificate of safety.\n\"We are trying to find out what's going on and deciding on our next steps,\" said Henkel's spokeswoman Natalia Ovakimian.\nThe other companies affected could not be immediately reached for comment.
