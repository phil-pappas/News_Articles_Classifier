Several plausible but expensive options are displayed here.The gold and silver funds owns stacks of metal. They will definitely do well if inflation surges, and they might do well if the dollar weakens against other currencies.A Swiss franc fund will probably do well if the dollar weakens, and it might do well if the U.S. reverts to the inflationary habits of the 1970s.As hedges, currencies and commodities can make sense. As standalone long-term holdings, they probably can’t. Gold’s long-term real return (return net of inflation) is not much above zero, and is likely to be below zero in a fund that nicks you 0.4% annually for holding costs. There is no reason to expect much more from francs and Aussies.If you plan on owning bullion for a long time, the iShares Gold Trust ( IAU ) will cost you a lot less than the more popular SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD ). In-and-out speculators, however have reason to prefer GLD for its high trading volume and tight bid/ask spread.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 IAU iShares Gold Trust 5,763 0.25 417 SIVR ETFS Physical Silver 268 0.3 503 SGOL ETFS Physical Swiss Gold 825 0.39 632 GLD SPDR Gold Shares 23,963 0.4 641 FXE CurrencyShares Euro 271 0.4 641 FXY CurrencyShares Japanese Yen 118 0.4 644 FXC CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar 218 0.4 646 FXA CurrencyShares Australian Dollar 183 0.4 647 FXF CurrencyShares Swiss Franc 166 0.4 650 AGOL ETFS Physical Asian Gold 11 0.39 670 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
