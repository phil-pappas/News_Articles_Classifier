Forget the stereotypes about old, pot-bellied, bearded, sandal-wearing men,\" he told AFP. \n\"The bloggerati and the hipsters are interested in new, exciting craft brews and we have a lot of that here. \n\"Twenty-year-olds rebel against their fathers' tastes, and they were the missing generation attracted to lagers -- so now their children are turning on to real ale. \n\"The wine industry has been clever and intellectualised wine; perhaps we ought to do that for beer,\" he added. \n\"The modern drinker is interested in good beer. We'll show you the difference between what you're drinking now and something even better.\" \nCwtch, a best bitter-style beer made by the three-year-old Tiny Rebel brewery in Newport (NasdaqGS: NEWP - news ) , southeast Wales, was crowned the champion beer of Britain. The Welsh word, pronounced \"cutch\", means \"cuddle\" in English. \n\"Cwtch is our modern version of a traditional bitter, with extra hopping for a more pronounced bitterness and aroma,\" explained the brewery's co-founder Bradley Cummings. \nSilver went to Kelburn's Jaguar, a golden ale, with Dancing Duck's Dark Drake stout winning the bronze.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:06:48.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
