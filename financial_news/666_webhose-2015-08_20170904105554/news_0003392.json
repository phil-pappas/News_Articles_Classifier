When asked if falling commodity prices and the stronger dollar should influence the Fed's decision, he said: \n\"I hope so. They always stress that currency is not a consideration. But I hope it becomes a consideration because when markets move so dramatically, and they have in emerging markets, and they have in developed markets almost 15pc to 20pc over the last six months ... that’s a dramatic move. \n\"That’s almost a bubble in reverse and it has significant implications for inflation in the US, call it deflation if you will. But we're moving closer to that point.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T02:05:03.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
