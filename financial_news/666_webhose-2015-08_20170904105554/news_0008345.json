In its second quarter update, Trinity (HKSE: 0891-OL.HK - news ) claimed the Tabaquite Block was currently classified as \"held for sale\" on its books, adding it had not received any profits from LGO. \nIn November 2014, the two companies signed a deal under which LGO committed to acquire Tabaquite Exploration & Production, which is set to receive a licence for the Tabaquite Block, from Trinity for $2m. \nHowever, Trinity said LGO had breached the agreement and it was considering its options, refusing to rule out \"legal remedies\", while LGO insisted it had previously notified Trinity about being in breach of agreement. \nThe group added it was reserving the right to take \"any action it deems necessary\" to protect itself and its shareholders' interests. \nLGO shares were down 7.74% to 1.43p at 1130 BST on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:28:58.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
