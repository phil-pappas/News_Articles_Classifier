Here’s what an extended period of cheap crude could mean: \n#1: Get out on the Highway \nWhen oil got expensive in 2007, U.S. drivers responded by cutting down on their time behind the wheel and buying more fuel-efficient cars. Both of those trends are unwinding as low oil prices have pushed the average price of gasoline down to $2.65 a gallon, 80 cents lower than last summer. Research from the University of Michigan shows Americans are starting to drive more miles and less efficient vehicles. In July, Ford closed a Michigan factory that made its compact Focus, citing weak demand for small cars. U.S. gasoline sales have reversed years of decline and are expected to jump more than 2% this year. \n#2: The End of the Affair \nWall Street fueled the U.S. oil boom, providing easy access to capital and debt. But that may be changing now that crude prices seem stuck below $50 a barrel. Last week, Samson Resources Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection, wiping out a $4.1 billion cash investment made by private-equity firm KKR & Co. and its partners. Energy companies are having trouble raising money by selling stock, and banks are likely to rein in some loans later this year. \n#3: Mergers Could Reshape Oil Industry \nWhen oil prices fell in the late 1990s and stayed low, the energy industry went on a merger jag. Exxon gobbled up Mobil. Chevron acquired Texaco. BP swallowed Arco and Amoco. So far this downturn there has been one notable merger: Shell’s $70 billion purchase of BG Group. But other big oil companies may open their checkbooks to buy shale drillers, since their big bets on expensive deep-water projects look too pricey in the new world of low oil prices. \n#4: North America's Energy Heft Hits a Snag \nWhen oil prices were high, there was talk that North America could soon become a crude-oil exporting powerhouse. But low prices have hurt operators in Canada’s vast but expensive-to-produce oil sands. The prospects have dwindled for deep-water exploration and production in both U.S. and Mexican waters in the Gulf of Mexico. And U.S. oil production isn’t rising anymore. \n#5: OPEC Still Matters But... \nThe cartel of big oil exporters has helped guide global crude prices for decades, keeping them relevant in geopolitics and world economic matters. But there are signs of serious discord. Saudi Arabia is competing with Iraq and Iran for valuable export markets in Asia. Venezuela’s economy is being ravaged by low oil prices, and future oil production offshore Angola and Nigeria looks questionable. If oil stays below $50 for an extended period, OPEC’s cohesion and resolve will be sorely tested.
