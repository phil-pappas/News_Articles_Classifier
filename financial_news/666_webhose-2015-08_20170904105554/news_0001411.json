Less than two weeks later, Greece missed a 456 million euro payment to the IMF. \nWhen it first defaulted at the end of June, the IMF froze Greece's access to its resources, including the Fund's ongoing financing program for the country. \nHowever, on July 20, Greece paid the IMF about two billion euros in arrears, after it received an emergency bridge loan from the European Union, restoring its eligibility for IMF financing. \nRepresentatives of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- the international creditors of Greece's two bailouts since 2010 -- are currently in Athens holding negotiations with the Greek authorities on a third bailout. \nGreece needs a deal that will unlock bailout funds by August 20, when it must repay some 3.4 billion euros due to the European Central Bank. \nAfter Thursday's payment to the IMF, Athens still owes about 22 billion euros, according to the Washington-based institution's website. \nThe next IMF payment, of about 307 million euros, is due on September 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:31:37.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
