Basically, it's a vicious cycle.\nAustralia's economy isn't performing as well as it was a few years ago, so fewer people want to emigrate here. Particularly New Zealanders, since the Kiwi economy is performing comparatively well at the moment.\n RBA\nThe RBA said it lowered its forecast for future population growth \"in part because labour market conditions in Australia are expected to remain weaker than those in countries that have traditionally been a source of skilled, prime-age immigrants, such as New Zealand\".\nAnd that has considerable knock-on effects for the rest of us.\n\"Lower population growth has important implications for the economy. It lowers the growth in demand for goods and services, as well as the economy's capacity to supply those goods and services. \"\nThe link between population growth and economic growth is bitterly contested by economists and yes, we're being a bit simplistic here.\nBut it's still something to think about, particularly if you tune in to watch the Bledisloe this weekend.", "external_links": ["http://www.citylab.com/work/2013/09/great-growth-disconnect-population-growth-does-not-equal-economic-growth/5860/", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/rba-lowers-jobless-rate-forecasts-as-population-growth-slows-20150806-gitnps.html", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling"], "published": "2015-08-07T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:04:07.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
