This matched June's reading, which was also the highest since January 2000. \nHowever, a separate YouGov (LSE: YOU.L - news ) poll suggested recent tremors in global markets meant August's robust reading would not be sustained in September. \nGfK's survey was conducted ahead of a stock market sell-off triggered by Chinese growth fears that saw $1 trillion wiped off global bourses on Monday . YouGov's poll, which closed just before \"Black Monday\" , showed a \"notably larger fall in confidence over the last week\" as UK consumers reacted to the global rout. \nJoe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said the domestic economy remained robust. He said rising house prices had made households feel richer, with the so-called \"wealth effect\" helping to boost confidence and consumption. \n“Rising house price inflation and improving employment growth prospects, combined with falling petrol prices and day-to-day living costs, as well as low interest rates, are translating into high levels of confidence across all major measures,\" he said. \n\"Consumers now believe that UK economic recovery is robust, we’re in the black and that prospects for growth are fact and not fiction.” \nStephen Harmston, head of YouGov, said: ‘The early weeks of this month saw consumer confidence reach a highpoint for the year. However, the market tremors over the past week have been felt by people in the UK and we have seen a clear drop-off in confidence as a result. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is becoming apparent that while people feel their living standards are slowly starting to pick up some are becoming a bit more pensive about their livelihoods.\" \nOfficial data on Friday are expected to confirm the UK economy grew 0.7pc in the three months to June. A poll conducted by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) showed activity in Britain's dominant services sector expanded at a robust pace in the three months to August, with business and professional services companies reporting the strongest growth in business volumes since records began in 2001.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T03:16:21.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
