Richard Hatch, of RBC Capital Markets, described yesterday’s share price fall as “a reflection of a challenged space, with limited upward moves in platinum group metals prices”. \nOn Tuesday, the broker slashed the stock’s target price to 35p as fears intensified the FTSE 250 company could encounter challenges in refinancing its debt, which falls due next year. Last month, the group announced it would axe 6,000 jobs by closing several mine shafts in response to the platinum prices crisis and rising labour costs in South Africa. \nHowever, whether Lonmin can cut costs quickly enough in order to save itself, Mr Hatch says, depends on its ability to put a refinancing package together which can help it withstand the current environment of falling platinum prices. \nWith financing problems projected into 2016, Augustin Eden, of Accendo Markets, warned that “having to turn to the equity markets to raise capital is a grave concern since issuing shares will dilute the price further”. Mr Eden added that the tragic events of August 16 2012, in which 34 of the company’s striking miners were shot dead by South African police, has kept investor sentiment towards Lonmin “somewhat subdued”. \nMeanwhile, depressed commodity prices continued to weigh heavily on Britain’s benchmark index amid ongoing uncertainty in China , the world’s largest metals consumer. The FTSE 100 tumbled 122.84 points, or 1.9pc to 6,403.45 - just 37 points shy of Janury’s low. \nDavid Madden, of IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) , warned “the Chinese equity markets may have ended on a positive note, but the erratic swings should be viewed with caution, and such a wide trading range tells us that China will not be stable for some time”. * China's stock market crash: five numbers you need to know As expected, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) was left nursing losses after it published its half-year results. The miner and commodity trader posted a 29pc loss in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation to $4.6bn. The company downgraded its marketing guidance for the year to between $2.5bn and $2.6bn. \nAnalysts at Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) said the results were “not bad” given the market conditions. However, they warned “unless commodity prices improve materially, the company’s balance sheet remains under considerable pressure”. Shares hit a new low, falling 17.2p, or 9.7pc, to 158.9p. Meanwhile, Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) slipped 4.4pc to 709.4p, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) was off by 3.7pc at £23.23, and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) fell 3.7pc to £10.72. * Glencore mulls future of platinum mine as commodity prices plunge Oil stocks also suffered after a report revealed US crude stockpiles had increased, with Brent crude dipping as low as $46.81 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell B shares lost 42.5p to close at £17.40, while BP was 6.3p lower at 367.5p. Mid-cap stocks were also bruised, as Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) plummeted 7.3pc to 96.2p and Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) fell 5.4pc to 199.6p. \nElsewhere, insurer Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) motored its way to the FTSE 100 top spot, following a robust set of half-year results which came in ahead of market expectations. Group pre-tax profit edged 1pc higher to £186.1m, while earnings per share rose by 4pc to 54.8p. \nHowever, Eamonn Flanagan, of Shore Capital, was quick to point out “little reference was made to conditions in the UK motor market, where we believe claims frequency and severity are both rising”. The stock leapt 56p, or 3.8pc, to £15.22. \nHikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) also advanced despite reporting a $40m fall in half-year operating profit to $204m. The Jordanian drug maker maintained its full-year group revenue guidance at around 6pc growth in constant currency, as it noted a strong performance in its branded and injectables businesses. \nJames Gordon, of JPMorgan Cazenove, said “this 2015 guidance doesn’t reflect any contribution from the Roxane acquisition, which could close before year end, which could provide a significant boost, offering guidance upside”. In July, the group announced it would buy US speciality generics business Roxane from German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim in a deal worth $2.65bn. Shares climbed 62p to £24.62. \nFinally, after announcing it would axe 5,000 jobs on Tuesday John Wood Group extended its losses, falling 21p to 560.5p, as six brokers targeted the company. Analysts at Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) said the “scope for incremental cuts is likely to be more limited, driving our expectation for another year of double-digit earnings decline”. * Questor share tip: Wood Group still a sell as profits fall", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:44:08.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
