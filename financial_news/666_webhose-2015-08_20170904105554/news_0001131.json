Why would you bother bumping your tyres or talking to a speaker box when, in the comfort of your own convenience, you can get a pizza delivered in 15 minutes?\"\nThe service was already being tested in a small number of stores and would be rolled out across the country within the next three months, he said.\nThe delivery guarantee will work hand in hand with another digital innovation, a GPS Driver Tracker, which was launched Australia-wide in July and lets customers watch their delivery driver make their way towards them on a map.\nDomino's says the launch of \"Four Click\" digital ordering in Australia and \"Five Click\" ordering in New Zealand, a \"Live Pizza Tracker\" for smart watches and touch identification for its iPhone and iPad apps have already driven customer frequency.\nMr Meij​ said about 60 per cent of Domino's sales were digital, and it planned to launch another 40 digital products this year to make orders easier and drive more sales.\nDomino's on Tuesday announced a 40 per cent jump in net profit in 2014-15. Its shares were down as much 7 per cent in early trade after Mr Meij's​ forecast of 20 per cent growth, which was below the market's expectations of 25 per cent. But those losses reversed and the stock ended up almost level for the day.\nThe ASX-listed fast food retailer had revenue of $702.4 million in the financial year ended June 30, up from underlying revenue of $588.7 million in the previous year, delivering net profit after tax of $64 million.\nThe result marks eight years of continued growth and exceeded both market profit expectations of $62 million and Domino's own guidance.\nSame-store sales in Australia and New Zealand grew 11.3 per cent thanks to digital sales, increased lunch-time trade and attracting new customers.\nThe pizza chain performed well in Japan, where it opened 64 stores last year for a total of 384 and grew total sales by 37 per cent and same store sales by 1.8 per cent.\nIn Europe, where Domino's has 200 stores across the Netherlands and Belgium and 250 in France, sales were up 16 per cent and same store sales up 11.3 per cent.\nDomino's plans to open its 400th Japanese store next month and has a long-term goal of 850 stores in the country.\nIt opened 59 stores in Australia and New Zealand last year for a total of 670.\nDomino's announced its final dividend was 27.2¢, which will be paid on September 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:48:34.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
