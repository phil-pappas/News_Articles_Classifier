Dean Osland Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Six parties including China-backed Shenhua Group have been in the data room for Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley coal business, adding more competitive tension to what was expected to be a two-horse race between Glencore and Mick Davis' X2 Resources.\nRio is hoping to fetch as much as $U4 billion ($5.4 billion) in a sale of its thermal coal business, with chief executive Sam Walsh confirming last week that he would be open to a sale at the right price .\nSources told The Australian Financial Review that Rio could reap up to $US3.5 billion although some of the companies in the data room have been suggesting the miner split the assets that are up for sale.\nCoal miner New Hope and a specialist mining private equity firm round out the six parties that have been in and out of the data room.\nNew Hope, which has a market capitalisation of just $1.5 billion, is understood to be interested in only part of the business, with industry players questioning whether they have the balance sheet to buy the full asset package.\nIndustry sources suggested South32 may also take a look at the assets, but the company said on Thursday it was not interested.\nChinese-owned Shenhua is still reeling from Environment Minister Greg Hunt's shock decision last month to announce, on radio, that he would review the approval of its Watermark Project , which is near prime farming land in New South Wales. Buying Rio's coal could make more sense for Shenhua than building from scratch.\nRio's coal business in the Hunter Valley is right next door to Glencore's coal business. Glencore last year tried for a joint venture of the two coal divisions, and its coal chief Peter Freyberg said in June the miner was in the market for synergy deals.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Glencore is seen by many as the natural owner of the assets, but has only been prepared to pay a fraction of what Rio wants for the assets â€“ which is thought to be about $US4 billion, with $US3 billion as a starting point.\nHowever, now that the competition is heating up, Glencore is considering a higher offer. A Rio-Glencore joint venture in coal would achieve about $500 million in annual savings or \"synergies\", Glencore told analysts last year.\nBut London-based X2, which has $US5.6 billion in equity to spend on mining assets, could be the biggest snag for Glencore. Coal and copper are top of X2's wish-list, and sources have told the Financial Review that X2 has been talking at least $US3 billion with Rio.\nWhen asked about selling Hunter Valley coal last week, Rio's Sam Walsh said \"if anybody wants to offer us a price that is more than we value an asset then of course we'll look at it\".\n\"We've got investment bankers coming up will a range of bright and brilliant ideas which we appreciate.\"\nRio's coal boss left in February and the division was punted into the copper arm of the global giant.\nRio's coal division in Australia has a book value of $US3.1 billion, which Rio would argue is already discounted because of the price malaise. That also includes two metallurgical coal mines in Queensland, which could be left out of any deal.\nRio and Glencore declined to comment when contacted by the Financial Review.\nX2 has also declined to comment on the Rio sales process, while New Hope could not be reached for comment.\nRio's business in the Hunter, called Coal & Allied, is 20 per cent owned by Japanese giant Mitsubishi. The two paid $1.56 billion for the 14 per cent of the business they didn't own in 2011, valuing it at $11.1 billion.\nIn June, Glencore's Peter Freyberg would not say whether talks had been revived with Rio, but pointed to the value of doing deals in the Hunter region, where \"synergies\" could cut costs.\n\"I can't talk about whether or not anything is happening with Rio Tinto. What I can say is you would have seen we recently did a deal with a neighbour [Peabody Coal] over two adjoining leases. It was a deal that released a whole bunch of synergies between those properties and means going forward we can carry on mining at a lot lower cost. So we are open to value-adding opportunities when they present.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/glencores-peter-freyberg-defends-coal-20150603-ghgajs.html"], "published": "2015-08-13T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:03:50.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
