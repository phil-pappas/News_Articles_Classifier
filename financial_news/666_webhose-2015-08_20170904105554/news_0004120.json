European stocks drop after early gains AFP â€“ 23 minutes ago View Photo \n\nEuropean stock markets slipped on Monday after starting the day with modest gains in a week set to be dominated by more developments over China and Greece. \nLondon's benchmark FTSE 100 index shed 0.52 percent to stand at 6,516.61 points in mid-afternoon trades, with losses led by a weak mining sector. \nFrankfurt's DAX 30 lost 1.19 percent to 10,854.39 points and the CAC 40 in Paris slid 0.44 percent to 4,934.42 compared with Friday's close. \nThe euro edged up to $1.1118 from $1.1112 late on Friday in New York. \nEurope's main stock markets had closed slightly lower on Friday at the end of a turbulent week for equities and other financial markets, triggered by concerns over the Chinese and Greek economies. \nThough European bourses posted modest morning gains, they reversed course on jitters over whether Friday's Greek bailout agreement will clear eurozone parliaments, and bigger worries about China's economy. \n\"The eurozone began to lose its lustre as the morning went on,\" said Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell. \nGiven the market-moving power of Greece in the first half of 2015, investors clearly aren't as fussed about the issue as they once were, with fears over China's next move outweighing the positive progress found on the continent.\" \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and her hardline Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble on Sunday hailed a dramatic change in Greece's approach to its debt crisis ahead of a key parliamentary vote in Berlin on the new bailout. \nBefore German MPs are asked to approve a third rescue package for debt-mired Greece on Wednesday, Merkel said the eurozone partner's new willingness to embrace reforms was down in part to Berlin's -- and in particular Schaeuble's -- unyielding stance. \nAthens' main index was up 1.16 percent at 681.78 points in Monday afternoon trading. \nAsian markets were mixed, with Tokyo helped by better-than-expected Japanese growth figures and Shanghai boosted by a government pledge to support China's volatile stock markets. \nThe dollar strengthened after solid US data boosted expectations of an imminent rate rise, heaping pressure on oil prices. \nChina's central bank meanwhile raised the value of the yuan against the dollar by 0.01 percent, the national foreign exchange market said, after a devaluation rocked markets last week. \nOn the corporate front, shares in Airbus lost early gains after the European plane maker said Indian airline IndiGo confirmed an order for 250 A320neo planes, a deal first announced last year. In mid-afternoon deals Airbus stock traded 0.43 percent lower at 62.12 euros. \nAirbus' largest-ever contract by number of planes is worth a massive $26.5 billion (24 billion euros) prior to the usual discounts, and brings to 530 the number of A320 and A320neo medium-haul planes owned by the low-cost Indian operator. \nLafargeHolcim (Other OTC: HCMLF - news ) meanwhile won 1.08 percent to 60.79 euros as the Franco-Swiss cement giant said it was selling some of its operations in India to Birla Corporation Limited (BSE: BIRLACORPN.BO - news ) for 750 million Swiss francs (692 million euros, $767 million). \nThe move, part of plans to cut debt, comes after the July merger of Lafarge (EUREX: 504482.EX - news ) and Holcim to create the world's largest cement company. \nUS stocks fell in opening trade Monday, kicking off a week that includes earnings from Wal-Mart Stores and the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes. \nFive minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.69 percent at 17,357.04 points. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 shed 0.51 percent at 2,080.77 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.45 percent to 5,025.73.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:37:42.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
