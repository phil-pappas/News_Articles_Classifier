When trading resumed yesterday, investors slashed the share price 7.5 per cent to $30.14.\nIt was the bank’s biggest market rout for any day since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, cutting its market capitalisation by $6.8 billion.\nThe rot spread to other banks, who had already sustained heavy losses the previous day: the big four shed a combined $17.5 billion in market value yesterday.\nCommonwealth Bank shares fell 3.8 per cent — taking their slump over the past two days to 6.9 per cent — while Westpac shares were down 3.3 per cent. National Australia Bank lost 2.3 per cent.\nAnalysts said the bad news for the major banks and their shareholders was not set to end there. Further selldowns were likely next week, IG Markets share analyst Angus Nicholson said.\n“The big four are not where you want to be. They are all set up to have further declines ­because they all need to ­announce new capital raisings,’’ Mr Nicholson said.\nThe banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, is pushing the banks to hold more cash and other assets regarded as particularly safe as a buffer against financial shocks. Broadly, they need a common equity ratio — a measure of how much cash they hold relative to their lending — of 10 per cent.\n“The two biggest concerns are going to be CBA and Westpac, they are the two biggest laggards in hitting their 10 per cent ratios,” Mr Nicholson said.\nThe CBA is due to post full-year results next week and analysts have speculated it will also announce a share issue, potentially up to $6 billion. That would likely trigger ­another wave of stock selling.\nAbout $61 billion was wiped from the value of the Australian stockmarket over the week.\nkarina.barrymore@news.com.au\n Banks savaged in $37bn ASX rout", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/banks-savaged-in-37bn-asx-rout/story-fni0dcne-1227474851000"], "published": "2015-08-08T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:49:37.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
