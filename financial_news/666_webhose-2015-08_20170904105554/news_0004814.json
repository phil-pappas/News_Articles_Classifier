Egypt's fight against terrorism is ongoing.\" \n- Ambitious target - \nSisi opened the ceremony by leading the flotilla aboard a refurbished yacht once owned by the former royal family, which carried French Empress Eugenie de Montijo at the canal's 1869 inauguration. \nSisi, elected last year on a promise to strengthen security and revive a dilapidated economy, broke ground on the canal project last August. \nInitial estimates suggested the new route would take up to three years to build, but Sisi set an ambitious target of 12 months. \nIt has been touted as a landmark achievement, rivalling the digging of the original 192-kilometre (119-mile) canal, which opened in 1869 after almost a decade of work. \nThe new section, funded entirely by Egyptian investors, runs part of the way alongside the existing canal connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. \nIt involved 37 kilometres of dry digging, creating what is effectively a \"second lane\", and widening and deepening another 35 kilometres of the existing canal. \nIt will cut the waiting period for vessels from 18 hours to 11. \nBy 2023, the number of ships using the canal will increase to 97 per day from 49 now, according to government projections. \nOfficials hope the new waterway will more than double Suez earnings from $5.3 billion expected at the end of 2015 to $13.2 billion in 2023. \nAnalysts were sceptical over the targets. \n\"The first priority for shipowners and traders is to cut costs, not speed. The trend in recent years has been for ships to travel at lower-than-normal speeds just to... save on their fuel bills,\" said Ralph Leszczynski, research head at Italian shipbrokers Banchero Costa. \n- Lavish ceremony - \nThursday's guests included Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, King Abdullah II of Jordan, Yemen's exiled President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi and Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah. \nNewly acquired French Rafale warplanes participated in the fly-past. \nBanners reading \"New Suez Canal: Egypt's Gift to the World\" and \"The Egyptian Miracle,\" as well as hundreds of national flags, graced the streets of Cairo and Ismailiya. \nDozens of buses ferried invitees to the site of the ceremony as security forces deployed in Ismailiya. \nWaving Egypt's red, white and black flag, a crowd gathered at Cairo's Tahrir Square -- epicentre of protests that ousted both Morsi and his predecessor Hosni Mubarak. \n\"On June 30 (2013) we changed the course of history; today we are changing the geography of the world,\" said jubilant tour operator Ibrahim el-Khatab, referring to the day when millions protested against Morsi. \nThe waterway is a cornerstone for Sisi to boost his regime's legitimacy after a deadly crackdown on dissent. \n\"The ability to accomplish such an economic project is part of cementing this legitimacy,\" said Amr Adly, of the Carnegie Middle East Center. \nMilitants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, mostly in the Sinai Peninsula that lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal. \nThe waterway is part of a comprehensive project to develop the area adjacent to the canal into an industrial hub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T21:20:40.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
