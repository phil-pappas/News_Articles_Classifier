You won’t need to set your alarm clock the night before, since you can get up any time you’d like. You can enjoy your breakfast at a leisurely pace, since you don’t have to rush out the door.Doesn’t that sound wonderful?But what about the 30th day or the 60th day? Will retirement still be a blessing, or will it feel like a curse since you don’t have something to get up for every morning? Work can be very fulfilling, which is why many baby boomers aren't retiring in the traditional sense. In fact, a recent study by Bankers Life Center for a Secure Retirement found that of middle-income baby boomers who are working in retirement, more than 6 in 10 do so because they find it fulfilling, not because they have to. Retirement can be fulfilling too, of course. Either way, any major change in life requires planning — and not just financial. Years ago, during a time when I was happy with the career I’d chosen but not with my current job, a friend gave me some sage advice: “[tweet_Quote: display=\"Run toward something — not away from something. #retirement\"]Run toward something — not away from something.[/tweet_Quote: ] ” So instead of immediately sending out resumes as a knee-jerk reaction, I took a year to look at what I really wanted to do and targeted the type of company I wanted to work for. When I actually made a transition, it was a calculated move rather than just jumping ship. In order to plan for a fulfilling retirement, consider taking these steps in the five years before you retire so you are transitioning toward retirement rather than away from working: 1. Have a dress rehearsal. If you’d like to move to another state or to a resort location when you retire, start going there now. A week-long trip isn’t going to cut it.

Talk to locals about what life is like living there day in and day out. 2. Don’t wait to make new connections. You and your friends may not be able to retire at the exact same time, so they may be still working and only have weekends available.Make connections now with people who are retired in your community, so you’ll have a group of friends to enjoy your hobbies with during the week.It may take some effort, but build an additional network of friends who aren’t associated with your workplace. 3. Re-ignite your hobbies . Retirement is essentially transitioning from “you at work” to “your money at work.” With extra time on your hands, you can rekindle any long-lost interests that you didn’t have time for when you were working.Did you play an instrument growing up and wish you’d kept it up? Find it in the recesses of your closet or rent one from a local music store and take some lessons.That’s what I did. I played the flute many years ago and had to drop it when I was raising kids and working full time.Now I play the flute on Sundays with our church choir (since I have time to practice). When I retire, I’d love to join other musicians to play at weddings and functions.Whatever your hobby — photography, golf, fishing, etc. — don’t wait until retirement to start enjoying it. 4. Make home improvements while you are still working. Whether you plan on staying in your home or you plan to sell, consider making any needed home improvements in the years leading up to retirement. If you like to DIY, set aside the funds you’ll need to tackle your projects until you have the time to devote to them. If you’re planning to sell, be sure not to over-improve your property. For example, according to the Remodeling.com 2015 Cost vs. Value Report , replacing a front door with a steel entry door and adding manufactured stone veneer to a home were high cost-to-value jobs for homeowners. Conversely, adding a sunroom generally didn’t provide as good of a return on dollars spent. 5. Update your financial plan. When you retire, you move from accumulation mode to distribution mode with your money. That process takes some strategy. Financial planning becomes more important as you transition to retirement — you need to have an idea of what your monthly spending will be to determine the income stream you’ll need. Five years out from retirement, you may want to tweak the asset allocation of your investments and start to earmark which funds to withdraw first, keeping taxes in mind as well as market volatility. If you don’t have a financial planner and haven’t set up a financial plan, now might be a good time to do so.
