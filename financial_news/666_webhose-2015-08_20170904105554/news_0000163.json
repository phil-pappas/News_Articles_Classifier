David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd One of the most fascinating succession battles in corporate Australia is happening away from prying eyes in the tasteful Perth headquarters of the country's premier conglomerate, Wesfarmers.\nUp until now it was generally assumed by the market that there was a two-horse race to replace successful and long-standing chief executive Richard Goyder .\nThe favourite was finance director Terry Bowen, who is privileged to be part of the board deliberations as an executive director. Having the chief financial officer on the board has been a tradition at Wesfarmers which worked well for Goyder, who replaced chairman-elect Michael Chaney.\nThe other horse in the CEO race is the ebullient managing director of home improvement and office supplies, John Gillam.\nThe outstanding performance of the Bunnings hardware chain, which is Chanticleer's second home, has cemented Gillam's reputation and made him the obvious person to fix the Woolworths Masters Home Improvement chain.\nGillam is a Perth boy but he comes to the succession planning process at Wesfarmers with a slight geographical disadvantage. He lives and works in Melbourne.\nThe succession process took a new twist on Tuesday when Goyder announced the first major management reshuffle in about 10 years with the exception of some unseemly rapid turnover of executives at the Target discount department store.\nThe reshuffle of executives has put Rob Scott, the former head of financial services, right in the frame as a potential CEO.\n Scott, a former investment banker, was the managing director of Wesfarmers Insurance, which was sold for a good price to Insurance Australia Group last year.\nHe was later tested out at Coles as finance director and then joined the management board of Coles Liquor.\nScott received a huge vote of confidence from Goyder and the board on Tuesday with his appointment to a new role called the Industrials Division.\nIt carries responsibility for the management of the three existing industrial businesses – chemicals, energy and fertilisers, resources, and industrial and safety. As a result of the changes, resources head Stewart Butel and chemicals, energy and fertilisers boss Tom O'Leary will report to Scott.\nReshuffle offers boost ﻿ Bowen gets a boost from the reshuffle because not only does he have more time on his hands to work on the big picture with Goyder, he has two new direct reports.\nOlivier Chretien, who has been running industrial and safety since 2008, will now run business development and corporate planning while Tim Bult moves from business development to a new role \"where he will oversee Wesfarmers' associated businesses and further develop the Group's offshore business development networks\".\nChretien and Bult will report to Bowen.\nGoyder told Chanticleer that the reshuffle was all about simplifying the management structure and gaining scale in an area that had divisions which were too small to warrant a separate reporting line.\nHe says it will free him up to work on the broader strategy and opportunities that present themselves.\nThe decision about who will replace Goyder, who just celebrated 10 years at the wheel, is bound up with the change of chairmanship from Bob Every to Chaney.\nAfter Chaney settles in as chairman following this year's annual meeting, the company can start to turn up the heat on the candidates. It is obvious to long-time observers of the company that it will be important for the replacement for Goyder to be found within the company's ranks.\nChaney says the candidates are always being tested and Wesfarmers has many talented executives.\nDividend stars The profit reporting season is only a few days old and already three companies have emerged as the stars in the dividend improvement stakes.\nRio Tinto took the lead early with a 41 per cent increase in its interim dividend to $1.449 a share fully franked.\nChief executive Sam Walsh told analysts at the interim profit briefing last week that he could not take all the credit for that generous increase in the payout. The big hike in the Australian dollar dividend is thanks to the fact Rio runs its business in US dollars. The rise in the US dollar meant the 12 per cent rise in US dollar payout translated to a 41 per cent hike for Australian shareholders.\nRio's dividend policy is to progressively lift its dividend in US cents.\nThe high bar set by Rio was beaten by Don Meij's Domino's Pizza Enterprises , which lifted is final dividend by 43 per cent to 27.2¢ a share fully franked. That took its total payout for the year to 51.8¢ a share fully franked.\nDomino's dividend payout ratio was 70 per cent in the year to June 2015. But the company is less generous with its cash than it used to be thanks to its intensive capital expansion program. It paid out 74 per cent of earnings in 2013.\nBut Domino's is not a yield play. At Tuesday's close it was yielding 1.9 per cent. The trade-off is that it is promising a 20 per cent growth in earnings, a growth rate that is less than prior years but still pretty heady.\nThe current winner in the dividend improvement stakes is Magellan Financial Group. It declared a fully franked final dividend of 37.8¢ a share, an increase of 73 per cent on the final dividend of 2014.\nThe dividend payout was in keeping with Magellan's policy of paying out 75 to 80 per cent of net profit after tax of the funds management business.\nThat dividend increase tells you a lot about the stellar results achieved by Hamish Douglass and his team in 2015. Funds under management rose 55 per cent to $36.4 billion and net profit more than doubled to $174.3 million.\nThe latest results have provided another example of the wisdom of owning the funds management company as well as its main products. Unitholders in the flagship Magellan Global Fund achieved a return of 29.5 per cent in the year to June while shareholders in Magellan Financial Group achieved a total return of 81.47 per cent.\nMLC turnaround Andrew Hagger, the group executive in charge of NAB Wealth, is happy to talk publicly about the turnaround achieved at MLC. He says the turnaround started two years ago when he walked in the door and immediately changed MLC's banker from Westpac Banking Corp to NAB. Yes, as mad as it may seem, NAB had owned MLC for 13 years and yet it was still doing its banking with a competitor.\nHagger reckons the high staff engagement scores and the roll-out of a series of digital products is a testament to the change in corporate culture in the wealth division, which has 1.7 million customers.\nMLC's net promoter score is plus 16 compared to the net promoter score for the overall bank of minus 10.\nHagger has a strong belief in the power of digital delivery mechanisms to lift the number of people seeking financial advice as well as improve the operating efficiency of MLC.\nAt the moment only about 20 per cent of Australians seek financial advice.\nHagger took his executive team to Silicon Valley in May where they visited a number of financial services companies including a major robo-advice provider.\nIn the coming months, NAB will launch its digital advice service to about 15,000 selected NAB customers through internet banking. It will be the first of the big four banks to do that.\nThe robo-advice already provided through MLC's website has uncovered some interesting trends. The fastest-growing product being sold through the digital delivery channel is a home loan.\nHagger says the changes at MLC will deliver higher returns to shareholders.\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:55:10.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
