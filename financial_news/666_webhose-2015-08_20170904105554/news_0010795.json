We have see a surge now but it could quite easily be that we see a fall again. You have to see a sustained move higher rather than a one-off move.\"\nThe German reading has particular importance with euro wide data due on Monday, and a meeting of the European Central Bank next Thursday that will likely discuss falling inflation expectations and a slowdown in the world's second largest economy China.\n\"Inflation for August will be too late for inclusion in the baseline for the September ECB staff forecasts to be presented next week, but will naturally be taken into account by Governing Council members at the meeting,\" said RBC in a note to clients.\nInflation factors coupled with China worries have also reduced the likelihood that the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates next month despite a strong rebound in domestic growth.\nEven with some key figures such as the Fed chair Janet Yellen and ECB president Mario Draghi missing, any headlines from a central bank meeting in Jackson Hole will be high on the agenda on Friday.\nGerman 10-year yields -- the bloc's benchmark -- were flat on the day at 0.73 percent at 0740 GMT, having flitted between 0.71-0.75 percent but failed to find any sustained direction. All other euro zone equivalents were also broadly unchanged.\nIn primary markets, Italy will auction a new 10-year bond, a test of risk appetite at the end of a rollercoaster week that has centred on fears of a slowdown in China.
