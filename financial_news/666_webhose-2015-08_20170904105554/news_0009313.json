Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Debra Cleveland What's the No.1 tip given by most retirees to those still working? Save more, because retirement often costs much more than you think.\nIn a survey of retirees by seniors website YourLifeChoices , when asked about \"advice I would give my younger/pre-retiree self\", the overwhelming response was save, put more into super, salary sacrifice. Publisher Kaye Fallick adds: \"They have a real DIY attitude – not 'see a planner' but save more, be more frugal.\"\nInterestingly, 57 per cent of those already retired felt their lifestyle was more frugal than they had expected. Just under 50 per cent said they did not have sufficient savings to lead a comfortable retirement lifestyle.\nSo for those still on the \"wrong\" side of retirement, ie working, how do they avoid this happening to them? How do they work out how much is enough before they stop work?\nThe first step is to work out your likely annual spend in retirement. As a guide, look at the ASFA Retirement Standard . It benchmarks the annual budget needed by Australians to fund either a comfortable or modest lifestyle in post-work years.\nIt argues a single person wanting a comfortable lifestyle would need just under $43,000 a year and a couple just under $60,000. If a lot of overseas travel is your aim, be aware that this budget only allocates about $2900 a year for this, which won't get you very far. Drilling down into the different areas of spend in this tool is very worthwhile because it's easy to see whether your household would spend roughly the same (or more or less) on insurance, utilities, clothing etc. It's exactly like being handed a good budgeting tool rather than having to start from scratch yourself.\nSo let's say you want to build in a bit more comfort and travel and have worked out you'll probably need $90,000 a year, what's your next step? \"Generally speaking, a sustainable annual income should be no more than 5 per cent of the superannuation balance,\" says Jonathan Philpot, wealth management partner at HLB Mann Judd Sydney. On that basis, your retirement nest egg would need to be $1.8 million – or curb your overseas travel plans to survive on a lower balance.\nAnd if your super balance is not looking rosy enough to retire and you have to continue working for longer, you'll be in good company. The 2015 FSC-CBA Older Workers Report found 72 per cent of those surveyed (all aged 50 to 75) were willing to stay in the workforce for longer. Financial security was why 61 per cent of them would continue working.\n Nicolette Rubinsztein, Commonwealth Bank's general manager retirement, says sustaining a comfortable retirement is a priority for older workers. The report found two-thirds of older workers (65 per cent) are satisfied they have sufficient funds put aside to retire, a big increase from 2012 where satisfaction levels with retirement savings were below 50 per cent.\n\"Australians' attitudes towards retirement are changing,\" she adds. \"No longer is the road to retirement such a defined path but [about] providing older workers with the support and flexibility to continue working until the time is right for them to retire and for reasons they choose.\"\nIf you're not yet retired and are concerned about whether you'll have enough, make a start with pre-tax (or\" concessional\") contributions . Remember when you salary-sacrifice into super, more goes into your retirement kitty because it's taxed going into the fund generally at only 15 per cent compared with your marginal tax rate if received as salary and then invested elsewhere.\ndcleveland@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["https://www.superannuation.asn.au/resources/retirement-standard", "https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=yourlifechoices", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DEBRACLEVELANDmoney/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/ClevelandAFR"], "published": "2015-07-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T07:08:07.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
