The index was down 30 points or 0.45% to 6688.23%. \nChinese exports fell 8.3%, the biggest drop in four months and more than forecasts for a 1% decline. Imports dipped 8.1% in July, in line with market consensus. \nSeparately, Chinese inflation grew 1.6% year-on-year in July, up from 1.4% the previous month and ahead of estimates of 1.5%. However, the figure remains well below the government's target of around 3%, adding pressure to roll out more stimulus to support China's economy. \nIn London, shares in heavyweight insurer Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) were down almost 2% ahead of half-year results on Tuesday. The company is waiting for details on a change in US law that could stifle sales of variable annuities. \nMiners Anglo American and BHP Biliton fell 2% and 1.72% respectively, as the sector continued to be depressed by the poor numbers from China falling metals prices. \nSupermarket stock were also in the red with Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) and Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) 's both down around 2%. \nOn the positive side, shares in satellite telecoms group Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) continued to rise on news that the launch of its third Global Xpress satellite has been rescheduled for this month. \nShire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) rose 0.85% on news that it is poised to start formal takeover talks with US rival Baxalta (Berlin: 9BX.BE - news ) in a deal that could be worth Â£20bn. \nLondon Stock Exchange Group rose 0.62% after excellent first-half profits numbers last week. \nFTSE 100 - Risers Carnival (CCL) 3,538.00p +1.52% Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) (BDEV) 654.00p +1.08% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 960.50p +0.95% Shire Plc (SHP) 5,345.00p +0.85% Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) (TW.) 201.30p +0.85% Mondi (MNDI) 1,610.00p +0.81% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 523.00p +0.77% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,582.00p +0.62% Persimmon (PSN) 2,095.00p +0.53% Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 809.00p +0.43% FTSE 100 - Fallers Sainsbury (J) (SBRY) 262.20p -2.05% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 784.50p -2.00% Prudential (Amsterdam: PD8.AS - news ) (PRU (HKSE: 2378-OL.HK - news ) ) 1,498.50p -1.96% Tesco (TSCO) 211.70p -1.90% Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,454.00p -1.82% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 909.90p -1.78% Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) (LLOY) 80.68p -1.77% BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (BLT) 1,170.50p -1.72% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 579.50p -1.70% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 345.20p -1.68%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T17:19:23.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
