A Reuters survey of nine analysts expected a decline of 0.53 percent.\nA comparison of the monthly indexes showed the Brazilian economy contracted by 1.89 percent in the second quarter from the first.\nThe IBC-Br index, a gauge of activity in the farming, industry and services sectors, is an early indicator of gross domestic product figures. IBGE, the country's statistics institute, will publish second-quarter economic activity results on Aug. 28.\nThe Brazilian economy shrank 0.2 percent in the first quarter as investments fell for the seventh straight quarter.\nIf confirmed by official data, the back-to-back contractions will show what most economists already know: The Brazilian economy has fallen into a deep recession.\nA weekly central bank survey of economists published on Monday showed expectations that the Brazilian economy would shrink by 0.15 percent next year, following a sharp contraction of more than 2 percent forecast for this year.\nBrazil has not faced two years of declines since the Great Depression of the 1930s, economists said.\nYears of dwindling confidence exacerbated by a growing political crisis and corruption scandal at major state-run companies has dragged down investment and consumption in Brazil.\nAfter being re-elected in October, President Dilma Rousseff has cut expenditures and raised taxes to regain market confidence after years of interventionist policies that spooked investors.
