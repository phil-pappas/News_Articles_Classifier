As a result we are cautious on the outlook for the balance of the year.\" \nThe announcement came as the group, which had a lacklustre debut on London’s stock market in February , unveiled its first-half results. \nThe figures were in line with what City analysts had been expecting, although these forecasts had already been revised down in June when management warned that second quarter trading was below expectations . \nAdjusted cash profit, which excludes interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptional costs, fell flat at £28.9m in the six months to the end of June. \nHowever, pre-tax losses widened to £14.1m, compared to £11.1m the year before, despite a 12pc rise in sales to £146.4m. \nStill, HSS said that its strategy to gain market share was working well and that it was making progress with plans to open a new distribution centre next year, which it hopes will increase tool equipment availability. \nThe company also plans to cut costs by between £8m and £12m next year, with up to £3m in the final quarter of this year. \nThe group, which is still partially owned by private equity firm Exponent (NasdaqGS: EXPO - news ) , said that it was “assessing further cost saving opportunities” through refinancing its existing debt facilities next year. \nHSS has been passed through a succession of private equity owners over the years. The company had been in the hands of 3i from 2003 to 2007 before passing to a fund led by City grandee Archie Norman. Inl 2012 it was taken over by Exponent. \nThe company is worth £199m and has lost nearly 40pc of its value since listing on the stock market six months ago .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T11:52:42.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
