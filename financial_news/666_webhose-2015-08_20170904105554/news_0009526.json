They have also experienced growing pains associated with integrating new businesses, which have weighed on their share prices.\nMost importantly though they recently delivered quality full-year results with positive outlook statements, suggesting they could be back to their best.\nGUD Holdings Within a week of announcing its annual result the share price of GUD Holdings had increased 20 per cent from $8.46 to a high of $10.18, a level it hadn't traded at since 2007.\nA number of factors contributed to positive sentiment, but from an overall perspective underlying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $58.9 million was at the top end of guidance and exceeded the expectations of most brokers.\nMacquarie was forecasting EBIT of $57 million and the better than expected performance prompted the broker to slightly increase forward earnings estimates, as well as upgrade its target price from $9.40 to $9.60.\nJPMorganâ€‹ also increased its 12 month price target from $8.84 to $9.59, highlighting strong top line growth in the second half of 2014-15 as a key positive.\n In terms of GUD's existing businesses, a turnaround in its core Sunbeam operations was a notable development. While the Davey water products business and the resilient automotive products operations generated lower EBIT growth than some of the other divisions, the latter should be a substantial driver of group earnings in 2015-16 and beyond.\nThis will be assisted by a full-year contribution from the May acquisition of Brown and Watson International, a leading supplier of lighting, electrical, battery power and maintenance products to the automotive aftermarket.\nGUD said at the time of the $200 million acquisition that it was expected to generate EBIT of $27.9 million in 2015-16, and with management having flagged a substantial uplift in earnings in the coming 12 months the integration process appears to be on track.\nSuper Retail Group A number of game changing acquisitions have been made by Super Retail since the group listed on the ASX in July 2004. The company's entry into the boating, camping and fishing industry via its market leading BCF stores underpinned strong growth in its early stages.\nHowever, the Super Cheap Auto operations has been the rock the company has been built around and while this relatively mature chain of retail stores traditionally generates low single digit year-on-year earnings growth, it has provided a good balance of stability against the substantial growth initiatives that have been undertaken in recent years.\nThese have included rapid expansion of the boating camping and fishing business, which has included the acquisition of Ray's Outdoors and an aggressive rollout of new BCF stores. However, it was the $610 million acquisition of Rebel Group that has taken some time to bed down.\nAt the time of acquisition Rebel was the clear leader in the Australian sporting goods retail sector with 128 stores (including 26 Amart outlets) and an estimated market share of 24 per cent.\nThe combined Rebel and Amart operations generated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $93.2 million in 2014-15, representing a year-on-year increase of 10.8 per cent. It is also worth noting that its contribution accounted for approximately 40 per cent of group EBITDA.\nBell Potter noted EBIT margins for the sports division of 9.4 per cent were ahead of its expectations of 8.2 per cent, suggesting this business is shaping up as the medium term growth engine, particularly given scope for expansion in an industry ripe for consolidation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:16:01.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
