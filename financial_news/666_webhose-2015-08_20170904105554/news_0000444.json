This is already the second Tube strike in the space of a month. \nMeanwhile, RMT leaders have claimed the offer \"is just a rehash of an earlier package\" which doesn't address concerns about work/life balance. \nThey believe Underground staff have not been properly consulted about the rota changes that night work would bring, leaving them \"at the beck and call of management to plug staffing gaps\". \nBut Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, has stressed that all workers will still get two days off in every seven, and will have ample opportunity to swap shifts with colleagues if they so wish.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:52:13.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
