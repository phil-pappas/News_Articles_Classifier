Data for August 20-26 showed a record $28 billion in outflows from equity funds.\nStrong gains over the last two days suggested that the worst might be over, but the CBOE Volatility index indicated that the market was still more volatile than usual.\nThe index - popularly known as the \"fear index\" - was up 2 percent at 26.67. It soared to a more than 6-year-high earlier in the week.\n\"The VIX average for the year has been about 15 and I definitely expect it to be above 20 in the short-term,\" said Frederick.\nIn China, stocks jumped more than 4 percent for the second day as authorities announced that pension funds managed by local governments will start investing 2 trillion yuan ($313 billion) as soon as possible in stocks and other assets.\nAt 12:03 ET (1603 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 69.02 points, or 0.41 percent, at 16,585.75, the S&P 500 was down 5.44 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,982.22 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 9.55 points, or 0.2 percent, at 4,803.16.\nSix of the 10 major sectors were lower, with the utilities index's 0.8 percent fall leading the decliners. The energy index jumped 2 percent a day after oil prices jumped the most in a day since 2009.\nData released on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending picked up a bit in July as households bought more automobiles, offering further evidence of strength in the economy.\nFreeport-McMoRan shares were up 2 percent to $10.40 after activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed an 8.5 percent stake in the company.\nAutodesk was down 4.9 percent at $47.54 after the maker of computer-aided design software cut its full-year profit and revenue forecast for the second time this year.\nBig Lots was jumped 14.9 percent to $48.25 after its second-quarter profit beat expectations and the company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,637 to 1,323. On the Nasdaq, 1,565 issues rose and 1,131 fell.\nThe S&P 500 index showed one new 52-week high and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 14 new highs and 13 new lows.
