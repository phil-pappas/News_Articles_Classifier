No constant roar of jet engines. No screeches from landing gear. Just promises, year after year, that it would shuttle paying passengers to the edges of Earth.\nVirgin Galactic had proclaimed 2015 was finally going to be the year. That was until the company's rocket-powered spacecraft broke apart over California's Mojave Desert during a test flight last northern autumn, killing one pilot and igniting speculation about the future of commercial space tourism and Spaceport America. Virgin Galactic chief executive George Whitesides said things are on track now. \"I really think we're turning the corner,\" Whitesides said. \"We've gone through one of the toughest things a company can go through and we're still standing, and now we're really moving forward with pace.\" He said the company and its investors weren't backing down from the goal of making space accessible. Virgin Galactic's manufacturing crew had proceeded with building a new spacecraft, and the operations team had ramped up a test-flight program. \"Our company has spent a lot of time and money to get to the point where we can carry out successful commercial operations at Spaceport America. We're still committed,\" he said. Whitesides has always been reluctant to attach a timeline to the milestones the company needs to reach, but he was certain test flights would resume later in 2015. That news was what New Mexico taxpayers wanted to hear. They've already funnelled nearly a quarter of a billion dollars into the world's first purpose-built spaceport, and state lawmakers were asked for nearly $US2 million more to make up for the lost fees stemming from the delay in Virgin Galactic's commercial flights. Some lawmakers have called for the plug to be pulled, adding fuel to criticisms that the project was a waste of time and money. Others, including Republican Governor Susana Martinez's administration, say the state has a chance to carve out a new niche for economic development and position itself on the front end of space tourism. New Mexico has struggled to rebound from the recession, while neighbouring states have bounced back. When Whitesides visited Spaceport America in December, the runway was quiet. But workers inside the massive, futuristic hangar continued to outfit it for the day Virgin Galactic opens. \"I really think we're on the edge of something truly incredible, which is enabling people and students to experience space, whether going themselves or sending their experiments,\" he said. He added: \"These things are hard. That's why they haven't happened yet.\" Christine Anderson, the head of New Mexico's Spaceport Authority, pointed to the ill-fated Apollo I launch rehearsal and the 1986 Challenger explosion as examples of space exploration efforts that resulted in tragedy. Still, astronauts and scientists pushed on and, she said, those backing Virgin Galactic and Spaceport America are doing the same. \"We have invested $US218 million, so there's absolutely no reason to stop now,\" she said.
