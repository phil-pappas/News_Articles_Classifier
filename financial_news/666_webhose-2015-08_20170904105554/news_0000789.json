The department revised the number in June to 231,000 and in May to 260,000. \nThat brought the average monthly jobs gains to 235,000 over the past three months, heightening expectations that the Fed could raise its near-zero federal funds rate as early as next month. \nThe unemployment rate held steady at a seven-year low of 5.3 percent, as expected. That is close to the 5.0 to 5.2 percent range the Fed views as normal for maximum employment over the longer run. \nThe Fed has held the benchmark federal funds rate near zero since late 2008 in a bid to support the economy's recovery from the Great Recession, and has said it would move rates higher carefully so as not to derail growth. \nIn its late-July policy statement, the Federal Open Market Committee said it would consider it appropriate to raise the fed funds rate when it had seen \"some further improvement\" in the labor market and was \"reasonably confident\" that inflation, now tepid, will move back towards its 2.0 percent target. \n\"There can be no doubt in our view that today's employment report does indeed represent 'some further' improvement in the labor market -- if not more,\" said Harm Bandholz of UniCredit (Milan: UCG.MI - news ) . \n\"It, therefore, further strengthens our view for the first rate hike in September.\" \nThe US private sector added 210,000 jobs, while government payrolls increased by 5,000. \nJob growth was largely concentrated in retail trade, health care, professional and technical services, and financial activities. \nThe robust US auto market encouraged dealerships to add 13,000 jobs, about a third of the total retail sector gains. \nConstruction added 6,000 jobs after none in June, while manufacturing bounced higher, by 15,000 jobs, after months of tepid gains. \nFalling oil and other commodity prices continued to take a toll on employment in mining, which lost 5,000 jobs in July. Since the recent peak last December the sector has shed 78,000 jobs. \n- Wage growth weak - \nThe length of the average workweek ticked higher, while the hourly wage -- watched closely by the Fed for signs of tightening slack in the jobs market -- edged up 0.2 percent to $24.99 after being flat in June. Year-on-year, wages were up 2.1 percent. \n\"Yearly earnings growth has been unable to break above 2.3 percent in the post-recession economy, a sign labor market slack may be greater than indicated by the unemployment rate,\" said Jay Morelock of FTN Financial. \nThe number of long-term unemployed -- those out of a job for at least 27 weeks -- barely budged at 2.2 million, and represented nearly 27 percent of the jobless. \nThe labor force participation rate was unchanged at 62.6 percent, the lowest level since 1977. \nAnd those employed only part-time who wanted full-time jobs was little changed at 6.3 million. \nFed policymakers still have the August jobs report to digest, just days before the September 16 to 17 FOMC meeting. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen has said the rate hike was likely in 2015, and the September meeting is one of three before the year ends. \n\"A labor force participation rate that remains at a 38-year low and wage gains that could be signaling more slack in the labor market don't make a September rate hike a slam dunk,\" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS (NYSE: IHS - news ) . \nBut David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, said the Fed should \"take the shot\" in September. \n\"Markets, economists, and analysts expect it.... The biggest risk is if the Fed does not move.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T00:15:12.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
