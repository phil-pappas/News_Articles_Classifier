The BMW i8 is positioned as a halo sports car model and is priced as such, while the BMW i3 offers city proportions and versatility in a compact package.\nWhat BMW does not have at the moment is an electric luxury sedan, but it definitely sounds like they’re thinking about it, according to a report from Reuters.\n“There is space if you look at it from the number point of view,” BMW CEO Harald Krueger told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung when prompted about new models in the pipeline.\nRecent reports indicate that BMW may build the potential i5 in two flavors: as a plug-in hybrid and as a pure electric. This would give buyers the option of picking a green car tailored to their needs, their location and their commute while using a common bodystyle and drivetrain. The design could replicate the general size and layout of the 5-series, though a Bavarian Tesla Model S rival is likely to offer a unique design, meant to advance the distinct look of the electric lineup, as well as distinctive interior packaging.\nPorsche is said to be readying a smaller hybrid sedan referred to in the automotive press as the Pajun, even though its name is unconfirmed. The Pajun, which may appear at the Frankfurt Motor Show opening Sept. 17 in concept form, is expected to be aimed generally at the Tesla Model S. Reports of the Pajun date back three years, and have recently intensified with promises of a 300-hp Tesla Model S fighter.\nGiven the amount of time that the Tesla TSLA, +2.25% sedan has been on the market and the range of electric cars that German manufacturers have launched in recent years, it is only a matter of time until a major manufacturer takes on the Model S directly. We’ll have to wait and see whether it comes out of Munich or Stuttgart first.\nThe story “BMW planning a Tesla Model S rival?” first appeared on Autoweek.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://autoweek.com/auto-shows/frankfurt-motor-show", "http://autoweek.com/article/green-cars/bmw-planning-tesla-model-s-rival", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/02/us-bmw-electric-idUSKCN0Q707020150802"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T14:07:53.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
