Net operating income growth was 4.2 per cent for the half-year. The higher-margin specialty sales increase was an average 10 per cent, with jewellery leading the charge, showing 15.6 per cent sales growth.\nSince the restructure, Westfield has separated its malls into flagship and regional portfolios. The group will pump $US1.6 billion into the flagship portfolio, which includes Century City in Los Angeles, San Diego's UTC and Valley Fair in California's Silicon Valley.\nIt is also developing a mall in Milan in Italy that is to be anchored by upmarket French retailer Galeries Lafayette.\nFunds From Operations (FFO) came in at $US380 million while the distribution for the six months to June 30 was 12.55¢ per security, also in line with forecast.\nThe UBS sales desk said the development business was on track and the stable portfolio was showing the benefit of focusing on high-quality centres.\nWestfield's Peter Lowy and Steven Lowy said the benefits of the restructure could be seen in the progress made on the $US11.4 billion development program.\nSteven Lowy said Westfield would also look to expand its digital offerings through Westfield Labs, with more ticketless parking in the US malls, to \"connect the consumer both physically and digitally through our mall infrastructure\".\n\"This year we expect to commence $US2.5 billion of projects, having already commenced $US1.6 billion of redevelopments to date in 2015 including Century City in Los Angeles and UTC in San Diego, with the expansion at Westfield London expected to commence later this year,\" he said.\n\"The $US1.4 billion Westfield World Trade Centre is now fully leased and committed. This will be a spectacular shopping, dining, event and entertainment destination integrated into the World Trade Centre Transportation Hub in Lower Manhattan.\"\nThe project will showcase a diverse mix of more than 100 domestic and international fashion, dining, beauty, entertainment and technology retailers as well as a \"world-class\" food offering, led by Eataly​, an Italian dining group. The project is now expected to open in the first half of 2016.\nThe distribution for the six months to June 30 was 12.55¢ per security.\nThe group reconfirmed its FFO forecast for the 2015 year of 37.7¢ per security, including the impact of the $US925 million O'Connor joint venture in the US that was completed in February.\nThe distribution forecast for the 2015 year was also reconfirmed at 25.1¢ per security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:23:05.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
