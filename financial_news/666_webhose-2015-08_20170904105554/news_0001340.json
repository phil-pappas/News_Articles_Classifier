She is recognized with this prestigious distinction for leadership in the oil and gas industry. With more than 700,000 members and over 200 operating Local Chapters, NAPW is the nation’s leading networking organization exclusively for professional women. “I’m pleased to recognize Stacey with this important honor,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “Her perseverance, work ethic and leadership qualities are an inspiration to all women.”\nStacey Greene began her career as a Receptionist at Chemical Waste Management right out of high school. After some time, she transferred to their sister company Advanced Environmental Technical Services as a Contract Coordinator. It was there she realized men were making much more than her because they had a degree and she did not. Growing up, Ms. Greene always heard her father talk about the safety aspects of the business he worked for and how difficult it was to tell a spouse when an injury or death had occurred. Driven to succeed, she ob-tained a degree in Environmental Health Technology.\nFor the past eight years, Ms. Greene has worked at Oceaneering International, Inc.(OII). Starting in 2007, she was the SubSea Products Regional HSE Manager and promoted to HSE Director of Strategic Processes in late 2014. She is responsible for the Health, Safety, Environmental Management System (HSEMS) and developing the system with regulatory / legislative agencies worldwide, encompassing customer requirements to meet all needs around the world.\nAlthough it can be challenging to stay on top of all the changes within the company, she is rewarded with her professional success and is passionate to build an even stronger foundation for herself and family.\nAbout NAPW\nNAPW’s mission is to provide an exclusive, highly advanced networking forum to successful women executives, professionals and entrepreneurs where they can aspire, connect and achieve. Through innovative resources, unique tools and progressive benefits, professional women interact, exchange ideas, advance their knowledge and empower each other.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbS91c2Vycy9zdGFjZXktZ3JlZW5lLTE=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5uYXB3LmNvbQ=="], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:20:24.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
