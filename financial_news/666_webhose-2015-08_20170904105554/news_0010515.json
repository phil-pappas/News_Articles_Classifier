The Brazilian government will send to Congress a budget proposal for 2016 that projects a primary deficit instead of the previously expected surplus, according to two people familiar with the matter. Stocks also slumped on renewed concern that China, Brazil’s top trading-partner, will fail to revive its economy.\n“Brazil is getting closer to a rating cut,” Alvaro Bandeira, an economist at Banco Modal, said from Rio de Janeiro. “There’s lack of credibility toward the fiscal adjustment. In addition to that, all the uncertainties regarding China’s growth is dimming the outlook for Brazilian exports.”\nBear Market Brazilian equities entered a bear market this month, after plunging more than 20 percent from their peak in May, as Rousseff faces backlash from lawmakers as she tries to approve measures to shore up the budget amid forecasts for the longest recession since the 1930s. Moody’s Investors Service cited lack of political consensus on attempts to repair government finances as well as a faltering economy when it lowered Brazil to the lowest level of investment grade this month. Standard & Poor’s cut its outlook for the nation in July, moving closer to reducing its credit rating to junk.\nThe Ibovespa tumbled 2.9 percent to 45,784.03 at 11:05 a.m. in Sao Paulo, bringing its monthly slide 9.9 percent. The real retreated 2.6 percent to 3.6762 per dollar. Brazil’s bond risk, as measured by credit-default swaps, jumped to a six-year high.\nEconomy Forecast Brazilian markets also slumped after analysts forecast a deeper recession, while remaining unconvinced that inflation will slow to the target in 2016. The economy will contract by 2.26 percent in 2015 and by 0.4 percent next year, according to the Aug. 28 central bank poll of about 100 analysts. The top five economists surveyed by the monetary authority cut their median outlook for the real at the end of next year to 3.83 per dollar, which would be the weakest since October 2002.\n“Brazil’s current story is a reality check,” said Martial Godet, the head of Europe and emerging-market equities and derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “The nation is facing more bad news almost every day.”\nSwap rates, a gauge of expectations for changes in borrowing costs, soared 0.31 percentage point to 14.26 percent on the contract maturing in January 2017, extending their monthly increase to 0.83 percentage point.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:23:56.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
