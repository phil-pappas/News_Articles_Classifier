Increased appetite for risk sent government bonds and the Japanese yen down Wednesday while the dollar rose.\nAnnual U.S. gross domestic product growth was revised to 3.7 percent from the 2.3 percent rate reported last month and last week's jobless claims fell more than expected.\n\"Can the U.S. economy prove the naysayers wrong? Well, so far it has been able to do that and today's data really puts a line under that,\" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.\nThe data came after New York Fed President William Dudley had said Wednesday that arguments for a September rate increase \"seem less compelling\" than only weeks ago, given the threat posed to the U.S. economy by recent market turmoil.\nOn top of these factors investor nerves in China and Europe were helped overnight by Wall Street's Wednesday rally, as well as strong lending data from Europe, according to John Canally, Chief Economic Strategist for LPL Financial.\n\"People are just taking a second look at what caused the 10 percent correction in the first place. Not only is the Chinese market not connected to the global economy. It's not connected to the Chinese economy.\"\nMarkets around the world plunged earlier in the week as a slump in Shanghai shares fueled worries over China's economic health. While Beijing moved to ease policy late on Tuesday, stocks still ended weak that day, but Wall Street staged a strong comeback late Wednesday and its biggest daily gain in four years helped to calm investor nerves overseas.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 369.26 points, or 2.27 percent, to 16,654.77, the S&P 500 gained 47.15 points, or 2.43 percent, to 1,987.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 115.17 points, or 2.45 percent, to 4,812.71.\nMost U.S. Treasuries prices fell modestly, as the Wall Street rally and the U.S. data revived some bets the Federal Reserve would raise rates by year-end.\nThe spate of market volatility comes also as investors watch an annual meeting of the world's top central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming for clues on how the turmoil may shake up policy plans.\nIn Europe, the FTSEuroFirst index of leading European companies closed up 3.6 percent. Germany's DAX , France's CAC 40 and Britain's FTSE 100 all climbed more than 3 percent.\nThe two main Chinese indices surged 5.3 percent and 5.9 percent on Thursday, snapping a five-day losing streak that had sent tremors around global financial markets.\nEmerging markets stocks rebounded with MSCI's benchmark emerging market stocks index up 3.3 percent.\nThe dollar advanced for a third consecutive session, bolstered by gains in global equities as well as the U.S. data. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was up 0.7 percent Thursday afternoon.\nCrude oil rocketed in its biggest one-day rally since 2009 as recovering equity markets and news of diminished crude supplies set off a short-covering surge by bearish traders.\nU.S. crude futures settled up 10.3 percent at $42.56 a barrel. The contracts had slumped to a 6 1/2-year low on Monday, dogged by a supply glut and China worries. Brent settled up 10.3 percent to $47.56.\nCopper was up about 4.2 percent, moving further away from Monday's six-year low.
