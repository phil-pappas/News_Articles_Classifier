The average Brent oil price between June and December 2014 was $89.11 while the average for the second six months to June 2015 was $57.80. The price of crude oil on Tuesday morning was $50.12.\nThis suggests that earnings will fall further in the next six months if oil stays near to current levels.\nA 10% weaker average rand/US dollar exchange rate has sweetened the results somewhat. However, Beelders believes that investors are increasingly looking at companies on a global basis. “This means Sasol is no longer priced by the marginal SA investor who considers ZAR earnings, but by the marginal international investor who would consider dollar earnings. Sasol would therefore have to stand out against peers like Exxon, BP, Chevron. I don’t think it looks great on that basis.”\nThe lower oil price was mitigated to some extent by a strong operational performance. Liquid fuel sales increased by 5% from the prior year. The Base Chemicals and Performance Chemicals businesses increased their sales volumes by 2% and 3%, respectively, on a comparable basis. In addition, the ORYX GTL facility sustained its solid performance, with an average utilisation rate of 90% for the year, despite a 28-day shutdown during December 2014 and January 2015.\nThe company also noted that the gross margin remained stable, as a result of its diversified asset portfolios as well as the savings from its ‘Response Plan’ initiatives. These were implemented early in the year in reaction to the lower-for-longer oil price environment. Measures include reducing capital investment and the suspension of the progressive dividend policy.\nNormalised cash fixed costs are also trending below inflation due to the Business Performance Enhancement Programme and Response Plan cost savings targets for the 2015 financial year.\nBeyond this investors will have to wait for the detail of the results, scheduled for release early September, as there are many adjustments for staff share schemes, the reversal of the Competition Commission fine, and other impairments that make it difficult to assess whether the numbers are fair under the circumstances or not.\nThe one notable item in the update is the further partial impairment of Sasol’s share in the Montney shale gas assets of about R1.3 billion due to poor conditions in the North American gas market following in a 19% decline in natural gas prices. This is in addition to the impairment of R5.3 billion recognised in the prior financial year.\n“This serves to show what a lemon Sasol bought under the last CEO Pat Davies,” says Terence Craig, director at Element Investment Managers.\nLike Beelders, he has some concerns that are not just in relation to the oil price. “We view David Constable’s resignation as a negative considering that it comes right in the middle of major international capex and project spend.”\nThe board has attempted to allay investor concerns by retaining Constable as a consultant, however this is not ideal either. “It is a negative for any new CEO as he would not have been party to that decision,” Craig adds.\nOne detail he will be looking for in the coming results is progress on the Louisiana ethane cracker project and its ongoing economics. This at least is a little more within the scope of management’s control.\nThe oil price is not. While the ‘consensus’ view is that commodity prices are going to bounce back at some point, one has to wonder given the increased skepticism regarding China’s public economic numbers and concern that China is not growing as fast as it says it is. It’s possible that commodity prices could be lower for some time.\nSpeaking to Siki Mgabadeli and Hanna Barry on Friday’s SAFM Market Update, commentator Wayne McCurrie from Momentum Wealth noted that at $50/barrel Sasol is probably fairly priced.\n“If you think the oil price is going to fall another $10, sell, if you think it’s going up another $10, you must be a strong buyer of it. So it [the share price] will be very dependent on what the oil prices does.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T15:44:45.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
