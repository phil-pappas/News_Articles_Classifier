Results of Operations and Financial Condition. \nOn August 10, 2015, PhotoMedex, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NasdaqGS and TASE: PHMD) issued a press release announcing its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The full text of such press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report. \nThe Company makes reference to non-GAAP financial information in the press release furnished herewith. Specifically, these non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted net loss and non-GAAP adjusted loss per share. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company's reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, nor superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and to provide further information for comparative purposes. \nSpecifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook. In addition, the Company believes non-GAAP measures that exclude stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash or non-recurring expenses enhance the comparability of results against prior periods. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in the press release. \nThe information set forth under this Item 2.02, including Exhibit 99.1, is being furnished and shall not be deemed \"filed\" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of such section, nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in any such filing.
