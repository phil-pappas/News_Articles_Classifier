I thought Gov. Jindal got through without making a mistake, but I’m not sure he distinguished himself from the other candidates on the stage,” he was Quote: d as saying.\nIn a statement, Jindal’s campaign manager Timmy Teepell declared victory.\n“We saw plenty of smooth talking and famous names running for President, but only one candidate in the race has the backbone, the bandwith and the experience to get the job done as President – Governor Jindal,” he said.\n“President Obama’s failure as President shows why we cannot trust a candidate who needs on-the-job-training no matter how well they speak. Governor Jindal is the most substantive of all the candidates in the field. He is a full spectrum conservative who will endorse, and not hide, his conservative principles,” Teepell said.\nFirst Published on August 07, 2015 9:35 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:46:00.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
