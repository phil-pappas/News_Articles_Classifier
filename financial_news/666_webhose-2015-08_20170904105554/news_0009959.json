Josh Robenstone by John Stensholt and Jon Pierik The AFL could face legal action after making a controversial decision that sees it on the verge of awarding player GPS tracking and data services contract to Champion Data, a company the league owns 49 per cent of.\nSeveral institutional shareholders of the ASX-listed Catapult Group International are understood to have urged Catapult management to considering suing the AFL over the league's decision to award Champion Data \"preferred partner\" status.\nCatapult announced the AFL's move to the sharemarket on Monday morning, after which its shares quickly fell in value. The company had previously been one of the best performers on the ASX this year, having almost trebled in value.\nCatapult currently provides GPS tracking devices to all the clubs, the AFL umpires and AFL development pathways. Several AFL clubs contacted by Fairfax Media expressed concern about the decision, given they have long-term contracts with Catapult and are satisfied with the level of service being provided to them.\nData collected by the clubs is used to monitor player fatigue and injury rates during matches and training, with decisions such as player interchanges and training loads made at least in part by analysing the data.\nAccording to documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, AFL general counsel Andrew Dillon and the league's general manager of broadcasting Simon Lethlean, are directors of Champion Data.\nWhen asked if there were conflict of interest concerns about the decision, an AFL spokesman said: \"The AFL football operations department, under [football operations manager] Mark Evans, received proposals from a number of companies looking to be the AFL's preferred operator for tracking devices.\nIndustry experts part of review \"The department utilised industry experts to review parts of the proposals and following that review it was the football operations department that put a final recommendation to the AFL executive. Andrew and Simon as members of the AFL executive were aware of the recommendation.\"\nCatapult shares fell by more than 12 per cent in early trading on the ASX on Monday morning, before ending the day down 8.5 per cent at $1.50. Even with the fall the stock has risen 134 per cent this year.\nAustralia, including the AFL, accounts for about 15 per cent of Catapult's business. It also has contracts to provide its services to major United Sports teams in the NFL, NBA and college sports.\nThe company announced to the ASX before the market opened that \"Catapult has been advised that the AFL has entered into preferred partner negotiations with Champion Data regarding athlete tracking services from the AFL from season 2017.\"\nShaun Holthouse, Catapult's chief executive said the company understood its existing contracts with the AFL and its clubs would remain in place.\n\"With overseas markets now comprising approximately 85 per cent of Catapult's revenue in 2015, and growing, Australian football has become less significant financially. However we were keen to showcase our very exciting emerging technologies with them, to deliver new business opportunities around data commercialisation.\"\nUS billionaire Mark Cuban is among the the shareholders of Catapult, which has surged in value since listing on the ASX last December.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:09:04.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
