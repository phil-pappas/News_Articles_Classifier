He spoke with Marc Myers.\nIn 1967, I was a sophomore at The Ohio State University in Columbus. After classes, I hung out at the Char-Bar and Charbert’s, the hip restaurant next door that attracted intellectuals and nut cases by day and local bikers at night. That’s where I met Kenny Weiss.\nKenny was a lead vocalist in many campus rock bands and later was in the James Gang. He tutored me in the best rock albums. In college in the ’60s, it seemed as if a classic album came out every day. Without iTunes, YouTube and all the stuff around today, you couldn’t keep up without the help of hip rocker friends.\nRichard Lewis One day in the late spring of ’67, Kenny said I had to hear an album by a guy named Jimi Hendrix. The guy’s name alone was cool. Then Kenny told me the album’s name—“Are You Experienced?” which was a great question, since I really wasn’t. I figured after I’d heard the album a few times, that problem would be solved.\nSoon after Kenny told me about Hendrix, I borrowed the album from a friend. Another friend with a great stereo system said I could let myself into his place to listen to it. The first track was “Purple Haze” and opened with that sawing electric guitar riff and the electric bass underneath. Then the drums kicked in, and Jimi started singing: “Purple haze all in my brain / lately things don’t seem the same / actin’ funny but I don’t know why / ‘scuse me while I kiss the sky.”\nI was floating. Hendrix’s guitar licks and all those ambient voices floating around in the song had an energy and hopefulness for me. At that moment in my life, I wasn’t worried about anything and was far from having to deal with the real-world pressures that awaited me after college. The lyrics didn’t have much to do with the song’s instrumental texture or the bridge, and that’s what got me. Who cares what the words mean? It was the feeling of everything mixed together.\nToday, the sound of Hendrix still takes me back to a time in my life before auditions, stand-up at clubs and the pressure to be funny. It was just music awakening my ambition, energy and respect for just doing what feels right.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT818_Lewis_BV_20150817152015.jpg", "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/info-PLAYLIST0818.html"], "published": "2015-08-18T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:42:32.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
