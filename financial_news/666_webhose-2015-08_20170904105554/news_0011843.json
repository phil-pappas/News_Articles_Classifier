The four lenders also bear the costs of the project. The card will also be available at all Huduma Centres countrywide. \nThe programme will integrate all services offered through the centres providing a cash payment option for government services. Citizens will, for instance, pay for their passports through the cards that are offered free of charge at 32 centres spread across 27 counties.

This is a big moment as every card holder will have a bank account,\" said Mr Monehin. \nMasteCard also won a similar project in Nigeria on the national electronic ID cards that will capture biodata about users. \nThe Huduma Card will see all government payment services done through a digital platform. \nKenyans using the card will automatically be enrolled in key government services such as the National Social Security Fund, National Hospital Insurance Fund.
