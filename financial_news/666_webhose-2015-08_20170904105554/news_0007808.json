It was edging closer to a six-year trough of $0.7234 touched last month. Immediate support was found around $0.7314, the 76.4 percent retracement of the $0.7234-$0.7440 climb.\nThe slide came after China’s central bank allowed its yuan to fall to levels last seen in 2012 and said it was aiming for a depreciation of 2 percent.\n“This looks like a move to a more open market policy,” said Stephen Innes, senior dealer at OANDA Australia and Asia Pacific. “Given this development, we can look for USD strength regionally against other currencies.”\nThe market often uses the Aussie as a liquid proxy to hedge against weakness, or wager on strength, in China.\nThe Aussie had already come under pressure on Monday as a rally in crude oil triggered a jump in the Canadian dollar. The market has recently been very short of the Canadian currency against its Australian counterpart.\nThe Aussie has shed one cent and a half to C$0.9600 this week, having touched a three-month peak on Monday. The kiwi was in no better shape, down 1.3 percent in two sessions to C$0.8570.\nNot helping the Aussie was a survey showing local business confidence and conditions weakening in July in spite of relatively healthy sales and profits.\nLikewise, the New Zealand dollar slipped 0.9 percent to $0.6559, pulling closer to a six-year low of $0.6490 set last week. Support was found around $0.6550.\nThe euro jumped one full cent NZ$1.6734, nearing a recent peak of NZ$0.6816.\nNew Zealand’s monthly electronic card retail sales rose 0.4 percent in July over June, with expectations growth will stay modest as the impact of lower dairy prices flows through to consumer behavior.\nNew Zealand government bond yields were as much as 2.5 basis points higher.\nAustralian government bond futures fell, with the three-year bond contract off 1 tick at 98.010. The 10-year contract was down 3.5 ticks to 97.1550 leading to a bearish steepening of the curve.\n 11, 2015 9:51 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:40:31.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
