Photo: NSW Fair Trading\nThe state's consumer watchdog has long been \"impaired\" by a lack of relationship with police, according to a government paper that criticised delays in the case of a mother who was killed by a faulty USB charger.\nAn internal audit of NSW Fair Trading, conducted after it botched a product-safety alert about the chargers last year, identified flaws causing delays, confusion and cases to fall between the cracks.\nIt found Fair Trading was \"operating without fundamental agreements or relationships\" with emergency services, such as NSW Police and Fire and Rescue, preventing it from \"always perform[ing] against the intent of the product-safety legislation in an informed and timely fashion\".\nSheryl Aldeguer was electrocuted in her home in April 2014. Photo: Facebook\nIt said its decade-old memorandum of understanding with NSW Police was not \"workable or effective\". As a consequence, six weeks elapsed before Fair Trading could begin investigating the electrocution of Central Coast mother Sheryl Aldeguer​ in April last year.\nAdvertisement Three weeks passed before Fair Trading was alerted to the death, and this was by energy supplier Ausgrid, not the police. Another three weeks elapsed before Fair Trading officers visited Gosford police station.\nTwo weeks later, Gosford police sent an email that connected the death to a non-compliant USB charger. It sat unread in an inbox for two days because the officer was on leave.\nFair Trading Commissioner Rod Stowe said all nine recommendations from the audit have been adopted.\nMs Aldeguer's death eventually led to a bungled product-safety warning , the reported sacking and reinstating of commissioner Rod Stowe , and widespread raids of businesses and markets .\n\"A mechanism where safety incidents are notified direct to Fair Trading by the police or coroner would be immediate and cut this initial time delay to zero days,\" the report recommends.\nIn response, Mr Stowe said he was in the process of strengthening relationships with first responders, which included establishing formal safety-alert agreements and training courses for frontline officers.\nThe report also panned the watchdog's organisational structure as \"not cohesive and fluid\", resulting in product safety-related divisions \"operating independently\".\nAs a result, a national recall in April last year for Bunnings Silver Cloud inflatable spa linked with electric shocks slipped between the watchdog's home building safety and compliance and enforcement divisions.\n\"The inflatable spa [was] not appropriately managed by either division … Fair Trading should consider changing their operating model to encourage cross-division collaboration and integration,\" the report recommends.\nIn response, Fair Trading Assistant Commissioner John Tansey, who leads the home building safety division, said the agency had been aware of the spa recall but had rightfully left it with the Victorian regulator which was managing it.\nThe agency had since established a \"front-end\" single-assessment team that could swiftly assess and decide which division a product safety case should go to, he said.\nThe report, prepared by Deloitte and obtained under freedom of information laws, also showed there was a lack of key performance indicators and corporate-driven \"Policies, Procedures and Process\" flowcharts.\nMr Tansey said key product-safety procedures were documented in existing process flows, as well as legislation. Fair Trading had a \"gazillion KPIs of what we respond to and how quickly\".\nAll nine recommendations have been adopted. The report, which Fair Trading refused to release until it was challenged by the Information and Privacy Commissioner, was delivered in November last year.\nIt was the only review undertaken during Matthew Mason-Cox's stormy 11-month tenure as fair trading minister before his demotion in Premier Mike Baird's post-election cabinet reshuffle in March this year.\nMinister responsible for consumer affairs Victor Dominello​ said the audit was among many regularly conducted to improve performance.\n\"NSW consumers can feel assured they have a very fierce advocate in me as a minister,\" he said.\n\"I will be bringing legislation in relation to opening up the complaints register to empower the consumer. We'll be doing work around underquoting in real estate to, again, protect the consumer.\"\nFair Trading is monitoring the national recall of 145,000 Samsung top-loader washing machines that, because of a water leakage fault, can cause fires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T19:58:56.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
