The reward/donation model crowd-funding platform estimates that about 63% of projects fail to meet their funding goals. However, a select few end up with the opposite problem - they far outstrip the initial money asked for.It is a possibility that entrepreneurs should keep in mind when planning Kickstarter campaigns. Kickstarter has no regulations on what is done with over-funding. A savvy start-up could end up reaping a significant profit from such a scenario.\"[O]verfunding leads to better margins and the creator may even profit from the project,\" Kickstarter says.Of course to get to a place where it can profit, a start-up would have to honour all of its funding commitments, stretch goals and will probably have promised improvements along the way to keep over-funding going.For example, Exploding Kittens - a card game created by Matthew Inman author of popular webcomic, The Oatmeal ; the people behind Cards Against Humanity - a tabletop card game; and others - had to fulfil around 220,000 orders after closing its over-funded Kickstarter campaign.The campaign became Kickstarter's most supported when it closed earlier this year. It also took became the most funded board-game in Kickstarter histry and the fourth most funded project overall. The majority of those backers elected to take a copy of the game as a reward for their support meaning Exploding Kittens had to significantly ramp up their production from initial expectations.The company estimates that it had to print 26,765,368 individual cards -weighing 52.57 tonnes and requiring 17 train-car sized containers to ship. In order to do this, the start-up had to hire five full-time staff and partner with six new companies to fulfil, print and ship the orders.[caption id=\"attachment_816c45e62f4f4e139bf5ee9dfb7fd6f9\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Robot Turtles(TM) by ThinkFun(R), the first board game to teach coding skills to kids as young as four, is now available nationwide. Robot Turtles began as a Kickstarter project where it became the most-backed board game in the history of the popular crowd-funding site. Awarded a &quot;Best Toy for Kids&quot; by the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association, Robot Turtles is sold at Target stores and on Target.com in addition to neighborhood toy stores.

However, these should be easily met within the initial budget requirements - if the campaign has been properly planned. But beyond this, many of the projects that start to head towards their funding goals with time left seek to improve their initial offering. For Exploding Kittens, that was through improvements to the packaging, the inclusion of a NSFW (not safe for work) and regular deck and the addition of a surprise gift exclusive to the Kickstarter backers. The company says it spent one million (USD) creating that surprise - which in fact only works out at under $5.00 per order but creates a significant amount of interest and goodwill amongst backers.Other over-funded projects pledge to do similar improvements. For example, Coolest - a redesign of the classic BBQ/picnic cooler from entrepreneur Ryan Grepper - became the most-funded project in Kickstarter history when it closed in 2014 (it has subsequently been knocked off its top spot by a second campaign from Pebble watches - the start-up it initially replaced on top of the board).Grepper promised to improve the design and features of the cooler even further by using the extra money raised. Initially, he crowd-sourced ideas for what should be improved. Suggestions included a solar power charger to keep the device's electronics going longer and a grill, which was included in an initial design but later dropped over safety concerns.Interestingly neither of these features made it into the final design. Instead the start-up chose to add rubberise the wheels on the cooler in order to enable it to pass over floors without damaging them. It also included an upgraded Bluetooth speaker and a magnetised bottle-cap catcher. Beyond that the company chose to improve quality and engineering of all components to ensure better durability as well as adding stainless steel hinges and a thicker axle for better strength.While doing this may initially seem like a waste of money that otherwise could be converted to pure profit - given Kickstarter's rules - it is an interesting play for start-ups looking to build a brand and perhaps launch further products in the future. For example if Coolest was to launch other accessories, either on its own or through Kickstarter, it would now have a wellspring of goodwill to draw upon.\" Our goal has always been to over-deliver on quality because that’s the brand promise we have for Coolest as a company,\" says Grepper. \"There’s plenty of room for innovation in recreational products, especially within 50ft of where you’d use your Coolest.\"", "external_links": ["http://theoatmeal.com/", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/816c45e62f4f4e139bf5ee9dfb7fd6f9/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-08-28T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T17:00:42.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
