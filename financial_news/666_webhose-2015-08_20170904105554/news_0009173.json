Quotient and MidCap originally entered into a $15 million term credit facility on December 6, 2013. \nNew funding of $15 million will be made immediately available to Quotient under the New MidCap Facility for working capital purposes. The remaining $20 million will be made available, subject to certain conditions, following receipt of CE-Marking for MosaiQ™ ($5.0 million) and upon first commercial sale of MosaiQ™ in Europe ($15 million) and will be used to fund working capital requirements following the commercial launch of MosaiQ™. Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable conditions, the initial $5.0 million drawdown must be made prior to January 31, 2017 and the subsequent $15 million drawdown must be made prior to June 30, 2017. \nThe New MidCap Facility will be repayable in 30 equal installments, commencing on March 1, 2018 (or 24 equal installments commencing on September 1, 2018, if the Company achieves CE Mark approvals for the MosaiQ TM instrument and blood grouping consumable). Interest will be payable monthly in arrears at an annual rate equivalent to one-month LIBOR plus 6.7%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 2.0%. \nThe Company has also granted an affiliate of MidCap warrants to subscribe for 111,525 new ordinary shares in the Company at an exercise price of $16.14 per ordinary share. Further warrants will be granted to the MidCap affiliate in connection with each subsequent drawdown of funds by the Company under the New MidCap Facility for new ordinary shares equal to 6% of the drawdown amount based on the market price of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of grant. \n\"This incremental funding provided by MidCap bolsters our available capital resources as we continue the commercial scale-up efforts for MosaiQ TM ,\" said Paul Cowan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quotient. \"In addition, we see this as a positive, minimally dilutive way to lower our overall cost of capital, while extending our near-term cash runway. We are pleased to again partner with MidCap and thank them for their continued confidence in our business.\" \nAdditional details regarding this transaction will be made available in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by Quotient with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nAbout Quotient Limited \nQuotient Limited (together with its subsidiaries, \"Quotient\" or the \"Company\") is an established, commercial-stage diagnostics company committed to reducing healthcare costs and improving patient care through the provision of innovative tests within established markets.
