Yes, he is a real person - because some of you have asked me if he exists,\" former finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos said jokingly on Friday while handing over the finance ministry to him.\n\"I am certain that with his work, as always, and with his devotion to the public good it would be difficult to think of a better interim finance minister, someone who loves what he does and does it very well.\"\nWell-respected by Greece's European creditors, Chouliarakis was given a more decisive role in the talks after former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was sidelined earlier this year.
