Regan The short-sellers in the stock market, who (probably) enjoy a warm glass of puppy-dog tears over a nice frosty mug of Milwaukee's finest foam, have gone and loaded up on bearish bets against the true heroes of global capitalism: the world's brewers.\nThe case for shorting beer stocks, according to Markit analyst Relte Stephen Schutte, hinged at least partially on a \"weaker\" macroeconomic outlook. This is a dubious claim for many reasons but none more obvious than the simple fact that everyone who's ever tried one knows that Guinness gives you strength.\nSo central bankers take a pro tip: the next round of quantitative easing would probably be executed most effectively not by buying bonds but by buying everyone from Brussels to Beijing a nice pint of stout from the ould sod. The Irish already saved civilization once and, by the grace of God and The Clancy Brothers, they can do it again if needed.\nThis bear thesis on beer also ignores all the other benefits that the beverage can provide to a global economy teetering on the brink. Is there any stronger elixir to boost consumer confidence? Highly doubtful.\nYou might need a nice cold one after loosing your pants on stock in beer makers. Quentin Jones Not to mention all the other positive catalysts beer provides the world, like making everyone else in the bar look more attractive and allowing the drinker to ignore the unimportant things in life (like pants that fit properly and arriving at work on time the next morning.)\nAnyway, where were we? Oh, right. Relte Stephen Schutte and his delightfully pun-filled report on short bets against the world's brewers as shares of the companies \"came off the boil.\" (Get it?) He points out how the \"crafty\" (get it?) shorts out there loaded up on bearish bets against Denmark's Carlsberg AS right before a 22 percent tumble in the shares.\nIt's not just the Great Danes who were targeted, according to Markit's analysis of data from the prime brokerages and custodians and others who enable this behavior by loaning out shares. Short interest in Molson Coors Brewing Co. more than doubled in 12 months to 3.7 percent of shares before things got a little, rocky for the stock.\nBoston Beer Co.'s short interest was approaching 8 percent before the stock fell faster than poor Don Zimmer after he tried to charge Pedro Martinez. The shorts also gnawed on the bones of Craft Brew Alliance Inc., whose stock is down 43 percent this year.\n Schutte links to a report from the buzzkills over at McKinsey who lay the bear case flat on the bar: \"There is falling consumer demand, increasingly competitive products, heightened requirements by retailers and consumers, and tougher market access.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:04:16.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
