Aaron Bunch by Mark Mulligan A character in William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice cautioned that \"all that glisters is not gold\", while veteran rocker Neil Young sang of his search for a heart made of the stuff.\nThe Old Testament's golden calf provided a lesson in the perils of idolatry. In Greek mythology, a golden fleece spun from the hair of a winged ram symbolised authority and kingship.\nSince the start of recorded time, the bright, dense, malleable metal has featured as a either a prized possession and reward for good deeds or a trigger for conflict and pillage, a formidable generator of greed, envy and hubris.\nAnd now the long-revered chemical element with the Au symbol is losing its lustre.\nAt a time when hyper-accommodative monetary policy has pumped up the value of everyday assets such as equities and property, the precious metal has shed more than 40 per cent of its value in four years.\nOver the same period the US sharemarket gained near 75 per cent, and local equities 37 per cent – double that if dividends are taken into account. Australian house prices across the capital cities are almost 40 per cent higher, on ABS data. Australian government bonds generated a total return of close to 20 per cent.\nGold producers around the world are being forced into mergers to survive. Higher-cost, over-leveraged producers who piled in when prices were better are now struggling to turn a profit.\nReasons for gold's fall So, in a world of negligible or even negative returns on low-risk assets, why is gold failing so spectacularly to hold its value?\nCelebrated economist Mohammed El-Erian is one expert who believes he has the answer.\nWriting recently in the Financial Times , he ascribes gold's tarnished allure to diverse factors.\nGold has long been a safe haven against turmoil in markets. But El-Erian argues that an increasingly sophisticated investment industry is constantly coming up with new types of insurance against future shocks, and he cites exchange-traded funds and clever interest rate and credit products as examples.\nIn any case, what use is a traditional hedge against inflation – an asset that retains its value whatever happens – when the developed world is almost an inflation-free zone?\nCentral banks in the emerging world have also been selling down their gold stocks to defend their currencies against plummeting commodity prices and capital flight.\nThis accumulative decline in investor and sovereign interest has not been offset by traditional demand for physical gold.\nIn short, Mr El-Erian argues that gold has struggled to find its new role amid all the so-called \"new paradigms\" thrown up in the wake of the global financial crisis.\nBut as anyone with even a smattering of history will know, it's hard to keep a good commodity down.\nValue through history The Inca and Aztec civilisations of pre-Columbian America recognised gold's shiny worth, hoarding and worshipping the metal until it was plundered by the marauding Spanish conquistadors, whose royal and clerical bosses used it to gild their cathedrals, palaces and monuments.\nNineteenth-century gold rushes helped shape states such as California and Victoria, bestowing unimaginable individual wealth or inflicting abject misery in the process.\nModern man has made the glittering material a financial asset of aptly mythical proportions, as collateral to underwrite everything from a currency's value to a hand-shake property deal between relatives.\nThe gold standard, used around the world for more than a century, involved holding stores of the metal for sale at a fixed price linked to circulating currency.\nSupposedly to prove the metal's inflation-beating qualities, Canadian firm Sionna Investment Management came up with the \"Gold-to-Decent-Suit-Ratio\" which proposed a correlation between the price of gold and that of a high-quality suit from a prominent tailor. It, too, has stood the test of time until recent years.\nAnd gold has myriad industrial applications, being used to fashion jewellery, mint coins and mould any number of commemorative trophies, statues and artwork. As an efficient conductor, it also pops up in connectors, switch and relay contacts, soldered joints and connecting wires and strips. Chemically inert, non-allergenic and easy to work with, gold is still used in dentistry.\nAustralia, by the way, is the world's second-biggest gold producer, behind China and ahead of Russia, with China, India and Malaysia among our biggest customers.\nSo what now for gold, and will its fading attractiveness set in for the long haul?\nImaru Casanova, senior analyst for gold equity strategy at Van Eck Global in New York, won't have a bar of it.\n\"Market sentiment towards gold is certainly very negative at present, but it has not lost its allure,\" she says.\n\"Investment demand for gold has typically increased when investors sense trouble in the US economy or financial system, which is lacking at the moment.\"\nShe agrees that while physical demand has softened since reaching all-time highs in 2013, in the last two years it has kept pace with the 10-year average.\nEffect of quantitative easing Many think that quantitative easing (QE) – asset-buying by central banks to hold down long-term interest rates and create investment liquidity – has been bad for gold. Casanova disputes this.\n\"QE also drove gold prices higher, as markets assessed both the reasons for it as well as its potential consequences,\" she says.\n\"In particular, markets were concerned that the extraordinary levels of liquidity being injected into the economy would eventually lead to high levels of inflation, and this was supportive of gold.\nIndeed, it's not QE that explains the fall in the gold price. It's the moment when markets cottoned on that QE wouldn't last forever, but still wasn't fuelling inflation.\n\"It was the end of QE, and the expectations for a Fed rate hike without yet any signs of inflation – along with the view of a strong US economy – that eroded the market's interest in gold,\" Ms Casanova said.\nThriving demand: Moffatt None of this is lost on Nigel Moffatt, director of the Perth Mint Depository, which buys, sells and stores gold bars, nuggets and other forms of the metal for investors at the Western Australian capital's historic coin-making facility.\nHe reports thriving demand for gold from investors, collectors and romantics across the age spectrum, with the younger set quick to jump onto the facility's brand new online, 24-hour trading platform.\nThe mint's hourly gold pour is a big visitor drawcard, and the facility remains licensed to turn out commemorative coins, medallions and similar pieces.\nOn the evolution of the gold price in recent years, he agrees markets are still waiting for global growth to pick up sufficiently to generate inflation.\nThe green shoots of recovery have appeared, he says, and with them an improvement in corporate profitability and a surge in equity investment.\n\"In the same way that during the GFC there was an enormous exodus from equities and other asset classes into gold, there has been a transition back into those growth asset classes,\" he says.\nPredictions So when will the price of the world's best-known precious metal hit its nadir in the current cycle?\n\"Sentiment remains negative and we remain cautious on gold,\" Van Eck Global's Casanova says. But she does sense a buying opportunity is coming into view.\n\"We believe the gold market is nearing a bottom and look to the coming Fed rate decisions as a possible turning point.\"\nBut she recommends investors don't buy gold itself, but rather buy into the companies who dig it up.\n\"We believe gold equities have been oversold and the companies are fundamentally attractive thanks to prudent cost controls, financial discipline and improving operating performance.\n\"So, this could be a good time to buy gold equities,\" she says.\nPerth Mint's Nigel Moffatt agrees, adding that declining prices, coupled with the Australian dollar's depreciation against the greenback, has not only made Australian miners particularly efficient, but also given them a local currency advantage.\nA cull of high-cost producers and ongoing consolidation has led to \"the emergence of some really quite powerful Australian gold mining groups\", he says.\n\"They've been extremely well-managed, they've seen the asset there, they've consolidated and then done remarkably well out of it.\"\nAnd the bright, dense, malleable metal that they dig out of the ground is, as Spandau Ballet once sang, indestructible.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:07:02.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
