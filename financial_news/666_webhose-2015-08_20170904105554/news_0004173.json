Jamie Williams by James Frost There's no better way to invest than spending 50¢ to buy $1 regardless whether you prefer shares or property or fixed income. The question is, where do you find them? And, how do you know if you have been sold a dud?\nExploiting swings in sentiment is an obvious starting point. With this in mind, you have a better chance of snagging a beaten up mining services company than you do a deeply discounted residential property.\nTo help you identify bargains, motivated sellers and distressed assets we've approached a group of experts across the three major asset classes in an effort to help you spot the difference between a screaming buy and a falling knife.\nEquities First cab off the rank is shares. The liquidity and ease of transacting in shares ensures it's the asset class that many turn to when looking for a quick buck.\nHowever, fund manager and value investing expert Roger Montgomery describes the act of buying deeply discounted shares in anticipation of a turnaround as extremely high risk.\n\"Benjamin Graham called it the cigar butt approach. You are picking up a cigarette butt from the gutter in the hope of getting one last puff out of it,\" Montgomery says.\nThe nature of equities introduces risks that bargain hunters in property and fixed income simply don't face. If the property market tanks, you still own the land. If the issuer of a bond goes broke, you are first in line at the creditors meeting.\n But as a share-owner, if the company tanks you may end up with nothing.\nYet there are a number of successful \"contrarian\" fund managers who are famous for picking turnaround stories. Chief among them in Australia is fund manager Allan Gray, known for buying big licks of distressed businesses.\nWhen identifying potential turnarounds Allan Gray chief Simon Mawhinney says the company is right about 60 per cent of the time.\n\"You either do very well or lose all your money,\" he says.\nMawhinney is careful to distinguish between a company that is distressed and one that is a bargain. Companies that are distressed are not generating any cash and investors should demand a much greater margin of safety.\n\"Take Atlas Iron,\" he says. \"It has a huge amount of debt. If could recover but you are really in the hands of the gods and the iron ore price. It will come down to luck.\n\"At the other end you have a company like Woodside. It has next to no debt and if you believe energy prices will recover from here, then that's a bargain.\"\nInvestors should compare net profit to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). All manner of shortcomings can be hidden by fancy accounting in measures like EBITDA and normalised net profit figures.\nMawhinney recommends focusing on free cash flow and uses Arrium as an example.\n\"Arrium is at the distressed end of the spectrum. If next year they can generate reasonable free cash flow [from the steel business] notwithstanding the iron ore price being where it is you could apply a higher multiple,\" he says.\nProperty When it comes to scooping up a bargain in property there are four main categories investors typically target: passed in properties; estate sales; mortgagee sales; and off-market sales.\nKaren Price, a buyers advocate with Morrell and Koren, says distressed sellers are few and far between in the current environment of low interest rates.\n\"I don't know of any at the moment and haven't heard of any for quite some time,\" she says.\nScouring the lists of passed in properties can give buyers the upper hand when negotiating with motivated sellers, especially those who have already purchased another property. However, in the current market the strategy is less certain.\n\"Just because it's Monday morning doesn't mean you are getting a bargain,\" Price says.\n\"Properties don't get passed in without a reason. Quite often you will find that they've set the price too high or there's something fundamentally wrong with the property.\"\nEstate sales and mortgagee sales are no picnic either. Deceased estates can attract enormous interest from property obsessives and often require the approval of multiple executors to be sold, pushing prices up.\nWith interest rates at record lows mortgagee sales – where the bank forecloses on a loan – are rare. When they do occur, they are seldom at fire sale prices.\nDecisions to sell are not necessarily the result of adverse market forces. Price says sellers motivated by personal reasons such as divorce or pressing financial needs may be inclined to attempt an off-market sale, a transaction that occurs behind closed doors. There are no open days or ads taken out in glossy magazines. Public figures often seek off-market sales in order to avoid tyre kickers and unwanted media attention.\nTo be offered an off-market sale you will need good relationships with agents, buyers advocates and be ready to settle quickly.\nThe recent sale of James Packer's Vaucluse mansion was an example of an off-market sale, although it was certainly not distressed and perhaps not a bargain either when you consider the $70 million price tag.\nMargaret Lomas, property expert and founder of Destiny Financial Solutions, says if you are looking for a bargain, but limiting your search to dress circle properties in blue ribbon suburbs then you will be waiting a while.\nEven motivated sellers can drum up enough demand to achieve a good price.\n\"Try the up and coming markets, those areas which have the underlying fundamentals and display exceptional growth drivers, but for some reason doesn't yet have the buyer demand that makes it a healthy market,\" she says.\nLomas recommends avoiding Sydney altogether. In her view those who stick to the inner and middle ring suburbs in metro regions on the east coast are likely to overpay. It will be a different matter when rates rise.\nShe likes the NSW central coast, including regions such as Bateau Bay where properties can be bought in the low $300,000, an equivalent rental yield of 6 per cent. Areas north of Wyong such as Blue Haven and Lake Haven are also worth a look.\nHer top picks in Brisbane include the north and south. Suburbs such as Morayfield, Deception Bay and Redcliff Peninsula all offer low buy-in prices, yields above 5 per cent and are likely to attract young families in the years ahead.\nIn Victoria, Lomas recommends staying away from regional areas such as Ballarat where spruikers have moved in, pushing up prices. She sees value in areas investors might normally be reluctant to buy in such as Tarneit and Narrewarren.\nBonds As far as fixed income goes, it would seem that Greek government debt would be at the top of any list of distressed assets. With the Greek Parliament holding emergency sessions to ratify a new deal, yields on two-year bonds have been holding above 20 per cent.\nBy way of comparison, two-year US treasuries are yielding 0.71 per cent.\nDespite being almost insanely risky, readers are also unlikely to be able to access Greek bonds. The Australian market for listed debt might be small, but it can still be interesting.\nBonds trade at a premium or a discount to par value depending on a variety of factors including interest rates and confidence in the issuer to pay a coupon.\nWith this in mind, a scan of ASX-listed capital notes throws up a number of securities trading at significant discounts to their $100 face values, including debt issued by Elders and Seven Group.\nListed in 2006, the hybrid security from battered agribusiness company Elders known as ELDPA has languished as concerns about the business grew. Elders suspended distributions in July 2009 and ELDPA hit a low of $8 in 2013.\nAs the business recovered, so too has the price of ELDPA. This time last year it was still changing hands for less that $40. As confidence around the business grew, the price rallied and last Thursday it hit a five-year high of $74.30.\nOn Friday the company announced it would buy back $30 million worth ELDPA at $80 a share – not quite $100 but nevertheless a positive development – delivering those security holders with an immediate 7 per cent profit.\nFixed income analyst James Lawrence of Morgans notes the strong performance of the business and says if it continued, further buybacks would eventuate.\nAnother security trading at a similar discount is the Seven West Media hybrid known as SVWPA. At the close on Friday it was trading for $71.20, a 28 per cent discount to face value.\n\"Seven Group Holdings has been going down this path of acquiring interests in energy companies such as Beach Petroleum and Drillsearch and investors are uncertain as to what their overarching strategy is and what that means for the shareholders,\" Lawrence says.\nThis is another perpetual hybrid, which means the company is under no obligation to buy it back. But unlike the Elders perpetual hybrid it is paying a distribution and yields 9.5 per cent. Among the risks SVWPA holders face is potential for the coupon to be suspended.\n\"We view it as unlikely,\" Lawrence says.\nIf Seven Group were to suspend the distribution of SVWPA it would need to suspend the dividend from the ordinary shares first. These shares are yielding Seven Group executive chairman and majority shareholder Kerry Stokes about $80 million a year.\nAlthough it is possible, it is not probable that a significant source of income for one of Australia's richest men will evaporate overnight. Lawrence suggests investors looking at SVWPA only allocate a small amount to it, likening it to an equity market exposure.\nLawrence does not have buy recommendations on either ELDPA or SVWPA. He does, however, like the ANZ convertible preference share ANZPA. This security contains none of the non-viablity triggers that banks have subsequently introduced to their hybrid issues and has a mandatory conversation date of December 2016.\n\"It's super low-risk,\" he says. \"It's offering you a yield to call of 5.5 per cent, which we view as very attractive in the current low interest rate environment.\"\nUnlike the Elders and Seven Group hybrids, it last traded at a premium to the $100 face value. Bargains are, after all, in the eye of the beholder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:35:38.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
