Max Davidson examines the rise of lateral living \nTo fans of Downton Abbey, and other period dramas set in stately piles, the idea of ‘lateral living’ is anathema. What is the point of having pots of money if you cannot live in a manor house, and lose yourself in the east wing from time to time? \nFor centuries, sweeping staircases have been as synonymous with conspicuous wealth as caviar and champagne. Until now that is. A new London elite is rejecting the traditional mansion in favour of the trophy flat, with not a solitary stair in sight. \n• A garage in Mayfair or a cottage in the country - what a year's rent in London gets you \n• London's newest super flat with a pizza lift from pub to bedside \nThey are snapping up penthouses that overlook the capital, or vast, first‑floor apartments with high ceilings and five bedrooms. \nThe penchant for such properties, which often cost more per square foot than the finest Georgian terraces, is a true sign of the times, says James Forbes of Knight Frank Knightsbridge. A house in Belgravia with six floors and no lift might fetch between £2,000 and £2,400 per square foot, whereas the equivalent figure for an apartment would be closer to £4,000. \nOnly last month a brand new penthouse in Mayfair sold for £7,000 per square foot the most expensive home sold in Britain so far this year. \nImages of the living area in 77 Mayfair. \nDespite the inflated prices, super flats are in demand as never before while that for city mansions and town houses is starting to wane. \n“Although the high-end homes market has been falling as a result of the recent changes in stamp duty, the properties bucking the trend, and holding their own, are apartments. Many of them are more like five-star hotels in character than traditional London houses,” says estate agent Peter Wetherell. \n“The world’s super-rich all seem to want to have lateral living space on one floor, whether they are Middle Eastern royals, Asian bankers, celebrities or commodity brokers,” he says. It is a reflection of the social change in London. \n“In Victorian and Edwardian times, the aristocracy expected to live on a different floor from their staff. In our more egalitarian world, staff are often seen as part of the family whether it is the nanny-cum-maid, the trusted PA or the butler who doubles as a personal trainer,” Wetherell adds. \nSo why the residential shift? It seems that central London living is being redefined by overseas tastes. Adam Challis, director at the property group JLL, says: “ Buyers from the Middle East, Continental Europe, Africa and the Far East (Kuala Lumpur: 5029.KL - news ) are not encumbered by British tradition. Plus the only type of property that can be built in the centre of the capital is apartments.” \nThe most talked-about penthouse up for sale this summer can be found in Wellington Court, Knightsbridge, with a £35m price tag. It has been dubbed the ‘‘Tom Cruise penthouse’’, not because it is small and perfectly formed, but because the actor stayed there during the filming of Edge of Tomorrow in 2012 and Mission Impossible 5 in 2014. \nThe terrace at Wellington Court. \nPinewood Studios, which rented the property on his behalf, has also used it to accommodate other visiting celebrities such as singer Rihanna and actor Ashton Kutcher. It became their central London base: a cool contemporary apartment worthy of Manhattan (Hamburg: 32U.HM - news ) , but with views over Hyde Park, not Central Park. \nThe 10,000-sq ft home is perched on top of a 19th-century building and has now been given the most lavish of makeovers, bringing a touch of The Great Gatsby to once conservative Knightsbridge. \nSome of the decorative touches are wildly over-the-top. Who but a Hollywood actor would want mirror‑lined ceilings, allowing residents to see themselves from every conceivable angle? But the excitement of the Roaring Twenties is recaptured in the baby grand piano, the Italian marble bathrooms and the faux-crocodile leather seating area. The west wing is given over to a master bedroom with his-and-hers bathrooms and a large private terrace. \nOne of the bedrooms in Wellington Court. \nThe Wellington Court pad would not be a 21st-century super‑residence without the holy trinity of a gymnasium, a home cinema and a surround sound system. \nThe entire emphasis is on relaxation, rather than the formal entertaining beloved of the upstairs‑downstairs generation. \nAnd perhaps that is the appeal of lateral living. People want to sprawl, spread themselves, chill out, not have to shinny up a flight of stairs to get to the bathroom and that doesn’t just apply to the outrageously wealthy. Right across central London, the story is the same. \nThe living area and balcony in Wellington Court. \n“The demand for large lateral homes, especially new builds, is so high at the moment that flats sell immediately before they have even been fully advertised,” says Becky Fatemi, managing director of Rokstone. \nFatemi believes that the key to this newfound popularity is presentation. \n“International buyers in particular want turnkey properties, so our most coveted homes are either newly built or refurbished to a very high standard,” she says, adding that many buyers do not live in the property all year round. \n“We now tell clients who are selling houses, even in very popular areas, that they need to be aware of the competition from flats. If their homes are not spruced up they can languish on the market for six months or more.” \nMeriam Makiya, a partner at Knight Frank, cites the concierge and leisure services typically to be found in apartment developments as another factor appealing to overseas buyers. \n“They have more efficient layouts than traditional homes, and usually a higher level of security as well.” \nSavvy developers have noted the trend for lateral living in central London and have joined the party. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) the housebuilders are at it. Berkeley Homes, under its St George brand, is building a 170m luxury tower on London’s Southbank, with a 24‑hour Harrods concierge service. \nOne of the most interesting new developments is The Mellier at 26 Albemarle (Stuttgart: AMC.SG - news ) Street, Mayfair, a magnificent Beaux-Arts building that, in an earlier incarnation, was a car showroom targeting the seriously rich motorist. Originally a grand Edwardian mansion, by the Thirties the building had become the London headquarters of Buick, a magnet for the great and the good. \nThe front of the Mellier. \nThe Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, dropped in here in 1935 and bought a car for himself and another for Mrs Simpson. \nThe super-rich may still be the target market at The Mellier the four single-level residences are priced at £18m, the duplex penthouse at £30m but this generation of property seekers have very different priorities to those pre-war Buick-buyers. \nAnd their lateral thinking is slowly reshaping the whole of the central London property market. \nThe living area at the Mellier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T13:28:15.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
