According to the official figures, China has been Africa's largest trade partner since 2009. It is also the largest greenfield investor and second largest overseas contractor on the continent. In return, imports from Africa are increasingly critical to the Chinese economy. \nAs China's most prestigious and profitable foreign trade platform, the Canton Fair has witnessed a surge in African buyers. Over 15,000 attended the 117th session of the event, up by nearly 3% on the 116th Fair. Eager to cash in on a Chinese \"gold rush\", a growing number of Africans are now coming to China to engage in entrepreneurial activity, with Guangzhou as a popular first port of call. \nThe Canton Fair consistently earns rave reviews from African buyers. \n\"In the past I used to attend international fairs in the United States and United Kingdom,\" says Ahmed Fouad, deputy head of the export department of Egyptian Appliance Manufacturer Unionaire. \"Now I come to the Canton Fair. The number of potential customers is way bigger.\" \nIt was also through the Canton Fair that Said Salim Hemed, a buyer from Tanzania, founded a win-win partnership with the Hubei Zigui Diyuan Canned Food Company. \n\"The Fair is a great way to seal win-win deals with our African counterparts,\" says Zigui Diyuan's general manager Hou Jiaqiang. \nFor further information on the 118th Canton Fair please visit: http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/index.asp \nFor further information on the Nairobi-Guangzhou promotion please visit: http://www.cantonfair.org.cn/en/csair/index.shtml \nFor media enquiries: \nMs. Chloe CAITel: +86-20-8913-8622Email: caiyiyi@cantonfair.org.cn Africa \nMuch attention is being given to what people ate in the distant past as a guide to what we should eat today.
