Glenn Hunt by Joanna Mather and Jenny Wiggins A picket of Hutchinson ports in Sydney and Brisbane will enter a fourth day after the Maritime Workers Union vowed to continue defying a Fair Work order to cease industrial action.\nThe protest is occurring after nearly 100 workers were sacked via email and text message last Thursday night in what the company has described as a \"difficult situation\".\nHutchison Ports Australia announced in June that it would be reducing the size of its workforce in Sydney and Brisbane.\n\"After a consultation process, this redundancy program has now commenced,\" the company said in a statement over the weekend. \"Unfortunately, it will result in 97 job losses between Sydney and Brisbane.\n\"This has been a difficult decision and follows our announcement six weeks ago that the company is downsizing its service offering to the market.\"\nFair Work Commission deputy president Anna Booth on Friday directed employees to cease all forms of industrial action. But the union refused and picketing was expected to continue on Monday.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Hutchinson chief financial officer Chee Keong Chan said the company had been incurring \"substantial financial losses\" and had been unable to secure market share.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten visited angry workers on the picket line outside the Hutchison Ports terminal at Sydney's Port Botany on Friday.\n The MUA claimed Hutchison, which controls just 3 per cent of the Australian container ports market, was getting rid of workers so it could replace them with machines.\n\"The MUA utterly rejects the suggestion that the company is reducing its Australian operations due to a lack of competitiveness,\" MUA national secretary Paddy Crumlin said. \"Hutchison has been actively subcontracting its existing work out to other stevedores and no-one except the company knows why,\" he said.\n\"Any business Hutchison has lost recently has been of its own choosing.\"\nThe case is due to come before Fair Work again on Monday.\nThe action at Port Botany comes as stevedore DP World Australia is close to sealing a new enterprise bargaining agreement with more than 1,000 wharf employees around the country after 18 months of negotiations.\nThe MUA and the stevedore are holding final talks on a deal that would see workers get a fixed annual wage increase of 2.6 per cent with an additional 0.3 per cent increase if they meet certain targets.\nOnce national and local parts of the agreement are finalised, employees will be notified and asked to hold a vote.\n\"Everyone is committed to getting it across the line sooner rather than later,\" a spokesperson from DP World said.\nNegotiations over a new wage agreement, which have involved the Fair Work Commission, have been difficult with DP World locking out MUA members in Melbourne and Sydney in December after the union took protected industrial action.\nThe union has been concerned about the impact of automation at DP World's Brisbane terminal and its plans for automation at its Sydney terminal, as well as the erosion of penalty rates.\nThe shift towards automation by all stevedores has results in hundreds of wharf jobs being lost.\nAsciano, the owner of rival stevedore Patrick's, has credited the implementation of automation at its Port Botany terminal with reducing labour costs and improving productivity. Asciano initially halved its Port Botany workforce to about 211 people from 460 people but has rehired some employees on a casual basis.\nAsciano said some workers were hired back because it needed more people to manage periods of \"high and low operational demand.\" But wharfies said the company had overestimated how many people it could make redundant during the automation process to meet cost cutting targets.\nPort Botany's automation has helped make Asciano an attractive takeover target for Canada's Brookfield group, which is considering a $9 billion acquisition of the Australian company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:04:02.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
