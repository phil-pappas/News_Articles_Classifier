Written by: Robert McGarvey 08/06/15 - 8:32 AM EDT More Headlines 8 Far-flung Job Options Off the Edge of the Map \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — Mark your calendar: October 1. That is when the rules of who picks up the losses for fraudulent use of credit cards shifts. There will be winners, there will be losers, and you definitely want to know how to maximize your safety. The October 1 so-called “liability shift” - mandated by Visa and MasterCard - deals a new hand. Mainly, up until now, card issuers -- banks in the large part -- ate the losses due to fraud at retail. On October 1, whichever party - retailer or issuer - that has not adopted so-called credit card chip technology eats the loss. How about you? Look in your wallet. Count the chip cards. This reporter counted three in his wallet. Another five were old-fashioned magnetic stripe cards. Your wallet very probably is similar. You are not alone. Payments technology company Arroweye Solutions in a survey found that 79% of consumers have not been contacted by their financial services provider about chip cards (debit or credit), and 56% do not yet have EMV cards, that is, the Europay, Mastercard Visa standard chip. Are we in trouble? Breathe easily. You - probably - won’t come up a loser. “There is no reason to panic if you don’t have a chip card,\" said Stephanie Ericksen, vice president of risk products at Visa. \"You have zero fraud liability.” And when you do finally get chip cards, there may even be benefits for you in their embrace. That is because credit cards that feature a chip generate a unique, onetime code. If a criminal were to steal the code, it would do little good. Then too, just about any garden variety crook can access tools that read what’s on a magnetic stripe on an old-fashioned card -- your personal account info. EMV ups the difficulty for criminals and that increases your safety, to a point. Remember the massive Target and Home Depot credit card breaches where tens of millions of accounts were compromised? Many of those accounts were pressed into counterfeit cards. As EMV is adopted - at more retailers and by more issuers - counterfeit cards at retail will plummet. That’s because, at least for now, the chip technology is beyond the reach of card counterfeiters. So-called card not present fraud - online purchases and wherever the retailer has not had physical possession of the card - will soar however. Also the EMV liability shift will not entirely end counterfeit fraud at retailers and that is because most will continue to accept magnetic stripe cards for several years after October 1. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:02:01.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
