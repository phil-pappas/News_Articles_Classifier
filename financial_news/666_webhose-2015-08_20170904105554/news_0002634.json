Some are concerned about groundwater contamination from chemicals used in the process, while others fear the potential impact on property prices or tourism. \n\"The UK government seems intent on overriding the democratic safeguards of the English planning system and shutting out local voices from crucial decisions,\" said Flick Monk, unconventional gas campaigner at Friends of the Earth Scotland. \nPro-business groups welcomed the decision, saying the change would help get shale gas projects up and running. \n(Reporting by Karolin Schaps; Additional reporting by Andrew Callus and Kylie MacLellan, editing by David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T02:26:18.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
