Five years is a long time in politics and economics,\" he said. \n\"The city may gain a short-term political victory if it wins the court application but in the long term the users of the road ... will be prejudiced and will become increasingly frustrated.\" \nHe said Sanral's work, planning and money would be \"thwarted and wasted\" if the project did not go ahead. \nDe Lille told News24 the Western Cape High Court action to set aside Sanral's decision to toll had nothing to do with politics. \nShe received the letter a week before the court case and discussed it at length with her lawyers. \nIn her responding letter without prejudice [to the court case] on July 29, she said any collaborative solution would have to accommodate the city's firm position that it was opposed to tolling. \nThe city said it would agree to settle the court case if: \n- Sanral agreed to an order of court setting aside the declaration of the N1 and N2 as toll roads; \n- Sanral agreed to withdraw and abandon the project; \n- A joint technical team was established to include members nominated by the provincial transport MEC to decide what infrastructural upgrades were required for the N1 and N2 and a timeline for their necessary implementation; \n- The parties agreed upon acceptable funding and/or financing mechanisms; and \n- Sanral paid the city's legal costs to date. \nIn a responding letter on August 11, Alli said he was \"somewhat surprised\" she had attached these preconditions. \nHe asked what infrastructural upgrades and acceptable funding/financing mechanisms she had in mind. \nDe Lille said on Wednesday she received quite a \"snipey few paragraphs\" in response, asking for clarity, and she left it at that. \nSanral spokesperson Vusi Mona claimed at the weekend that her reply to their initial offer showed she had no interest in the project and was intent on dragging the parastatal to court. \n\"We explained that Sanral would not be held to ransom by unreasonable and unethical demands. There has been no further response from her to date,\" the statement read. \nHe also claimed the city was making Sanral out as a \"monster\" that wanted to rip off residents. \nDe Lille told News24: \"We don't need to do that because they are doing quite well in painting and projecting themselves as monsters.\" \nThe Western Cape High Court has yet to deliver its judgment. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T09:09:50.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
