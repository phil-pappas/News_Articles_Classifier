Our working assumption continues to be that this represents a step increase in the level of exports and imports and not a lasting upward shift in their growth rates.\" \nThe Bank had warned in February of the distortions caused to 2014 GDP (gross domestic product) by so-called \"contract manufacturing\" which involves booking overseas transactions in Ireland, mainly for tax avoidance purposes . A month later the CSO said in a technical note that considerable comment had attributed “undue significance” to the matter and it was \"not particularly significant in explaining the recent growth in Irish GDP.\" \nEnda Kenny, taoiseach, in a speech in March 2015 said in respect of the 2014 trade performance that \"export growth at 12.6% was the strongest since 2001\" — of course political distortion is different to economic impact but it does matter when ministers confuse spin or lying with substance. \nIrish Export Performance: Myths and reality - Ireland is a poor exporter \nSeamus Coffey, the UCC economist , \" estimated 'gross value added' in Ireland of around €3.5bn \" from contract manufacturing in the nine months to September 2014, based on some CSO data, but Coffey didn't have enough data to judge the impact. \nDouble Irish Dutch Sandwich services trade and tax inversions which mainly involve US companies becoming Irish for tax purposes, in effect moving a tax residency and headquarters to Ireland, cause big distortions. \nEven though fake exports such as Google Ireland booking Google Australia's sales in Ireland which become Irish output and exports, may not have an impact on growth, it messes up productivity data e.g. unit labour costs and distorts for example science and technology indicators. \nIn 2014, €48bn of the total €102bn in services exports were in the 'Computer Services' sector — dominated by the likes of Google, Microsoft and Facebook. \nGoogle books about 40% of its global output in Dublin making its 2,500 staff in Dublin from a head count of 53,600 at end of December 2014 appear superhuman in terms of productivity. \nIn 2013, John FitGerald , then an economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), in a paper on the impact of foreign companies becoming Irish for tax purposes (redomiciled Plcs), found that GNP (gross national product) in 2010 was boosted by 2.9% and the current account was artificially improved by 4.1%. \nIn the first quarter of 2015, Medtronic, the American company, became Irish while Actavis, a redomiciled PLC, acquired the US company Allergen. These two companies alone have a combined market capitalisation of $230bn. \nIrish M&A deals H1 2015: Dutch or UK firm acquires Irish firm for €32.6bn - they are both American — this is an example today of fact and fiction \nJohn FitzGerald said in a summary of a recent paper: \"Traditionally, a key to understanding the behaviour of the Irish economy was the growth in exports and imports. However, recently implemented definitional changes in the national accounts make these data very difficult to interpret. The inclusion in the national accounts later this year of aircraft leasing activities on a comprehensive basis will further complicate the situation. The ongoing large purchases of aircraft by the leasing sector will, henceforth, be included under imports. As well as making the data on exports and imports difficult to interpret, this will also make the policy implications of changes in the current account of the balance of payments more obscure. Finally, the activity of a small number of firms, commonly referred to as 'redomiciled Plcs,' is also distorting the figures for Gross National Product (GNP) and the current account of the balance of payments. Taken together, these new developments affecting the Irish national accounts mean that there is no simple measure of economic progress in Ireland. The change in GDP is now a defective indicator of welfare. While GNP is a much more satisfactory measure, it can also be distorted by the behaviour of redomiciled Plcs.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:26:25.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
