However, the amount you receive may change at certain points,” Jongen says.\n“After six weeks outside Australia, your pension supplement will reduce to the basic amount. In addition, your pensioner concession card will no longer be valid but will be automatically reactivated when you return to Australia.”\nCHECK OUT OUR TRAVEL AND MONEY GUIDE\nDepartment of Human Services general manager Hank Jongen Source: Supplied\nIf you are spending more than 26 weeks overseas, your age pension may be reduced, but if you’ve lived in Australia for more than 35 years of your working life, the rate on payment should stay the same.\n“Australia has social security arrangements with 29 countries which can assist you to claim an Australian age pension while you are outside Australia, or to claim a pension from the other country, and may also affect your rate of pension while you are in an agreement country,” Jongen says.\nThe Department of Human Services website, humanservices.gov.au, has more information about pensioners travelling outside Australia and a checklist of what to think about.\n“Information on the department’s website about when customers need to notify they’re leaving Australia has recently been revised,” Jongen says.\n“In most cases customers do not need to notify the department, as we are automatically advised by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.”\n@keanemoney\n ", "external_links": ["http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/travel#itm_t=story&itm_l=pension-while-overseas", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310&h=How+holidays+can+affect+the+age+pension", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310&title=How+holidays+can+affect+the+age+pension", "https://twitter.com/keanemoney", "http://moneysaverhq.com.au/campaign/travel#itm_t=story&itm_l=pension-and-travel", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+holidays+can+affect+the+age+pension&c=SENIORS+love+to+travel%2C+and+also+love+the+age+pension+they+receive+in+retirement.+But+sometimes+mixing+the+two+can+get+tricky.+Here%26%238217%3Bs+how+the+rules+affect+you.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/travel#itm_t=story&itm_l=pension-while-overseas", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/rules-for-seniors-to-know-when-travelling-overseas-and-how-it-can-affect-their-retirement-funds/story-e6frfmcr-1227498236581?sv=275bfa9049b1e9f5e850c3db30074310&title=How+holidays+can+affect+the+age+pension"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T13:06:07.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
