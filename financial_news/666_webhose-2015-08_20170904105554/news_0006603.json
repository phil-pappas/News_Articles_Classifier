The S&P 500 lost 5.52 points, or 0.3% to 2096.92. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 32.35 points, or 0.6%, to 5059.35. \nShares of Wal-Mart Stores led the Dow lower, dropping 3.4%, to $69.48, the retailer’s lowest closing price since February 2013. The move shaved 16.2 points off the Dow. Earlier Tuesday, Wal-Mart cut its earnings guidance for the year to between $4.40 and $4.70 a share, from its previous forecast of $4.70 to $5.05 a share. \nFor the quarter ended July 31, Wal-Mart said profit fell 15% to $3.48 billion, or $1.08 a share, from $4.09 billion, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier, citing factors including higher wages. In February, Wal-Mart said it would boost U.S. employees’ wages. \nAlan Konn, an senior portfolio manager at Ulhmann Price Securities LLC, a wealth-management firm, said the portfolios he manages still include Wal-Mart shares and that he approves of the higher minimum wages. \n“It is the right thing to do to keep employees,” Mr. Konn said. “I’ll give it time. This is a monster of a company.” \nShares of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls operator TJX TJX 7.22 % Cos., however, soared 7.2% to a record closing price of 76.78 after the company reported a 6.1% increase in quarterly earnings. Ross Stores rose 3.7% to 56.53, a record close. \nIn other earnings news, Home Depot again lifted its outlook for the year, as the U.S. housing recovery helped drive better-than-expected sales growth in its latest quarter. Its shares rose 2.6%. \nThe housing market is one of the bright spots of the U.S. economy. Housing starts rose 0.2% in July from a month earlier to an annual rate of 1.21 million.
