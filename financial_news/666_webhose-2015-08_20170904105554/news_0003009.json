ADVERTISEMENT That 0.4 percent increase in delinquencies was twice as much as any other form of consumer credit, and comes as student loan debt has emerged as the largest form of non-housing consumer debt.\nDelinquencies were defined as payments past due by more than 90 days, and climbed as the overall amount of student loan debt held steady at $1.19 trillion. \nStudent loans overtook auto loans and credit card debt as the nation’s largest pile of non-mortgage consumer debt in 2012. \nThe rapid growth of debt facing college graduates has emerged as a major political issue. Presidential candidates have discussed the matter on the campaign trail, and lawmakers in Washington have put forward proposals aimed at providing relief from that sector. \nBut the latest data show that even with an economy on the mend, more and more borrowers are finding the debt too much to handle. \nWhile more and more borrowers aren’t paying back student loans, the New York Fed found that just 95,000 Americans added a foreclosure to their credit reports, the lowest ever level in the 16-year survey. \nClimbing delinquencies in student loan debt came even as overall delinquencies fell in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, down slightly from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the year.
