Nic Walker Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Forcing people to fund more of their retirement by unlocking the $700 billion tied up in family homes has emerged as a point of consensus among experts from both sides of the political spectrum.\nAt last week's National Reform Summit , free market and progressive think tanks agreed the value of the family home should be taken into account when assessing whether somebody is eligible for the age pension.\nThey want the government to put reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners to borrow money using the equity in their house as security, at the centre of retirement income policy.\nCentre for Independent Studies economist Simon Cowan said a 20 per cent jump in house prices in recent years meant the total value of pension equity was likely to have reached $700 billion, and could be as high as $750 billion.\nMore than three quarters of pensioners own their home and for older age groups 75 per cent of all net wealth is held within the family home.\nMr Cowan said a government-based reverse mortgage scheme would allow the release of some of that value to boost pensioners' living standards while easing pressure on the pension.\n\"While the pressure on the budget has only increased in recent years, particularly as forecasts of a quick return to trend economic growth look less likely, the store of pensioner home equity has increased rapidly,\" he said.\n\"As a potential avenue to increase living standards, this cannot continue to be ignored.\"\n The left leaning The Australian Institute is also sold on the idea of reverse mortgages. It wants the existing pension loan scheme expanded so that asset-rich retirees are forced to spend down some of the equity in their homes.\nOnly retirees whose wealth or income makes them ineligible for the full age pension can access the scheme, which pays the equivalent of the full age pension on a fortnightly basis.\nThe money is borrowed from the government and secured against the value of property owned by the recipient. The loans are repaid either on the sale of the property or on the death of the recipient.\nBut there are only 40,000 such loans nationwide.\nThe Australia Institute says take-up could be dramatically increased by extending eligibility to everybody of pension age.\nA Grattan Institute report found that including owner-occupied housing in the calculation of a retiree's eligibility for the age pension would contribute about $7 billion a year to the budget.\nThe 2013 report said the change would also encourage people to downsize to housing which may be better suited to their needs, enabling more efficient use of the existing housing stock.\n\"We're suggesting, one, why not advertise that scheme more but, two, extend it to those who are eligible for the pension and then you get around this asset-rich, income-poor problem,\" the Australia Institute's executive director, Ben Oquist, said. \"It's politically difficult, but so is raising the GST.\"\nAccording to the Institute of Actuaries of Australia, many retirees hold on to their houses to fund aged care or to pass wealth on to their children.\nBut the fact the family home was exempted from the pension assets test encouraged people to remain in inappropriate housing, said PwC partner Catherine Nance, who heads the actuaries institute's housing working group.\nShe said one possible solution was to allow a portion of the equity in a home or proceeds of a sale to be exempted from the pension assets test.\nMs Nance said the problem many retirees had when trying to downsize was getting a bridging loan. This was because banks liked to lend to people who could prove an income.\n\"The world is changing,\" Ms Nance said. \"These days, not every borrower is working but it doesn't mean the loans aren't safe and secured.\"\nBut the Abbott government doesn't like the idea and the children of baby boomers, many of whom are expecting big property inheritances, would likely resist.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison has ruled out including the family home in the age pension asset test.\n\"The idea that this government would put the family home in the assets test for the pension is just not under consideration,\" he told the ABC in February.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-08-31T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:05:28.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
