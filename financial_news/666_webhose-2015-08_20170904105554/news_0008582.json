Vince Caligiuri Share on twitter by John Stensholt Legendary horse trainer Bart Cummings, who won an unprecedented 12 Melbourne Cups, has died, aged 87.\nMr Cummings had been suffering ill health for some time, and died in the early hours of Sunday at his homestead at Princes Farm, Castlereagh, in Sydney's north-west.\n\"His final moments were spent with his family and wife of 61 years, Valmae, with whom he celebrated their anniversary on Friday,\" said grandson and training partner James Cummings. \"For Bart, 87, this was a fitting end. A husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather; a master trainer and larger-than-life figure.\"\nMr Cummings was simply the most successful horse trainer in Australia and one of the biggest and most popular identities in Australian sports history.\nNumber 1: Bart Cummings, Light Fingers and Roy Higgins after the 1965 Melbourne Cup His Melbourne Cup success earned him the nickname of the \"Cups King\". He also won seven Caulfield Cups, five Cox Plates and four Golden Slippers in a career that featured almost 7000 race wins and 268 Group One winners.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia has lost a \"sporting giant and a racing legend.\n\"Few people have dominated a sport like Bart Cummings did. He will be remembered as a truly great trainer, the winner of literally thousands of races,\" he said .\nFederal opposition leader Bill Shorten said on Twitter, a \"legend of the turf has left us\" and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said Cummings was the \"king of the Melbourne cup\".\n Victorian Racing Minister Martin Pakula says Mr Cummings' feat of training 12 Melbourne Cup-winning horses will probably never be surpassed, and that he stands alongside Don Bradman as the greatest name in Australian sport.\nBorn and raised in Adelaide, Mr Cummings almost drowned at the age of 12. He entered the horse racing industry and at 23 was the strapper of 1950 Melbourne Cup winner Comic Court, trained by his father, Jim.\nMr Cummings gained his trainer's licence in 1953 and trained his first Melbourne Cup winner, Light Fingers, in 1965, seven years after winning his first Group One race with Stormy Passage in the SAJC Derby.\nHis 12 Melbourne Cup wins would come with 11 horses, with Think Big winning consecutive Cups in 1974 and 1975. His last Cup win was in 2008 with Viewed, on the 50th anniversary of his first entry in Australia's most popular horse race.\nMr Cummings was made a member of the Order of Australia in 1982 and was an inaugural member of the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2001.\nTwo year ago, Mr Cummings joined grandson James, the son of fellow trainer Anthony Cummings, in a training partnership. The duo had a winner on Saturday at Sydney's Rosehill, Sultry Feeling, in the TAB Plate Multi Handicap.\nMr Cummings' last Melbourne Cup involvement was 2014, training the sixth-place-getter Precedence with grandson James.\nWith AAP", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-30T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T09:23:52.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
