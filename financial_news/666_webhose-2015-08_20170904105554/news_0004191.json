Michele Mossop by Matthew Smith A Hong Kong-based hedge fund has earmarked $US120 million ($163 million) to invest in distressed mining and mining services companies over the next near and a half.\nThe hedge fund, LIM Advisors, is currently raising $US400 million in total to invest in distressed situations in the Asia-Pacific region, founder and CEO, George Long, told the Australian Financial Review .\nMr Long said he believed the pain investors in mining and mining services companies have already felt on the back of the recent plummeting commodity prices will get worse before it gets better.\nBut where there is distress, Mr Long said he sees opportunities, particularly in areas where a lot of equity investors fear to tread.\n\"We're slowly edging back into the mining and mining services. But I think it could be a year or two before it really bottoms,\" he said during a visit to Sydney this week.\nIn July, LIM agreed to provide debt funding and underwrite a recapitalisation in troubled mining equipment company, Austin Engineering, to the tune of $26 million.\nLIM's new distressed debt fund will find similar opportunities to the Austin deal across the Asia Pacific region, with Australia a \"big target\", Long said.\n\"There will be a mining and mining services industry in some form at the end of the day, even at the bottom of the cycle...it's not possible in the modern economy to not have a mining industry. But we'll see a lot of consolidation. Junior minors will get wiped out, BHP and RIO will go on,\" Long described.\n A lot of the freshly raised capital will go towards funding rights issues and convertible stock deals as well as debt buyouts where the opportunities were presented themselves, Long said.\nLIM came onto Australia's radar in July when it launched an activist campaign against AMP Capital relating its listed China Growth fund , which has struggled to narrow its discount to net tangible asset trading gap.\nLIM recently increased its stake in the listed investment company to around $64 million or just less than 13 per cent.\nLIM invests in Asia including in Japan and in China's A Shares and H Shares market through its multi-strategy hedge fund.\nUsing a base case of slowdown in China's GDP to around 4 per cent – where many market watchers are predicting China's economy to stop slowing in the 6 per cent to 7 per cent range – Mr Long predicted more companies in the mining and resources segment will be pushed to the brink.\n\"It's getting worse, we are still in the down turn phase,\" he said.\nMr Long builds his base case on some of the surprisingly low activity in China's electricity consumption and freight and rail traffic numbers.\nThe effect of China's continued slowdown on Australia's resources segment outside of the largest low cost miners will continue to felt, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:13:25.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
