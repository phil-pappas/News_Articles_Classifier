He had brought it on himself.\n\"I had watched him fidgeting in his chair the whole time,\" Marshall recalled of the disgruntled staff member in the March meeting.\nIt was the second briefing tour that has so far taken Marshall to talk to scientists at about a dozen of CSIRO's 55 sites. \"We got an hour in to the Q&A and I thought, 'I'm going to regret this but I have to ask this guy to just ask this question'.\"\nThe man, one of the 300 scientists at the Clayton campus who undertake a broad range of research from custom 3D-printing of titanium body parts to nanotechnology, had heard enough of the new CEO's promises.\nScientists are naturally sceptical, but CSIRO's cohort also has reason to be cynical too. More than 1200 of their colleagues have been marched out the door over two years from a massive restructure, an efficiency drive put in place by the Labor government, and a $111 million funding cut as part of the Abbott government's first budget in 2014.\n\"Hey I've heard everything you said,\" Marshall remembers the man saying. \"Every CEO that we've had has had all these ideas. None of them have worked. They've all failed. What are you going to do when you fail?\"\nMarshall admits his initial feeling was 'Oh God'. But ever the entrepreneur, he responded by urging the scientists to change their thinking and stop being afraid of failure \"because as a scientist you don't ever fail\".\n\"In fact, I may have done six start-ups and they all made money but we failed a lot,\" he tells AFR BOSS in his office at CSIRO's industrial-style complex in North Ryde. \"And it was all the fail points that actually taught us what we needed to know to get success. It's really a state of mind. If you hit a wall, you can call it a failure and pack up and go home. Or you can make it a catalyst for something really extraordinary.\"\n The country is now counting on Marshall to do something really extraordinary.\nSeemingly insatiable global demand for commodities like coal and iron ore has helped Australia to 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth. But prices have crashed and demand is slowing and there is little sign that other sectors like agriculture or manufacturing will pick up the slack. The Lucky Country needs to be transformed, but no one is really sure how to make it happen.\nThe answer will rely on innovation and so rightly, many turn their focus and expectations to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. CSIRO has a reputation for its great inventions – like Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and 100 varieties of cotton that have helped Australian farmers boost their output. But of late the institution has suffered from a perception, sometimes fuelled by politicians, that its scientists are in ivory towers embarking on projects that are of questionable use.\nMarshall could be the person to change that reputation while also having an influence on innovation more broadly in Australia.\nCertainly that is the view of Niki Scevak, who invests alongside Marshall in fund venture capital firm Blackbird Ventures and has known him for about six years.\nWhat the Australian public needs \"He's not from central casting but he's exactly what the Australian public needs,\" Scevak says.\nThere are a number of ways Marshall breaks the mould. Like his predecessor Megan Clark, who trained as a geologist, and before that Geoff Garrett, who has a doctorate in metallurgy, he has a deep scientific background. But unlike Clark's career working her way up the ranks of major mining companies, and Garrett's career in academic and government organisations, Marshall is an entrepreneur who was schooled in Silicon Valley.\nSome formative advice while at Stanford University in the late '80s meant he has not applied his PhD in physics to boosting a big corporation's bottom line, or writing journal articles in academia. Instead, he used it to start six technology start-ups, creating wealth for himself and investors, which then catapulted him to a second career in venture capital. He is not a bureaucratic type – the 53-year-old is comfortable in a suit, but it was only in recent years that he finally cut off the rat's tail that trailed from his dark curly mop.\nMarshall studied physics at Macquarie University and in the early '80s did a two-year internship at CSIRO's Lindfield campus. Within a decade of studying at Stanford in 1987 he had taken his first company public, listing Iridex on the NASDAQ in 1996. The company, which still exists, created ophthalmic lasers used in surgery for sufferers of glaucoma, an eye condition common in diabetics. His second public company, Arasor, which listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, but collapsed in later years after he had left, supplied wireless connectivity for the Beijing Olympics.\nIn the seven years to 2014 he was the managing director of Palo-Alto-based Southern Cross Venture Partners, which has invested in companies like online retailer Shoes of Prey and wireless chip designer Nitero.\nFor 25 years Marshall lived with his wife and two kids in a grand Los Altos home surrounded by orange and lemon trees, but yearned for home. He began mentoring for Scevak's Sydney-based technology accelerator Startmate, was heavily involved in Australian expat community organisation Advance and was a founding backer of Blackbird Ventures.\nDespite spending 25 years in the Valley, Marshall has remained hungry to improve Australia's track record on innovation and has contributed to government policymaking and brainstorming. But just as he had done with the company Arasor a decade earlier – in which he had an epiphany about the need to establish the company in China if it was to be successful in selling to the Chinese – Marshall decided he would need to come home if he was going to make a difference to Australia's innovation ecosystem.\nInitially the plan was to reinvigorate the Australian end of Southern Cross, but word got around that Marshall was coming home, including to CSIRO's recruiter Egon Zehnder. CSIRO chairman Simon McKeon, who oversaw the recruitment of the new CEO, says Marshall is a \"wonderful\" CEO. \"He has this very strong scientific pedigree, but is also a more-than-successful venture capitalist in what I would call the centre of venture capital,\" the Macquarie banker and former Australian of the Year says.\nMcKeon knew Marshall \"by reputation\" as the Australian to get in touch with when any government or business delegations went to Silicon Valley, but had not shaken his hand in person until the day in Melbourne when Marshall appeared in front of the board as a short-listed candidate. \"He had this magnificent CV and I was waiting almost, looking for the problem,\" McKeon says. \"I expected him … for some inexplicable reason to be socially awkward.\"\nBut McKeon's fears were unfounded. \"What really blew me away was his very impressive people skills.\"\nMarshall and McKeon have since the beginning of the year been holding court in intimate capital city dinners with state government ministers and bureaucrats, business leaders and scientists. Marshall's ease at the role of master speechmaker and storyteller is allowing him to forge strong relationships and ensure the right people understand what CSIRO is doing and why it needs continual support, McKeon says.\n\"I thought, 'Boy, this is important,\" he says of the way Marshall can relate easily, whether it's with a minister, a microbiologist or a mechanic; \"yes, we really do need someone who will represent the scientific community very well, but on top of that needs to engage with the common man.'\"\nIt is in this summary of McKeon that one gets a hint of the kind of expectation that has begun to surround Marshall since he started in February. Not only can he revitalise CSIRO, but can his influence extend nationwide?\nMcKeon puts it thus: \"We have got to be blunt. Australia is the most wonderful place in the world, but we don't quite have that strong innovative culture. That's why the CEO of CSIRO needs to be such a strong communicator.\"\nMarshall himself doesn't shy away from the broader, national role.\nHe says CSIRO's mission is to solve Australia's \"innovation dilemma\". \"Nine billion dollars going in on the front end into R&D, almost nothing in the middle to fund translation of that wonderful technology and yet $1.7 trillion in our capital markets, which, is by the way, the same as the Silicon Valley market caps,\" he explains. \"We have the fourth-biggest capital market on one end, the 12th-highest investment in the world on R&D in the front end, and yet you're 81st in the world on innovation delivery.\"\nBut for CSIRO to successfully plug that gap it needs to address its own problems. There are three main ones, and to explain them, Marshall makes what seems like an impossible comparison. CSIRO, he says, is like a big start-up.\n\"It's not quite sure who its customer is. It's not quite sure what its value proposition is. It's not quite sure how to go to market.\"\nLanguage of entrepreneurialism Marshall speaks the language of entrepreneurialism. To gather ideas from 5,300 CSIRO employees he's \"crowd-sourcing\". To do a better job at justifying CSIRO's $749 million in annual funding he's being more customer-centred and delivering measurable outcomes. To plug the funding gap for early stage technology development eschewed by risk-averse investors and companies, he is starting a seed fund.\nHis style is part informal, part start-up pitch. And although you could imagine being persuaded to hand over a cheque if it was a pitch (and in a way, it is, and taxpayers already have) he has a reassuring grasp of detail and lack of hyperbole that make you confident he will spend your money in a way that ensures you get the best return on your investment.\nThe key for Marshall will be his knack for storytelling. He understands that if CSIRO wants to maintain its level of funding, while also delivering real value to the nation, it needs to explain \"the why\" of every activity it undertakes.\nAt Lucas Heights, the Sydney suburb known for its nuclear reactor, scientists at the CSIRO site recently developed scanning technology, which an unnamed mining company has started using, that can measure the exact mineral content in the ground before it is extracted and processed. Marshall says the technology can deliver $1.2 billion in value to the company per year, because it makes mining more efficient.\nPutting a dollar figure on the benefit CSIRO's technology brings is an obvious way to ensure the organisation's value is tangible and easily understood. This is crucial when Marshall is fighting for funding in austere and ideological times.\n\"No matter how pure the research is, we still owe it to the public to be able to say \"This is what we're doing; we believe that this will lead to X\" and X will be a tangible value,\" he says.\nNot every area is as easily explained as a billion-dollar boost to a mining giant's topline. But Marshall has had a number of discussions with McKeon, who chairs insurance giant AMP, about the way certain areas of CSIRO's research, such as into climate and its well-regarded Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, can be seen as the country's own insurance policy. Research into these areas helps answer the \"What happens if?\" question, he says.\nMarshall is also wary of becoming too customer-centred and just focusing on revenue-generating research. His nightmare would be if CSIRO turned into a \"research for hire\" consulting firm.\nIt should be OK to say that, if it indeed is delivered, the \"X\" benefit may not come for years, he says. \"It's important not to lose sight of that. When you plan a seed of technology or research, it can take – WiFi took 20 years to cook. The big ones take a long time but if you get it right, they're profound.\"\nIn this way Marshall sees one of his roles as not just reinvigorating CSIRO, but also in retraining its customers, which include government and the private sector.\n\"I have a 'customer first' mantra, and that often gets mistaken for 'Customer is always right'. In my experience customers are rarely, if ever, right, and it's not their job to be right. It's an interesting misconception about innovation.\"\nCustomers can only see incrementally ahead – for example, a faster or different-colour version of the current product – and therefore only want to talk about how their supplier can deliver something more cheaply. \"But when you're going to them with a high-value solution that they didn't imagine you could do, no one argues about price at that point. It's all about 'How do I get it and how much value can it deliver to my business?'\"\nAs far as the government is concerned, it should expect a return on investment of its $749 million in annual funding, he says. CSIRO can boost established industries, like mining and farming, to deliver those returns through higher company taxes. But Marshall is also thinking bigger. He wants to create new industries and his pet idea is in materials.\n\"I've got a feeling that there's something really unique in the materials industry that we already have buried in our broom closet that will enable something really profound in Australian industry.\"\nLast November, before he had even started, Marshall sat down with the \"power scientist\" on his executive team: the executive director of manufacturing, digital productivity and CSIRO services, Anita Hill. Marshall revealed his hope that with the addition of smarts from CSIRO's science, Hill's team could tinker with one of the metals the wide brown land has in abundance and create a new, unique material with extraordinary properties. \"She has now got three big ideas in that area,\" he says. \"That was by December. That's the culture of CSIRO: it's like this high-powered engine that just needs to be pointed in the right direction.\"\nIt is now up to Marshall to do the steering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:07:47.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
