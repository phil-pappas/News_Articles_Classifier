Congress has 44 members in all.\nMahajan adjourned the House immediately after. However, a number of the Congress members staged a sit-in in the House.\nCongress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice President Rahul Gandhi also did not leave the House for quite some time and were seen holding discussions with leaders of some other Opposition parties.\nHer action came after several warnings and despite pleas by TMC leader Sudip Bandhyopadhyay and CPI(M) leader P Karunakaran that it would aggravate the situation.\nThe Rule 374(A) says: “Notwithstanding anything contained in rules 373 and 374, in the event of grave disorder occasioned by a member coming into the well of the House or abusing the Rules of the House persistently and wilfully obstructing its business by shouting slogans or otherwise, such member shall, on being named by the Speaker, stand automatically suspended from the service of the House for five consecutive sittings or the remainder of the session, whichever is less.”\nThe move came after the government approached the Speaker slamming the Opposition for obstructing the House for the past several days.\nSuch a major action is the first in the current Lok Sabha.\nThe suspended members included B N Chandrappa, Santok Singh Chaudhary, A H K Choudhury, Sushmita Dev, Ninog Ering, R Dhruvanarayana, Gaurav Gogoi, G Sukender Reddy, Deepender Hooda, S Kodikunnil, S P Muddahanumegowda, Abhijit Mukherjee, Mullappally Ramachandran, K H Munniyappa, B V Nayak, Vincent Pala, M K Raghavan, Ranjeet Ranjan, C L Ruala, T Sahu, Rajee Satav, Ravneet Singh K Suresh, K C Venugopal and T Meinya.\nSonia Gandhi was angry at the Speaker’s decision and asked Leader of Congress Mallikarjun Kharge to lodge protest.\nKharge, while objecting to the Speaker’s action, said “our demand is that the ministers resign. Then everything will be peaceful”.\nAmid the bedlam, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said there is no FIR, no court observation and no prima facie case against Swaraj as well as the two Chief Ministers and hence there is “no justification” for them to resign.\nHe said the CVC too has not pointed out any wrongdoing. “We have not shied away from discussion and we are ready for it.”\nSingh said while Opposition has an important role in parliamentary democracy, the House should be allowed to function.\nHis response came when Kharge opposed the Speaker’s move to name MPs from his party for disrupting the proceedings.\nBefore naming them, the Speaker repeatedly told Congress members not to display placards and return to their seats.\n“Don’t force me to take stringent action…you cannot say they disrupted proceedings so we will also do the same…we cannot denegrade ourselves further,” Mahajan said.\nBandhopadhyay and Karunakaran urged the Speaker not to suspend the members and the warring parties should be given a change to resolve issue as they are “experienced politicians”.\nKarunakaran recalled that BJP had stalled the Lok Sabha as opposition party for one month and such an action in the present Lok Sabh could be avoided.\nThe Speaker said if they are ready to take guarantee for Congress members, she could have a rethink.\nSome members from Left parties were also in the Well raising slogans against the government but were not displaying placards.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 1:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:34:52.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
