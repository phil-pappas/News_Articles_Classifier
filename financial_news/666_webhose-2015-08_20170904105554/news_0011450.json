All dollar figures refer to manufacturer's suggested retail prices as of mid-August for each vehicle's entry-level version, excluding delivery fees, taxes, title and any rebates. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T21:53:32.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
