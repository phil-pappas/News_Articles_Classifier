More Peronist takes lead in presidential poll \nAt the very least, Mr Temer’s decision to partly distance himself from the government will add to the already considerable challenge Ms Rousseff faces in getting support in Congress for any aspects of her agenda. More ominously for the president, it could also signal the start of the disintegration of her governing coalition. \n“This is a very worrying sign for the government, an indication that tensions between the PT and PMDB are likely to increase,” said Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at Tendencias Consulting in São Paulo. “There is a risk that this is one of the events that could eventually result in the PMDB leaving the government coalition.” The party is to hold a convention in November where the internal debate about its role in a Rousseff government is expected to come to a head. \nWith the Brazilian economy in a steep recession, Ms Rousseff’s popularity at record lows and an investigation into massive corruption ongoing, much of the attention has been focused on a possible attempt to impeach the president . However, the rumblings with her vice-president are a reminder that Ms Rousseff’s ability to govern during the remaining three years of her mandate will also depend on her capacity to keep the coalition together. \nThe PMDB has been one of the bedrocks of almost every government since the end of Brazil’s dictatorship in 1985. With little obvious political ideology, the party has deep roots in government at all levels across the country and jealously guards the positions in the federal bureaucracy that it has the power to nominate. \nSupporters insist the party has been an essential force for stable government in Brazil, while critics claim it is at the centre of the extensive political patronage networks whose dark side has been exposed by the Petrobras scandal. \nGloomy reality dawns on Brazil \nRoberto Setubal, the head of Brazil’s biggest private bank, sees a long period of gloom for Brazil’s economy as unemployment rises and Congress is roiled by corruption scandals. However, he does not believe Dilma Rousseff, the president, will be impeached. \nContinue reading \nA loyal and discreet lawyer who has twice been speaker of the lower house of Congress, Mr Temer has provided vital assistance to Ms Rousseff amid the political turbulence this year. After the first massive anti-government demonstration in March, he took on the role of “political co-ordinator”, which meant taking charge of the almost daily negotiations between the administration and Congress over budget cuts and appointments in the bureaucracy. The position gave him an influence over policy that some likened to a form of prime minister. \nMr Temer has given ambiguous reasons for his decision to step back. In public, he has said that he took on the liaison role with Congress in order to pilot a series of budget cuts, which have now been implemented, and he has played down suggestions of a rupture with Ms Rousseff. \nHowever, close colleagues of Mr Temer have suggested he wants to be more involved in the “macro-politics” of the government — the sort of terrain that might more normally be the job of the president. This month, he said that Brazil needed “someone with the capacity to reunify the country”, which some took as a sign that he was thinking about his potential role in a post-Rousseff government. \nThe unpopularity of the president and the continued economic crisis have led to increased calls from at least some PMDB members for the party to break ties with the government, especially given its desire to launch its own candidate for the presidency in 2018. \nHowever, some analysts believe a complete break with Ms Rousseff is unlikely. The PMDB would not want to give up all the positions in government that it controls and there is no clear consensus yet within the party about its future course. Corruption scandals also hang over some of its leaders. Eduardo Cunha, speaker of the lower house, was charged last week with allegedly taking a bribe related to a Petrobras contract while Renan Calheiros, leader of the Senate, is also under investigation. \nLast week, Gilmar Mendes, the judge who leads Brazil’s electoral authority, called for prosecutors to investigate whether Petrobras-linked bribes were used to finance Ms Rousseff’s re-election campaign. If such an investigation were to lead to any charges, that would also affect Mr Temer because he was on the same electoral ticket. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
