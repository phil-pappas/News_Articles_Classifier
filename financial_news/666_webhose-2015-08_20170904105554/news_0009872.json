This debt amounted to just over half a million rand, forcing the union into bankruptcy. \nThe cases stem from a wave of violent protests on farms in the Western Cape during 2012/3. Farm workers were demanding to be paid R150 a day. At the time, many workers were getting around R69 a day. Hundreds of workers were dismissed or locked out, among them at least 100 CSsaawu members. \nWhile the union failed in its challenges against the employers, the court ordered both the union and the workers to pay the court costs. \nIn a bid to avoid bankruptcy, the union filed for leave to appeal in June 2015. However, on 12 August 2015, the Constitutional Court dismissed the union's plea to have the cost orders overturned \nMeanwhile, Swarts said the union was still in the process of making negotiations around the payments. \n\"We consulted with our lawyers this week and we were given advice that we don't agree to and are not happy with. Ideally, we would like our legal team to negotiate with the employers for us to pay the money in smaller amounts, but this could also mean that they(employers) can hold this over our heads for the next 20 years,\" he said. \nSwart said the closure of the union would not only be \"devastating\" for the farmworkers, but also a loss for the poor in the Boland. \n\"The sheriff of the court was already at our offices twice to put up a notice of closure. It's important to remember that we aren't just fighting to keep the union going, it's about the poor having a voice. If we close, it will have a seriously devastating effect for farmworkers and the poor in the Boland region,\" he said. \nOn Sunday 30 August, Csaawu will meet with its members to decide on the next step.
