But it needs to be tapped properly and it will take time,\" he said. \nBrookfield is a global asset manager with more than $200 billion in assets under management. Core Infrastructure India Fund is a private equity group run by India's Kotak Mahindra. \nThe sale will allow Gammon, a medium-sized Indian infrastructure firm majority owned by parent Gammon India Ltd (GAMM.NS), to cut its consolidated debt to 22.29 billion rupees from 39.47 billion rupees. ($1 = 66.1400 Indian rupees) \n(Reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Michael Perry and Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T14:37:21.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
