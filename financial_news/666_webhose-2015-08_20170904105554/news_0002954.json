You ask them, by a show of hands, how many people have complaints about their jobs. Almost all of them raise their hands. The top complaint? Most likely it has something to do with money.\nWith cost-of-living expenses going up, living on a starting salary is harder than ever — especially if you’re trying to make your way in a big city like New York, San Francisco or Chicago. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and starting salaries are all part of the journey (or so you keep telling yourself).\nThe problem is: How do you afford all of the expenses in your life while making what you’re getting paid? For many people, the answer is finding a second job. If you aren’t sure whether that’s the right option for you, take a look at these questions to ask yourself when considering whether to find a second source of income:\nWhat’s Your Financial Situation?\nAgain, one of the most common reasons people begin to look for second jobs is to make a little extra cash. Part-time jobs are a good way to supplement income or even come up with a little extra spending money.\nHowever, second jobs are not without their disadvantages, especially in the long-term (more on that later). That said, it’s a good idea to ask yourself how long you would have to work a second job to get back on track financially and whether you could solve your money woes by sticking to a strict budget instead.\nIf you need extra money for a specific expense in the future– say, you’re moving to a new apartment and need to save up for movers, deposits, fees, and everything else involved– getting a second job for the short-term may be your best option. However, it’s a good idea to give yourself a tentative time frame. That way, you can develop a budget for the months you’re making extra money and look forward to the days of freedom in your not-so-far future.\nHow’s Your Overall Job Security?\nAnother reason getting a second job may benefit you? If you’re worried about your job security at your current one. For many young people, even a few weeks of not working after losing a job and before finding another one can be the difference between on-time rent payments and an angry landlord. For that reason, it’s important to have a backup plan if you think you may be without a job in the near future.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1L2uZCv&text=With%20cost-of-living%20expenses%20going%20up%2C%20living%20on%20a%20starting%20salary%20is%20harder%20than%20ever.", "http://www.rent.com/blog/avoid-common-money-blunders/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1L2uZCv&text=How%20do%20you%20afford%20all%20of%20the%20expenses%20in%20your%20life%20while%20making%20what%20you%27re%20getting%20paid%3F", "http://www.rent.com/blog/legit-apartment-money-saving-tricks/", "http://www.rent.com/blog/save-over-300-on-your-monthly-expenses-and-without-a-huge-sacrifice/"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:19:03.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
