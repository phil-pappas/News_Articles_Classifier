ADVERTISEMENT According to the SEC, ITG billed itself as a broker that traded only on behalf of clients, operating a “dark pool,” which is a private exchange for trading securities. However, for over a year the company ran a trading desk for its own profits. That desk, dubbed “Project Omega,” even tapped into the private information of ITG’s clients to gain a trading edge.\n“ITG created a secret trading desk and misused highly confidential customer order and trading information for its own benefit,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “In doing so, ITG abused the trust of its customers and engaged in conduct justifying the significant sanctions imposed in this case.” \nThe SEC claimed that via this secret trading operation, ITG traded roughly 1.3 billion shares, including 262 million shares traded with company clients unaware of ITG’s in-house operation. Furthermore, the regulator charged that the company used incoming trading data from its clients to inform its own investments, allowing it to deploy high-frequency trading algorithms to maximize profit from incoming client moves. \nThe company agreed to pay $2.3 million in improperly gained profits and interest, as well as an $18 million penalty to the SEC.
