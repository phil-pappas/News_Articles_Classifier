His lawyers were not immediately available to comment. Before his arrest, Karpeles told the Nikkei business daily that he never misused customers' funds and he still suspected outside hackers had been stealing Bitcoins for years. \n\nThe global virtual currency community was shaken by the shuttering of MtGox, which froze withdrawals in early 2014 because of what the firm said was a bug in the software underpinning Bitcoins that allowed hackers to pilfer them. \n\nThe MtGox exchange-which once boasted of handling around 80% of global Bitcoin transactions-filed for bankruptcy protection soon after the cyber-money went missing, admitting it had lost 850,000 coins worth 48bn (387mn). \n\nThey were worth about 480mn at the time of the disappearance. \n\nKarpeles later said he had found some 200,000 of the lost Bitcoins in a \"cold wallet\"-a storage device such as a memory stick that is not connected to other computers. \n\nJapanese media, citing police, have said investigators suspect Karpeles knew details about the missing Bitcoins-which were transferred by his exchange to a separate account-without notifying depositors. \n\nBitcoins are generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet and are not backed by any government or central bank, unlike traditional currencies. \nInvestors have demanded answers from Karpeles and called on the firm's court-appointed administrators to publicise its data so that hackers around the world can help analyse what happened at MtGox. \n\"I knew it. I thought it's absolutely strange that all of them disappeared only because of hacking,\" a 23-year-old investor who saved his Bitcoins at the exchange told the Mainichi Shimbun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:47:17.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
