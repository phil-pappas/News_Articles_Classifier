State media reported earlier this week that Jericho had \"hooked up with a female lioness called Ketty\". \nThe caption reads, \"Jericho is alive and well. It's good to be on top. #RIP_Cecil\". \nThe ad has received mixed reactions in Zimbabwe, with @ndiMunyahWacho tweeting, \"How can #Jericho be so out of taste?\" \nBut @tchumet said: \"Its mo than #great its Epic its been long since I last saw any Ad that shows thinking went into it, Great work #JERICHO.\" \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T18:16:07.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
