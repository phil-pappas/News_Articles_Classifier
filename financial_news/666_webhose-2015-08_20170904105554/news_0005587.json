In their mid-40s, with three children, the couple earns more than $94,000 a year.\n\nWINNIPEG FREE PRESS\nJohn Woods / Winnipeg Free Press Photo Store \nYet they've managed to save only about $50,000 in RRSPs and other accounts. More worrying has been their inability to stick to a monthly budget. This has led to them accumulating a lot of debt, including almost $30,000 on credit cards and another $50,000 on a line of credit. That's almost as much as they owe on their mortgage, at about $96,000.\n\"Everything credit-wise is maxed out,\" says Nora, who works in an office.\n\"It's been really the result of overspending, and I feel like I've been an ostrich with my head in the sand, where it's one of those things where you fall into that trap, thinking it won't happen to me.\"\nThey're rolling their high-interest credit-card debt into their mortgage, which would increase what they owe on their home to $142,500 at 4.99 per cent over 30 years.\n\"Whatever money is left on the mortgage over and above what's owed on the cards would be thrown back into the house to make repairs and improvements,\" Nora says.\nAnd the couple still has to pay off their line of credit and a vehicle loan of about $16,000.\nNora and Victor know time isn't on their side: They need a plan to get out of debt as soon as they can so they can start saving for retirement. Only Victor -- who works in sales -- has a work pension worth about $63,500, so they know they need to free up cash sooner rather than later to set aside for old age.\n\"Right now, we're basically staying afloat,\" Nora says. \"I want to make my money work for me rather than being reactive to our spending.\"\nCredit counsellor Sandra Fry with the non-profit Credit Counselling Society in Winnipeg says Victor and Nora should be able to get out of debt and on track for retirement, because they earn more than they spend -- at least on paper.\nTheir monthly take-home pay is about $5,200, while their expenses are about $4,900. The remainder should probably go toward debt, which could shave off a few years in their plan to become debt-free. As it stands now, their line of credit and auto-loan debt won't be paid in full until 2025, and their mortgage wouldn't be paid off until about 2045.\nIf they want to speed up the process, they should use the snowball strategy to paying off their debts: Once one debt is paid, they would add the payments that had been going toward it to the next debt with the highest interest rate. In their case, their truck will be paid off first, in about three years. That would free up $460 every month that can be diverted toward the line of credit.\n\"This would reduce the amortization on the line of credit to approximately 61/2 years instead of 10,\" Fry says. \"So they could have all unsecured debts paid by 2022, and at that point they could choose between paying the mortgage off faster or increasing retirement savings.\"\nAlternatively, they could contribute the payments that were going toward their vehicle to their savings. But that is only effective if the return on their investment exceeds the interest rate on the line of credit.\nThe bigger challenge, however, is their mortgage. At their current pace, they won't be free and clear until their 70s. But Fry says they can take some steps to reduce the amortization.\n\"If they have not committed to a new mortgage at 4.99 per cent, I would encourage them to shop around, because it's a high interest rate in a market where the bank prime rate is 2.7 per cent,\" she says.\nA lower rate would have a positive effect on their finances.\n\"Every one per cent drop in interest on a $140,000 balance will reduce amortization by five years,\" Fry says.\nA four per cent rate on a mortgage would reduce their amortization to 25 years, while a three per cent rate would allow them to pay off their mortgage in 20 years.\n\"If they are unable to change mortgages, then perhaps they should consider whether they should instead be directing extra funds to reducing their mortgage before they focus on an accelerated pay-down for their line of credit, because it will be a higher interest rate than the credit line,\" Fry says.\nOf course, any debt-reduction strategy will be ineffective if Victor and Nora cannot balance their budget. While the couple is showing a monthly surplus, Fry says a budget on paper doesn't always equate to what's really happening.\nBudgeting is an ongoing process, and Victor and Nora need to be on top of their expenses monthly. That means reviewing last month's spending at the start of each month and then making changes where they can to reduce costs. Fry says it's the only way to make real progress, besides increasing income. When successful, budgeting can help individuals repay debt much faster than anticipated.\nFor example, if Victor and Nora can find an additional $200 a month in their budget, they could reduce the amortization on their line of credit by three years. Potentially, they could be debt-free -- excluding the mortgage -- by about 2020 if they also reallocate the payments on their vehicle loan to their line of credit once the loan is paid in full in 2018.\nWith both debts paid, they could then direct half of the $1,160 a month in free cash flow to their mortgage. This would help them pay off their mortgage about 15 years earlier, based at a 4.99 per cent interest rate.\nAt the same time, they would contribute the other $580 to savings. If they could earn a four per cent return on that money, for example, they would have nearly $70,000 in about a decade. And by about 2029, when they're debt-free entirely, they could contribute the $1,920 going toward debt to savings for about five to 10 years to save even more for retirement.\nYet this is all dependent on Nora and Victor developing good budgeting skills. That's often easier said than done, Fry says.\n\"For this reason, I think they would really benefit from credit counselling going forward, to help them develop a workable budget that they can stick to for the long haul,\" she says. \"Or, if they prefer to go it on their own, they can also take advantage of free budgeting webinars, including on our educational website ( www.mymoneycoach.ca ).\"\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T11:25:59.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
