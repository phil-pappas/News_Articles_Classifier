The Queen Mary 2 retraced its course in hopes of finding the missing person but the search was abandoned after experts determined no one could have survived that long in the chilly Atlantic.\nA passenger, Konstantin Binder, tweeted that Capt. Kevin Oprey turned the ship around at 10:40 a.m. Saturday. Passengers were later called on deck and asked to look as the captain said \"every pair of eyes helps.\"\nThe ship traveling from Southampton to New York will stop in Halifax on Monday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T14:08:40.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
