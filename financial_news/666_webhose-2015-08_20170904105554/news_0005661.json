A daily close below 0.9726 (trend line, 23.6% Fibonacci retracement) exposes the 38.2% level at 0.9617. Alternatively, a move above the 14.6% Fib at 0.9793 clears the way for a test of the August 11 high at 0.9902. Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade on a long or short side from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
