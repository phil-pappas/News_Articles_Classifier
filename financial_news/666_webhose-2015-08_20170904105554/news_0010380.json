A key outcome of this collaboration is the new contract negotiated with NHIF for a period 2015/16 and came into effect on July 1 2015,\" she said. \nShe indicated that under the new contract, drug and substance abuse rehabilitation centres will also be covered. \n\"On its part, the government will continue consultations with NHIF, the Union of Kenya Civil Servants and other stakeholders to improve the benefits package offered under the scheme to ensure that members access quality healthcare,\" she stressed. \nShe explained that members who retire within the contract period will also continue to access the medical benefits under the scheme. \n\"And with good reason, a healthy workforce is essential to the realisation of this government's broad transformational agenda.
