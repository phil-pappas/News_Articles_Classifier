Symetra shareholders will also receive a previously announced special dividend of $0.50 per share in cash.\nChief Executive Thomas Marra and its management team will continue to lead the business in the United States.\nShares of Symetra were up 6.7 percent in premarket trading.\nOVERSEAS BUSINESS\nFounded in 1957, Symetra provides employee benefits, annuities and life insurance. It is partly owned by White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd, a holding company of several financial services companies.\nSymetra's largest shareholders, White Mountains and Berkshire Hathaway, which have about 18 percent and 17 percent respectively, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction, Symetra said in a statement.\nSumitomo Life has hitherto had only minimal overseas operations, consisting of minority stakes in insurance companies in China, Vietnam and Indonesia.\nThe company said the acquisition of Symetra will boost the proportion of its overseas business to 14 percent in premium revenue and 8 percent in adjusted profits, based on its previous year's results.\nGoldman Sachs is acting as financial advisor to Sumitomo Life and Morgan Stanley to Symetra, the two insurers said.\nWith three of Japan's top four life insurers having made multi-billion U.S. deals, including Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co's $5.6 billion acquisition of Protective Life, industry leader Nippon Life will likely draw attention as the next big buyer.\nNippon Life, with $500 billion in assets, has said it is looking for overseas targets and could spend up to 1.5 trillion yen on acquisitions and investments at home and abroad over the next 10 years.
