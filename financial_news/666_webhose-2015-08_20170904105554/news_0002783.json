ADVERTISEMENT Jobs growth fell from 229,000 in June and dropped below 200,000 for the fourth time this year, according to the ADP National Employment Report released on Wednesday.\nStill, there is optimism around the labor market’s steady expansion, even with the appreciating dollar and a drop in oil prices holding back more robust jobs growth. \n“Job growth is strong, but it has moderated since the beginning of the year,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, which helps produce the ADP report. \n“Layoffs in the energy industry and weaker job gains in manufacturing are behind the slowdown,” he added. \nZandi — who expects jobs growth to average about 200,000 a month this year, down from 250,000 last year — estimates that even with the drop in the pace of job creation, the labor market is rapidly approaching full employment. \nThat growth could provide the catalyst the Federal Reserve needs to raise a key interest rate as early as September. \nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said she expects the central bank will raise rates for the first time in nine years sometime in 2015. \nFor the Fed to take action in September, employers will need to add about 200,000 jobs in July and August, Zandi said. \nBut it will be a \"close call\" as to whether the government's report, set for release on Friday, will provide that boost to the Fed, he said. \nZandi said \"everything should be in place for the first rate hike in September, because we're approaching full employment pretty quickly.\" \nThe government's jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers added around 215,000 jobs last month, which should further fuel those expectations. \nMeanwhile, there were some bright spots in the ADP report. \nLarge businesses — those with more than 500 employees — posted their best month since December, and gains were nearly double the June number. \nCompanies with more than 1,000 employees added 47,000 jobs — well above the 6,000 added in June. \nConstruction firms added jobs at a healthy pace, hiring 15,000 last month, although that was a slightly slower pace than the 17,000 in June. \nThere were trouble spots, however. \nManufacturing added only 2,000 jobs after gaining 9,000 in June. \nPayrolls for businesses with 49 or fewer employees increased by 59,000 jobs in July — about half of the June number. \nCompanies with 500-999 employees added 17,000 jobs after adding 28,000 jobs in June. \nJobs in the service industry rose by 178,000 jobs in July, down from 216,000 in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T23:11:01.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
