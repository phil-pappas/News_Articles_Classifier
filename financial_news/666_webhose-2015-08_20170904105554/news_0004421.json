A plan must gain a majority vote in both rounds for a sponsor to be approved. \nA decision is expected at 2.30 p.m. Tokyo time (0530 GMT). The sources declined to be identified ahead of the vote. A spokesman for Airbus declined to comment. \nAt stake is access to 36 landing and take off slots at Tokyo's crowded Haneda airport which are operated by Skymark and which would help ANA cement its growing domestic dominance over local rival Japan Airlines. \nFor Delta, a win would give it a base at Asia's second-busiest hub and a bigger presence in Japan were it does not have an alliance partner. \nAirbus is Skymark's second biggest creditor with 28.9 percent of its debt. The Delta plan has been put forward by leasing firm Intrepid Aviation which has 38.1 percent of its debt. \nAn official in Tokyo for Skymark's No. 3 creditor, jet engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings which has 15.7 percent of its debt, declined to comment. \nANA, its affiliates and partners together have about half of the 465 domestic slots at Haneda. JAL controls 184.5 of the daily landing rights. \n(Reporting by Maki Shirakin and Tim Kelly; Additional reporting by Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:50:40.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
