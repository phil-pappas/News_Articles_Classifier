When they do, parents will be doing themselves a big favor by knowing exactly what they're getting from the credit card they use to pay for back-to-school supplies. Here's the rub. Cardhub.com, a credit card specialty site, says that some cards are more transparent than others on the fees, rates and fine print that comes part and parcel with any card deal. In the firm's 6th annual Credit Card Application Study , which tracks how open card companies are with their customers, Cardhub.com rates the best and worst card providers in terms of transparency. Some takeaways from the study earn a closer look from card consumers: - Capital One, State Employees Credit Union and Boeing Employees Credit Union have the clearest overall credit card applications. - Barclaycard U.S. and Navy Federal Credit Union have the least clear credit card applications. - Credit unions lag slightly behind big banks when it comes to overall website transparency, with the biggest deficiency being in terms of how rewards earning and redemption rates are characterized. - The areas in which the most ambiguity remains - for big banks and credit unions alike - include the disclosure of balance transfer fees and rewards redemption value. - Transparency is now at the highest point since Cardhub began conducting this study in 2010 - having increased 15% in that time. Card consumers who don't pay attention to their credit card company's transparency efforts, bad or good, and who don't pay close attention to the fine print, are taking a big risk. \"The vast majority of consumers do not realize that the plastic card they pull from their wallet and use for goods and services creates a unique and varying cost for every company,\" says Joseph Bizzarro, CEO at Vizant, a payments services and advisory firm. \"Every credit, debit or prepaid card incurs a whole host of fees and costs, and while the merchant may pay these costs, it is the consumer that ultimately pays for it.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:51:17.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
