The indexes had plunged more than 20 percent over the past week.\nTokyo’s Nikkei rose 1.8 percent, adding to the previous day’s 3.2 percent gain, after U.S. stocks racked up their biggest one-day gain in four years.\nIronically, U.S. stocks rallied on Wednesday on expectations that the Fed will hold off from hiking interest rates next month due to mounting global uncertainties, including China – the very factors that prompted heavy selling in the previous sessions.\n“The market has started to price in this prospect while the current level provides a good short-term rebound opportunity,” said Shigemitsu Tsuruta, senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities, referring to speculation that the Fed will decide to wait.\nChinese shares ended lower in the previous session as a double-barrelled blast of central bank stimulus failed to convince investors of Beijing’s ability to jolt the world’s second-biggest economy out of its slowdown.\nIn currencies, the dollar dipped briefly overnight after Dudley’s comments on the chances of a September rate hike.\nHowever, he warned about overreacting to “short-term” market moves, and left the door ajar to raising rates when the U.S. central bank holds a policy meeting on Sept. 16-17.\nThe greenback subsequently rallied as ebbing risk aversion reduced demand for the yen and euro, which had been bought as safe haven plays during the recent equity selling.\nThe dollar got an additional boost from upbeat U.S. durable orders data, which backed the view that the Fed would remain on track to eventually raise interest rates as the U.S. economy continues to recover.\nAgainst the Japanese currency, the greenback fetched 120.16 yen, up 0.2 percent from U.S. levels and recovering from a seven-month low of 116.15 plumbed on Monday\nThe euro was up about 0.1 percent at $1.1327 after losing 1.7 percent overnight, knocked further away from a seven-month peak of $1.1715 scaled on Monday.\nThe common currency was also hurt by comments from a senior European Central Bank official. Peter Praet said the risk of the ECB missing its inflation target has increased due to commodity price falls and weakness in some overseas economies.\nCrude oil rebounded amid a general thaw in global risk aversion. U.S. crude futures bounced 2.3 percent to $39.50 a barrel. The contracts had slumped to a 6-1/2-year low on Monday, dogged by supply glut woes and worries of a hard landing by China’s economy. Brent added 2.4 percent to $44.16.\nGold took back some lost ground after suffering its biggest fall in five weeks overnight as the dollar rebounded and U.S. stocks rallied. Spot gold rose about 0.3 percent to $1,127.50 an ounce.\n 27, 2015 7:25 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:08:36.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
