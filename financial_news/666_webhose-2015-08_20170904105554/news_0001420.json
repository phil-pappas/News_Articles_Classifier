A “significant portion” of the asset sale proceeds was paid out through an “extraordinary restricted payment,” which could include shareholder dividends, it said.\nThe yield on the 2018 notes fell 152 basis points to 8.15 percent after the offer was announced.\nGunvor will offer the full price for all outstanding notes that were part of its debut $500 million bond sale in May 2013. The trader already holds $154 million of the notes, it said.\n“We have good liquidity and cheaper forms of financing available so it made sense to do it now,” Seth Pietras, a spokesman for Gunvor in Geneva, said by phone.\nThe yield on the notes climbed to more than 10 percent on March 21, 2014, the day after Gunvor co-founder Gennady Timchenko was sanctioned by the U.S. for his ties to Vladimir Putin. The yield peaked at more than 14 percent in December.\nGunvor, which followed rival Trafigura Beheer BV in selling bonds to fund purchases of physical assets, has been reorganizing since Timchenko sold his 44 percent stake to co-founder Torbjorn Tornqvist the day before the sanctions were announced. The company, which has denied any links to Putin after getting its start trading Russian oil, has sold most of its assets in the country, including the Ust-Luga petroleum product terminal.\nSeeking Acquisitions The company, one of the world’s five-largest independent commodity traders, bought back $80 million of the bond in April.\nGunvor is now seeking to acquire assets outside of Russia including refineries and mines in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia. The company, which already owns two refineries in Europe, is “looking very actively on the investment side,” Chief Financial Officer Jacques Erni said in April.\nGunvor’s cash reserves rose by 56 percent to about $1.5 billion last year and operating profit jumped 20 percent to $432.4 million as volatility and a contango market structure boosted earnings from oil trading.\nChief Executive Officer Tornqvist, a Swedish national, now controls about 87 percent of Gunvor’s equity and all of the 15-year-old company’s voting shares. He has said Gunvor’s ownership is too concentrated and will seek partnerships or investors. A group of Gunvor employees own the remaining equity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:54:17.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
