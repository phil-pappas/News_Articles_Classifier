James Brickwood \"I was curious,\" Halas recalls. \"This is LVMH, after all; it's big.\"\nHis interest was piqued enough for him to make a pit stop in hot, steamy Singapore on his way back from a selling trip to Europe. As monsoonal rain fell outside, Halas sat inside L Capital Asia's headquarters, listening to Thakran, his head of operations and the head buyer for duty-free operator DFS (majority owned by LVMH) talk about what the group could bring to Seafolly.\nThakran was well versed on Australia, having been on something of an Australian buying spree in previous years. L Capital has outlaid $52 million for a 49.9 per cent stake in bush outfitter RM Williams, $80 million for 40 per cent of performance sportswear company 2XU, and about $20 million for gourmet food chain Jones the Grocer. He also knew of Seafolly; he walks past one of its stores most days on the way to his office.\n\"Ravi had just come back from a Byron Bay silent health retreat,\" Halas recalls. \"He had clear eyes, focused thought and great energy.\" Thakran understood both the challenges and the opportunities. Seafolly has 42 stores in Australia, branded both Seafolly and Sunburn (the latter selling other labels too), and sells through 1200 doors in 46 other countries, from Neiman Marcus in the United States and Harrods in London to Galeries Lafayette in France.\n Seafolly ambassadors Behati Prinsloo, Camille Rowe, Gigi Hadid. There was a huge opportunity to do more offshore, to sell Australia's sun-and-sand reputation to the world via a brand that epitomised it. It was also logical to take Seafolly further beyond swimwear, deeper into the allied beach sectors in which it was already dabbling. Both strategies would need capital but, just as importantly, something more than money. Thakran got it. \"It's the ability to connect with the right influences and the right people,\" Thakran says now. \"We often don't look at spreadsheets at board meetings. Our focus in our workshops is more about the brand and the delivery of the products and retail merchandising.\"\nHalas left Singapore promising to mull it over. It would take many more months, meetings and family discussions before, in February 2014, Halas and Thakran were back around a boardroom table, this time hammering out the mechanics of a deal.\nNearly 10 months later, as Australians dusted off their swimmers in preparation for the 2014 summer holidays, L Capital announced that it had agreed to pay $70 million for a 70 per cent share of Seafolly. The Halas family would retain the remaining 30 per cent.\nThey intend to grow sales from $120 million in 2014-15 to $250 million within three years. The idea is for international sales to jump from one-third to about two-thirds of the business, and for Seafolly to morph from a swimwear label into a true lifestyle brand.\nSimone, Anthony and Peter Halas in 1983. Australia has already delivered a swimwear brand to the world: Speedo, which is now owned by UK-based Pentland Group. But where that's primarily a sports brand, Seafolly plays in the fashion pool.\nIt won't be easy. Seafolly accounts for about 35 per cent of the $250 million Australian fashion swimwear market, according to LEK Consulting, but the $US18 billion ($24.4 billion) global beachwear market is a much more crowded space. Quiksilver, Billabong International, Eveden Group, Equatorsun and Jantzen are only some of the companies competing for a slice of the global swimsuit dollar.\nAdd to them Seafolly's biggest international threats, Victoria's Secret and German brand Maryan Mehlhorn, and a suite of boutique Australian labels, among them Zimmerman, Jets, Sunseeker and Baku, and it starts to look like a great idea that might be harder to pull off than it sounds.\nDavid Bush, fashion business consultant and a former senior executive at David Jones, is a believer, noting that Australian swimwear companies have a particular edge. \"The world perhaps neglects [us in] other apparel categories but certainly looks to Australia for swimwear,\" he says.\nAt 75, Peter is still a director. He comes in once a week to attend a management meeting and have lunch with Anthony. He thinks the research and development Seafolly puts into the construction of its outfits will stand it in good stead. \"They know that when madam goes to the beach and jumps in the waves and runs after the kids, the fit and function does what it's supposed to do. I can spot Zimmerman or Seafolly swimwear at the other end of the beach, and I don't find that with other swimwear.\"\nGigi Hadid at the office Seafolly's headquarters in Mascot, Sydney, are much more basic than the glamorous home of Louis Vuitton across town in King Street, where the deal with LVMH was nutted out. Seafolly girls past and present line the walls. A giant picture of current ambassador Gigi Hadid leans next to a Seafolly-printed surfboard in Anthony's office. Down on the ground floor, several women are hunched over sewing machines, making prototypes for next season. The space looks a little cramped for its 110-odd employees and there's the constant drone of aircraft overhead.\nBut it feels as if the sun is shining for Anthony, Peter and Yvonne, who could not be happier about the \"whole new world\" L Capital has opened up for their once little bikini company. They have just returned from a trip to Paris, where they had breakfast with LVMH chairman and majority owner Bernard Arnault.\n\"We also spent a day with [LVMH chief executive] Sidney Toledano, who [also runs] Christian Dior,\" Anthony enthuses. \"The inspiration and ideas are extraordinary. It's a world I would have never had access to. We have access to global resources, which will help us reach our goal of being a beach lifestyle brand.\"\nWe're sitting in Anthony's office, which is just across the hallway from that of Peter, who at 75 is still a director but only comes in on Tuesdays, to participate in a weekly management meeting and have lunch with his son. Peter wears a black T-shirt, jeans and black Prada trainers – his standard apparel.\nYvonne, 73, wears a brown sundress, a gigantic single pearl necklace bought in Japan and moderately tinted sunglasses, which she keeps on. Anthony, 47, also looks good, having inherited his parents' fine looks and smart casual dress sense.\nFamily photos take pride of place in the offices of both Peter and Anthony, whose relationship appears to be that of mentor and pupil and good friends, as well as father and son. Peter and Yvonne are happy for their son to take the limelight, although they enjoy the stroll down memory lane to the beginnings not just of their business, but their Australian lives.\nFrom Hungary to hope Like so many in the rag trade, Peter's story is one of immigrant success built from hard grind and the good luck of growing a business in lockstep with the Australian fashion industry. Born and raised in Hungary, Peter set off on the path towards Australia in the wake of Hungary's 1956 Communist Revolution. His father, who had survived a Nazi death camp but lost his wife and parents along the way, urged his son to get as far away from the mess of Europe as possible.\nThe 17-year-old Peter and four friends walked 120 kilometres to the Austrian border, travelling at night and hiding in barns during the day. It was the dead of winter but Peter had ignored his father's advice to pack something practical like underwear and a sweater, instead stuffing his backpack with books.\nPeter arrived at a refugee camp near Innsbruck and promptly applied to come to Australia. Six months later, his permit came through. He arrived in Australia in June 1957, settling in Bondi Beach. It was there in 1960 that he met Yvonne, who was also of Hungarian descent and had also lost a parent during World War II, in her case a father. Yvonne had emigrated to Australia as a child.\nYvonne describes seeing \"this very tortured, poetic-looking man on the beach smoking a cigarette\", and says she literally fell at his feet. Then 18 and 20, they had tea and a beer at a local pub before the 6pm closing. \"I went home and told my mother, 'I met the man I want to marry.'\" And marry they did; the pair recently clocked up 54 years together.\nDuring the early years Yvonne worked for the Packers, checking knitting patterns and recipes for The Australian Women's Weekly. Ita Buttrose was doing the social pages and they were all under strict instructions not to look at the Packers if they walked past.\nPeter got a job as a manufacturer's sales agent, flogging sportswear and swimwear on commission to hundreds of small customers. There were many department stores, though none as big as today's heavyweights, Myer and David Jones.\n\"I tried to do a university course [studying science] at night, but I found it too difficult to work and make a living plus study at night and [have] a social life so after about 18 months I dropped out,\" he says. \"I realised I was good at sales so I got into an agency for clothing.\"\nPretty soon he was a partner in a swimwear manufacturer called Waterlilly. It was a good time to be in bathers, which – thanks to the 1970s' sexual revolution – were changing. Bikini tops were suddenly little more than bras and one-piece costumes were revealing ever more hip. After eight years, an exhausted Peter wanted out of the rag trade, and sold out of Waterlilly. He looked around for other options but with his $18,000 payout burning a hole in his pocket he was soon back in the game, founding Peter's Folly in 1975, which later became Seafolly.\nReturning to the rag trade \"a terrible folly\" \"I said I'd never get back into the rag trade because it was just too hard, but I realised that that was the only thing I really knew,\" he says. \"So we got back in and someone said, 'Well that is a terrible folly.' That's how Peter's Folly came about.\"\nA non-compete clause stopped him from entering the swimwear market but he wasn't too fussed. In the mid-'70s it was all about denim: denim dresses, jeans, shorts, even denim-covered furniture. Peter's Folly jumped on the bandwagon, making denim sundresses for, among other clients, Myer, which placed the first order with the company for a grand total of $261.80.\nBy this point the couple had two children, Anthony and Simonne. Yvonne worked the reception and dispatch in between raising the children, while Peter ran the company. Design and manufacturing were done in-house. \"At the beginning people asked me what was the vision,\" Peter says. \"The vision was to put food on the table.\"\nWaterlilly went bust not long after Peter's Folly was established. Peter and Yvonne took the opportunity to dive back into swimwear, a category in which the hottest name at the time was Brian Rochford.\nBy 1980 annual sales had reached $8 million but Seafolly desperately needed money. Like many small businesses, cash flow was tight and it was hard to get a bank loan. Enter clothing importer Daniel Chen, who went on to be a perennial on the BRW Rich List. Chen bought 51 per cent of the company, essentially underwriting it. \"If Daniel Chen hadn't come along, we would have been in real trouble,\" Peter says.\nIt was through the partnership with Chen that the business started contract manufacturing swimwear for discount retailers such as Target and Kmart. The Seafolly label remained niche as the private-label business took off, propelling the company towards annual sales of $40 million by the mid-1990s. But the world was changing fast. This contract business was under pressure from cheaper Asian imports and orders were drying up. Chen wanted to stay in private label but the Halas family wanted out.\nAdding to their woes were debts from some of Chen's other businesses, which were not always kept separate from Seafolly. \"That was the time when our private-label business was struggling,\" Peter recalls. \"We knew that we should get out of private label and purely focus on Seafolly but … they had this fixed idea that it was too risky.\"\nIt was Anthony who encouraged his father to have one of the most difficult conversations of his life: telling the man who had helped him in the early days that it was time to split. He credits his wife Andie, with whom he has three children, as being instrumental in the decision. \"She was quite strong, saying 'This is our future; we have to make a decision about the Chen family.'\"\nAfter months of negotiations, Anthony bought Chen's 51 per cent stake in Seafolly for $1. Chen has since died. \"My father then very generously handed me the keys to the business,\" Anthony says.\nPacking boxes for the family business It was not the first time Anthony had been involved – it had always been a family business. Peter's father, a former oriental carpet salesman, and stepmother were finally allowed to leave Hungary in 1978 and, despite being in their 70s, they too joined Seafolly. Peter's half-brother, Andrew, also emigrated to Australia and worked in sales in the early days.\n\"I remember these tiny little offices on Foveaux Street in Surry Hills where all the rag trade was at the time,\" Anthony recalls. \"My grandfather was in there packing boxes; my grandmother was in there doing the accounts; my mother was the marketing PR. Every school holidays I'd be packing boxes, helping the cutters lay out fabric on the cutting tables, so it really was just part of the family.\"\nNevertheless the business was doing well enough for the family to move from Bondi to Vaucluse and for Anthony and Simonne to attend private high schools.\nLike his father, it had never been Anthony's dream to work in swimwear. As a young boy he'd wanted to be a vet, later studying accountancy then acting. He did commercials and even snared a role in Macbeth for Shakespeare by the Sea. But after several years delivering bread at midnight and working in cafes to make ends meet, he realised he was no Hugh Jackman.\nSimonne, meanwhile, became a psychotherapist, moved to Melbourne and married Paul Kanat, who started Hugo Boss in Australia and now owns Ted Baker Australia.\nAfter taking over the Seafolly reins in the late 1990s, Anthony wasted no time getting out of the private-label business and ramping up the Seafolly label, which had a much healthier margin. But there was a cost: the move slashed Seafolly's annual sales from $40 million to just $7 million. The business survived that first year thanks to the generosity of close family friends, who loaned the funds needed to plug the hole in earnings.\nAnthony knew the gem in the rough was the Seafolly brand but had many sleepless nights about shuttering the private-label side of the business. \"I can't say it was any great knowledge that I was using to make the decision; I was going off a gut feel,\" he says.\nAs serendipity would have it, the separates swimwear concept was taking off, in which tops and bottoms are sold individually. Seafolly was one of the first large companies to sense the opportunity. At about the same time, Seafolly upped its marketing spend, using a rising star called Kristy Hinze in a national outdoor advertising campaign. This helped it get into shops such as Surf Dive 'n' Ski and Beach Culture, which had previously shunned it as a \"mumsy\" brand. Seafolly started investing 10 to 15 per cent of its sales revenue in marketing, up from a norm of about 3 per cent.\n\"This was not sensible,\" Anthony says. \"But it was a calculated risk; it was the perception that needed to be adjusted.\" Since then Seafolly has raised the glamour stakes further, appointing models such as Miranda Kerr and Gigi Hadid as ambassadors and, in 2010, launching the Isola range in partnership with model Megan Gale, pitched specifically at 30- to 40-year-olds.\nThere were downsides to moving deeper into the cutthroat world of fashion, in which staying ahead of the style pack while remaining profitable is a tricky balance. Over the years there have been various legal stoushes, with Seafolly suing and being sued over copycat allegations.\n\"Our graphic team has four full-time employees; our design room has 15 employees,\" Peter says. \"We spend an enormous amount of money creating what is around you here. We will keep protecting our designs.\"\nThe long road to finding a business partner It wasn't until 2012 that Seafolly stopped manufacturing in Australia. It still does the design prototypes and fabric testing at Mascot, but manufactures in China and has a warehouse in Hong Kong. \"We were one of the last larger-scale apparel companies to manufacture in Australia,\" Anthony says. \"Costs got prohibitive. Plus the machinists' kids don't want to do this job.\"\nThe process of shifting its manufacturing offshore was one of the factors that got in the way of Seafolly's previous attempts to find a partner. Most private equity firms wait to see this type of challenging transition completed before making an investment. It is understood that Pacific Brands, along with private equity players Crescent Capital Partners, CHAMP Ventures, Riverside Company and RMB Capital Partners, showed interest in the brand during the UBS sales process. Some found the Halas family's price expectations too high given the rocky retail climate; others were waiting for the offshore manufacturing shift to be finished.\nWhile Anthony agrees investors were wary about retail, he says none of the potential partners before LVMH were the right fit. Peter says the process was distracting Anthony from running the business. \"They didn't understand where we wanted the business to go; they were pretty short-term thinkers.\"\nNick Batchelor was managing director of RMB Capital Partners at the time and now works at Quadrant Private Equity. He recalls how it looked from his side. \"When we first looked at the business, they had outgrown their systems as well as their software and finance teams,\" he says. \"They were going through the typical evolution of a successful family business that is transitioning to become a corporation.\n\"At the time, Australian retail was really struggling, making it a difficult call to invest in such a company. To Anthony, it became clear that he would really need an international private equity partner to get the valuation and business support he was after.\"\nWhile Seafolly didn't partner with RMB, Anthony was impressed enough with Batchelor to ask him to join the Seafolly board, where he remained until the sale to L Capital. Batchelor was an instrumental adviser to Anthony during the negotiations, as were David Zwi, a partner at law firm Thomson Geer, and Peter. Both sides agreed at the outset to do the deal without formal advisers.\nRussel Pillemer, co-founder of Pengana Capital, plays tennis with Anthony once a week. He says he only gave Anthony moderate advice on finding an investment partner. \"The general advice I gave him was look for the best partner, not the one who will write the biggest cheque,\" Pillemer says. \"Go with the one who will add the most value in the long term.\"\nThe power of the LVMH name Cue L Capital's Thakran, who flags the US as one of the first stops in taking the \"uniqueness of Australia to the world\" via the Seafolly brand. Seafolly has four stores in the US and is slated to open four more by year's end. The aim is to have 50 stores there within five years, concentrated in Florida and California with a few in strategic locations such as New York.\nSeafolly has three stores in Singapore and, while it's early days, it also sees an opportunity to open stores in greater Asia, in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China. The aim is to shift own-store business from about 38 per cent of sales to 65 per cent within five years. Indicative of its global ambitions is a decision to end the Isola partnership with Megan Gale when the contact expires in January, due to difficulties securing an international trademark for the brand, and acquire or establish a new label to fill the gap.\nIn terms of new categories, Seafolly's traditional kaftans and cover-ups will be expanded next year to include active wear, followed by more premium resort wear such as dresses and jumpsuits. Designs for accessories such as beach bags, hats, towels, footwear and eyewear will be revamped, and jewellery and beach chairs may be added. The goal is to triple accessories sales over the next five years from today's $6 million. \"When a woman picks things up for a beach holiday, she will pick up many things like sun care, hats and sandals,\" Thakran says. \"Each of these are opportunities ... [And] what about men – apparel and more accessories?\"\nAnthony had confirmation of the power of LVMH on a recent trip to California. \"I was with one of the representatives from LVMH and we were sitting with a landlord. The way the landlord spoke to me sitting with LVMH there was very different to if I was just there as a bikini manufacturer on my own,\" he says.\nIf Seafolly pulls off the international push, it will become one of only a handful of Australian retail brands to make it big overseas, joining the likes of Billabong International (despite its more recent troubles), Quiksilver, Rip Curl and Cotton On. It is too early to say how long L Capital will stay involved, or whether it will eventually take the company through to a public float in Australia or the US. No one is focused on that just yet.\nAs for Peter and Yvonne, they recently sold their beach house at Terrigal and bought an $8 million property in Darling Point. Peter is still up by 6am most days, walking along the cliffs from Bondi to Bronte. He loves street photography and says he needs more wall space to house his collection of work by artist Joshua Yeldham. He and Yvonne are also active in charitable work, principally through Courage to Care and their daughter-in-law Andie's new charity, Thread Together, which provides clothes to people in need.\nThe couple remain grounded on the meaning of success. \"Having lived through the Holocaust and lived through the revolution, having peace that I can wake up in the morning is having success,\" Peter says.\nAdds Yvonne: \"I also feel having an amicable family situation and seeing the children happy is success.\"\nThe AFR Magazine fashion issue, out Friday August 28, inside The Australian Financial Review .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:05:21.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
