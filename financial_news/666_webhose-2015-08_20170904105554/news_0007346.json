Photo: NYT\nFor the past year, Google's workforce has increasingly been under attack from a herd of unicorns.\nThe unicorns, a class of hot start-ups valued at $US1 billion ($1.36 billion) or more, are all aggressively pursuing the best and brightest minds in Silicon Valley with promises of talked-about workplaces and eye-popping payouts. Amid a general scramble for talent, internet search company Google has undergone specific raids from unicorns for engineers who specialise in crucial technologies like mapping.\nIn particular, Uber - the largest unicorn, with a valuation of more than $US50 billion - has plundered Google's mapping unit over the past 12 months, aiming to bolster its own map research. Airbnb, the popular short-term rental start-up, has gone on a more general hiring spree, poaching more than 100 workers.\nThe recruiting is not confined to the best engineers; sometimes it spills over to non-technical employees too. Two of the chefs who prepared meals for Googlers, Alvin San and Rafael Monfort, have been hired away by Uber and Airbnb in the past 18 months.\nAdvertisement Employees calling the shots \"It's an employee's market right now,\" said Rodrigo Ipince, 28, a software engineer who recently left Google and was pursued by unicorns, but chose to join a mobile gaming video startup, Kamcord. Ipince, who worked at Google for five years, said he received at least one or two emails from recruiters daily, asking if he was eager for a new job.\n\"It was fairly easy to get my foot in the door of whatever company I want,\" he said.\nRecruiting battles are a perennial tale in Silicon Valley, where technology companies wage war on one another for top prospects by doling out six-figure salaries and generous stock packages as if they were Halloween candy. The difference now is the scale of the talent clashes, with a large and growing number of young companies jumping into the fight, boasting fat war chests and claiming $US1 billion-plus valuations.\nThere are now more than 124 unicorn companies, according to CB Insights, a research firm that tracks start-ups.\nThe competition is recognised at the very top. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, in a memo written over the weekend in response to a New York Times article about the company's workplace , referred to a \"highly competitive tech hiring market\" and how his employees \"are recruited every day by other world-class companies\". He wasn't specific about which companies were after Amazon workers.\nWhile the unicorns typically pick off small groups of engineers at a time, making little impression on a large company's total employee numbers, the poaching attacks are often aimed at siphoning off the best talent in strategic technologies. That can sting the likes of a Google, where executives have said one skilled engineer can be worth many times the average.\nThe lure To snag employees from large rivals, unicorns have a simple recruiting pitch: They are on a path to success, as illustrated by their rising valuations. Many offer generous equity packages of restricted stock units that can later translate to big paydays for employees if the unicorn goes public or is sold - a lure that neither Google nor any other public tech company can dangle. Also, the unicorns say they are far more fleet-footed and cutting-edge than large organisations.\n\"The things that excite young tech workers are high growth and fast execution,\" said Dave Carvajal, founder of Dave Partners, a tech recruiting company. \"It's not that tough for the new unicorns to swing by these big, older tech companies and pick up busloads of talent.\"\nMike Curtis, vice president for engineering at Airbnb, which has a $US24 billion valuation, said new hires were drawn to the youth of the company, which was founded in 2008. Airbnb, based in San Francisco, has doubled its workforce over the past year, now employing about 2000 people globally.\n\"These people think quite a bit about what our future growth potential is, what kind of impact we will have on the world, and, yes, what that would mean in terms of their equity,\" Curtis said in an interview.\n'Increase the talent pool' Apart from Google, one-time internet darlings Yelp and Twitter have become prime poaching targets, especially as their share prices have plummeted, reducing their employees' potential for big gains from equity compensation. Over the past 18 months, Yelp's stock price has fallen 73 per cent from its peak, while Twitter shares are trading near a low.\nYelp's chief operating officer, Geoff Donaker, acknowledged the unicorn poaching phenomenon in a conference call with analysts last month after the company reported disappointing earnings. About what he called \"the unicorn bubble question\", Donaker said: \"We are certainly feeling those impacts.\"\nThe company said it was having to spend more to hire sales representatives, and that recruiting was not happening as fast as Yelp would like because of the competitive environment.\n\"We will do what we can to hold the dam on that whole thing and ride it out,\" Donaker said.\nRepresentatives of Twitter and Yelp said their total employee numbers had risen on an annual basis.\nShannon Eis, a spokeswoman at Yelp, said: \"This competition for talent has a better chance at being solved if tech companies work together to increase the talent pool. We have to encourage students to train for careers in the fields that are growing our industry and our economy.\"\nUber head hunter Among the most aggressive unicorn recruiters is Uber, the ride-hailing company based in San Francisco, which has expanded operations to 59 countries. Uber promises a fast-paced work environment and \"world changing\" ambitions, according to multiple people who have been approached by the company or work for it. Uber has more than 3500 employees, up from roughly 1300 a year ago, not counting its so-called driver partners, who are contract workers.\nUber does not shy away from dangling generous compensation packages to important hires, especially in engineering. In the case of some highly sought-after engineers from Yelp last year, Uber offered millions of dollars in restricted stock units, say two people with knowledge of the recruiting practices, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nOne of Uber's prime picking grounds is Google. Uber has systematically hired Google's experts in mapping technology, a crucial component of Uber's plans to reduce its reliance on outside companies for mapping. In June, Uber hired Brian McClendon, a Google vice president for engineering who now leads Uber's driverless car and robotics research centre. Uber has also raided Google's Geo unit, according to people close to the company, hiring at least a dozen mapping specialists over the past year.\nMcClendon declined to comment, as did an Uber spokeswoman. Google declined to comment for this article.\nCounter-offers Google is not letting its employees go without a fight. Offers from a short list of companies - including Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and Palantir - will often produce counter-offers, say two people with direct knowledge of the matter.\nThe most senior Google employees may get a one-on-one meeting with Google co-founder Larry Page to try to persuade the executive to stay, says one of these people. Google is often willing to go \"over the top\" to keep top talent, the two people say.\nNow may be an especially opportune time for unicorns to pick off Google workers. The company is in the midst of restructuring into a holding company named Alphabet. That has raised questions as to how employees, and their pet projects, will be situated and funded under the new regime.\nIn addition, a nimble recruiter from a much-talked-about start-up can still move faster than even the most competitive companies like Google. And sometimes, moving fast enough is all it takes.\nIpince said: \"In one case, I replied to a recruiter on Thursday. I was interviewing on-site by Saturday, and I had an offer by Monday.\"\nThe New York Times", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/technology/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-defends-working-conditions-after-nyt-criticism-20150818-gj1xez"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:40:23.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
