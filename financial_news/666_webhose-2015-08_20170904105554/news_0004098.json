We need a recovery that works for the many and not just the few. \n\"Ordinary employees need to be included in workplace pay committees to add some common sense and reality to boardroom pay decisions. They should not be a closed shop for an elite who are only interested in looking after their own.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T06:13:29.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
