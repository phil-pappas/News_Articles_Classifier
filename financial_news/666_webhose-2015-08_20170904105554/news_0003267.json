In an interview, he told Reuters that earlier this year the team broke out incidence rates of malicious software by language. The rate of Russian-language Androids with potentially harmful programs had spiked suddenly to about 9 percent in late 2014, he said.\nGoogle made its roughly weekly security scans of Russian phones more frequent and was able to reduce the problems to close to the global norm.\nLudwig said improvements to recent versions of Android would limit an attack’s effectiveness in more than nine out of 10 phones, but Drake said an attacker could keep trying until the gambit worked. Drake said he would release code for the attack by Aug. 24, putting pressure on manufacturers to get their patches out before then.\nNexus phones are being updated with protection this week and the vast majority of major Android handset makers are following suit, Ludwig said.\nSamsung Vice President Rick Segal acknowledged that his company could not force the telecommunications carriers that buy its devices in bulk to install the fixes and that some might do so only for higher-end users.\n“If it’s your business customers, you’ll push it,” Segal said in an interview. Samsung is the largest maker of Android phones.\nLudwig said many Android security scares were overblown. He added that only about one in 200 Android phones Google can peer into have any potentially harmful applications installed at any point.\nDrake noted that those figures exclude some products, including Fire products from Amazon , which use Android.\nAs with Apple’s iPhones, the biggest security risk comes with apps that are not downloaded from the official online stores of the two companies.\nStolen files from Hacking Team, an Italian company selling eavesdropping tools to government agencies around the world, showed that a key avenue was to convince targets to download legitimate-seeming Android and iPhone apps from imposter websites.\nFirst Published on August 07, 2015 9:01 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:36:50.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
