The rule supplements the CFTC’s proposed rule from October 2014 containing substantive requirements related to the exchange of margin for uncleared swaps (together, the Margin Rules). The Margin Rules apply to SDs and MSPs that do not have a prudential regulator (Covered Swap Entities, or CSEs). Federal banking regulators separately proposed a similar rule that would apply to entities under their regulation. However, the Margin Rules would significantly change the economics of uncleared swaps for “financial end users” that trade with CSEs. What is a “financial end-user”? \n“financial end user” is an entity that is not a CSE but that falls into one of several enumerated categories, including banks and depository institutions, businesses licensed or registered as credit or lending entities, broker-dealers, investment advisers, registered investment companies, private funds, commodity pools, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, futures commission merchants, certain employee benefit plans, insurance companies, entities that raise money for the purpose of investing or trading, and foreign entities that would constitute one of the foregoing if organized under the laws of the United States or any state. \n“financial entity” that is used in the CFTC’s mandatory swap clearing requirement . There, the term includes a catch-all referring to entities “predominantly engaged in activities that are in the business of banking, or in activities that are financial in nature,” as defined in Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act. This catch-all has been particularly challenging and confusing for certain market participants to apply. By contrast, in its Margin Rules the CFTC described specifically the types of entities that it considers “financial end users.” In most circumstances, a “financial entity” would also be a “financial end user”; however, financial market participants should be aware that the terms do not fully align in all cases. For example, smaller community banks and savings institutions with total assets of $10 billion or less are exempted from the CFTC’s definition of “financial entity” but nonetheless would be “financial end users” for the purpose of the Margin Rules. \n“material swaps exposure.” Material swaps exposure exists where an entity and its affiliates have an average daily aggregate notional amount of uncleared swaps (including swaps, security-based swaps, and FX forwards and FX swaps) for June, July and August of the prior year (the Notional Test) that exceeds $3 billion. Significantly, affiliation for these purposes would be defined to be as little as 25 percent ownership or control. \n“affiliates.” As a result, an asset manager may be unable to identify all affiliates of a vehicle if investors’ other investments implicate unknown vehicles for the purpose of the Notional Test. \n“swap” pursuant to the Department of Treasury’s 2012 determination and would not be subject to the Margin Rules generally. \nffect December 1, 2015, irrespective of the notional exposures of the parties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T05:11:06.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
