Still, year-over-year gains amount to 43,719 jobs – a growth rate of 1.5 percent. \nMinnesota’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate ticked up to 4 percent in July, up from 3.9 percent a month earlier. It still falls well short of the 5.9 percent nationwide rate. \nThe leisure and hospitality sector, down 3,700 jobs in July, was the only one to cut more than construction. Trade, transportation and utilities dropped 1,700 positions, while education and health services lost 1,200. Manufacturing outfits lopped off 300 and other services lost 100. \nGovernment, on the other hand, posted 2,700 new jobs in July, outmatching gains in professional and business services – up 1,400 – and financial activities, which added 500 positions. Meanwhile, logging and mining employers tacked on 300 jobs and information added 100. \nCheck back later for updates to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:29:16.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
