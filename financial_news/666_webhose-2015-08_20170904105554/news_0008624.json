The mining firm said it will lay off about 1,480 workers at one of its Zambian copper projects after the reduction in power supply curbed production.\nFirst Quantum's problems were compounded by a fall in copper prices -- down about 18 percent so far this year -- that is denting its revenue at a time of mounting financial pressure for the company, which is consuming cash as its develops its large, open pit Cobre Panama project, Moody's said.
