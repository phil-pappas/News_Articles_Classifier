Germany had raised the prospect of a “time out” lasting at least five years, following a breakdown in trust between euro-zone countries and the Greek government. Even when an acrimonious weekend summit in Brussels ended on July 13th with a tentative plan for a third bail-out, providing up to €86 billion ($96 billion) over three years in return for further austerity and reforms, there was widespread pessimism about whether a more detailed agreement could really be reached. Yet on August 11th the Greek government settled the specific conditions of the rescue with the four institutions representing the interests of creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB), the IMF and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a rescue fund for the euro zone.\nThe new proposals were due to be passed into law by the Greek parliament on August 13th, after The Economist had gone to press. The hope among Greek officials was that euro-zone finance ministers would endorse the deal the following day. That could in turn pave the way for a release of funds from the ESM in time for the Greek government to redeem bonds held by the ECB worth €3.2 billion when they mature on August 20th.\nIn this section The battle of midpoint Yuan thing after another Whom to trust A new contract for growth In jeopardy Asset-rich, cash-poor Third time lucky? Automation angst Reprints\nThis timetable may yet prove too optimistic. The agreement will still have to be ratified by several euro-zone parliaments, including the German Bundestag. Despite the surprisingly swift progress in the negotiations, the German government has struck a cautious tone, arguing that thoroughness is more important than speed. If Germany drags its heels, Greece may need a second emergency loan from a rescue fund backed by the whole of the European Union in order to repay the ECB (it received a first one in mid-July to clear arrears with the IMF and repay another lot of bonds held by the ECB). The question of relieving some of Greece’s huge public debt, to be addressed once the bail-out has been agreed, is another potential pitfall: the IMF has made clear it requires European concessions on this point if it is to join the bail-out later this year.\nIn order to get this far, Greece has already had to legislate two sets of reforms in the past month. These have raised VAT and made minimum pensions payable only at the age of 67. A European directive on dealing with failing banks has been adopted and the independence of the national statistics agency has been reinforced. Judicial delays are also to be tackled.\nThis week’s agreement includes steps to liberalise markets, especially energy. Tax administration is to be overhauled with tougher procedures to deal with taxpayers who are in arrears. A new privatisation fund is being set up, with the objective of eventually raising €50 billion, of which half will go to recapitalise Greek banks, a quarter to pay down debt and the remaining quarter to investment. Privatisation is expected to raise up to €6.4 billion between 2015 and 2017, an ambitious target given that Greece has managed to raise only €3 billion in the past five years.\nDaily dispatches: What news from Athens?\nImportant though such structural reforms may be in improving Greece’s long-term prospects, what matters in the short term is healing a traumatised economy that has slipped back into recession and is fettered by capital controls. One encouraging sign is that the creditors have not imposed overly harsh fiscal targets for this year and next. Greece is expected to run a primary deficit (ie, excluding interest payments) of 0.25% of GDP in 2015 and a surplus of 0.5% in 2016. Another helpful development is an acceptance on the part of euro-zone creditors that attempts to impose a “bail-in” to recapitalise the banks (by converting large deposits into equity) would be wholly counter-productive since this would destroy the working capital of Greece’s small businesses.\nYet even if the hurdles to a full agreement can be surmounted, the outlook for Greece remains precarious. Despite the recent promising developments, the risk of more political upsets remains very real. The decision by Alexis Tsipras, Greece’s prime minister, to accept the bail-out terms has split his party, forcing him to rely upon opposition parties to pass legislation. That may lead to an early election. Chronic political uncertainty was a crucial reason why Greece’s first two bail-outs went wrong. It may also blight the third.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150815_FNP002_0.jpg", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/2015/07/articles/body/greece_580.png"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:17:14.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
