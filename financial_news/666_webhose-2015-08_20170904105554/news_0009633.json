The benchmark index lost 8.2 percent in August, its biggest monthly decline since January 2014.\n\"We had a big recovery last week but it's now reversed so people are taking profits on shares that had a good bounce,\" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.\n\"Japan saw some of the biggest swings last week because it's such a liquid market, which makes it the natural place to go when there's a bit of chaos in Asia. So the last week was spent riding the wave of volatility and now people are starting to have a deeper think about what the fall in China really means for Japan.\"\nData showed Japan's industrial output unexpectedly fell 0.6 percent in July, in a sign that weak overseas demand and high inventories are weighing on production.\n\"Weak demand from China is expected to continue to weigh on Japan's production going forward so China worries may persist,\" said Masaru Hamasaki, head of market & investment information department at Amundi Japan.\nInvestors are eagerly awaiting Tuesday's release of surveys on manufacturing sector activity from the United States and China.\nData on U.S. auto sales and non-farm payrolls, due later in the week, will also be keenly watched for signs of the kind of economic strength that would support a September rate-hike by the Federal Reserve.\nAdvantest Corp and Japan Display each fell more than 4 percent after being excluded from the MSCI Japan Index along with Chiyoda Corp, which fell 2.6 percent.\nChina-related shares, such as steelmakers and machinery makers underperformed the market. Among them, JFE Holdings fell 3.3 percent while Komatsu dropped 2.9 percent and Daikin Industries 2.3 percent.\nThe broader Topix fell 0.8 percent to 1,537.05 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 lost 0.9 percent to 13,813.71.
