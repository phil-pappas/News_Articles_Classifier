The multimillion-pound acquisition target is a venture capital-backed provider of technology to advertisers and publishers that aims to make online advertising less intrusive and more effective for premium brands. \nNews Corp has been seeking bolt-on businesses to bolster its digital publishing efforts. \nSpeculation has surrounded Ms Brooks’ return to business life. News Corp confirmed last autumn that she had visited Mr Murdoch at its New York headquarters as she “explores and considers her professional future”. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) was cleared of all charges in June following a trial alongside Andy Coulson. The former News of the World editor and communications chief for David Cameron was found guilty of phone hacking and sentenced to 18 months in prison for conspiracy to hack phones. \nConfirmation Ms Brooks is operating in the background for News Corp will fuel speculation that she could eventually take a more high profile role. News UK, formerly News International, is expected to announce an executive shake-up later this year that could provide an opportunity for her to step out of the shadows, industry sources suggested. \nA News Corp spokesman said: “We don’t comment on rumours and speculation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T22:57:41.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
