A London jury unanimously found the former trader at UBS Group AG and Citigroup Inc. rigged the interest-rate benchmark used to value more than $350 trillion of loans and securities.\nThe SFO has struggled to retain credibility amid a number of botched cases and a dwindling budget since the financial crisis. It narrowly avoided being merged into a larger crime fighting body in 2011, an idea floated again by the government last year.\nGreen opened an investigation into Libor at the start of his tenure in 2012, reversing a decision by his predecessor not to take on the matter. A few months later, he told lawmakers the agency would be judged by its success on Libor, a message he reiterated in an October interview with Bloomberg, when he described the Libor case as a “watershed” moment.\nHayes’s conviction “must be a considerable relief to both the SFO and its current director,” said Robert Rhodes, a London-based trial lawyer. Had he been acquitted, Rhodes said, “it would have likely raised serious questions about the judgment of those responsible for bringing prosecutions at the SFO.”\nRamping Up Beginning in 2013, the SFO started ramping up its raids, tripling them between April of that year and March 2014, according to London-based law firm Pinsent Masons LLP.\nThe initiative followed several years of major reversals.\nIn 2012, a London court ruled a prosecutor presented “unfair and unjustified” evidence to obtain search warrants in a probe of property tycoons Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz. The brothers had extended the loans to Iceland’s Kaupthing Bank Hf before it collapsed in 2008.\nAnother prominent case collapsed in 2013. The SFO dropped its prosecution of British businessman Victor Dahdaleh, who was accused of paying about 40 million pounds ($62.3 million) in bribes to senior executives of a Bahrain-owned aluminum company.\nThe abrupt dismissal came five weeks into a two-month trial, when the prosecutor said there was no realistic chance of a conviction.\nLimited Progress Last year, the HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate said the SFO hadn’t done enough to improve the quality of its investigative work.\nThe inspectorate assessed the abilities of SFO staff and guidance on disclosures after concluding it made “limited progress” on areas it was told to fix in 2012.\nA spokeswoman for the SFO didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment by phone.\nCrucial Result With the victory in the Hayes trial and the trader’s long prison sentence behind him, Green will soon have the opportunity to improve his record.\nAt least two more Libor trials remain in the pipeline before the end of Green’s four-year term next April.\n“The conviction is a crucial result for the SFO,” said Stephen Pollard, a London lawyer at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP. “It may have an impact on the outlook of the agency’s future. At the very least it might buy the prosecutor more time to prove itself.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T08:25:37.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
