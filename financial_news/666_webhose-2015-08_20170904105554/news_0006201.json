What are the options? \nMy father died at the beginning of the year with an estate valued at around £1m made up of property, shares and savings. I'm my father's executor and one of the main beneficiaries, along with my siblings. The IHT is now due but probate hasn't been granted and so I don't yet have access to his money. Is this right? How am I supposed to pay the tax if I can't get my hands on the money? CR, by email \nEstates attract inheritance tax by being worth more than the allowance (or nil rate band). An individual's allowance is £325,000 and a married couple get twice this allowance - £650,000 - applying at the death of the second spouse. \nAbove that level, estates are taxed at 40pc. \nTax is due at the end of the sixth month after someone's death. If someone dies in January, tax is due by July 31. \nBut what you describe is normal - even if it seems to defy logic. \nWhen someone dies, the executor values the estate and reports to HMRC. The tax should then be paid when due. Once it has received the tax, HMRC issues a receipt which is required as part of granting probate. \nOnly once probate is granted can the assets be distributed. \n• New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) inheritance tax rules: we answer your questions \nAs Emma Myers, Head (Other OTC: HEDYY - news ) of Wills and Probate at Saga Legal Services explained: \"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's a catch-22: tax needs to be paid; but the money from the estate isn't available to pay the tax until the tax is paid.\" \nGary Rycroft, a solicitor and member of the Law Society's Wills committee, said: \"The Government understandably wants to get its share before the assets are distributed. But it does create cashflow problems for executors and families.\" \n= What you can do to settle the bill = \nWhere the estate includes cash savings sufficient to settle the bill, the executor can set up a payment directly from the bank holding the cash to HMRC. \"This is the norm where there is enough cash,\" said Tina Riches, partner at accountant and financial services group Smith & Williamson. \n\"A 'direct payment scheme' means the money goes straight to HMRC, rather than through the executor or any other party.\" \nWhere there isn't enough money, executors can either pay out of their own pockets (if they can) and recoup the money from the estate after probate - or take a loan from a bank. \n\"Banks are usually geared up to offer loans in these circumstances,\" said Ms Riches. \"The banks can satisfy themselves that there are assets.\" \n= What happens where much of the estate is made up of property or shares? = \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) and property, along with the rest of someone's estate, are valued at the point of the owner's death. Tax, where due, is calculated on that amount. \nWith property, you can elect to pay the tax in instalments. \nGary Rycroft said: \"It's not widely known but IHT on real property can be paid by instalments over a period of up to ten years. \n\"So if, for instance, you want to retain land or buildings you've inherited you might choose the instalment route as a way of making the tax more affordable.\" Interest applies to the outstanding tax. \nWhere much of the estate is in the form of shares executors face similar difficulties particularly as they can’t sell the shares without a Grant of Probate. \n\"In one case I dealt with a large estate where almost all the value was in shares,\" Mr Rycroft said. \n\"We negotiated a special arrangement with HMRC whereby the executors pledged to inform HMRC of any share sale and make the payment of IHT the priority in terms of distributions. On that basis they agreed to allowing a Grant of Probate to be obtained 'on tick', as it were.\" \nBut he stressed this kind of one-off arrangement would have to be agreed with the Revenue on a case by case basis (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T14:50:56.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
