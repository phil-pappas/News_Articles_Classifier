This week, outflows from high-yield bond funds totaled $820 million after $1.31 billion in the prior week.\nAnd yields on bonds in the high-yield sector excluding energy and mining companies broke above 6% for the first time this year, according to the report. Bond yields rise when prices fall and vice versa.\nWith defaults gaining ground, a potential interest-rate increase around the corner and a global commodity rout weighing on energy and mining companies , the high-yield bond market has suffered in the past few weeks.\nYear to date, high-yield funds have recorded outflows equal to 0.7% of assets under management. In high-yield bond ETFs the outflows have amounted to 5% of assets under management. That is in contrast with all fixed income, which have seen total year-to-date inflows of 1.3% of assets under management, according to the report.\nNew issuance in the high-yield market slowed in July, with just $10 billion in new paper hitting the market, the lowest monthly volume since December, according to S&P Capital IQ.\nMeanwhile, the commodity rout has pushed bond yields in the energy sector higher since mid-July. That suggests that investors are worried about risk, and are demanding to be better compensated for it.\nThe high-yield bond market consists of companies with weak credit ratings, around 13-14% of which are energy companies. As oil prices plunged in the third week of July, investors had already been unloading positions in companies directly affected by low commodity prices.\nThe stress has seeped from the energy and materials sector into the broader high-yield market, the analysts said.\nBank of America Yields in the high-yield sector excluding energy and mining companies have been trading around year-high levels throughout July. Fitch Ratings increased its 2015 U.S. high-yield default outlook to 2.5% to 3% from 1.5% to 2% this week, reflecting the impact that “languishing oil prices, weak coal demand and burdensome regulation have had on energy and metals/mining companies during the first half of the year.”\nOil slumped nearly 20% last month due to the dollar’s strength and faltering demand from China.\nWhile the default rate for high yield remains low overall, in the energy sector it has exceeded 5%, which nearly matches the peak level reached during the recession, according to Bank of America.\nFor investors, high yields don't always turn into high returns.\nThe BofAML High Yield Index was on pace to return 3.23% for the year at end July. That represented less than half the index’s yield of 6.65%.\n“Strategists frequently take the easy way out in their year-ahead outlooks by predicting that the high-yield market will ‘earn the coupon’,” Marty Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, said in a research note for S&P Capital IQ.\nThe coupon refers to the interest payment that investors receive on their bonds. Because outflows reduce the net-asset value of funds, investors’ real returns could end up being much lower than the yield on the index.\n“At this stage, 2015 is shaping up as another year that makes false prophets” of those who made the assumption that returns would equal yield levels, said Fridson.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T01:46:29.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
