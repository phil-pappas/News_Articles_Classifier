Advertising Print This Post \nA recent addition to SpotOption’s lists of features is the ability for end-user binary options customers to have bitcoin denominated accounts. With it, trade sizes and payouts become denominated in binary options instead of the typical US dollar, Euro, British pound or Japanese yen. \nBecoming the first broker to offer customers binary options trading with a bitcoin denominated account is Montenegro registered BitPlutos. In addition to bitcoin based trading, BitPlutos also supports the virtual currency for deposits and withdrawals. Along with bitcoins, customers issue deposits and withdrawals with fiat currency using Neteller, Skrill or bank transfers, which are converted to and from bitcoins for the funding. \nIn regards to whether bitcoin support for deposits and withdrawals is another feature that SpotOption enabled, or is being handled solely by BitPlutos, Finance Magnates reached out to the binary options platform provider which as of publishing time didn’t provide that answer or comments on overall end-user interest for bitcoin binary options. \nOverall, the news relates that bitcoins continue to be an area of interest among binary options brand operators even as volatility in the currency has declined. After prices had spiked above $1000 at the end of 2013, it led to an array of binary options brokers adding bitcoin trading on their platform. However, according to broker sources, demand for bitcoin trading fell as volatility fell. Got a news tip?
