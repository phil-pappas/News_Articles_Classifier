Serious conditions such as those just do not pop into the consciousness of young, healthy consumers who are planning their finances and risk cover, but they should.\n\"When people experience a traumatic medical event – such as a cancer diagnosis or heart attack – there is often a long road to recovery and restoration of health,\" says Megan Beer, AMP's acting group executive, insurance and superannuation.\nResearch shows continuing to work has significant benefits while in recovery, Beer says, pointing out that trauma insurance is suitable for people with significant debts and dependencies. \"When the unexpected happens, trauma insurance provides the much needed funds to assist not only in recovery, but also provides funds to secure the long-term security of a family affected by illness.\"\nWhile many insured will make a full recovery, some may find their ability to earn has been curtailed, she says, and the right cover can provide a lump sum for future outgoings. Critically for the judges, AMP's policy delivers smart cover that adequately compensates you for your condition.\n Finalists: ANZ OnePath Trauma Comprehensive; AIA Vitality Priority Protection Crisis Recovery\nBEST INCOME PROTECTION POLICY WINNER: TAL Accelerated Income Protection Premier\nWhat the Rice Warner judges said: \" TAL's policy offers a strong balance of features and price backed up by a solid financial institution. In particular it offers excellent pricing across a wide spectrum of occupations, benefits, waiting periods and ages.\"\nDebilitating illness or injury are too dreadful to ponder. That's the view of most Australians, who hope for the best and save on insurance cover they \"don't need\". But 25 per cent of Australians will be disabled for more than three months during their working life, says insurer TAL, which took the top honour for income protection cover.\nThe judges highlighted its excellent total and partial disability definition, along with the product being well targeted to workers' broad spectrum of needs. Adequate income cover provides more than just a cheque at claim time, says Gavin Teichner, TAL's general manager, individual life. \"Income Protection Premier has a range of benefits included to help rehabilitate through illness or injury and also offers critical illness cover on their [customers'] own children at no extra cost.\"\nIn the past five years, the insurer has paid almost $370 million in income protection claims and Income Protection Premier has the option to cover additional critical illness events, payable as an extra lump sum.\n\"Our ability to earn an income is one of our biggest assets and we must protect it,\" Teichner says. \"A big misconception around income protection is that it's too expensive … but there are ways to address affordability issues, such as setting it up through superannuation – and it's actually tax deductible.\"\nFinalists: ANZ OnePath OneCare Income Secure Comprehensive; BT Protection Plan Income Protection Plus\nBEST TERM/TPD POLICY WINNER: AIA Vitality Priority Protection Life Cover TPD\nWhat the Rice Warner judges said: \"An excellent score for a sharp price and excellent features backed by a strong financial institution.\"\nIt is the families of the insured who can tell you why life and total and permanent disability cover is so important, because the person who listened to sage advice at one point in his or her life and took out a policy most likely will not be able to convince you.\nThe random events that may spell financial doom are deflected when robust insurance is in place.\nThe judges placed AIA Australia at the top for its pricing across occupations and ages, and noted its flexibility regarding definitions. The comprehensive list of benefits and options was also noted and the Vitality initiative, which reduces premiums and adds benefits for policyholders who make healthy choices, was also singled out.\nFinalists: MLC Insurance Life Cover/TPD Rider; AMP Elevate Insurance Life/TPD Rider", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/blue_ribbon_two_hype/index.html", "https://www.amp.com.au/personal/insurance/products/insurance/trauma-insurance", "http://www.aia.com.au/en/individuals/products-services/priority-protection-express/priority_protection_express.html", "https://www.tal.com.au/personal/life-insurance/income-protection", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-20T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:00:27.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
