The increase in demand in air cargo markets, which began in summer 2014, continued in the first part of 2015, but demand slackened in the second quarter. There was an improved contribution from our subsidiary and associated companies.”\nThe number of revenue passengers carried by Cathay Pacific and Dragonair in the first half of 2015 grew 8.8% to 16.8 million, and ASKs increased 6.4% year-on-year. Passenger load factor was up 2.3 percentage points to 85.9%. Passenger yield, however, was down 9.2% for the period.\n“Strong competition, a significant reduction in fuel surcharges, foreign currency movements and the fact that a higher proportion of passengers were connecting through Hong Kong put downward pressure on yield,” Slosar said. “Demand on regional routes was strong, particularly in economy class. There was strong economy class demand on long-haul routes. But premium class demand, though robust on short-haul routes, was weaker than expected on some long-haul routes.”\nCargo up, yield down\nCargo and mail carried by the two carriers increased 8% to 868,000 tonnes, with the cargo and mail load factor showing a marginal (0.9 percentage points) improvement year-on-year to 64.1%. Cargo and mail yield, however, declined 11.1% during the half year.\nSlosar said that a sustained increase in cargo demand during the first few months of 2015 slackened in the second quarter, bringing the group’s cargo revenue down 2.5% for the period to HK$11.4 billion. He blamed “strong competition, overcapacity in the industry and a significant reduction in fuel surcharges” for the collapse in cargo and mail yield.\n“We expect our cargo business to be stable in the second half of 2015,” Slosar said. “We expect more competition on our transpacific routes but intra-Asia shipments traffic will continue to grow. Market conditions will continue to fluctuate … [but] … we are well placed to take advantage of any increase in demand.”\nLooking forward, Slosar said, “We expect our business to do well in the remainder of 2015. Our financial position remains strong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T07:21:57.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
