Supplied by James Dunn The enormous expansion in Australia's liquefied natural gas industry has borne fruit; with the first export shipment of LNG bound for Asia leaving the central Queensland port of Gladstone in January, carrying a cargo worth $50 million.\nThe shipment was the first return on at least $60 billion spent on building the three export LNG projects based in Gladstone. The QCLNG project – led by BG Group, the former British Gas – was the first out of the blocks, becoming the world's first project to turn gas from coal seams into LNG. The Santos-led GLNG and Origin Energy's APLNG projects will follow later this year.\nBy 2018, the three Gladstone LNG plants could hit full production with 360 tankers a year carrying cargo out of Gladstone. According to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), Australia's LNG industry is well placed to capture a major share of the growth in global demand for the fuel: by 2018, 13 new export 'trains' are expected to come online, almost quadrupling Australia's international gas sales.\nThis is slated to deliver significant benefits to the economy. APPEA says one of the LNG projects now being developed will provide up to $90 billion in government revenue over its 20-year working life.\nRoy Krzywosinkski, managing director of Chevron Australia, told the audience at the recent APPEA conference that the growth of the magnitude of the Australian LNG industry was the biggest energy industry expansion, anywhere. Across the life of Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, the contribution to Australia's gross domestic product is expected be about $500 billion – equivalent to the size of the New South Wales economy.\nMore than 80 per cent of the projects' spending will go to Australian suppliers, delivering tens of millions of dollars to local businesses, creating a still-larger \"multiplier\" effect across the economy.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:55:38.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
