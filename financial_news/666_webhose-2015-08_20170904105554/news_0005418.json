Core inflation hit a five-month high. r.reuters.com/pec24w\nEconomists in a Reuters poll had expected inflation to stay at zero, while some had even been forecasting a drop back to the -0.1 percent level hit in April.\nBritain's 10-year bond yields edged up after the data, erasing an earlier fall, while German yields -- the euro zone benchmark -- followed slowly behind.\nThe concerns over the weakening inflation outlook have ratcheted up expectations of further central bank stimulus in the euro zone, while they could also scupper plans for Britain and the United States to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. But such prospects have taken the back seat on Tuesday after the UK inflation data.\n\"The UK data would be the main thing to highlight today,\" said Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING. \"The rise in yields makes sense with the core CPI number going up.\"\nGerman 10-year Bund yields rose 2 basis points to 0.65 percent. Spanish and Italian 10-year yields rose 4-5 bps to 1.98 percent and 1.80 percent, respectively.\nPortuguese yields rose 9 bps to 2.47 percent.\nAlso pushing yields higher on Tuesday, data in the United States showed housing starts have now been above a one million-unit pace for four straight months and in July they rose to a near eight-year high.\nFed Chair Janet Yellen said in July that the economy faced constraints from an underperforming housing market.\nGREECE STABILITY\nConcerns around the stability of the Greek government also weighed on peripheral bonds even though Athens is very close to clinching an 86 billion euro bailout deal.\nThe Greek government appears likely to call a confidence vote following a rebellion among lawmakers from the ruling Syriza party over the country's new bailout deal, a move that could lead to fresh elections.\n\"At the moment we haven't seen polls that split out the left platform from the rest of Syriza, so it's very hard to gauge the risks here,\" said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.\nGreek yields were 14 bps higher at 9.29 percent , pausing after a sharp rally in the last week.\nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble -- one of the toughest negotiators in heated talks with Athens last month -- has given a strong backing to the new deal.\nGermany's lower parliamentary house is due to vote on the aid package on Wednesday, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to reassure sceptical lawmakers that the IMF would take part in the deal -- something Schaeuble called \"indispensable\".\nIMF chief Christine Lagarde, who has been pressing euro zone countries to provide Athens with \"significant\" debt relief, has said the IMF will wait until October to decide whether to participate.
