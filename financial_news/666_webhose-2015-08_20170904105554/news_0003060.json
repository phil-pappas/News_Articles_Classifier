Rural demand for gold accounts for nearly two-thirds of India’s total.\nIn the first half of 2015, Indian demand fell 7 percent from a year before to 346.2 tonnes, led by a 19 percent drop in investment demand, WGC data showed.\nBetter returns from the stock market, a belief that gold prices would fall further and curbs on banks’ selling of gold coins squeezed investment demand and the trend is likely to continue in the second half, Somasundaram said.\nHe estimated total demand in 2015 would rise nearly 11 percent to about 900 tonnes, anticipating 554 tonnes in the second half, an increase of nearly 26 percent from a year before due to lower prices.\nIndian gold prices fell to their lowest level in four years in July, although that failed to produce the long queues outside gold showrooms that were seen when prices fell in 2013.\n“Many people are waiting for prices to come down further. If prices move up, these people will move in and stock up quickly. It will accelerate the buying,” Somasundaram said.\nSpot gold touched a three-week high of $1,126 an ounce on Thursday as a weaker Chinese yuan kept equities under pressure, encouraging investors to seek safe-haven assets.\nHigher imports by banks and other trading companies pushed gold prices in India to a discount over London prices in May and June, making smuggling less attractive. In 2014 smuggling networks had brought in an estimated 175 tonnes of gold.\nSuch imports had come down “dramatically”, Somasundaram said. “The incentive to smuggle is very low.”\n 13, 2015 10:08 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:26:23.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
