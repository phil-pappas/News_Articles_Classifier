Photo: Bloomberg\nAustralia's spend on mineral exploration slid by a third in just 12 months to its lowest level in nine years as miners continue to hammer down costs and expenditure .\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says the national spend on exploration fell 33 per cent year on year to just $322 million in the June quarter, led by $30 million of spending evaporating in Western Australia.\nVeteran minerals economist Richard Schodde said one of the key takeaways from the data was that while the total spend declined by a third, the number of metres drilled in the nation's exploration efforts was only down 9 per cent.\n\"That suggests we are getting a lot more out of the dollars that go into drilling as costs come down,\" Mr Schodde said.\nAdvertisement \"It's a good-news story. We haven't taken our foot off the accelerator in terms of drilling activity even though the industry is in distress.\"\nMr Schodde, managing director of MinEx Consulting, said while the quarterly results seemed dire at first glance, they also revealed slight green shoots in sectors such as gold, where expenditure increased 8 per cent year-on-year to $112.4 million.\n\"The silver lining is drilling activity is not as bad as it looks, we seem to be moving towards new projects, which is good for the longer term, and there are some commodities in favour like gold, with the dead weight of iron ore really just pulling down the entire sector,\" Mr Schodde said.\nJust $77 million was spent searching for iron ore during quarter, compared to a peak of $336 million spent three years ago.\n\"It is an echo of the collapse in iron ore prices filtering through to exploration spend. And it is no surprise Western Australia, which is the home of much of our iron ore, has been given a big whack because of that,\" he said.\nOne of the key indicators the industry observes is the quarterly spend and metres drilled on searching for new deposits, rather than around known deposits, in the hope it will result in the next generation of mines.\nIn the June quarter, the national spend on \"greenfields\" exploration around new deposits ticked up 25 per cent but remained down year-on-year at $114 million compared to $144 million in June 2014.\nHowever, metres drilled on new deposits was up for both the quarter and the year at 438,000 metres, again illustrating companies taking advantage of the declining cost of exploration.\nAssociation of Mining and Exploration Companies chief executive Simon Bennison said the evidence of the impact of lower drilling costs was good news for the industry but most companies continued to face \"the same old difficulties\".\n\"Where commodity prices are at the moment it is obviously pretty difficult,\" he said.\n\"Some of the drillers aren't charging for mobilisation or demobilisation and are willing to go much greater distances on the back of that, and that's helping a number of companies. But a lot of companies are still being very careful about their costs and cash reserves, so greenfields exploration is still struggling to see much of a bounce.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/metals/iron-ore-to-head-back-below-us50-as-australia-expands-supply-20150831-gjbehj", "http://www.afr.com/news/economy/wa-chills-as-bhp-billiton-rio-tinto-and-fortescue-cut-20b-spending-20150830-gjb0z8"], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:21:30.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
