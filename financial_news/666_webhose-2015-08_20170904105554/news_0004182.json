Photo: Rex Features Comments \nInterest rates are expected to rise in the new year and savers are hopeful that the paltry returns being offered on cash accounts will improve. \nBut there’s no guarantee that banks and building societies will pass on a rate rise to all customers, and those that do may choose to only offer a fraction of the increase to savers. \nIt may be worthwhile considering putting some of your savings into a tracker account. \nTrackers pay less than the best fixed-rate accounts on the market, but you’re guaranteed to see a rate rise as soon as the Bank of England increases Bank Rate from its historic low of 0.5pc. \nUnlike fixed-rate savings accounts, trackers promise to pay a set percentage of interest above Bank Rate. \nHalifax’s online tracker bond, for example, has an 18-month term and promises to pay 1.43pc above Bank Rate on balances of £500 and above. For those with more than £50,000 in savings, the rate rises to 1.48pc. \nInvestec Bank has a two-year “double base” product, which promises to pay double the Bank Rate plus 0.6pc. If interest rates follow expectations and rise to 0.75pc in the new year, the account would pay 2.1pc. Balances must be between £25,000 and £2m. \nCambridge Building Society and Kent Reliance both have two-year tracker Isas that promise to pay 1pc above Bank Rate, while Aldermore has an instant access account that pays 0.5pc above until at least May 2016. \nIn comparison, the best two-year fixed-rate account is Secure Trust Bank's 2.38pc bond, while Leeds Building Society this week launched a market-leading three-year fixed rate cash Isa paying 2.3pc. \nThe best variable rate savings products \nProvider", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T12:56:49.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
