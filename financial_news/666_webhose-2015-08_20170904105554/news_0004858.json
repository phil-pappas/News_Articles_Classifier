Will that transfer the bug?\" the company replied: \"Re: little ones, try to not put water in mouths\". \nMartin Padley, the chief scientific officer for United Utilities, said: \"We apologise for the inconvenience but the health of our customers is absolutely paramount.\" \nThose affected are being urged to tell elderly relatives and neighbours about the water warning. \nAccording to United Utilities, cryptosporidium causes a gastrointestinal illness called cryptosporidiosis. \nThe illness lasts from a week to three weeks in healthy individuals, but \"can be prolonged and life threatening in severely immunocompromised individuals\", the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T11:29:12.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
