Fairfax by Lisa Murray Trade Minister Andrew Robb says the recent falls on Chinese stock markets could see money flow into Australia as investors look for a safe haven.\nMr Robb, who is leading a trade delegation to Hong Kong and mainland China this week, said he was not surprised about the sharp declines on the Shanghai stock market, which has fallen 22 per cent in the past four days.\n\"Everyone has been anticipating some sort of correction up here so I don't think it's a surprise now that it's happened,\" he told Hong Kong radio station RTHK on Wednesday morning.\n\"What I think will happen out of this correction is that even more money will be looking for a safe haven in Australia,\" he said.\n\"My expectation is that this will accelerate the level of investment inquiries coming into Australia across all sorts of areas of activity.\"\nAfter a volatile trading session, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 per cent to 2988.76 on Wednesday morning, as investors scrambled to digest the impact of an interest rate cut announced by China's central bank late Tuesday.\nThe People's Bank of China also lowered the banks' reserve requirement ratio in a bid to boost economic activity by pumping liquidity into the banking sector.\nInitially the market rose 1.2 per cent but reversed those gains quickly as investors remain concerned about China's economic slow-down.\n Asked how the weaker Chinese economy was affecting Australia, Mr Robb said: \"so far trade is just continuing to growâ€¦. in a very significant way.\"\nHe cited the example of meat exports which had risen from 60,000 tonnes three years ago, to 260,000 tonnes last year, making China the country's third biggest market.\nHe said the performance of China's stock markets was \"not necessarily mirroring what's happening in the real economy.\"\nMr Robb said China's decision to devalue the Yuan earlier this month was also not a big concern for Australia.\n\"It's all a function of confidence and whether it's the start of something much bigger but that's not our expectation,\" he said.\n\"We've come off the back of many years of a wonderful mining and energy boom and we're now in the low part of it so a lot of that revenue and activity has slowed down and the exchange rate has come back accordingly. We're now down 30 per cent on where we were 18 months ago and I can tell you it's a huge driver of activity across the rest of the economy. Another two or three points won't do our exporters any harm whatsoever.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:09:39.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
