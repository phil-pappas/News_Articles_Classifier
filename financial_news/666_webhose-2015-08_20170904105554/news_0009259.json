GM plans to export Buick Envision vehicles from its Chinese plant to the U.S by the end of 2016, per media reports. This will make General Motors the first automaker to import vehicles from China for sale in the U.S. The company initiated production of Envision in China in 2014.Per the reports, the Buick brand will also be shifting the production of the compact Verano sedan from Michigan to China by late 2016. In addition, General Motors will shift the production of the mid-size Regal sedan from Canada to either China or Europe in 2017. \nAlso, the compact Cascada convertible will be imported from Europe starting early next year and the compact Envision crossover from China in late 2016. Cascada was launched earlier this year at the Detroit auto show. The sub-compact Buick Encore crossover, which is currently imported from Korea, is also expected to be produced in China soon.However, General Motors will continue with the production of two of Buick's future U.S. models in North America, namely the mid-sized LaCrosse sedan and the large Enclave crossover. The LaCrosse will be redesigned next spring and the production will be shifted to Hamtramck, MI. The Enclave will also be redesigned in early 2017 but the production will continue in Lansing, MI.General Motors’ Buick brand enjoys a huge market in China.
