We welcome approaches from anyone with inside information on all our cases including this one - we can be contacted through our secure reporting channel, which can be accessed via the SFO website.\" \nThe company said: \"Soma Oil & Gas can confirm that it has been informed by the Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) that it is investigating an allegation that has been made against the Company. Soma Oil & Gas is confident that there is no basis to the allegation and it is co-operating fully with the SFO to answer it's queries.\" \n\"Soma Oil & Gas has always conducted its activities in a completely lawful and ethical manner and expects this matter to be resolved in the near future.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T15:56:49.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
