The seller could reap in excess of $1 billion from the sale. \nThe drug is used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, most notably multiple sclerosis. This type of affliction occurs when the body's immune system begins attacking healthy cells. \nIn a series of milestone payments, Novartis will pay $300 million upfront at the closing of the deal, $200 million subject to the start of a phase 3 multiple sclerosis study conducted by Novartis, and contingent payments of up to $534 million if other development milestones are hit. Additionally, Novartis will be obligated to pay royalties of up to 12% to GlaxoSmithKline on sales of the drug in autoimmune indications. \nIn its press release trumpeting the sale, GlaxoSmithKline said that in the wake of the divestment, it will \"continue to focus on progressing our pipeline in core therapy areas including HIV, oncology, vaccines, cardiovascular, immuno-inflammation, and respiratory diseases.\" For its part, Novartis said in its own press release that it \"is pleased to further reinforce our commitment to neuroscience and to add an exciting new treatment to our strong MS portfolio.\" \nThe new deal comes several months after the two companies agreed to a $20 billion asset swap, in which GlaxoSmithKline traded its oncology operations for Novartis' vaccine unit. Additionally, they agreed to form a joint venture focused on consumer healthcare products. \nThe move feels like a sensible one for the two companies. It fits in with GlaxoSmithKline's ambitions to reduce reliance on innovative treatments, while adding another drug to Novartis' autoimmune portfolio. At the moment, we can probably consider the deal a win-win. \nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed -- and if you act soon, it could make you rich.
