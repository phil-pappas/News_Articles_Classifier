Photo: Patrick Scala\nJB Hi-Fi expects sales growth to accelerate in 2016 as the consumer electronics retailer capitalises on the buoyant housing market by adding small appliances to existing stores.\nJB Hi-Fi reported a better-than-expected 6.3 per cent increase in net profit to $136.5 million in 2015 as strong sales of appliances and mobile phones offset weakness in software.\nSales for the 12 months ended June 30 rose 4.8 per cent to $3.65 billion, beating expectations, and chief executive Richard Murray expects sales to grow 5.4 per cent to $3.85 billion in 2016 as the company opens six new stores and converts 16 existing stores to the JB Hi-Fi HOME format, which includes large and small home appliances.\nMr Murray revealed that JB Hi-Fi would introduce small appliances into JB Hi-Fi's existing stores in an attempt to grab a bigger share of the $4.6 billion home appliances market.\nJB Hi-Fi's move comes a week after rival Dick Smith unveiled plans to introduce small appliances into 100 Dick Smith stores over the next five months under a sub-brand, ConnectedHome.\nMr Murray said small appliances had been installed in four JB Hi-Fi stores to date, with pleasing results, and another 14 stores would range small appliances by November 2015.\n\"The rollout of small appliances to our existing store network is a natural progression of our proven home appliances strategy,\" Mr Murray said.\n\"The home appliances market in Australia is circa $4.6 billion, larger than many of the other categories JB HI-FI operates in, and presents a significant opportunity for the company as it leverages the strength and trust in the JB HI-FI brand.\"\n\"By leveraging our strong heritage in innovation and technology, we see our continued expansion into home appliances and ultimately the connected home as a significant opportunity for JB in the future, he said.\nAnalysts say JB Hi-Fi's new HOME appliances format is delivering double-digit sales growth, fuelled by the strong housing market, although the cost of converting stores is pushing up the retailer's cost of doing business.\nJB Hi-Fi's net profit result beat consensus forecasts of about $131 million and exceeded the company's $127 million-to-$131 million guidance.\nSame-store sales growth surged 7.4 per cent in the second half after a weaker first half, taking annual same-store sales growth to 2.9 per cent.\nJB Hi-Fi also opened five new stores, taking its network to 187 stores. It expects to open six stores in 2016 and maintained its stated target for 214 stores over time.\nJB Hi-Fi increased its final dividend by 2¢ to 31¢ a share, fully franked, taking the full year payout to 90¢ a share vs 84¢. The final dividend is payable September 11.\nThe retailer also announced it would buy back $15.2 million of its shares to offset the dilutionary impact of shares issued as part of the employee share options scheme.\nMore to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T02:52:17.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
