What we don't have is a political agreement.\" \nThe talks between ministers and the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism aim to finalise the list of new reforms required of the Greek government in exchange for a lifeline of what officials in Athens Tuesday said was \"around 85 billion\" euros ($93.8 billion). \nThe deadline for Greece to reach an agreement on its third bailout is August 20, when it must repay 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. \nGerman investor sentiment meanwhile dropped this month owing to nagging geopolitical uncertainty clouding the outlook for Europe's top economy, a leading survey found on Tuesday. \nThe widely watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute sank 4.7 points to 25.0 points this month, ZEW said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T17:36:10.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
