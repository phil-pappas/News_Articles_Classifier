Here’s my strategy for playing the ongoing meltdown. Follow @Kiplinger \nJust a little more than a year ago, oil fetched more than $100 a barrel, and the fear was that the price would rise even higher. Now, the price of a barrel of oil has plunged to $42, and Wall Street is awash in predictions that the price could stay low for years because of abundant supplies and global economic weakness, particularly in China, which curtails demand. See Also: 8 Energy Stocks That Could Make You Rich \nMarkets, as anyone who lived through the tech bubble and subsequent bust knows, can go to extremes—in both directions. And calling a bottom is every bit as difficult as predicting a top. But it’s obvious that the stocks of companies connected to energy are a lot cheaper than they were a year ago—about 30% cheaper, based on Standard & Poor’s Energy index. That makes this a favorable time to consider the sector. \nBut one group within the energy sector that you should not jump into is the one that has been hit the hardest: companies involved in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Many of these companies, especially in the high-cost shale oil business, took on too much debt. Financially stronger firms will buy out some companies, and others will go out of business.

Rowe Price New Era (symbol PRNEX ) is managed by Shawn Driscoll, who was one of a handful of energy analysts who saw the sell-off in energy stocks coming. He believes now that natural resources are still in the early innings of a major, multiyear decline. So this fund, which used to invest almost entirely in stocks of commodity producers, now also holds a sizable percentage of assets in companies that buy commodities, such as chemical and packaging companies. \nDespite those defensive moves, the fund lost 24.6% over the past 12 months, which is about two percentage points less than the average natural resources sector fund. Expenses are 0.65% annually. (All returns, share prices and related data are as of August 18.) \nVanguard Energy Index Admiral ( VENAX ) or Vanguard Energy ETF ( VDE ) is a superb choice for investors who prefer an indexed approach. The two are identical except that the former is a mutual fund, the latter an exchange-traded fund. Each charges fees of just 0.12% annually. They provide exposure to a market-capitalization-weighted index of U.S. energy firms. As such, energy giants such as ExxonMobil ( XOM , $77.90) and Chevron ( CVX , $83.44) dominate the funds, representing 32% of each fund’s assets. Both funds have surrendered 29% over the past 12 months. \nIf you prefer to invest in individual stocks, start with the industry’s big kahuna, ExxonMobil. Exxon has a long record as a superior capital allocator. It has resisted overpaying for assets during boom times, preferring to pick them up at better prices during busts. The stock, which yields 3.7%, trades at 1.0 times sales per share and just 9.0 times cash flow per share. (Cash flow is earnings plus noncash charges, such as depreciation; for many energy companies, the price-to-cash flow ratio is a more useful measure of value than the price-earnings ratio because results of many energy companies typically include large noncash items.)
