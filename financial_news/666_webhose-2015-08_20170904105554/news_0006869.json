Earlier it had fallen as much as 5%, sparking losses in a number of Asian markets.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.1%, while Japan’s Nikkei closed 1.6% lower.\nDespite the late gains in China, the downbeat tone persisted in Europe. The Stoxx Europe 600 was 0.9% lower in early trade, wiping out the previous session’s small rally.\nGermany’s DAX, packed with exporters highly sensitive to Chinese demand, fell 1.1%.\nLater Wednesday, minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest meeting should offer clues on the likely timing of the first interest-rate rise since the financial crisis.\nWith trading volumes lighter than usual during the summer holiday season, stock markets are vulnerable to “what should be familiar concerns over Chinese growth and U.S. Fed policy,” said Ian Williams, an economist and strategist at brokerage Peel Hunt.\nIn currency markets, the euro climbed 0.4% against the dollar to $1.1064.\nIn commodities, Brent crude oil was steady at $48.78 a barrel. Gold rose 0.6% to $1,123.00 a troy ounce.\nWrite to Tommy Stubbington at tommy.stubbington@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T11:23:09.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
