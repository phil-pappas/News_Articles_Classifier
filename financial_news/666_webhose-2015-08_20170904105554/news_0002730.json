That previous slow reveal of policy reports sometimes created volatility, as happened in August 2014 when their forecasts and meeting minutes -- published a week apart -- sent markets in opposite directions.\n“The minutes were dovish about the near-term rate rise prospects, but the Inflation Report was hawkish about medium-term ones,” Rob Wood, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London and a former BOE official, said about this month’s releases. “It would have caused some confusion, so it was a success to release them both at the same time.”\nInvestors can look forward to a month devoid of further scheduled distractions from the BOE for the first time since the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was formed in 1997 -- marking a sea change from the communication strategy pioneered by Carney’s predecessors including Mervyn King.\n“Super Thursday,” as dubbed by economists, saw BOE officials publish their decision, vote, minutes and quarterly Inflation Report simultaneously.\nWhile the forecasts in the report projected consumer-price growth above the bank’s target in three years, the pound dropped after the minutes showed only one MPC member voted to raise the benchmark interest rate. Most economists expected that at least one other would push for tightening.\nHawkish Report Sterling pared some of the decline when Carney addressed journalists at a press conference shortly after the release of documents, saying that the outlook is “consistent” with the need for higher borrowing costs.\nAlan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, agreed investors may have read Thursday’s Inflation Report as hawkish on its own.\n“That would probably have fanned the flames of people expecting more dissent, and the minutes would have been a surprise,” Clarke said. “Under this new system, it’s reduced volatility. It was a surprise, but it would have been a big surprise in two weeks’ time given the interpretation that Carney was hawkish.”\nWhen the governor unveiled the plans for the new communication format in December, he said one of its aims was to reduce speculation between publications and give people a better chance to understand the MPC’s thinking. On that measure, he may be successful, Wood said.\n“It was useful to have together,” he said. “There was still a bit of a difference between Mark Carney at the press conference and the tone of the minutes, but it’s all in one day now so you can take one view away from it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T07:14:36.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
