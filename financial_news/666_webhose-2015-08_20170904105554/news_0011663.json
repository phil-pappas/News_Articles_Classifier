But which stocks should you buy? \n\"While many have observed that recent winners are leading the market lower, the extent of this underperformance is just 1%,\" Jonathan Golub, chief market strategist at RBC Capital Markets (a division of Royal Bank of Canada ), wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. \"More importantly, our work indicates that investing in these market 'darlings' following precipitous market pullbacks is a winning strategy over the ensuing week, month, and six months.\" More Headlines 10 Big-Name Stocks That Already Are in Correction Territory \nThe report was a quantitative analysis \"looking at the pattern of returns you get from buying the winning stocks going into a severe market pullback,\" Golub wrote in a follow-up email to TheStreet . Aug. 17 \"was the day before the market pullback so we screened for those stocks that have run in the six months prior to that date.\" \nHere's the list, paired with ratings from TheStreet Ratings for added perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n6-Month Return (through 8/17): 27.3% 1-Week Return (from 8/17): -10.2% \nAetna Inc. operates as a health care benefits company in the United States. It operates through three segments: Health Care, Group Insurance, and Large Case Pensions. \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, A TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates AETNA INC as a Buy with a ratings score of A. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate AETNA INC (AET) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its solid stock price performance, impressive record of earnings per share growth, increase in net income, revenue growth and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows weak operating cash flow.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: Powered by its strong earnings growth of 36.84% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 49.07% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, AET should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year. AETNA INC has improved earnings per share by 36.8% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, AETNA INC increased its bottom line by earning $5.66 versus $5.35 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($7.52 versus $5.66). The company, on the basis of net income growth from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly outperformed against the S&P 500 and exceeded that of the Health Care Providers & Services industry average. The net income increased by 33.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, rising from $548.80 million to $731.80 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 6.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 4.3%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share. The return on equity has improved slightly when compared to the same quarter one year prior. This can be construed as a modest strength in the organization. Compared to other companies in the Health Care Providers & Services industry and the overall market, AETNA INC's return on equity exceeds that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.
