The WSJ’s Chun Han Wong reports that highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the scene of the blast that killed at least 112 people and concerns over unhealthy air have triggered evacuations in the area. Several manufacturers have shut down operations in the vicinity, in part because of logistics difficulties in getting parts move around Tianjin but also because their workers live in areas affected by the blast. The WSJ’s Yoko Kobuta reports that Toyota Motor Corp. is halting production for three days at a plant in Tianjin and another about 40 miles away that receives parts from the Tianjin factory. The company says it is still looking at the impact on its broader global supply chain.\nThe latest innovation in warehousing equipment isn’t with the warehouses but with the workers. Logistics operator Exel, the North American supply chain management unit of Deutsche Post DHL Group, is preparing to what it calls “vision picking” at two U.S. warehouses. WSJ Logistics Report’s Robbie Whelan writes that Google Glass-like wearable devices would replace handheld scanners and paper job orders , and they would help increase efficiency by telling workers the fastest route to products. Exel says a test in the Netherlands this year improved efficiency by 25%. Such an improvement may be particularly important at peak shipping periods when the company hires temporary workers to meet increased demand.\nGlobal metals markets are bracing for the impact of the yuan’s devaluation on China’s exports of aluminum and steel. China is the world’s biggest producer of the two metals, and the WSJ’s Biman Mukherji and Rhiannon Hoyle write that China already has been aggressive with its metals exports in response to production overcapacity and the country’s slowing economy . The metals markets are highly price sensitive and a devaluation that’s hit 3% heading into this week may have more impact on the commodities trade than on retail and industrial parts shipping. It also may trigger a louder outcry against China’s actions from metals producers. U.S. steel makers already are reviving their competition complaints against China, and commodities producers in Australia already hurt by falling China demand fear metals may be drawn into a budding currency war.\nTRANSPORTATION\nENLARGE Damaged containers at the Port of Tianjin. Photo: Associated Press U.S. West Coast ports are still waiting to see the recovery they want in cargo container traffic. WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that inbound container volume at the Port of Los Angeles fell 3.5% year-over-year in July . That was a big contrast with record results reported at the neighboring Port of Long Beach reported in the same month. The bottom line at the San Pedro ports was that inbound container volume grew 5.4% from the same month a year ago. That’s meager compared to record expansion in container trade that East Coast ports are reporting. The numbers suggest shippers are taking the tactics they used during labor strife on the West Coast and using them as part of their 2015 distribution strategies.\nThe competition between China’s largest e-commerce players, led by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -0.47 % , is a fierce winner-take-all battle to many of the online providers, and it reaches deep into the supply chains of retailers . The WSJ’s Kathy Chu and Gillian Wong report that China’s e-commerce market amounted to a $441 billion in transaction volume last year, a big market that’s expected to grow much bigger. Alibaba has more than half the transactions and is using a strategy that calls on retailers to provide their products exclusively to Aibaba’s shoppers. No. 2 seller JD.com focuses on its logistics—unlike Alibaba, the company buys the goods from retailers and handles its own inventory. That helps the company ensure, JD.com says, that it’s not selling counterfeits.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We want to be less of a Wal-Mart. ’\n—Rosalind Brewer, chief executive of Sam’s Club .\nIN OTHER NEWS Japan’s economy contracted 1.6% in the second quarter.
