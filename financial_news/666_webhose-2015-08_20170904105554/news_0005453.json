After more than a year of engaging behind the scenes as an activist investor, HESTA instructed the three external fund managers to sell the holdings on Friday. The super fund previously owned a 3 per cent stake, valued in excess of $18 million.\n\"We believe it is highly likely that the social governance issues associated with its detention centre contracts will have a negative impact on Transfield's business and share price, so have concluded it was in the best financial interests of our members to divest the stake,\" Ms Blakey said.\nShe flagged the heightened risk of future legal actions against the company.\n\"Strict confidentiality clauses in Transfield's government contracts meant the company was unable to answer questions we needed answers to,\" Ms Blakey said.\n Neither Transfield chairman Diane Smith-Gander or chief executive Graeme Hunt attended any of the meetings, sending other directors and executives in their place. Many discussion were held with Transfield's board and management before taking action to exit the investment, including inviting the company to send representatives to front its board for an hour long discussion in May.\nNeither Transfield chairman Diane Smith-Gander or chief executive Graeme Hunt attended any of the meetings, sending other directors and executives in their place.\nChild sexual abuse reporting made illegal In a written statement provided to Fairfax Media by Transfield Services on Tuesday the company said: \"Our shares are traded every day.

Shareholders including major funds continue to support the company.\"\nThe engineering company's stock was fetching $1.15 at Tuesday's market close, down from an all-time high of $10.51 at the peak of the mining construction boom in 2007.\nThe shares have risen 45 per cent since the company was awarded a $1.2 billion contract to run the facilities Manus Island and Nauru in February 2014. Most financial analysts hold a positive view that the area offers a good growth opportunity for the company.\nAnalysts estimate the detention centre contracts currently contribute between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of total revenue.\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors has an ongoing engagement with Transfield Services in relation to its concern about the social governance risks associated with is detention centre contracts, meaning that more super funds could be readying to follow HESTA's lead.\nHESTA is the country's sixth largest largest superannuation manager, responsible for investing $32 billion in retirement savings on behalf of more than 800,000 Australians. The majority of its members are women working in the healthcare and community services sectors.\nMany doctors, nurses, and other workers in the sector have protested the Border Force Act, which came into effect on 1 July, making it illegal for healthcare professionals to report child sexual abuse in offshore detention centres.\nSome of HESTA's members have used direct contact and social media to lobby the fund to blacklist Transfield Services but Ms Blakey said the internal review process had already begun many months earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:12:57.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
