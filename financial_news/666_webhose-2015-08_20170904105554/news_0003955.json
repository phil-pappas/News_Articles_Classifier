On Monday, August 3, the spread was $19.468 per barrel. \nThe above chart illustrates the US Gulf Coast 3:2:1 crack spread over the last few days. The 3:2:1 crack spread reflects a theoretical calculation of the difference between the price of two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of distillate fuel and the cost of three barrels of crude oil that these products are assumed to be produced from. \nCrack spreads usually increase when product prices increase by more than crude oil prices or when crude oil prices fall more than product prices. The former was true in the week ended August 10. As we saw in Part 1 of this series, WTI prices fell by 0.46% during the week while gasoline and diesel prices rose by ~1.2% and ~4%, respectively. Why watch crack spreads? \nCrack spreads represent the price difference between refiners’ revenues, derived from the sale of finished refined products, and refiners’ costs—the price of crude oil. So, they’re an important metric that drives refiner profitability and market valuation. This is something investors in refiner stocks should watch. \nA wider crack spread increases the profit margins of refiners such as Valero Energy (VLO), Phillips 66 (PSX), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), and Tesoro (TSO). It enables them to purchase raw materials or inputs—crude oil—at a lower rate and sell the refined products—gasoline and diesel—at higher prices. \nTogether, the companies mentioned above make up ~8% of the iShares U.S. Energy ETF (IYE). \nThese refiners have spun off some of their midstream assets to form MLPs, including Valero Energy Partners (VLP), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), MPLX LP (MPLX), and Tesoro Logistics (TLLP). A higher crack spread also indirectly benefits these companies, as the higher volumes produced by their refining parents—if they choose to take advantage of the higher margins they’re getting—would mean more volume to transport. This would boost the revenues of these MLPs. \nFor the latest updates on the energy sector, follow Market Realist’s Energy and Power page. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:14:34.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
