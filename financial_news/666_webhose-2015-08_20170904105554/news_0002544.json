It was not immediately clear who Whelan replaced.\nSoulCycle lists luxury gym chain Equinox Holdings, owned by real estate firm Related Cos and buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, as its majority stakeholder.\nThe company also has a retail clothing line, featuring sweatpants, zip-up shirts and tote bags with printed slogans and skull-and-crossbones.\nSoulCycle said it sees an opportunity to expand into the digital sphere, as it hopes to cater to an \"at-home\" audience and plans to expand it physical presence by opening at least 10 to 15 new studios per year for the next several years.\nThe company's net income rose about 42 percent to $25.3 million in 2014, while revenue rose nearly 50 percent to $112 million.\nSoulCycle listed Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup among the underwriters for its IPO, according to a preliminary prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ( 1.usa.gov/1SPn5xZ )\nThe filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell, the expected price or the exchange on which it intends to list its shares.\nThe filing contained a nominal fund raising target of $100 million. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.
