Miners also continued to fall under the pressure of weaker Chinese growth, with Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) down 7.26 percent at 191 pence and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) losing five percent to 1,148.50 pence. \nThe move by Beijing also pulled US stocks mostly lower, with investors wary of weaker Chinese exports further strengthening the dollar. \nIn trades around noon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.31 percent at 17,385.23. \nThe tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.46 percent to 5,048.35, thought the broad-based S&P 500 reversed initial losses to advance 1.28 percent to 2,104.18. \nThe news by China overshadowed developments within the eurozone -- notably that Greece has reached a technical deal on a multi-billion bailout with its international creditors after marathon talks. \n\"An agreement was reached,\" a government source told AFP, with Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos briefly telling reporters that \"one or two details\" remained to be worked out during the day. \nEuropean officials later noted, however, that the accord was a \"technical level agreement... What we don't have is a political agreement.\" \nThe talks between ministers and the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism aim to finalise the list of new reforms required of the Greek government in exchange for a lifeline of what officials in Athens Tuesday said was \"around 85 billion\" euros ($93.8 billion). \nThe deadline for Greece to reach an agreement on its third bailout is August 20, when it must repay 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. \nGerman investor sentiment meanwhile dropped this month owing to nagging geopolitical uncertainty clouding the outlook for Europe's top economy, a leading survey found on Tuesday. \nThe widely-watched investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute sank 4.7 points to 25.0 points this month, ZEW said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T22:12:14.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
