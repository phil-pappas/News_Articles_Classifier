Preliminary data will be released on August 17th.\nThis is the year that the economic plan of Shinzo Abe, the prime minister, should be taking wing. The negative effect on consumer demand of a rise in the consumption tax in April 2014—the economy tipped into recession afterwards—is by now safely past. Meanwhile a drop in oil prices has been a boon for household budgets.\nIn this section The battle of midpoint Yuan thing after another Whom to trust A new contract for growth In jeopardy Asset-rich, cash-poor Third time lucky? Automation angst Japan Politics Japanese economy Asian economy Japanese politics\nYet the economy’s performance has been underwhelming. The problems have been weak industrial production, thanks to a slowdown in exports to America and China, and anaemic household consumption. In a recent report on Japan, economists at the IMF attributed some of consumers’ reluctance to open their purses to their worries about how Japan’s dire fiscal position—debt now stands at 246% of GDP—could affect their future income. Companies and consumers may also doubt whether Abenomics is here to stay.\nThe longer-term picture, though, looks more encouraging. Average real annualised GDP growth for the first half is likely to come in at about 1.5%, which is relatively strong considering Japan’s shrinking and ageing population. Many economists are forecasting a further acceleration of growth in the second half, although this depends on a rebound in the global economy—hardly a forgone conclusion given the gloomy news from emerging markets.\nMost encouragingly, GDP is on a steady upward trend in nominal terms (see chart). It was Japan’s chronic failure to grow in nominal terms over the past two decades that set it apart from other developed countries. Core consumer prices and the GDP deflator, another measure of inflation, have both started rising. And although the news on wages in June was disappointing—a 2.9% fall in real terms—they should soon rise as the labour market continues to tighten. Naohiko Baba of Goldman Sachs, a notable bear on Abenomics, expects real wage growth of 0.2-0.3% in the current fiscal year.\nAdding to the momentum on pay, Mr Abe outlined the largest increase in Japan’s minimum wage since 2002 on July 29th, from ¥780 ($6.30) an hour to ¥798 an hour, a rise of 2.3%. (That will still leave it much lower than in many other rich countries.) The rise should help low-income earners most at risk from the Bank of Japan’s quest to raise inflation.\nThe question now is whether firms and households can start driving faster growth. Japan’s companies have slashed their debts and corporate profits are high. According to the Tankan survey, they consider business conditions to be as favourable now as they were during the most recent period of sustained growth, under former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. For households, aggregate wage income—wages multiplied by employment—is growing.\nYet Mr Abe’s public support is now falling, because of unpopular defence legislation (see article ). There is little sign yet of any real challenge to his position, but he may in future wield less clout. The government’s ability to demand that firms raise wages, as it did with some success this year, could wane, adds Mr Baba. A poor second quarter will increase misgivings about Mr Abe’s economic plans. But it is hard to believe that the economy would be stronger without him.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/images/print-edition/20150815_FNC405_0.png", "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/print-edition/20150815_FNP001_1.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:00:52.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
