Supplied by John McDonald\nThere are many definitions of what \"it truly means to be human\", and Shaun Monson's Unity tries out most of them. One of my own definitions is that it is truly human to feel a sense of creeping irritation when we find our own, most banal opinions being fed back to us as revelations. If you've ever had a few doubts about war, racism, sexism or cruelty to animals, this film will clear up the confusion. They are all bad ideas.\nUnity , in the words of the press release, \"is a new documentary that explores humanity's hopeful transformation from living by killing into living by loving. It is a unique film about compassion for all beings, or all 'expressions of life', and going beyond all 'separation based on form'.\"\nIs that clear? Good. The doco is divided into five chapters: Cosmos, Mind, Body, Heart and Soul, and narrated by an unprecedented gathering of 101 dalmatians. Sorry – 101 celebrities, everyone from Aaron Paul to Zoe Saldana. It would be easier to list the absentees rather than the participants.\nAfrican children shot on site: Shaun Monson's \"Unity\" is a star-studded \"comic steam bath\" of profundity. Supplied Unity bears some similarity to films such as Godfrey Reggio's Qatsi trilogy, and Ron Fricke's Baraka and Samsara . There is the same relentless barrage of images which may be beautiful or confonting, spectacular or teasingly familiar. The point of difference is that Reggio and Fricke rely on music to drive the montage, while Monson's visuals are overlaid with muttered fragments of would-be profundity. Rather than the jackhammer rhythms of Philip Glass, he favours maudlin strings that underline the \"seriousness\" of his message.\nAnother difference is that Monson seems to delight in piling up images of horror, as if hoping to shock his audience into submission.\nThe celebrity chorus may be a cute idea but it is not easy to become immersed in this film. Although it is set up as one long cosmic steam bath, many of the propositions broadcast by the invisible celebrities are hard to swallow.\nA sequence that tracks the evolution of human rights from the time of Cyrus the Great to the present is mind-boggling in its simplifications. Every part of this summary invites argument, but I almost gagged at the the idea of the French Revolution being a golden age of human rights. The Revolution may have begun with noble ideas about liberty, equality and fraternity, but there was nothing noble about the Terror, which saw thousands of people executed for ideological reasons.\n Such contradictions tend to upset the incisive dichotomies of this movie such as: \"human rights = good; mass murder = bad\".\nVegan proselytising From the very beginning we learn that it is wrong to kill and eat animals – a lesson illustrated by a sickening film clip showing a terrified cow awaiting its turn in the abattoir. By the end the celebrities are telling us plants have consciousness too, which seems to imply that we shouldn't kill and eat them either. One suspects the idiot dentist who shot Cecil the lion has done more for the cause of animal rights than any amount of vegan proselytising.\nIt is reasonable to argue that our treatment of animals is a measure of our own humanity. To be sensitive to the pain and suffering of another sentient being is a big step on the way to peaceful co-existence. But this is not the same as embracing vegetarianism.\nTo make their case, the celebs point out that the largest, strongest animals in the world, such as elephants and cattle, are vegetarians. The logical corollary is that we might be as strong as an ox if we ate only grass.\nMonson tackles the big question of the meaning of life, telling us it all comes down to selflessness – letting go of the ego and the strivings it generates. It would be interesting to know how many of the celebrity narrators endorse this form of Hollywood Buddhism. It projects a vision of nothingness that seems strangely at odds with the lifestyles of most movie stars.\n\"Consciousness is when we feel the suffering of every creature in our own hearts,\" Jennifer Aniston says. \"That is our relationship to the harmony of being.\"\nLarenz Tate chimes in: \"Living by loving may be the ultimate solution to all of humankind's difficulties.\"\nCatherine Tate adds: \"We've simply got to evolve beyond any act that involves the destruction of any life.\"\n\"No more war,\" begins the celebrity chorus. \"No more racism. No more sexism. No more speciesism. No more opposite intensities.\" Opposite intensities? Ask Joaquin Phoenix.\nIf only we could get rid of our competitive, violent urges, embrace other species and become one big omelette of love, what a wonderful world it would be. Unless you are insensitive enough to believe that a world without striving would be a very dull place.\nGood assault on taste Iris Apfel is one human being who doesn't want to be like everybody else. At the age of 93 she is the most stylish woman in New York. Yet it is an idea of style that has nothing to do with understated elegance, or even beauty, but is more like a full-blown assault on the idea of good taste.\nThis is the penultimate documentary by the legendary Albert Maysles, who died in March. His final feature, In Transit , is yet to be released.\nMaysles and his brother, David, who died in 1987, were known for a style of documentary called \"direct cinema\", in which they kept planning to a minimum and simply let the action unfold. They regularly included themselves in the frame, making us conscious of the intrusions of the camera. The best-known Maysles brothers films are probably Gimme Shelter (1970) and Grey Gardens (1976).\nIris is typical of the Maysles style, but lifted onto another plane by the startling presence of Iris Apfel, who manages to seem thoroughly down to earth, even if she does resemble a walking Christmas tree. There is more common sense in two minutes of Iris's conversation than 99 minutes of Shaun Monson's Unity .\nIris knows she has never been pretty but, like Diana Vreeland, she figured out early on that style was much more important than good looks. Nowadays she feels sorry for all those pretty girls who have grown old without ever becoming interesting.\nIn 1948 she married Carl Apfel, who has just celebrated his 100th birthday and still dotes on his wife. He's happy to let Iris do most of the talking for him, even at his own birthday party.\nCarl shot a lot of home movies which Maysles has drawn upon to provide background for this story. In this footage we see the Apfels in their younger days, roaming the world on one shopping spree after another, as they seek out material for their highly successful interior decorating business. They even helped with the decor of the White House, although Jackie Kennedy proved a difficult customer.\nJazz frame of mind The Apfels seem to have kept much of the treasure they found on their scavenger hunts, as their apartments in Manhattan and Palm Beach are both crammed to the rafters with exotic bric-a-brac, some of it expensive and tasteful, some the merest kitsch.\nThis also describes Iris's voluminous archive of clothing. She might combine a designer dress with cheap costume jewellery bought at a street market, or a Chinese shaman's jacket picked up on her travels. The consistent trademark is a pair of heavy-rimmed glasses that covers half of her face.\nIris compares her way of dressing to jazz improvisation. It is an instinctive process that drives her to mix colours and textures in a way that breaks every unwritten rule of fashion, but looks amazing. She has always done this, but her recognition as a fashion icon arrived late in life.\nThe catalyst was an exhibition of her costume collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2005, called Rara Avis and later simplified to Rare Bird of Fashion . Curator Harold Koda explains it was only ever intended as a stopgap, replacing an exhibition that had fallen through. No one was prepared for the massive crowds that poured through the show, driven almost exclusively by word of mouth.\nSuddenly Iris was a media superstar, doing interviews for leading magazines and being asked to mentor fashion students. She was minding her own business when this wave of fame struck but has enjoyed every moment of her new-found status.\nWe tend to think of people who dress outrageously as narcissists, but Iris is not only modest, she never passes judgment on anyone else's fashion sense. There can be nothing wrong with anyone's outfit if it makes them happy. After all, she says, \"It's better to be happy than well-dressed.\"\nIndulgence for buffs David Stratton seems happy to be released from the round of TV movie reviews and free to devote himself to other projects. One of the first is the Great Britain Retro Film Festival, which runs until August 19 at cinemas in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.\nIt's an indulgence for film buffs, as the 19 movies included are all extremely well known. The novelty is the chance to see new, digitally enhanced versions of classics such as The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) and The Third Man (1949).\nThere used to be many occasions when one might see such films on the big screen, but today there is scarcely a repertory cinema to be found in our cities.\nPerhaps this festival suggests that audiences are starting to remember what movies were like in those days when artistry was ascribed to directors rather than computers.\nUnity\nWritten & directed by Shaun Monson\nStarring 100 celebrities … you name 'em.\nUS, rated T/C, 99 mins\nIris\nWritten & directed by Albert Maysles\nStarring Iris Apfel, Carl Apfel\nUS, rated M, 80 mins\nFor David Stratton's Great Britain Retro Film Festival:\norpheum.com.au (Sydney)\ncinemanova.com.au (Melbourne)\nlunapalace.com.au (Perth)", "external_links": ["http://www.orpheum.com.au/", "http://www.cinemanova.com.au/", "https://www.lunapalace.com.au/"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:08:14.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
