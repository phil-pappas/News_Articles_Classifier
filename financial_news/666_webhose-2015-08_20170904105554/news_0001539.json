Banks. By Simon Letch. For AFR Weekend , August 125, 2015 Simon Letch Share on twitter by Christopher Joye It's a unique licence to print money. A business where you're funded with only 4 per cent equity and 96 per cent debt (ie, 25 times leverage) that allows you to translate a humdrum 1.1 per cent return on assets into a stunning 18 per cent return on equity.\nThe secret is you've convinced the government to implicitly and explicitly guarantee your creditors such that they will never suffer a loss if you default on your debts, which in turn makes their cash ultra-cheap to get. And you pay nothing for this priceless AAA-rated sovereign insurance.\nIt's actually better than that: you've also got an iron-clad, $66 billion line of credit with the Reserve Bank of Australia that you can tap when you get into trouble for a minimum 12-month period at a total cost of only 2.4 per cent annually (or half current home loan rates!).\nThis so-called \"committed liquidity facility\" was deliberately designed by the RBA to ensure you can always pay your debts as and when they fall due, which makes it practically impossible for you to trade insolvent.\nWelcome to the world of that beautiful $140 billion behemoth, the Commonwealth Bank, which has inverted the axiom that there is a trade-off between risk and return. Years ago I highlighted a perversion embedded at the heart of our financial system: the supposedly lowest (highest) risk banks were producing the highest (lowest) returns. Normally it works the other way around.\nThis too-good-to-be-true outcome was a direct artefact of the big banks gaming regulatory rules that enabled them to harness more than twice the leverage of competitors when funding virtually identical home loan assets. Thankfully this lucrative regulatory loop-hole is being closed, which is why the majors are suddenly having to raise tens of billions of dollars of fresh mullah . Thus far they've \"surprised\" markets – but not readers of my column – with equity issues totaling $16 billion in 2015, which is more than the $13 billion they scrambled to find during the global financial crisis.\nAs CBA's credit analysts explained on Wednesday, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is now \"at least\" 10 per cent (notably not the 9.25 per cent level another credit analyst claimed might be the new normal).\nStill short After factoring in changes to residential mortgage risk-weights that come into effect in July 2016, and refinancing its wealth management debts, analysts reckon CBA is still short another $5 billion of CET1. And that's before additional equity surcharges are imposed under the new global banking rules known as Basel 4, which will not be finalised until the end of 2015.\nSo contrary to some optimistic reports, the capital-raising game has only just begun. Top analysts say the majors are still short $20 billion to $25 billion of equity, which will be realised through asset sales, dividend reinvestment plans, skinnier payout ratios, and more rights issues. (ANZ was, by the way, smart to get ahead of CBA via its $2.5 billion institutional placement because there is only a finite amount of investor liquidity.)\nIf you don't believe analysts, consider APRA's latest guidance. In July our increasingly fearless regulator concluded the majors were deficient 200 basis points of \"capital\". It deliberately left its capital definition vague only because the Basel 4 rules have not been resolved and APRA cannot, therefore, settle on a final CET1 target. Bankers who think the 200 basis points can be met through fake equity (ie, hybrids) or bail-in bonds are kidding themselves. APRA absolutely expects it to be addressed via CET1, which is the only form of capital that will lift the majors' unimpressive 4 per cent \"leverage ratio\" that investors focus on during crises. On this benchmark the majors ranked below the 50th percentile of peer banks globally in June 2014, which is not good enough.\nAs capital climbs the majors' leverage and returns mechanically decline. Every 100 basis points of extra CET1 compresses returns by about the same amount absent mitigating actions. Profit growth will also shrink as credit growth slumps towards the rate of increase in national incomes of about 5 per cent annually, which is less than half the 12 per cent annual pace of credit growth between 1995 and 2008.\nThe terrific news for shareholders is that this belated deleveraging will transform the majors into some of the safest banks in the world, which will be able to comfortably withstand a 1991-style recession, exacerbated by a 20 per cent decline in house prices.\nIndeed, it's hard to conceive of better businesses than these government-backed printing presses, which have demonstrated that they possess the unilateral pricing power that befits true oligarchs. In July they jacked-up the price of $450 billion of investment loans by 6 per cent, with no discernible consequences other than fattening their profits.\nRational profit maximisers And kudos to them for doing so: management must emphatically remain rational profit maximisers that serve the best interests of shareholders. This margin expansion is essential to offsetting the return dilution wrought by deleveraging and the majors should do the same across their $780 billion owner-occupied loan books. The last thing home buyers need right now is cheaper money, and if margins get too wide the majors will merely invite more competition, which would be welcome.\nOne of the most profound ramifications of APRA defraying the majors' historically huge leverage advantage will be a levelling of the competitive playing field. The big four will inevitably cede housing market share to smaller rivals and tilt their balance sheets back towards higher-margin business lending. This will in turn lubricate the supply of finance to the entrepreneurial sector, which has been neglected while banks worshiped at the bricks and mortar altar.\nSo with the majors' share prices about 15 per cent off their March peaks, is now the time to buy into these businesses? I don't think so.\nThe problem with big bank valuations (and analyst forecasts) today is that they are tenuously predicated on the lowest loan losses in history. To accept the possibility that the majors are good value you have to heroically suppose there's no chance Australia will experience a recession or that loan losses will normalise back to historical trend rates that incorporate cyclical downturns.\nThis benign trajectory is the Achilles heel in the discounted cash-flow models deployed to price major banks stocks. And as it is 24 years since Australia has experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, there is every chance our remarkable luck will run out.\nThe probabilities of a dip have elevated with the sharp contraction in growth across the Asian region, which captures four of our five largest trading partners. Throw in a nascent Chinese credit crisis that is evolving into a beggar-thy-neighbour currency war and it is easy to understand why ANZ is happy to ditch $5 billion of its low-returning Asian assets. (It was always silly to think ANZ would ever have a durable comparative advantage banking in Asian markets in the first place.)\nTo better understand the vulnerabilities inherent in the major banks' valuations, it is instructive to reflect on the assumptions supporting the No.1 analyst's forecasts. UBS's Jon Mott has a well-deserved reputation for being ferociously independent. While he was excoriated by ANZ's boss, Mike Smith, for (correctly) claiming the majors were undercapitalised, he is actually quite constructive on the sector with one \"Buy\" and three \"Neutral\" recommendations. That is, no sale signs in sight!\nThese calls mean Mott expects Westpac to deliver capital gains of more than 13 per cent over the next year with ANZ, CBA and NAB treading water. Mott manages to remain relatively optimistic while adopting ostensibly conservative assumptions (see table). He believes that many of the majors' key financial metrics, including asset growth, net interest margins, revenue growth, return on assets, and return on equity, will shrink over the next 3 years.\nThe one exception is provisions for bad and doubtful debts as a share of gross loans, which Mott has lifting modestly from around 0.15 per cent today to 0.21 per cent in 2017. The issue I have with this is that bad debt charges have averaged 0.34 per cent since 2000 (or 63 percent more than Mott's 2017 number). And the past 15 years have been a very biased, recession-free sample period.\nIf we look at the window 1991 to 2014, the average major bank bad debt charge was 0.51 per cent of total loans, which is 2.4 times Mott's 2017 forecast. That average also conceals some shockers: in 1991 and 1992 bad debts hit 1.65 per cent and 2.43 per cent of loans (or 11 to 16 times higher than current levels).\nA simple stress-test is to imagine that non-residential loan losses reach, say, two-thirds of their 1991 marks coupled with a rise in residential arrears to, say, 2 per cent (compared to 0.6 per cent presently) with 30 per cent loss severity. Given a 60/40 balance-sheet split between residential/business lending, total bad debt charges would jump from 0.16 per cent to 1.1 per cent. This is less than half the losses in 1992 and only 34 per cent above the majors' 2009 experience.\nAll else being equal, every 0.1 percentage point increase in loan losses knocks about 5 per cent off the majors' returns on equity (RoEs). So my stress-test would at least cut RoEs in half assuming no other adverse impacts (eg, weaker credit growth and margins), which of course there would be in spades. The point is that major bank profits hinge crucially on the macroeconomy's performance, which could easily sour. Yet prevailing prices do not accommodate this possibility.\nThe majors are transforming into world-class businesses that will be able to withstand the worst shocks. But that does not mean they are cheap. Asset growth, revenues, net interest margins, leverage, returns and home loan market share will all shrink. Better value will materialise when bad debt charges rise above long-term averages and fickle investors run for the hills. That's my buy signal.\nThe author is a director and shareholder in Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income investment portfolios.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:08:50.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
