buyouts after posting a strong lift in full-year profit and flagging an increase in revenue and earnings this financial year.\nAustralia's biggest plastic packaging manufacturer has posted a profit of $67.63 million for the year to June — a 17.2 per cent increase on $57.69 million a year earlier.\nRevenue in the period rose 8 per cent to $1.253 billion.\nThe packaging group, backed by Melbourne billionaire Raphael Geminder, in June made its biggest acquisition since becoming a listed company with the $80 million purchase of Barry Smorgon’s and John Tisdale’s packaging company Jalco.\nAt the time, Mr Geminder intimated there may be more to come, a sentiment that was echoed in today's full-year results.\n“The board and management continue to assess a range of M&A opportunities focussing on adjacencies, geographical expansion, and acquisitions that will bring about transformational change and deliver long-term shareholder value and returns,\" Pact chief executive Brian Cridland said.\nMr Geminder and Mr Cridland have developed a vision to transform Pact into a $5 billion enterprise before 2020 with operations in Asia, Europe and the US.\nAny future acquisitions are expected to be in service of this goal.\nPact will pay a final dividend of 10c a share — 6.5c of which will be franked — on October 5 to shareholders on the register at September 4.\nCombined with the interim unfranked dividend of 9.5c, Pact's total dividend payment for the year comes to 19.5c a share, well up on 9.5c in the previous year.\nMr Cridland said the group was expecting to achieve higher revenue and underlying earnings in fiscal 2016, subject to global economic conditions.\nOriginally published as Pact eyes more M&A as profit rises ", "external_links":
