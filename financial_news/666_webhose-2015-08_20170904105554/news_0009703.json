The root causes of trafficking are complex and often interrelated. Poverty, unemployment, lack of good governance, favoritism, bureaucratic red tape are among the many reasons cited by many migrants. It is important to note that each country presents specific factors or a combination of multiple factors that are unique to each situation. \nAs a country bearing the brunt sides of the stick, alongside to establishing a national task-force and drafting a new law, Ethiopia is taking several measures to find a lasting solution. It is all out to combat illegal migration. Such is the announcement that 'Domestic Workers' Recruitment Agreement' to protect the rights of Ethiopian domestic workers in Saudi Arabia is going to be signed between the two governments in September. By signing the deal, the Saudi government takes responsibility to ensure safety of Ethiopian domestic workers in terms of getting salaries on time, protected from any physical assaults and safe return back home. \nRegarding labour recruitment, in particular to foreign countries, most of Ethiopians traveling to Middle East countries aren't well trained and don't have the know-how to operate modern home appliances and can't provide the required services they are hired for, which often leads to abuse and violation of rights by the employees. Thus it is imperative to train and send only skilled employees to ensure their rights and benefits. It is a good thing that, the new agreement requires employees at least must have the know how to operate home appliances in order to enter into Saudi Arabia. \nAlthough, the national effort being carried out is strengthening at this point in time, saving young Ethiopian men and women from their obsession that a better future could only be achieved through migration, and dismantling an organized human trafficking network run by fellow countrymen may take more than what a single National Task Force and the various laws and measures can handle at the moment. \nPrimarily, the youth must not be desperate and opt for illegal migration since the country is in a better position to create employment opportunists. They can and have to fight for their rights and engage in available opportunities to realize their dreams here at home. However it must be underlined that, it is constitutionally guaranteed to move and work overseas, but they are expected to do it only via legal and safe way. \nAs long as there's poverty and a strong conviction that life is better on the other side, youngsters will always find ways of trying to get there. How to deal with the loopholes is what is crucial. The challenge now is to ensure that there is a strong law enforcement, effective coordination and cooperation among stakeholders as well as conducting a systematic continuous awareness among the public. \nHaving the right laws, job creation and awareness are not enough. Mobilizing public support and participation is key to address the root cause of illegal migration through community dialogue in particular in migration hub zones to bring attitudinal changes in order to create broker-free woredas ,but most of all, to break traffickers' backbone and bring lasting solution to the problem. \nWith the right policies and legal protection in place, youth migration can represent a triple-win, benefiting young migrants, the country, and the countries of destination. While strict implementation can transform youth migration from a challenge into an opportunity, empowering today's youth -tomorrow's students, workers, entrepreneurs, parents and leaders - to achieve their full human potential.
