Nordstrom and J.C. Penney both rose after the department store chains posted better-than-expected quarterly results.\nStocks hit session highs late in the session after Belgium's Finance Minister told Reuters in Brussels that euro zone finance ministers had agreed to a Memorandum of Understanding drafted by institutional negotiators, \"with some additional measures.\"\nU.S. producer prices rose for a third straight month in July, suggesting the drag on inflation from weaker oil prices was easing, while industrial output advanced at its strongest pace in eight months.\nThough the Chinese currency devaluation added some uncertainty to the outlook for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, most traders and economists are still expecting a September increase.\nThat kept the market from breaking out of its trading range, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.\n\"I think the bulls are nervous and bears are hoping for a big market decline once the Fed does finally hike rates,\" he said.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.15 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,477.4, while the S&P 500 gained 8.15 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,091.54.\nThe Nasdaq Composite, which swung 167 points from its low this week to its high, added 14.68 points, or 0.29 percent, to 5,048.24.\nFor the week, the Dow rose 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 added 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.1 percent.\nThe day's economic data followed strong employment and retail sales data for July on Thursday, which overall suggested the third quarter was off to a healthy start.\nNine of the 10 S&P 500 sectors ended higher.\nEnergy shares dipped in afternoon trade and the energy index ended down 0.2 percent. Still, the energy index rose 3.2 percent for the week, its biggest gain since March.\nJ.C. Penney rose 5.6 percent at $8.52, Nordstrom jumped 4.3 percent to $78.13 and was among the biggest percentage gainers in the S&P 500, while the S&P retail index rose 0.4 percent.\nRestaurant operator El Pollo Loco fell 20.7 percent to $14.56, below its IPO price, after weak quarterly results.\nSysco rose 7.4 percent to $41.38 after Nelson Peltz reported a 7-percent stake in the food distributor and said he would seek representation on the company's board.\nNYSE advancers outnumbered decliners 2,072 to 962; on the Nasdaq, 1,697 issues rose and 1,096 fell.\nThe S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 62 new highs and 101 new lows.\nAbout 5.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.1 billion daily average for the month to date, according to BATS Global Markets.
