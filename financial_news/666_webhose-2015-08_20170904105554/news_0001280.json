Even so, wages growth appeared to have slowed more than might normally be expected. \"A key reason behind this could be that a much more flexible labour market in recent years has enabled companies greater capacity to cap wages growth due to slackness in the labour market,\" Mr Peters said. But every cloud has a silver lining. \"The resultant ongoing tepid wages growth appears to have contributed to more jobs than otherwise would have been the case.\" At ANZ, Katie Hill and Justin Fabo said an elevated unemployment rate would keep wage pressures subdued, but they said that was \"a necessary adjustment in Australia's relative labour cost structure and low wages growth globally\". \"This will limit upside in household spending growth and keep inflation in check.\" As well as slower growth in wage rates, the switch in economic growth to lower-wage industries meant average earnings per employee has been slower growth in wage rates, they said. AMP's Shane Oliver said the combination of subdued consumer confidence and weak wages growth would keep the brakes on consumer spending. \"Fortunately, wealth gains and low interest rates are providing a bit of a positive offset and helping drive reasonable retail sales growth,\" he said. NAB's David de Garis was upbeat about consumer spending, noting that growth in wage rates was still beating inflation. \"Such real wages growth, together with increases in employment and some easing back in the household savings rate (at least until the March quarter) has underwritten volume growth in household consumption and retail volumes,\" he said.
