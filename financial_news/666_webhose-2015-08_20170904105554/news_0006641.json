But can you get a longer loan? \nRising house prices and tough affordability requirements are forcing borrowers to take on mortgages with terms of up to 40 years. But how easy is it to get a very long loan and which lenders offer them? \nSome 20pc of property buyers searched for very long-term loans between April and July this year, according to brokerage Mortgage Advice Bureau. This was up from 8pc during the same period in 2014. \nThe trend is mainly a result of rapidly rising house prices and lacklustre wage growth. By taking a longer term loan borrowers can reduce their monthly repayments, which helps meet affordability requirements. \nWhile 25 years is the standard mortgage term, most lenders will extend this to 35 or even 40 years. \n= Which lenders offer longer terms? = \nNatwest and Virgin will agree to 35-year terms, while Halifax and Nationwide, plus some of the smaller building societies such as Ipswich and Nottingham, will offer 40-year terms. \nHSBC on the other hand will only lend for up to 30 years. \nSecuring a very long loan is not difficult. Borrowers can simply request a longer term when they apply for a specific mortgage deal. \n= What about older borrowers? = \nThere are limitations. David Hollingworth, of mortgage broker London and Country, said lenders’ maximum age caps mean that few people aged in their mid to late thirties or older will be able to take out longer deals. This limits the market mainly to first and second-time buyers. \n“The natural limitation here is the maximum lending age,” he said. “This varies across lenders but most will typically require the mortgage to finish by age 65. This is slowly changing though and some lenders will accept borrowers who say they plan to work to age 70 for example.” \nWhile some may be able to borrow into retirement, in most cases lenders will require proof of retirement income, which can be very difficult to produce. \n= What about the costs? = \nWhile longer-term loans will bring down monthly costs, the additional interest that builds up over time is substantial. \nTake a £200,000 repayment mortgage with a rate of 3pc. Over 25 years, the monthly repayments would be £948 and the total interest payable over the life of the loan would be £84,526. \nThe same mortgage taken over 35 years would have lower monthly repayments of £770, but the overall interest would reach £123,274 some £38,748 more. \nMortgage calculators: \nHow much can I borrow? \nMonthly cost of your repayments \nTerm (years) Monthly repayment Total (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) interest 25 £948.42 £84,526 30 £843.21 £103,556 35 £769.70 £123,274 40 £715.97 £143,666 • For money-saving tricks and ideas, get our weekly money round-up here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T03:58:08.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
