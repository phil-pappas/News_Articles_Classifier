Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey To ﻿ ny Abbott is actively considering a referendum on gay marriage rather than a plebiscite should he win the next election, an option which would increase the chances of killing off gay marriage for the long term.\nAs the Coalition recovered from Tuesday's six-hour party room debate which scuttled an internal push for a conscience vote and any chance of gay marriage being legalised ths term, it emerged that the Prime Minister has spent the past few weeks discussing plebiscite and referendum options with conservative colleagues.\nThis was despite him ruling out any such vote after the Irish referendum, saying same-sex marriage should be an issue for the Parliament.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison, one of the most senior ministers opposed to gay marriage, backs a referendum over a plebiscite and has been discussing with Mr Abbott a constitutional change that if passed, would force a change to the Marriage Act that would allow same-sex marriage.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott visited a Green Army project in Queanbeyan on Wednesday Andrew Meares A spokesman for Mr Abbott said consideration would be given to both a plebiscite and a referendum. It is much harder to effect change with a referendum. A plebiscite is non-binding and to pass requires only a national majority.\nA referendum is binding but to pass, requires a majority of the states as well as a national majority. Referendums rarely succeed, especially when they lack the support of the prime minister, as a gay marriage vote would.\n﻿ Mr Morrison told The Australian Financial Review that his motive for a referendum was to resolve the gay marriage debate, one way or the other.\n\"To definitively determine this issue, we need to give the country a conscience vote and let the Australian people decide,\" he said.\n \"I don't want this question left to politicians and judges to decide.\"\nTreasurer Joe Hockey also backs the referendum to change s51(21) of the constitution to insert the words \"opposite sex\" and \"same sex\" before the word \"marriage\".\nIf passed, Mr Morrison said it would require the Marriage Act to be amended to bring it in line with the Constitution by removing the definition of marriage as that only between a man and a woman.\nChristian pressure group's opposition ﻿ The Australian Christian Lobby, which is fighting tooth and nail against gay marriage, has been advocating a plebiscite or referendum for several months.\nLiberal MP Warren Entsch, who drove the push to legalise gay marriage, met Mr Abbott on Wednesday and demanded he play a role in deciding the policy the government took to the election. There are fears among moderates that a referendum or plebiscite will be deliberately worded to maximise chances of failure.\n\"They have been looking at ways you can fiddle a plebiscite so as to make it hard,\" said one MP.\nThe tensions created by Tuesday's debate spilled into the open on Wednesday when Malcolm Turnbull , one of 16 frontbenchers who argued in the party room for a conscience vote, criticised the plans for a post-election plebiscite or referendum, rather than grant a conscience vote, because it ensured the issue would continue to cloud the government's agenda.\nHe said while gay marriage was an important issue, \"there are a lot of other very big issues\".\n\"One of the attractions of a free vote is that it would have meant the matter would be resolved in this Parliament one way or another in a couple of weeks.\n\"The reason I haven't advocated a plebiscite after the next election is that it would mean, it will mean, that this issue is a live issue all the way up to the next election and, indeed, at the next election and, if we are returned to office, it will be a very live issue in the lead up to the plebiscite itself.\"\nMr Abbott dismissed calls to hold his proposed plebiscite on gay marriage in conjunction with the next federal election because the issue could cloud the broader election fight. Nor would it coincide with a referendum planned for 2017 on Aboriginal recognition in the constitution.​ That would mean three visits to the polls in three years.\nMr Turnbull's public comments underscore anger among moderate Liberals at what they believe were deliberate tactics by Mr Abbott to scuttle the push by allowing Nationals MPs to also join the meeting.\nHad just Liberals attended, there would have been support among a significant minority – 33 out of 79 Liberals who spoke, spoke in favour of a free vote.\nOthers believe the result was fair but the process mishandled with one MP pointing out that all Mr Abbott had done was expose the fact than half his frontbench was at odds with him on the issue.\nLabor, which is promising legislation within 100 days if elected, said the plebiscite was a delaying tactic designed to secure the ultimate failure of the gay marriage push.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Abbott could not be trusted and that the nation could either have Mr Abbott or gay marriage but not both.\nHe slammed Coalition Senate leader Eric Abetz as \"a clown \" for arguing in the party room that all gay people did not really want to get married, citing unwedded Italian fashion designers Dolce and Gabbana as an example.\nSources Quote: d Senator Abetz as saying \"lots of homosexuals don't want to get married, Dolce and Gabbana never got married\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-12T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:07:03.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
