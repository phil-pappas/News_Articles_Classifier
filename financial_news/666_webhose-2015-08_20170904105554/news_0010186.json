For the United States, sturdy overseas demand for its debt helps finance the federal government's deficit spending and holds down borrowing costs.\nBut now, fears of capital outflows accelerating from emerging economies mean these countries cannot simply sit on their piles of IOUs from Uncle Sam, analysts said.\n\"If capital were to leave emerging economies, especially those that peg their currencies against the dollar, the natural thing to do is to sell Treasuries,\" said Gene Tannuzzo, portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments in Minneapolis.\nChina stunned investors when it devalued the yuan earlier this month, while emerging market currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Brazilian real have declined to decade-plus lows against the dollar.\nOn Tuesday, China cut interest rates and required bank reserves in a bid to stabilize its stock market and to restore confidence in its economy. On Wednesday, Thailand, Southeast Asia's second biggest economy, said it would speed up domestic investments on 17 projects worth $47 billion.\nINDIRECT BIDDING SLIPS\nTreasury auctions on Tuesday and Wednesday featured worrisome signs that foreign central banks were not the big buyers they had been up to now. Foreign central banks typically purchase new Treasuries through bond dealers who bid on their behalf, a category of buyers identified as \"indirect bidders.\"\nOn Wednesday, indirect bidders bought 50.06 percent of $35 billion of new 5-year notes, their smallest share since last October. The day before, they took down just 47.09 percent of $26 billion in 2-year notes, the smallest share since May.\nThese are still sizable purchases, implying any abating appetite is likely modest, if not temporary, analysts said. The latest data from June shows China owned $1.27 trillion of Treasuries to rank as the top foreign holder, up from $1.24 trillion at the end of 2014.\nAnd the pullback from indirect bidders, which also include fund managers, may stem in part from jitters about whether the Federal Reserve will try to raise interest rates by year-end, analysts said.\nStill, some parts of the U.S. bond market point to active sellers in recent days as the plunge in Chinese stock prices unnerved global investors, analysts said.\nOne sign is how expensive the newest 10-year Treasury notes have become relative to older issues, said David Keeble, global head of interest strategy at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in New York.\nThe latest 10-year paper, issued in early August, has not been this pricey compared with older issues in two years or more, he said. That could be a sign that some foreign central banks are dumping their Treasuries onto bond dealers.\n\"They may be loading up dealers with them,\" Keeble said.
