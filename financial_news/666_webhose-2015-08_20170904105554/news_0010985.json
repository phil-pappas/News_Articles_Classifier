Robert Homer Seven Group faces worst case scenario for a conglomerate Sometimes you get to the top and the ground falls away beneath you. Ryan Stokes became chief executive of Seven Group in April and his first earnings results underlined the tough job he has in front of him. The company swung to a full-year net loss of $359.1 million from the year-earlier profit of $262.5 million , mainly because of non-cash impairments. Underlying profit fell 19 per cent year on year.\nThe big worry is that five of the group's six key segments – WesTrac China, industrial businesses AlllightSyykes and Coates Hire, the media division and the energy division – reported statutory losses. Only WesTrac Australia was in the black. All of which isn't a good look for a conglomerate, where the theory goes that if one sector is down the others balance it out.\nTo make matters worse, the outlook statement suggests the job ahead of Stokes the younger will be challenging indeed – underlying earnings are set to fall 10 per cent in 2016, and could fall further if trading conditions deteriorate. James Thomson\nAir New Zealand throws down the gauntlet to Qantas There's nothing like a record profit to embolden an executive. So it was for Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon, who combined the good news with an attack on rivals Qantas on their trans-Pacific front .\nAir New Zealand is making a concerted push to fill its planes to North and South America with more Australian passengers, so Luxon accused rival Qantas Airways of acting like \"Air Sydney\" due to its relative lack of trans-Pacific flights from other Australian cities. \"Much of the focus in Australia tends to be around Sydney,\" said Luxon after his airline reported record full-year normalised earnings before tax of $NZ496 million , which were double those of Qantas in proportion to the size of the carriers. \"In many ways you have got Qantas as Air Sydney rather than Air Australia.\"\nThe message was clear enough - forget Qantas and fly to the Americas via Auckland. And Luxon revealed Qantas should expect more where that came from with plans to defend it's home turf. All up a good day for Air New Zealand, now he just has to walk the talk. Jamie Freed\n BC Iron in the red but looking to the stars BC Iron plunged into the red. Really, it was no great surprise for investors given the collapse in the iron ore price this year and the operational problems the miner has had at its Nullagine mine. BC Iron's shares rose 4.3 per cent on the result, closing at 24c but still a long way from the $2.90 ​they traded at​ this time last year, despite the miner sinking to a $158.5 million net loss and revealing the stark change in fortunes meant it would not pay dividends.\nIn past years, investors piled into BC Iron for its strong dividends, including a total 32c paid out last year. While it's not surprising BC Iron couldn't pay a dividend it highlights the dramatic change in fortunes for the smaller miner and its Pilbara peers.\nBut it's the outlook that matters for the BC Iron and its investors​, and managing director Morgan Ball remains upbeat. Like BHP Billiton boss Andrew Mackenzie he doesn't think Chinese steel production has peaked, he is confident BC Iron's​ costs can continue to fall… and he is praying the iron ore price doesn't. Tess Ingram\n​Charter Hall raking it in Still on commercial property players, Charter Hall Group, which manages $13.6 billion worth of property funds, saw a record $1.7 billion in new equity flow into its business from super funds, pension funds and insurance giants chasing yield. With property yields still miles above bond yields, Charter Hall pressed ahead with $2.6 billion of property transactions and growing its Australian funds under management by 18 per cent.\nThe group's property investment earnings rose 17.3 per cent and property funds management earnings jumped 25.2 per cent, all of which added up to a net profit of $117.9 million, up 43.6 per cent . But wait, there's more...\nIt expects operating earnings per security to grow between 5 to 7 per cent this financial year and cannot see the booming commercial property market slowing down. Joint managing director David Harrison said further funds management growth was a key focus for the group.
