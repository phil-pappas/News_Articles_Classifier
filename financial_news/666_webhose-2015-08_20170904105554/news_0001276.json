The cash-and-stock bid, which Perrigo’s board has called inadequate, is currently worth just under $200 a share, down from $232 when it was unveiled in April.\nThat price “could be inadequate to win over enough Perrigo shareholders to complete the acquisition,” ISS wrote.\nA Mylan MYL, +0.41% spokesperson didn’t immediately comment on the recommendation.\nMylan stockholders are expected to vote Aug. 28 on whether to issue new shares to fund the acquisition.\nMylan said this week it was prepared to close a tender offer after receiving just a simple majority of Perrigo shares, rather than the 80% required under Irish law to take a company fully private. ISS said that raised the risk that Mylan would be stuck as a large shareholder in another public company with no certain path toward owning the rest.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/proxy-adviser-iss-recommends-mylan-shareholders-vote-against-perrigo-deal-1439553481?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T21:56:29.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
