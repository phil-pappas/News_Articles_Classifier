Super battery coming soon? Email \nWe love our phones, but we hate our phones' batteries. \nIn fact, multiple surveys have shown that what Americans most want in their next smartphone is improved battery life. Charged for days, not hours \nNew research suggests dramatically improved phone batteries are not the work of science fiction. A team of researchers at MIT and Tsinghua University in China found a way to triple the storage capacity in phone batteries. That same research also found a way to improve a battery's life, while also cutting charging time – a lot. \nImagine a phone that could go 3 days without charging. Imagine that same phone could be recharged in 6 minutes. \nHow soon could these super batteries make it into your phone? It's unclear, but one researcher who was not involved in the study told the MIT News Office he's optimistic the batteries can make it into production. \n\"To me, the most attractive point of this work is that the process appears simple and scalable,\" says David Lou, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Hold on a minute \nBut Paul Lee, head of global technology, media and telecommunications research for the professional services firm Deloitte, sees only modest improvements in battery technology in the next few years. \nWriting for Deloitte Insights, hosted by the Wall Street Journal, Lee this week says consumers can expect to see something like 15% improvement in battery life during the next few years. And that improvement will come because phones will get bigger, allowing for larger batteries. \nHe also downplayed quick adoption of new technologies that improve battery performance – like what the MIT researchers found. \n\"Even if there were an imminent breakthrough, it is highly unlikely a new battery type could be easily 'dropped into' existing devices, and it would likely require different charging technology and packaging, among other changes,\" Lee wrote. \nBottom line: If you think you're going to be in the market for a new phone soon, don't believe the likely hype you'll hear from the makers of soon-to-be-released phones about improved battery life. \nYou'll probably still have to keep multiple chargers handy. \nRelated posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:23:50.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
