After Facebook Inc. tested a Snapchat-like live events feature at the Lollapalooza music festival last week, Mark Zuckerberg has now set his sights on Periscope and Meerkat.\nThe world’s largest social network on Wednesday rolled out a live-streaming video feature called Live for Facebook Mentions, heating up an increasingly crowded live-video market that already includes players like Twitter Inc.’s TWTR, -2.93% Periscope and Meerkat.\nUnlike the existing offerings, Facebook FB, +2.53% is launching its live-video offering with a sense of prestige: You must be a celebrity to broadcast. And unlike Twitter, Live will live within the native Facebook app; last week, interim Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said Twitter had “nothing specific” to share when asked whether Twitter had plans to integrate Twitter, Periscope and Vine into one app.\nSee Also: It may take 3 chiefs to fix Twitter\nFacebook’s launch comes at an interesting juncture in the still-young market’s juncture. Periscope and Meerkat were both launched earlier this year, and while Periscope stole much of the spotlight from Meerkat when it launched two months later, neither app has nailed down monetization.\nFacebook didn’t mention monetization when it launched Live on Wednesday either, but the company has been working more broadly to improve video monetization across its platform. It is also hoping to expand the reach of Facebook videos, even beyond the core Facebook platform. With Live, the company will let users share videos to Instagram, and, interestingly, to rival site Twitter as well.\nShares of Facebook were up 2.3% to $96.22 in recent trade, pushing them up 24% in the last three months. Twitter’s shares have reached record lows, falling 2.5% to $28.60 recently.\nLast quarter, Facebook reported a 40% increase in video shares on its network, fueled in part by an updated News Feed algorithm that boosts video rankings.\n“We’re excited about the potential for continued work here,” Facebook co-founder and Chief Executive Zuckerberg said at the time.\nLive video works to support Facebook’s broader efforts to connect people around important public moment and events in real time. These efforts prompted some 59 million users to generate more than 300 million interactions around the Copa America soccer tournament and roughly 26 million people to change their profile photos to reflect support for the Supreme Court’s decision regarding same-sex marriage, Facebook said last month.\n“Facebook has clearly become the home for global conversations about things that people care about,” Zuckerberg said.\nFacebook launched Live for Facebook Mentions on Wednesday with the backing of celebrities across a wide range of genres. Actor and former wrestler Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, tennis player Serena Williams, country singer Luke Bryan, actress Ashley Tisdale and Martha Stewart will be among the earliest broadcasters.\nVideos from public figures, ranging from politicians to athletes and musicians, will automatically show up in their followers’ news feeds. Facebook users can comment on and share the live videos with their own followers, and see what other public-figure videos their Facebook friends are watching. If they miss it, the videos will be automatically archived and stored on the public figure’s Facebook page.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T07:41:01.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
