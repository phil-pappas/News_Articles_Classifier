Idaho lawmaker appointed to co-chair powerful budget-setting committee \nBy KIMBERLEE KRUESI Published: 8/10/15 1:24 pm EDT - Updated: 8/10/15 1:28 pm EDT \nBOISE, Idaho — Republican state Sen. Shawn Keough of Sandpoint has been appointed to co-chair Idaho's powerful budget-setting committee. \nPresident Pro Tem Brent Hill of Rexburg on Monday announced that Keough will replace former longtime co-chair Sen. Dean Cameron of Rupert, who left the Idaho Legislature earlier this year to lead the state Department of Insurance. \nKeough has served 20 years in the Idaho Statehouse, making her the longest-serving female senator in Idaho's history. \nKeough has also served on the joint budget-setting committee since 2000. She will join Republican Rep. Maxine Bell of Jerome in leading the legislative panel. Keough will also be working closely with Republican Sen. Dan Johnson, who was bumped up to vice-chair — Keough's former position — of the budget committee. \nCommittee chairs are coveted positions in the Statehouse because they have the rare power to kill any bill that crosses their desk. In Idaho's Republican-dominated Statehouse, this means it's more likely for a chairman to allow a hearing for politically favorable bills like a new tax break. Meanwhile, unpopular legislation proposals such as raising the minimum wage or expanding Medicaid eligibility have been killed by chairmen unwilling to anger their Republican caucus or risk slowing down how quickly lawmakers can adjourn. \nChairmanships and committee assignments are typically finalized every two years following the fall election. However, after two veteran senators left the Idaho Statehouse earlier this year, Senate leadership was tasked with reorganizing each legislative panel. This set off a domino of changes, where members were shuffled to fill the missing holes. \nAlong with Keough's appointment, Hill selected Republican Sen. Jim Patrick of Twin Falls to oversee the Senate Commerce and Human Resources Committee. Patrick replaces former GOP Sen. John Tippets of Bennington, who left to be director of Idaho's Department of Environmental Quality. \nThink your friends should see this?
