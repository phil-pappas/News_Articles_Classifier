Davutoglu and the CHP were expected to make separate press statements later.\nThe lira currency weakened to a record low of 2.81 to the dollar on the news. Many investors had hoped for a grand coalition between the AKP and the pro-business, centre-left CHP, and fear another election will prolong uncertainty.\nThe AKP failed to win a parliamentary majority in an election on June 7, leaving it unable to govern alone for the first time since it came to power in 2002.\nDavutoglu has until Aug. 23 to find a junior coalition partner or President Tayyip Erdogan could call a snap election. The AKP is now expected to hold talks with the nationalist opposition MHP, which has hinted it could support a minority AKP government in the short term if it leads to a new election.\n(Reporting by Gulsen Solaker; Writing by Jonny Hogg; Editing by Nick Tattersall )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:19:07.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
