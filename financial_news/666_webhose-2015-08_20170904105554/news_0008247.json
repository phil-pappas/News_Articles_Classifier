But that annualized rate of 5.59 million homes is still below what would be a “normal” rate, he said. Historical patterns show 4.25% to 4.5% of households sell their home annually, he said. That suggests a “normal” level of sales each year in the high 5-million to low 6-million range. \nSales of existing homes rose for a third straight month, hitting the highest annualized rate since February 2007. But the percentage of first-time buyers fell to 28%, its lowest level of the year. Analysts say a healthy number would be around 40%. \n“What’s happening is we’re having competition for multiple age groups for the same inventories, and in those situations, lower-income buyers are now competing with the better capitalized,” Huskey said. \nInventories continued to fall in July, and represent 4.8 months at the current sales rate. Huskey said a healthier rate would be about six months, and there are many markets in the South and Midwest that are closer into balance, unlike in coastal markets such as San Francisco and Seattle. \nOne reason the company’s real-estate agents give him for low inventories is that prospective sellers are uncertain about where to move next, a problem exacerbated by the lack of new construction. The continued though diminishing percentage of owners who are underwater on their mortgage also impacts the ability of owners to put their homes up for sale. \nThe one trend that home builders are expecting, but hasn’t really materialized in perhaps the way that was forecast, is for baby boomers to sell their homes, and then to live in assisted living or retirement homes. “People are retiring at an older age,” Huskey said. “People are not only having to work longer but desiring to, and we are seeing a postponement in those that are electing to sell their property,” he said. \nThere’s also a recent trend for older Americans who sell their property to stay closer to family rather than move out of state, he said. That, he added, may be a psychological reaction from the recession. \n“It’s a sense of what is important,” he said. “They are choosing to live closer to those who they love.” \nShares of Coldwell Banker’s parent company, Realogy RLGY, +0.62% have dropped over the past month, although they are up over 7% during the last 12 months. Heskey declined to comment on the stock price.
