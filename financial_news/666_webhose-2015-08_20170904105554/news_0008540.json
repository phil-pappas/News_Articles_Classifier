It's the end of a long, odd journey that began with Chrysler buying a 15% stake in Mitsubishi back in 1970. In an effort to keep U.S. Mitsubishi sales in Chrysler's column, the two automakers built a plant in Normal in 1988. After making Chrysler and Eagle-brand vehicles there for a few years, Mitsubishi bought out Chrysler's share of the plant in 1991 and escaped Chrysler's clutches altogether in 1993. \nIt had been building cars under its own name in Normal for 20 years but watched production sink from a peak of 223,000 vehicles in 2000 to just 18,500 by 2009. The company eventually brought production levels back up to more than 69,000 by last year, but Mitsubishi's share of the U.S. market slid to just 0.5%. Though Mitsubishi sales in the U.S. are up 25% year to date, the company didn't seem to feel it could carry that plant much longer.
