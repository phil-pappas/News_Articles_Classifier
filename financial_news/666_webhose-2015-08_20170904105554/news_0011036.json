Commercial real-estate buyers focused instead on Brickell, its financial center.\nThat’s changing. Flagler Street, Miami’s historic main street lined with beauty parlors and variety stores, is attracting serious investors who are paying high prices for low-rent properties.\nOlder central business districts in many large cities, from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, have gone through a renaissance in the last 10 years. Now, investors are betting that the time is right for Miami.\nMore on Miami real estate\nProperty Dynasties Team Up to Fund Miami Project Miami Condos Seek Chinese Buyers Condo Builders Fuel Land Rush in Miami Florida’s Fisher Island Mounts a Comeback Consider the recent sale of the Metro Beauty building, a two-story property with a beauty supply store and a barber shop on the ground floor and offices above. The building, located near a train station and a few blocks from the upscale Brickell City Centre, sold earlier this month for $6.8 million. When the building last sold in 2001, the price was $800,000.\n“People have a vision that this is going to be the next hot area,” said Ryan T. Shaw, a vice president at Marcus & Millichap in Miami, who brokered the deal.\nThe capitalization rate on the transaction, which measures the annual return, was about 3.5%, Mr. Shaw said. That low yield suggests the price was high relative to the rent the property produces. “I don’t think anybody really looked at it from a cap rate perspective,” Mr. Shaw said.\n‘ People have a vision that this is going to be the next hot area. ’\n—Ryan T. Shaw, a vice president at Marcus & Millichap in Miami The Metro Beauty building was purchased by Moishe Mana, an investor from New York City who has spent nearly $200 million over the past few years on properties in the Flagler area.\n“This is the oldest section of Miami, and the reason it hasn’t been developed is because it had very fragmented ownership,” he said.\nMr. Mana said he invested in the Meatpacking District in New York City when it consisted of warehouses and has holdings in other sections of Miami and in Jersey City, N.J. He said he plans to improve his properties over the short term but also has long-term redevelopment plans, which he said would commence after the City of Miami implements a revitalization project on Flagler Street that will make it more pedestrian-friendly by widening sidewalks and providing additional space for outdoor cafes. That project is expected to begin in October, according to the Miami Downtown Development Authority.\nAnother driver of investor interest in the area is the nearby Miami Worldcenter project, which will include 1 million square feet of retail space, 600,000 square feet of convention space and an 1,800-room hotel.\nAll Aboard Florida, a passenger-train line being built by Florida East Coast Industries that will run from Miami to Orlando, has plans to build its Miami station near the Flagler district.\n“This area is sort of the hole in the doughnut,” said Alex D. Zylberglait, a senior vice president of Marcus & Millichap. “Downtown historically has been a neglected area, home to low-end retailers. But it’s surrounded by a lot of activity, so that makes it the most logical place for the next wave of redevelopment.”\nIn June, Mr. Zylberglait brokered the $9 million sale of 219 E. Flagler St., a six-story, 42,123-square-foot building that previously sold in 2009 for $2.6 million, a 246% increase. With a cap rate of 3% to 3.5%, he said that “on an income-producing basis, the building is not worth the value that was paid for it.”\nThe buyer, Danny Lavy, a Canadian investor who has made multiple purchases in downtown Miami, plans to renovate the building to create more modern offices or apartments that will rent at higher rates. “I don’t look at instant gratification,” he said. “I look at where the building will be in 10 years.”\nManny de Zarraga, executive managing director of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler L.P. in Miami, said that investors like Mr. Lavy are not speculators.\n“They are visionary developers, because they see in these areas the potential to bring in better quality retail tenants and residential components to cheap old office buildings,” he said. “And, in the course of renovating and upgrading and increasing the rents, they’ll ultimately make the neighborhood better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T22:37:19.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
