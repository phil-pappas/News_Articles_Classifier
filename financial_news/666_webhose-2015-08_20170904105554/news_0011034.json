According to the CFPB, the subsidiary marketed two loan products at dental offices as part of its health-care services financing program – an installment loan and a deferred-interest loan – to assist consumers in paying for dental services. The CFPB contended that consumers were provided inaccurate information related to the terms and conditions of the deferred-interest loan product, finding that, in certain instances, the loan product was marketed as a “no-interest” loan. However, the dental service providers who marketed the loan product failed to note that the 22.98 percent interest rate would be added to the principal if consumers failed to pay the loan in full before the end of the promotional period.
