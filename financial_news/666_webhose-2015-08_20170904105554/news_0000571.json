Rob Homer by Sue Mitchell Online book retailer Booktopia has Amazon's $300 million Australian book revenue in its sights after acquiring its largest domestic rival, Bookworld, from publishing house Penguin Random House.\nThe Bookworld acquisition will boost Booktopia's share of the domestic online book market from 62 per cent to more than 80 per cent and lift sales from $54 million in 2014 to an estimated $90 million by the end of 2015.\nThe purchase price was not disclosed. Penguin Random House paid less than $5 million for the assets of Borders and A&R after the collapse of their parent, REDgroup Retail, in 2011 and rebranded the Borders site to Bookworld in 2012.\nBooktopia chief executive Tony Nash said the acquisition would create significant synergy benefits, boosting the profitability of the combined group and increasing the likelihood of Booktopia pursuing an initial public offer at some stage.\n\"We have a 10,000-square-metre facility in Sydney and have 90 staff. Once we integrate those teams it will be profitable and will make a fantastic contribution to what we are currently doing,\" Mr Nash told Fairfax Media after the deal was announced on Monday.\nBooktopia has about 1.7 million registered users and Bookworld about 1.5 million, although Mr Nash suspects their customers might overlap.\nMr Nash intends to keep the Booktopia and Bookworld brands separate, to give customers a different buying experience, but said the merger would give Bookworld customers access to a wider range of books and better customer service.\nWider range Related Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements Booktopia has four million titles on its website, a similar number to Bookworld, but has 100,000 titles in stock at its dedicated online fulfillment centre in Homebush and a wider range of backlist and academic titles.\n\"There will be an uplift in customer experience because they haven't had the range we've had,\" he said.\nBooktopia's sales have been increasing by 30 to 40 per cent a year over the past few years, reaching $54 million in 2014.\nMr Nash expects that rate of growth to continue as more consumers buy books online and believes sales will eventually match those of Amazon, which is estimated to sell between $200 million and $350 million of books in Australia a year.\n\"It's a $1.8 billion market, so we imagine we'll grow by a similar amount every year by doing what we do and being the majority retailer in our sector,\" he said.\nIBISWorld said retail book sales had fallen more than 5 per cent a year over the past five years, while online book sales had surged 26 per cent a year. Online book sales represent about 7 per cent of the market, well below penetration rates in Britain and the US.\nThe Bookworld acquisition, which will be funded from cash flow and new bank facilities, increases the likelihood of Booktopia's shareholders pursuing an initial public offer, emulating other recently listed pure-play online retailers such as SurfStitch.\nBenchmark \"When you go to the market you have to be of a substantial size, of which $100 million turnover is the benchmark for us,\" Mr Nash said.\n\"We use SurfStitch as a model ... we're not as big as them yet, but if we can do something like that and enable books to be held in the hands of Australian investors and customers, that would be a fantastic outcome,\" he said.\n\"We know what it takes to do that and whether that's the best thing for the company we'd need to see as we go forward. It's very important for us as the owners of Booktopia to create value.\"\nThe company is 90 per cent-owned by the extended Nash family – Tony, his brother Simon Nash, brother-in-law Steve Traurig and sister Elana Traurig – and 10 per cent-owned by staff.\nBookworld chief executive James Webber, who will step down when the purchase is completed later in August, said he was proud of Bookworld's achievements in the past three years and excited about the opportunities created by bringing the two businesses together.\n\"This significantly strengthens this growing and increasingly important channel to market,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:37:49.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
