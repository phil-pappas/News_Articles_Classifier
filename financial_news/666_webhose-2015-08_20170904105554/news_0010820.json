Only slightly more than half have more emergency savings than credit card debt . What's more, even if you have emergency savings, there's a good chance that you're always finding \"reasons\" to spend it. That's going to chip away at your savings, leaving you without the cash you need when you really need it. So how do you know when you're really in a jam and when you're just making excuses? \nEmergency Spending to Keep Things Running... \n\"A good rule of thumb for [tapping into] an emergency account is anything that's a part of your daily life or work that you need in order to keep things running,\" says Ellie Kay, a family financial expert and author of Living Rich for Less (WaterBrook Press, 2008). As an example, she gives auto repairs on the car you use to get to and from work. You need that car to get to work, so go ahead and crack the piggy bank to repair it. \"If you can't drive to work, that's a significant disruption,\" she says. Another example that Kay cites is anything required to maintain your biggest investment -- your home. \"If your roof begins to leak and starts doing damage to your home, that's an emergency fund purchase,\" she says. \"Mold growing because of a leaking roof is a huge disruption.\" More Headlines 25 Collectibles Jittery Stock Market Investors Should Consider Buying \nMedical care is another solid reason for tapping into your emergency savings fund. However, Kay says that this is only true in cases where \"medical care is imperative and not elective.\"\"A nose job is not what your emergency fund is for, unless you have a deviated septum and it's ruining your health,\" she adds. Your emergency fund isn't just for emergency surgeries. Kay says that it can also be for doctor's care and prescriptions, where necessary. \"A lot of people end up filing for bankruptcy, because they had some huge medical emergency that they had to spend their emergency fund on and then some more,\" she says. The point is only to use it for medical procedures that are really necessary. \"Microderm abrasion might help the quality of your skin, but it's not an emergency,\" she says. \nFinally, some forms of travel qualify as emergencies according to Kay. Travel that you need to do for work, but weren't expecting falls in this category. Another example is if you have a child away from home who breaks a leg and you want to oversee medical care process. Or, in an extreme example, if you have a parent who is dying, you want to be able to see your loved one before he passes. Emergency funds could also be spent on moving your family in with other parts of your family if you're active duty and go on deployment. \"But going to Disneyland is not an emergency,\" says Kay. \nThe Four Rules of Emergency Spending... 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T18:23:26.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
