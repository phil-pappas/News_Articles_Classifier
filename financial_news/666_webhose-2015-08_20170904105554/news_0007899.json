The island has been in recession for nearly a decade.\n\"Our committee has jurisdiction over banks ... and we have been working on the safety and soundness concerns of Puerto Rico banks,\" said Duffy, who is separately working on a proposal to look for solutions to Puerto Rico's problems with possible ideas including using a financial control board.\nDuffy requested in an Aug. 4 letter that the U.S. regulator detail how it was addressing potential issues among the island's banks.\nThe FDIC is \"closely monitoring the fiscal and economic situation in Puerto Rico and assessing the potential impact on individual institutions,\" said an Aug. 18 letter from FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg, provided by Duffy's office. The FDIC confirmed its authenticity.\nBeginning in September 2013, the FDIC held regular discussions with the banks it supervises about their holdings of Puerto Rico debt and \"observed a decline in the exposure over time.\"\nThe five FDIC-insured Puerto Rico banks - Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Banco Santander Puerto Rico, FirstBank Puerto Rico, Oriental Bank and Scotiabank de Puerto Rico - had $442 million exposure to Puerto Rico government securities in September 2013. That fell to $240 million as of June 30.\nThe banks are well capitalized, the letter said, and the FDIC stands ready to \"ensure the orderly, least costly resolution of failed insured depository institutions should one of them become insolvent.\"\nDuffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, also said he is working on broader ideas for a draft proposal to address solutions for Puerto Rico.\nIdeas could include a financial control board, an idea proposed in June by Republican Congressman Jeffrey Duncan, and Duffy is examining the possible impact of lifting the Jones shipping Act.\nThe Jones Act requires ships carrying goods from one U.S. port to another to be built in the United States.\nHe did not rule out supporting extending Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection for Puerto Rico entities, currently a Democrat-supported proposal, but would like to see it part of wider reforms.\n\"We have to come up with solutions that help the Puerto Rico people,\" said Duffy. \"It's incumbent upon Republicans to engage on this issue.\" (Reporting by Megan Davies; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T01:54:07.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
