Marc Reed, Verizon's chief administrative officer, said the company is \"disappointed\" it was unable to reach an agreement with the unions despite \"six weeks of good faith bargaining and a very strong effort by the company.\" However, he said Verizon representatives will continue to meet with union leaders. The unions say the telecom giant is demanding that workers sharply increase their health care contributions and make concession on pensions. They contend Verizon is demanding cuts in jobs and job security and wants to either eliminate the company's 401k benefit match or freeze its defined benefit pension. In addition, workers might be asked to pay \"thousands more dollars\" in health care costs due to higher deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance costs, according to the CWA's website. \"Verizon has earned $1billion a month in profits over the last 18 months, and paid its top handful of executives $249 million over the last 5 years, but continues to insist on eliminating our job security and driving down our standard of living,\" Dennis Trainor, a CWA vice president who represents Verizon workers in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts, said in a statement Sunday. \"We're not going to take it, and we're going to keep the fight going while we're on the job.\"Reed said Verizon presented the unions with a counter-proposal Saturday night that included changes to the company's previous proposals on healthcare benefits, retirement benefits and other subjects. He said the company's proposal remains on the table at this time.
