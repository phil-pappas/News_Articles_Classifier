She had been missing since Aug. 11 , when she left her Nyack, N.Y., home with her therapy dog and without her cellphone, officials said.\n“We want to make sure there is no criminality, but at this point it’s deemed a runaway,” South Nyack Police Sgt. Daniel Wilson said.\nIt isn’t clear what kind of relationship the missing teen and the man had, Sgt. Wilson said.\nRosie O’Donnell, an entertainer who previously co-hosted “The View,” posted details about her daughter on Tuesday, appealing to the public for help finding her. A spokeswoman for Ms. O’Donnell later confirmed that Chelsea O’Donnell had run away from home and suffers from mental illness.\nRelated\nRosie O’Donnell’s Missing Daughter Is Found Rosie O’Donnell Says 17-Year-Old Daughter Is Missing Rosie O’Donnell Buys New Florida Home She is believed to have taken a bus to Barnegat to stay with the man, whom she met on Long Beach Island, the official said. She had stayed with him for most of the time she was missing, the official said.\nChelsea O’Donnell obtained a new cellphone and contacted acquaintances to tell them that she was in good physical and mental health, Sgt. Wilson said. She didn’t disclose her whereabouts to anyone until Tuesday, Sgt. Wilson said, at which point one of the acquaintances told the police that she was in New Jersey.\nRockland Police officials then contacted officers in Barnegat and asked them to check a few homes. They eventually found the residence where she was staying, officials said.\nThe man answered the door and seemed visibly shaken while being questioned by the officer, said Barnegat Police Lt. Keith Germain.\n‘He seemed like he had something to hide. He was shaking like a leaf,” said Lt. Germain.\nHe soon admitted that she was there and the teen was found at 6 p.m., inside the home “lucid and cooperative,” said Sgt. Wilson. She was reunited with her family six hours later, officials said.\nChelsea O’Donnell didn’t answer questions about her relationship with the man, officials said. She was in good physical condition and refused medical attention, authorities said.\nInvestigators still don’t know why she ran away from home, authorities said.\n“She doesn’t have a history of running away or going missing,” said Sgt. Wilson, who added there hadn’t been a fight to trigger her disappearance, officials said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Rosie/status/633766797787955201"], "published": "2015-08-19T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T20:50:22.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
