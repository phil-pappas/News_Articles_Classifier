Japan's Nikkei dipped 0.3 percent.\nMSCI's all-country world stock index lost 0.37 percent.\nBritain's FTSE 100 closed down 0.4 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst index of 300 leading shares managed a gain of 0.2 percent, erasing earlier declines. Germany's lost 0.2 percent and France's CAC 40 fell 0.3 percent.\nThe worries over China came on a day when trade in the yuan was relatively calm after Beijing fixed the currency's exchange rate marginally higher for the third successive session.\nChina's central bank on Tuesday set the yuan's midpoint near Monday's closing price at 6.3966 per U.S. dollar. In the spot market, the yuan closed flat at 6.3938 .\nConcerns about slowing growth in China also hit commodities, as benchmark copper prices slid to a six-year low of $4,983 a tonne, to pierce the psychological $5,000 level, and were last down 1.8 percent at $5,022 a tonne.\nBrent oil futures were down 0.1 percent to $48.67 per barrel, edging closer to a six-month intraday low of $48.24 touched last week.\nHowever, U.S. crude futures rebounded from a near 6-1/2-year low to trade up 1.5 percent to $42.49 on bullish U.S. housing data and bets for an inventory decline, as well as short covering ahead of the front-month contract expiration on Thursday.\nInvestors will look to U.S. inflation data and minutes of the latest Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, as they look for clues when the Fed will begin raising interest rates.\nMost investors are expecting a rate hike will occur by the end of year. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last down 9/32 in price to yield 2.1819 percent.
