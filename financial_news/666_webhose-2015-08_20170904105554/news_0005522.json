Advertising Print This Post \nLocalBitcoins, a global marketplace facilitating the in-person trade of bitcoins, has joined several other major industry players to call it quits in New York. \nThis week marks the end of a 45-day grace period for businesses dealing in virtual currency to either apply for the BitLicense, or close shop. Some of the larger, well-capitalized companies like Coinbase have applied, while itBit is exempt by virtue of its qualifications as a banking institution. \nMany crypto businesses, however, have decided to no longer market their services to New York residents. They cite the licensing requirements and/or applications process as overly burdensome, not worth the return on investment. This week saw both Bitfinex and Kraken withdraw from the state. \nOn its blog, LocalBitcoins expresses regret that for withdrawing from another region, “due to regulators.” Last year, it halted service in Germany after being contacted by BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), the country’s financial supervisory authority, also apparently on the matter of licensing. On New York, the company writes: \n“We’re sad to say that due to regulators another region has had to be blocked from LocalBitcoins. From today onwards users from New York are no longer allowed to use LocalBitcoins because of the legislation known as the BitLicense (23 NYCRR 200) which makes it a federal offense to sell virtual currency to people living in New York unless you have applied for the license.” Got a news tip?
