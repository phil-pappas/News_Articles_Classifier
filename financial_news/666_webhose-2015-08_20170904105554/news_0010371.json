However, after failing to win support in parliament, they may ask states to pass their own laws. \nModi has had to issue temporary executive orders in the past seven months that allow the government to forcibly purchase farmland for industrial development. He has failed to secure the votes in parliament needed to make the changes permanent. \nLand reform is critical for Modi's drive to build new roads, homes and factories and, if stalled, would blight his vision of 100 new 'smart' cities across India linked by industrial corridors and high-speed rail routes criss-crossing the country. \nConflict between farmers and companies trying to secure land for industrial projects has hampered India's plans to expand its network of highways, build mines and other infrastructure, holding up about $300 billion of investment. \n(Reporting By Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Paul Tait)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T11:40:59.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
