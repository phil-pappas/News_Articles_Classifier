It would assist us and the people of South Australia if they were to be as open as they possibly can be,\" Mr Weatherill told reporters on Tuesday. \n\"I think people are becoming frustrated in seeking to understand where BHP stands, what their level of commitment is to South Australia. \n\"You don't need to guarantee anything. We just need to understand what the trajectory is, what their thinking is beyond a media statement with a few cryptic lines.\" \nBHP said its decision to cut jobs was not a reflection of SA government policy settings but was driven by global challenges in the resources sector and the need to transform Olympic Dam into a sustainable operation. \nThe latest job losses will reduce the total workforce at Olympic Dam to about 3500. \nThe company offered little else on its future plans, including the status of a major expansion that still has state government approval despite being mothballed by the company in 2012. \nDespite his concerns, Mr Weatherill said there was some cause for optimism and that barring another major slide in commodity prices, employment levels at Olympic Dam should stabilise before starting to grow again. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook SA premier urges BHP to be more open AAP \nMining giant BHP Billiton owes it to the people of South Australia to be open about future plans for the Olympic â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:36:10.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
