Foreign currency assets were up by $894 million in the week ended August 21, indicating that the central bank may have bought dollars from the market.\nForeign currency assets are a loose indicator of the central bank’s interventions in the market.\nHowever, change in reserves also reflects the movement in currencies such as euro and the dollar as part of the reserves are invested in assets denominated in these currencies.\nThe Indian rupee has lost 3.4% ever since the Chinese yuan was devalued twice in the week ended August 14.\nIt has been the worst performing currency in Asia.\nEven as the rupee fell to a two-year low, there were talks that the RBI had stepped in to sell dollars and slowdown the rupee’s depreciation.\nThis week too, the central bank was seen selling dollars to prevent a sharp fall of the rupee. The currency fell past the psychological 66/$ mark on August 17 following a global stock and currency market rout on worries over the Chinese economy.\nThe currency has recovered to end at 66.16/$ on Friday.
