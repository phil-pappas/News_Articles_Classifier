He also called up DMK leader M Karunanidhi and JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda.\n“Todayu2019s agreement is a shining example of what we can achieve when we deal with each other in a spirit of equality and respect, trust and confidence; when we seek to understand concerns and try to address aspirations; when we leave the path of dispute and take the high road of dialogue. It is a lesson and an inspiration in our troubled world,” the Prime Minister said at the signing ceremony.\nTerming the six-decade-old Naga problem as a contribution of the colonial rule, he said, “it is one of the tragedies of Independent India that we have lived with this legacy.”\nHe said there were not many like Mahatma Gandhi, “who loved the Naga people and sensitive to their sentiments. We have continued to look at each other through the prism of false perceptions and old prejudices.”\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 10:55 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:04:37.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
