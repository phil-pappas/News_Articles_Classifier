A strong and secure country is vital to both our prosperity and national security. \n\"There will be thousands more jobs right here in Faslane, as well as across the UK supply chain. Across Scotland, around 12,600 people work in defence and my defence spending commitments will secure these jobs and provide huge opportunities for defence, security and technology companies all over the UK.\" \nBut the SNP and Plaid Cymru, who want to scrap the Trident missile system, accused the Chancellor of \"wasting billions\". \nThe SNP's Westminster defence spokesman, Brendan O'Hara, said: \"There is something fundamentally wrong with Westminster's values and priorities if the Chancellor thinks wasting billions on nuclear weapons is something to boast about when people are dying within our benefits system. \n\"And in defence terms too, at a time when Scotland's conventional defence footprint has never been smaller with major capability gaps, base closures and personnel numbers at an all-time low, it seems the Treasury apparently has a limitless pot to keep an unwanted and obscene arsenal of nuclear weapons afloat. \n\"Investment in Faslane is welcome - but it must be as a conventional base - and not more money spent on weapons of mass destruction.\" \nPlaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood AM said: \"Plaid Cymru has long campaigned for Trident to be scrapped altogether. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is perverse to claim that billions should be spent on outdated weapons of mass destruction when so many are being hit by welfare sanctions and struggling with stagnant wages. \n\"With the parliamentary vote on Trident renewal expected next year, I hope the Labour Party will be able to rise above its current rifts and speak with one voice against attempts to commit the UK to a new generation of nuclear weapons.\" \nFaslane, around 40 miles from Glasgow, is home to missile-carrying Vanguard submarines and recently welcomed the third of seven planned Royal Navy Astute class attack submarines. \nThe Ministry of Defence is also expected to base the Successor class on the Clyde when they come into service from 2028, with crews and engineers potentially calling Faslane home until at least 2067.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:34:02.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
