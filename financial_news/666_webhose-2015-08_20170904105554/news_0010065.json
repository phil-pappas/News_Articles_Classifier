Moller-Maersk, said the gas condensate field contains an estimated 250-300 million barrels of oil equivalent.\nProduction is expected to start in 2019 and continue for at least 13 years, with plateau production of 60,000-90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\nMaersk Oil said last week it would seek regulatory permission to shut its Janice installation, which produces around 7,000 barrels per day from three UK North Sea oilfields, due to falling oil prices.\n($1 = 0.6481 pounds) (Reporting by Ole Mikkelsen; editing by Jason Neely )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T10:20:42.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
