Broadening the base of the goods and services tax is one way this can be done.\"\nThe ACT announced in its May budget that it would slash payroll tax for small business and axe stamp duty on business insurances, while NSW Small Business Minister John Barilaro says that state needs to work towards scrapping the tax.\nRead next: The Business Council's tax reform plan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:59:51.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
