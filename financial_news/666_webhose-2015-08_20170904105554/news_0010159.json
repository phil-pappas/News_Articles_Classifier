She spoke on condition of anonymity because of department rules preventing her from being named.\nPolice and firefighters didn't know the cause of the blast and were prevented in initial efforts from trying to investigate it because fires were still raging at the site hours after the explosion and a series of smaller blasts.\nSpanish national television said the blasts in the aftermath of the main explosion also hindered a search operation for people missing immediately after the incident.\nBy late afternoon, no more people were reported as missing, the spokeswoman said.\nThe factory was purchased in January by Etienne Lacroix Group and the French company said at the time that the plant's Spanish management team would continue running the business.\nA woman who answered the phone at Etienne Lacroix said the company based near Toulouse had no immediate comment and referred inquiries to a company manager who did not immediately respond to an emailed message seeking comment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
