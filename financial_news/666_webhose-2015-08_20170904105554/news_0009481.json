Baseball agents Seth and Sam Levinson paid tribute to their longtime client Jorge Posada with an intimate party at Tao Downtown Lounge on Friday, August 21 in honor of his number retirement by the New York Yankees. The low-key event, attended by close friends and family, included two of Posada’s most famous teammates, Derek Jeter – accompanied by girlfriend Hannah Davis – and Tino Martinez. At the end of the night, Posada was served with a pinstriped cake, complete with jersey No. 20. The former Yankee humbly thanked friends and family for their support and contribution to his career success.\n“Jorge is one of the greatest catchers in the history of the game and absolutely deserving of the honor of having his number retired by the most storied franchise in sports history,” said baseball agent Seth Levinson of Posada.\n“Our celebration was not just to honor Jorge’s great career as a warrior on the field but also to embrace the fact that he is a caring, giving and charitable man off of it,” added baseball agent Sam Levinson.\nIn his brilliant, 17-year career – entirely with the Yankees -- Posada won five World Championships, made five All-Star teams, hit 275 home runs and drove in 1065 runs. His career on-base percentage (.374) and OPS (.848) rank among the greatest marks by a catcher in MLB history.\nABOUT ACES INC.\nACES – Athletes’ Careers Enhanced and Secured – has represented professional baseball players for over 25 years.
