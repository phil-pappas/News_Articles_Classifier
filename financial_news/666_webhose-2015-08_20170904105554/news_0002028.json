Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Battle lines for the election have been drawn. Climate policy, superannuation, tax reform and refugees, and the arguments over the numbers around them, will likely decide who wins government.\n15 per cent GST hike It's a rare election where a sitting Prime Minister takes a major tax change – indeed a tax hike – to the people. Tony Abbott could take a GST increase to the next election but only if there are major shifts in the position of Australia's political leaders between now and 2016.\nWhen NSW Premier Mike Baird proposed a 15 per cent GST earlier this month as a salve for the states' health funding ills, it put him at odds with some of his Coalition colleagues and, of course, some of the Labor Premiers whose kneejerk response echoes that of their federal counterpart Bill Shorten.\nThe Commonwealth has already withheld $80 billion in health and education funding. Baird said health funding will be short by $35 billion a year by 2030, without a change to the consumption tax and Australia would be in danger of \"tumbling over a fiscal cliff\".\nBut Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk, with the backing of ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr, prefer raising the 2 per cent Medicare levy to 4 per cent over eight years. It would effectively raise the income tax rates on Australia's ever-shrinking proportion of working taxpayers at a time when the rest of the developed world is shifting away from incentive-destroying income taxes to less economically harmful consumption taxes.\nAbbott has warned the GST should not be just for raising revenue but be part of a broader tax reform process, including getting rid of the some of the states' own inefficient taxes and associated tax revenues to which they remain addicted.\nAt the end of the leaders' summit in Sydney last month, the split between the federal government and some of the states makes the task of reaching agreement between all levels of government an ever remote possibility.\n On the upside, Abbott has softened his previous approach demanding any change to the GST would require the support of all the states and the federal opposition. Now \"something approaching a consensus\" could be enough.\n15 per cent tax on high super earnings It's the generation-dividing argument that will dog the next federal election. Which Australians are needy enough to require taxpayer support to save and survive in retirement?\nThe Coalition and the Greens argue the pension system is unsustainable, but Labor argues it is the superannuation system that needs to be fixed.\nLabor has taken a gamble in suggesting the tax advantages of the superannuation system, the invention of its own hero Paul Keating, now needs to be reined in to stop those with millions in their super funds from paying no tax on their earnings.\nIn contrast, Treasurer Joe Hockey has promised the government is committed to making no changes to super this parliamentary term or next. Instead, the Coalition is focused on the \"millionaire pensioners\" and has made a deal with the Greens to start lowering the asset thresholds at which the part-pension cuts out – from $1.5 million excluding the family home for couples to $820,000 but not until July 1, 2017. It would save the budget a hefty $2.4 billion once introduced.\nLabor says the tax-free status of superannuation earnings is disproportionately beneficial to high-income earners and is unsustainable. Instead anyone earning more than $75,000 a year from their superannuation fund would have to pay 15 per cent tax on any extra income from 2017.\nIt would affect approximately 60,000 superannuation account holders with superannuation balances in excess of $1.5 million and has the surprising support from many in the financial services industry, including Brad Cooper, the head of Westpac's wealth business.\nAs The Australian Financial Review revealed on Friday, Cooper says retirees should start paying on income tax on annual super earnings of more than $150,000 to ensure the system is sustainable. Cooper, the chief of BT Financial Group, has picked that figure because it is twice that of average weekly ordinary earnings – $75,000 currently – and takes into account that for many households, a single person's super will fund the retirement of a couple.\n50 per cent renewable energy When news leaked that Labor was considering options for a new emissions trading scheme a week before the party's high-stakes national conference, tabloid newspapers labelled Bill Shorten a \"carbon tax zombie\". Party insiders talked of a deliberate plan to destabilise another Labor leader through the contentious issue of climate change.\nWhile Shorten did say that if elected he would announce a new low-cost emissions trading scheme dealing in international permits to accompany a massive boost in renewable energy, there remains ambiguity about just how committed some in Labor are to the party's 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.\nLabor frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon described it as an \"aspiration\", not a policy. Shadow environment minister Mark Butler described Labor as having \"an open mind\" about lifting the share of renewable energy from 23.5 per cent in 2020 under current laws, which demands electricity retailers to buy renewable energy or pay a fine.\nMeanwhile, the Coalition has stuck with its promise of a Direct Action plan – a reverse auction where the government buys back carbon at the lowest price through planting trees, capturing gas from landfill and supporting energy efficiency. And is yet to announce its post-2020 target for the Paris climate talks in December.\nAbbott has been under fire for ordering the Clean Energy Finance Corporation – the government-owned organisation that the Coalition would like to abolish and yet can not – to stop putting funds into wind power.\nNevertheless wind power will be a side issue for the Coalition which will remind voters of the peril of Labor governments that love to impose \"damaging, economy-wide taxes that no other country has implemented\".\nThe great unknown is whether voters attitudes toward climate have changed since the 2013 election. Will the Coalition now be seen as being so out of step that the electorate is willing to risk a Shorten government's ambitious 50 per cent target?\n27,000 refugees It's been a tough learning curve for Labor. The Coalition's hardline boat turnback policy has indeed \"stopped the boats\".\nAfter an hour-long emotional debate at the national conference, Labor has shifted its position on the loaded asylum-seeker issue in a move that the party's pragmatists hope will neutralise Coalition attacks come election time as well as potentially minimise the devastating loss of life that occurred under Labor's old policy.\nIn government, Labor would leave open the option of turning back asylum seeker boats in the Java Sea where it was safe to do so. It's an acknowledgment that turnbacks do save lives, but it has also tested the unity of the party with the left wing still bruised.\nIn order to win over the Left, Shorten has promised a Labor government would give $450 million to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to help provide health and education services to asylum seekers. Labor would also raise the refugee intake to 27,000 a year by 2025 at an extra cost of $1.9 billion over a decade.\nThere's still room for the Coalition to run an election campaign against Labor on immigration, with the unhappiness of deputy leader Tanya Plibersek over the change, giving the Coalition opportunity for mischief making about future leadership spills and policy reversals.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:05:50.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
