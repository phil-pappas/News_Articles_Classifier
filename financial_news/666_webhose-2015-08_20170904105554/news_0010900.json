That&apos;s only the second time this has happened in the history of the index. May 15, 1940, marked the end of the last three-session period in which this occurred:\nBespoke Investment Group This string of sizable deviations from the 50-day moving average is a testament to just how severe recent losses have been compared to the index&apos;s recent range.\n\"Not even the crash of 1987 got this oversold relative to trend,\" writes Bespoke.\nThe money management and research firm produced a pair of analogue charts showing what&apos;s in store if the S&P 500 mimics the price action seen in mid-1940. Overlaying the axes gives the impression that the worst of the pain is behind us, and a market bottom isn&apos;t too far off:\nBespoke Investment Group However, indexing the S&P 500 to five sessions prior to the tumult shows that a replication of the mid-1940 plunge could see equities run much further to the downside and into a bear market:\nBespoke Investment Group If it tracked the 1940 trajectory, the S&P 500 would hit a low of 1,556 in relatively short order. But Bespoke doesn&apos;t think stocks are fated to repeat that selloff.\n\"There is nothing, nothing , we have seen - Chinese fears, positioning, valuation, or any other factor - suggests to us that we are headed to 1556,\" the analysts write. \"More likely, in our view, is something along the lines of the top analogue; we doubt the bottom is in, but see it unlikely we enter a bear market and a true stock market crash.\"", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iZoHryMehPuQ/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ipS4DYZjY9vc/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/isXVAYucce.o/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://www.bespokeinvest.com/\\"], "published": "2015-08-26T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T18:16:53.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
