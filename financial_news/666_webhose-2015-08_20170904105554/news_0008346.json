This suggests that demand for energy may remain tepid,\" he told AFP. \nAsian shares fell on Friday, continuing a global sell-off in equities that hit Wall Street overnight and saw the Dow reach its lowest level this year as concerns about the health of the world economy snowballed. \nAnalysts fear a slowdown in China, the world's second-biggest economy, could drag on global growth and curb energy demand -- bad news for oil prices at a time when markets are already oversupplied with crude. \nOil has managed to hold above the key $40 a barrel mark, but US banking giant Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) said on Wednesday prices could fall to $32 a barrel, a multi-year low last seen in 2008. \nInvestors will be watching the weekly US oil rig count, due on Friday, to see if a slump in crude prices has started to dampen production in the world's top consumer. \n\"If we would to see any relief for crude prices, it has to come from production cuts,\" Aw said. \nThe United States and producers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have decided against cutting high production levels despite falling prices as they fight over market share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T07:03:30.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
