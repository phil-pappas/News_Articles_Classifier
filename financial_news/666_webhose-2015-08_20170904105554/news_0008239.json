Supplied \"I know Andrew and Paul Bassat pretty well from my days at Wotif,\" Mr Cooke said. \"They're good guys, they're smart operators and they really do have a compelling business and a great footprint globally. In terms of the short-term focus, I think it's a fact of life â€¦ You have to listen. But you have to make the right decisions and do what is right for your company at the right point of time.\"\nWesfarmers CEO Richard Goyder said: \"From time to time the market gets a bit more skittish so it reacts more strongly to short-term things. It tends to fix itself over time. Maybe we are in a period like that.\n\"Right now if you deliver below expectations or deliver an outlook statement that has any negativity about it, it seems to me you get hammered and then presumably if the underlying business is strong things sort themselves out over time.\"\nLatest scalp Yet another top-20 company saw more than 10 per cent of its market value evaporate after an underwhelming result on Thursday. The latest scalp was Origin Energy, which closed at $8.60, a loss of $1.29 or 13 per cent. Origin reported a net loss for 2014-15 as write-downs hit the bottom line.\nFund managers agree the market's reactions have been especially extreme this r eport ing season . They attribute this to shorter time horizons for investment, the activity of short-sellers, and the fact that the reporting season has come at a time when valuations are steep.\nBut while that might apply to CSL, which traded at $100 a share the week before its result pushed the stock down as much as 6 per cent, that does not necessarily apply to stocks in the energy sector, which were already sold-off on the commodity price crunch.\nGarth Rossler, Maple Brown Abbott chief investment officer, said this results season was a unique one.\n\"I suppose the question is, is it a more volatile reporting season than usual? And on balance I think it is,\" he said. \"You've got a couple of additional pieces this time around, which is the weakness in commodity prices and the bank capital,\" referring to the $16 billion cash call imposed on investors as three of the big four banks top up their reserves. It is believed that has led to selling in other sectors to fund buying of the new bank equity.\nMr Rossler added: \"Quite a lot of industrial stocks are on pretty premium ratings and I think you just don't dare miss if you're sitting on 25 times earnings or something like that. Contrast that with Orica, which wasn't sitting on a high multiple at all but still managed to fall [as much as 17 per cent].\"\nMalcolm Whitten from Nikko Asset Management said: \"The reactions this reporting season have been more extreme. I think it's a function of the starting point of market valuations, so expectations and share prices are situated more precariously and where there's disappointing news, the end result has been more savage,\" he said.\n\"I wouldn't relate that necessarily to the market being more short term.\"\nMr Whitten did not see market forecasts as being overly bullish heading into the reporting period because commodities were already in bear-market territory and the bank capital raising had been well flagged.\n\"Generally I think there was cautious expectations, companies that miss those have been dealt with harshly,\" the fund manager said.\nAMP CEO Craig Meller said businesses that are \"very clear about their strategy and their plans, and how value will emerge\" will be rewarded by shareholders. \"There are investors who are looking for different cash flow signatures,\" he said, alluding to the obsession with dividends. \"Our mindset as a company is how do we make sure that we deliver for the short term, and we deliver for the long term.\"\nwith Ruth Liew", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:47:16.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
