The metal lost nearly seven percent of its value in July on the prospect of the first U.S. rate hike in nearly a decade.\nSpot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,085.80 an ounce by 0923 GMT. Bullion breached an important support level at $1,100 in a late July rout that pulled it as low as $1,077, its weakest since February 2010.\nU.S. gold for delivery in December slipped 0.5 percent to $1,085.50 an ounce.\n\"It is more likely than not that we see gold below $1,000 in September, once the Fed announces its rate hike,\" Natixis analyst Bernard Dahdah said.\n\"The five pillars that used to bolster the price of gold are now eroding: central bank demand has weakened, Indian consumption has also been weaker since 2013, U.S. quantitative easing has ended, exchange-traded funds have become a source of supply because investors are selling and Chinese demand is not as strong as it used to be.\"\nPlatinum and palladium wallowed near multi-year lows on a global glut and prospects of sluggish demand from the automotive sector.\nSpot platinum fell 0.7 percent to $945 an ounce, close to $940.50 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2009. Palladium was unchanged at $592.50, after hitting a near three-year low of $586.33 in the previous session.\n\"We suspect that we will see a steady grind lower across most commodity complexes, including gold, largely attributable to the strength of the dollar and poor technicals that will only encourage more funds to further increase their short side exposure,\" INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said.\nThe dollar rose to its highest since April against a basket of major currencies. The next main data event is the release of U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. Before that, the ADP employment and ISM non-manufacturing surveys will be in focus.\nHoldings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped further on Tuesday to 21.56 million ounces, the lowest since September 2008.\nSilver slipped 0.5 percent to $14.50 an ounce.
