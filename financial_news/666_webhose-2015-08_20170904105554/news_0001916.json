The answer is becoming harder to pin down \nNest, the internet appliance company bought by Google last year, and Google Fiber, a high-speed broadband project, will also be separated, with all of the separate units owned by Alphabet. \nGoogle’s shares rose by as much as 5.8pc in after-hours trading following the announcement. Shareholders in Google will now become shareholders in Alphabet, which will continue to be listed in New York on Nasdaq. \nMr Page will become Alphabet’s chief executive, and Mr Brin president. Mr Pichai, Google’s product chief who was seen as Mr Page’s effective number two , will take over Google itself. \nThe company’s two founders created Google while at Stanford University in California in the 1990s, and have retained control of the company through its history, growing it into the internet’s biggest search engine and one of the world’s most valuable companies. Android dominates the smartphone market and YouTube is the world’s biggest video website. \nHowever, Mr Page and Mr Brin have also expressed loftier ambitions, investing heavily in medical science, space exploration and robotics. In a statement last night, Mr Page said separating these areas from Google’s core business, which is driven largely by online advertising revenues, would allow such projects to have more independence. \n• Google shares jump after hint it may rein in spending • Google quietly releases new Google Glass \nThe move will leave the day-to-day running of Google to Mr Pichai, with Mr Page adopting a more hands-off approach. \n“As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, ‘Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.’” Mr Page said. \n“As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make ‘smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.’ \n“From the start, we’ve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have.” \nInvestors in Google have asked questions about the company’s heavy spending on research and development in recent years. Mr Page said the restructuring will make Alphabet “cleaner and more accountable.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:53:36.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
