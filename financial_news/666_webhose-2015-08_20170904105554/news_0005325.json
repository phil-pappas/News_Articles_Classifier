Share on twitter by Kate Cowling If you're still in your 30s and early 40s, you can afford to be mostly in growth assets. And if you're a decade away from retiring, it's your last chance to ramp up your savings for what could be 30 years out of the workforce.\nTop up super by salary sacrificing: Darren Howard, an adviser at Ord Minnett, says he personally learned the power of compounding at an early age and encourages people to salary-sacrifice up to 14 to 15 per cent of their pay, including the employer contribution. Adviser Patrick Canion of ipac adds: \"Even if it's a case of doing salary sacrifice for a couple of percentage points, to bring your employer contribution of 9.5 per cent up to 11 per cent, it counts.\"\nTarget super post-mortgage: \"As you come out of your 30s and hit your 40s, it's time to get serious about paying down non-deductible debt – your mortgage, any personal loans, education loans, try to knock them on the head, \" says ipac adviser Patrick Canion. \"Then you've got to start building up your super.\"\nHe recommends putting any extra savings into super – even if it's a couple of thousand here and there – for its favourable tax treatment in your 30s and 40s. Then he suggests ramping up efforts in your 50s to hit your yearly contribution limits, now $35,000 a year.\n\"You want to stop earning as much from exertion and start letting your investments do some of the work. Try to max it out if you can.\"\nWork out how much you'll really need in retirement: everyone has a different standard of living, but it's crucial to ascertain how much you can live on before you retire. Financial adviser Suzanne Hadden, founder of BFG Financial Services, says one couple she advises set an aspirational yearly benchmark of $140,000 a year, while others have far more frugal expectations. \"One of the few things you can control is budgeting,\" she adds. Even if you're still in your 40s, being able to keep to a budget will be vital to your retirement plans.\nDe-risk gradually: in the decade before retirement, Canion says it's time to shift some of your assets out of shares and into defensive safe havens like cash and bonds. \"We say you should enter retirement with two to three years worth of cash to protect you from market volatility,\" he adds. You will still need growth assets to grow your investments as, once again, your retirement could span three decades and you'll need your nest egg to at least keep up with inflation.\nPlan your next career: it's a bit naive to think you'll never work again after retirement, Canion believes. Even if it's one day a week doing casual or volunteer work, people often find themselves occupied in some capacity. \"People tend to retire from full-time work, have a rest, go on a cruise maybe, but then after six months the word gets out that they're looking for stuff to do and they start receiving calls. Before they know it, they're working three to four days a week,\" he says. The trick is to start planning what that may be now.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:42:16.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
