Officials said that he most likely could not see his partner at the back of the truck from that position. \nThe workers' full-face masks and helmets make it difficult to communicate. \nThere were no other workers present at the site of the incident. \nTEPCO officials said they did not know why the victim could not escape when the hatch started coming down, or whether any screaming was heard. \nPolice are investigating the incident, said TEPCO, which did not disclose the victim's name. \nThe decades-long decommissioning of the plant, which was wrecked in the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan, involves thousands of workers. \nThe number of accidents last year, including injuries and sickness, doubled to 64 from a year earlier. Saturday's death, the second this year, occurred weeks after the government and TEPCO announced plans to slow down projects to improve safety. In January, a worker died after accidentally falling from atop a storage tank. \nThe two men involved in Saturday's incident were assigned to the truck used at the site where a frozen underground wall is being installed near highly contaminated reactor buildings, a project aimed at curbing a contaminated water problem hampering the decommissioning of the plant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T17:26:55.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
