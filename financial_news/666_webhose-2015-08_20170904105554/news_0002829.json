AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Wall Street markets were composed at the end of a tumultuous trading week, as China's plunging currency stabilised and positive American economic data settled skittish investors.\nAn agreement between eurozone finance ministers on Friday night over a third bailout for Greece, worth €85 billion, also boosted investor sentiment during late trading in the US.\nFor the first time this month, the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its second straight day of gains on Friday, rising 0.40 per cent to 17,477 points.\nThe S&P 500 Index gained 0.39 per cent to 2091 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ edged 0.29 per cent higher to 5048.\nDespite a big sell off midweek in response to the shock yuan devaluation, US stock indexes eked out minor gains over the past five trading days.\nThe yuan rose on Friday after three days of heavy devaluation engineered by the People's Bank of China. The Chinese currency finished the week about 3 per cent lower against the US dollar.\n\"With the yuan raised up a little bit on Friday, things are starting to stabilise,\" said Empire Executions president Peter Costa in New York.\nA degree of normality returned to currency markets as the yuan steadied. The Australian dollar recovered ground to enter the weekend hovering around US73.78¢, after the dollar touched as low as US72.15¢ on Wednesday.\n However, emerging Asian economy currencies across Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore, as well exchange rates in Russia and Turkey, remained under selling pressure, as the fallout from the yuan devaluation and lower oil prices took hold.\nDespite weak leads from Europe and Asia, US share indexes jumped on Friday in light of promising economic data.\nRobust US industrial production and consumer confidence figures added to signs that the American economy remains on course, despite headwinds from overseas.\nIndustrial production surged 0.8 per cent in July, due to the manufacturing of more vehicles.\nProducer prices remained subdued growing 0.2 per cent last month.\nMore positively, consumer sentiment remained at elevated levels, falling only slightly to 92.9 from a very high 93.1, according to the University of Michigan.\nThe latest positive data follows a jump in US consumer spending revealed on Thursday.\n\"After the solid increase in retail sales in July, this still high level of confidence suggests that the strength in sales will probably continue in August,\" said Capital Economics economist Adam Collins.\n\"What's more, with gasoline prices falling once again, confidence may well rise back to the highs seen at the start of the year. That would bode well for consumption growth beyond the third quarter.\"\nOil prices continued to fall on Friday as oil supply swamped the market, taking the price of US crude oil down almost 4 per cent for the week and 20 per cent in the past month.\nUS WTI crude oil has plunged more than 30 per cent from a recent peak in June .\nBrent crude was fetching $US49.03 a barrel on Friday, just above a six-year low. US WTI crude was trading at $US42.30.\nDespite the big falls in energy prices, the S&P energy stock index was the best performer this week, rising 3 per cent.\nPositively for the American industry, Reuters reported that the Obama administration would allow limited oil exports to Mexico under a swap arrangement , a small step in reversing the ban on crude oil exports.\nOn Friday, major share indexes outside the US finished the week on a downbeat note.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 fell 0.71 per cent to 3491, Germany's DAX lost 0.27 per cent to 10,985 and Britain's FTSE 100 declined 0.27 per cent to 6,550.\nIn Asia, the Nikkei lost 0.37 per cent on Friday to finish the week at 20,519, while the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 shed 1.92 per cent to 4073.\nThe losses follow a dismal week on the Australian stock market. Australian equities fell to a seven-month low and into correction territory, as company profit results underwhelmed and the shock yuan devaluation sparked selling of shares.\nOn Friday the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index declined 31.4 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 5356.5 , to be 2.2 per cent lower for the week.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-08-15T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:10:55.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
