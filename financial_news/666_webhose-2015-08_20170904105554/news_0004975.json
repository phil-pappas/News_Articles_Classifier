Bloomberg by Noah Buhayar Berkshire Hathaway shares traded near record highs at the beginning of Warren Buffett's 50th year running the company. More recently, the stock has begun to sag.\nShares have slumped 5.2 per cent since December 31 and are headed for their first annual decline since 2011, even as Buffett pulled off one of the biggest coups of his career last month. By backing HJ Heinz's merger with Kraft Foods Group, he now holds a stake valued at about $US26 billion ($35.37 billion), more than twice what he paid.\nThere's less to celebrate about some other Berkshire investments and businesses. Buffett's railroad has had to spend heavily to come back from service delays last year. His reinsurance business, a main source of funding for the company, is facing increased competition. And some of his biggest equity investments - like International Business Machines and American Express - have lagged the market.\n\"We're talking about a large, diversified portfolio of companies,\" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones. \"Some will underperform and some will outperform.\"\nOver the past five decades, Buffett has built Berkshire into a sprawling operation and amassed one of the best investing records in history. Through 2014, the company's share price averaged annual gains that were more than double the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. The equity benchmark is up 1.7 per cent this year.\nBerkshire's dozens of subsidiaries include insurers, manufacturers, retailers, electric utilities and the railroad, BNSF. Buffett also oversees a stock portfolio valued at more than $US100 billion.\nThe diversity of those investments could help the company post operating earnings per share of $US3038 when results are released on Friday, according to the estimates of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That's a 15 per cent increase from a year earlier.\nBuffett's favoured yardstick - book value - could have risen by about 2 per cent to about $US150,000 a share during the second quarter, according to an estimate from Cliff Gallant, an analyst at Nomura Holdings. The billionaire Berkshire chairman and chief executive officer has said the metric is a good, though understated, proxy for the company's true worth. Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $US214,150 on Tuesday.\n Book value per share would get a boost in the current quarter as Berkshire recorded a gain on the Kraft and Heinz bet, said Gallant. The food companies completed their merger last month to create Kraft Heinz Co.\n'Improved profits' down the track \"It seems like he's executing,\" Gallant said of Buffett. \"The stock price doesn't always follow that.\"\nBerkshire faces challenges.\nCarloads at Buffett's railroad slipped 0.1 per cent in the second quarter from a year earlier. That's a narrower decline than at its Western US competitor Union Pacific, but some costs have been climbing at BNSF. Buffett pledged to spend $US6 billion on upgrades this year after delays last year that were tied to a surge in oil shipments and harsh winter weather.\nHe wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in February: \"Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. Our huge investments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits should follow.\"\nBuffett has been less sanguine about the future of Berkshire's reinsurance operations. For decades, he's used the premiums held by these businesses until paying claims, called \"float\", to fund his stock picks and takeovers. In May, he said the prospects for that business had \"turned for the worse\" as hedge funds and other investors piled into the industry, driving down the price of coverage.\nTo counteract that trend, Berkshire has begun to focus on underwriting policies directly for businesses. The company's reinsurance chief, Ajit Jain, has been overseeing the effort even as he hunts for new deals. In June, Insurance Australia Group agreed to cede a fifth of its premiums and risk to Berkshire, as part of a decade-long tie-up. IAG had more than $9 billion ($US6.6 billion) in premium revenue last year.\nBuffett has less control over the companies in his stock portfolio - and some of them have been struggling.\nHe invested almost $US11 billion to amass a stake in IBM in 2011. Since then, the computer-services provider has worked to transform itself into a seller of cloud-computing technology and data analytics. Revenue has slipped for 13 straight quarters. IBM shares now trade below the price that Buffett paid for them.\nAmEx, another of Berkshire's largest stock investments, has plunged about 19 per cent this year. It is nearing the end of a partnership with retailer Costco Wholesale, a relationship that accounted for 20 per cent of worldwide loans and 8 per cent of customer spending.\nBerkshire's cash pile has been growing in recent quarters and stood at a record $US63.7 billion at the end of March. While that money is earning almost nothing, long-term shareholders will wait for Buffett to make his next big investment, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette and Woods.\n\"I don't think they or their investor base care if it takes another five years for things to be attractively valued,\" he said. \"Berkshire is very disciplined in terms of what it's going to pay.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-15/buffett-s-berkshire-hathaway-pays-a-500-million-for-stake-in-iag", "http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-02/buffett-says-reinsurance-peak-is-history-as-hedge-funds-pile-in", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-22/american-express-profit-beats-estimates-as-expenses-decline"], "published": "2015-08-06T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:08:56.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
