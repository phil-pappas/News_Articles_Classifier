She filled online orders for more than a decade, working through summer heat and winter chill inside the company's south-central Kentucky warehouse.\nOne constant was the pace that Milby tried to keep to avoid write-ups from her supervisors that could put her $12.50-per-hour job at risk .\" \nOn Saturday, The New York Times wrote: [At Amazon, workers are encouraged to tear apart one another's ideas in meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the company boasts are \"unreasonably high.\" The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another's bosses . Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: \"I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.\")] \n\"This is a company that strives to do really big, innovative, groundbreaking things, and those things aren't easy,\" said Susan Harker, Amazon's top recruiter, according to the NYT. \"When you're shooting for the moon, the nature of the work is really challenging. For some people it doesn't work.\" \n[Bo Olson was one of them. He lasted less than two years in a book marketing role and said that his enduring image was watching people weep in the office, a sight other workers described as well. \"You walk out of a conference room and you'll see a grown man covering his face,\" he said. \"Nearly every person I worked with, I saw cry at their desk.\" ] \nThe Times said it interviewed more than 100 current and former Amazon employees, including many who spoke on the record and some who requested anonymity because they had signed agreements saying they would not speak to the press. The newspaper said Amazon spokesmen declined to comment further on Monday. Jay Carney, Amazon's chief spokesman and President Obama's press secretary until June 2014 , appeared on \"CBS This Morning\" to defend the company. \"This is an incredibly compelling place to work,\" he said, having traded one job for another where a brass neck is a more important attribute than telling the truth. \nSaturday's report says: \"Amazon employees are held accountable for a staggering array of metrics, a process that unfolds in what can be anxiety-provoking sessions called business reviews, held weekly or monthly among various teams. A day or two before the meetings, employees receive printouts, sometimes up to 50 or 60 pages long, several workers said. At the reviews, employees are cold-called and pop-quizzed on any one of those thousands of numbers.\" \nVox quotes Brad Stone in his history of Amazon : [During one memorable meeting, a female employee pointedly asked Bezos when Amazon was going to establish a better work-life balance. He didn't take that well. \"The reason we are here is to get stuff done, that is the top priority,\" he answered bluntly. \"That is the DNA of Amazon. If you can't excel and put everything into it, this might not be the place for you.\"] \nVox adds: [The Amazon expos√©'s clearest analogue is Anne-Marie Slaughter's viral Atlantic article \"Why Women Still Can't Have It All,\" which limned the difficulty of working a top job at the State Department while also trying to be a good parent. Slaughters records her frustration at \"how unexpectedly hard it was to do the kind of job I wanted to do as a high government official and be the kind of parent I wanted to be.\" \nSlaughter's article was the most-read piece in the Atlantic's history.] Jeff Bezos' message to Amazon staff \nDear Amazonians, \nIf you haven't already, I encourage you to give this (very long) New York Times article a careful read:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T10:33:18.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
