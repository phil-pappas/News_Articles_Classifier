The decline also included a $US71 million loss from paying off $US2.9 billion in secured notes.\nThe drop came even though worldwide sales rose five per cent to 762,000 for the quarter, including a six per cent increase in US retail sales to individual buyers. Revenue for the quarter role nearly 11 per cent to $US22.6 billion, mainly because of higher global sales and prices. Chief Financial Officer Richard Palmer said the Jeep brand had its best quarter ever with global sales up 47 per cent from a year ago to 316,000. Jeep, which sells only four-wheel drives, is benefiting from the global popularity of the higher-sitting vehicles in the past year. The quarter's pretax profit margin for the unit, known as FCA US LLC, were six per cent, up from 4.8 per cent a year ago. Last week, the parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, reported that its North American pretax margin had hit 7.7 per cent. Palmer said the FCA margins were lower because they included lower-profit international sales and because of the difference between US and international accounting standards. Profit margins are the percentage of revenue that a company gets to keep. The recall charge came from a consent agreement announced last month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The company was assessed a record $US105 million penalty for recall problems including delays in notifying customers, distributing parts and telling NHTSA of problems. It must pay a $US70 million civil fine, plus make $US20 million in safety-related improvements. It would have to pay another $US15 million if it violates the agreement. The Italian-American parent company, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, last week raised its outlook for the year due to strong North American sales and a European recovery. It reported a net profit for the quarter of $US364 million.
