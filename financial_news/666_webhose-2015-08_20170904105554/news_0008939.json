Maruti Suzuki is the largest passenger car maker in the country and Maruti Suzuki S Cross does pack a punch. But will it turn into a big rival of Hyundai Creta? Check this out:\n1) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Exteriors\nAesthetically, Maruti Suzuki S Cross is not nearly as attention-grabbing as Hyundai Creta which does put the former on the back foot. Comparing the two vehicles, Hyundai Creta seems a winner based simply on looks alone. In fact, the premium price tag that Hyundai has placed on the new compact SUV seems to be paying off at the moment. Maruti Suzuki S-Cross is a little dull compared to Hyundai Creta, which borrowed its appearance from the luxury SUV Santa Fe.\n2) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Price\nThe price factor will play an important factor in determining whether or not Maruti S Cross is able to overcome the prowess of Hyundai Creta which does make a lasting impression compared to any other compact SUV in the market. If S-Cross can undercut the starting price of Creta, which is Rs. 8.59 lacs, it can surely prove itself a value for money car.\n3) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Interiors\nMaruti Suzuki S-Cross actually manages to outperform Hyundai Creta here. Features like SmartPlay touchscreen unit, first in class cruise control, auto dimming IRVM are worth considering while the quality of materials used is top notch as well.\n4) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Powerplant\nUnder the hood too, Maruti Suzuki S-Cross does a fantastic job using the formidable 1.6 litre Multi Jet Engine from Fiat. The 1598cc displacement of the engine uses four cylinders having four valves each generating a rather modest power of 118bhp at 3750rpm. The torque delivered, however, is a massive 320Nm at 1750rpm which is 60Nm more than what Hyundai Creta has to offer which is a big difference. Hyundai Creta, on the other hand, has a 1.6 litre CRDi engine under its belt that has a 1582cc displacement and delivers 126.2bhp power at 4000rpm and 259.9Nm torque at 1900 to 2750rpm.\n5) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Brakes\nOn the braking front as well, Hyundai Creta falls short of Maruti Suzuki S Cross where the latter offers disc brakes for both front and rear wheels. Hyundai Creta, on the other hand, misses out on the disc brakes for the rear wheel although the same is provided for the front.\n6) Hyundai Creta vs Maruti Suzuki S-Cross: Mileage\nBut what exactly makes Maruti Suzuki cars stand out and garner such an overwhelming response? If mileage is what you are thinking then it is indeed correct. And this is another factor that can play a vital role in determining the performance of Maruti Suzuki S Cross against the likes of Hyundai Creta. Despite the large torque of 320Nm, Maruti Suzuki S Cross manages to give a decent mileage of 22.7kmpl for the 1.6 litre DDiS engine and 23.65kmpl mileage for 1.3L DDiS engine. Creta, on the other hand, offer healthy figures of 21.38 kmpl for 1.4 CRDi with 6-Speed MT while the 1.6-litre CRDi gives 19.67 kmpl with 6-Speed MT and 17.01 kmpl with 6-Speed AT.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 2:44 pm Â© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd", "external_links": ["http://www.cardekho.com/carmodels/Maruti/Maruti_SX4_S_Cross"], "published": "2015-07-31T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:32:25.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
