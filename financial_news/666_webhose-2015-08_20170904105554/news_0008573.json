American markets followed suit with the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 immediately down by 0.8pc. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) came after the Shanghai Composite Index fell another 0.8pc, after dropping almost 40pc since its peak in June . \nBritish markets were closed for the bank holiday. \nAnother contributing factor is the possibility of an interest rate increase in the US in the coming months. \nFederal Reserve official Stanley Fischer hinted at the weekend that the market turbulence may not have pushed back the rate hike, despite market expectations that it would not be possible to increase the cost of borrowing at a time of financial disturbance. \n“We should not wait until inflation is back to 2pc to begin tightening,” he said. But he also noted that policymakers should “consider the overall state of the US economy, as well as the influence of foreign economies on the US economy, as we reach our judgment on whether and how to change monetary policy”. \nHe was speaking at the monetary policy conference at Jackson Hole in the US, shortly after Bank of England governor Mark Carney had also made clear that the market volatility in China had not pushed his plans for a UK rate rise expected in the next year off the table. \nAs a result, upcoming jobs data in the US will be watched closely this week to see if strong numbers could clear the way for a rate rise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T21:17:33.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
