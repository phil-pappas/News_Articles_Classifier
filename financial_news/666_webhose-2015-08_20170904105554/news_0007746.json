It reached a two-week high of $1.5690 overnight after comments from Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes reinforced expectations of an impending rate hike, but has pulled back on caution ahead of inflation data due later in the session.\nAnalysts said British inflation may be forecast to remain soft in the short term, but many - including the BoE - expect it to climb in coming months as the economy and wages pick up.\nThe Australian dollar edged down 0.1 percent to $0.7365 but was still comfortably above a six-year low of $0.7127 hit last week when the yuan's plunge churned the currency markets.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:15:02.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
