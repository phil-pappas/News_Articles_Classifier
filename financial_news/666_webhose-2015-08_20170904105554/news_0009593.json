Bloomberg by Steve Johnson \"Be greedy when others are fearful.\" That's what Warren Buffett tells us, and it's a philosophy that has made him one of the world's richest people. Almost by definition, of course, it is easier said than done.\nOthers are usually fearful when there is something to be fearful about. And it's never going to be apparent whether you are experiencing a mild panic from which the market will quickly recover or the beginning of the next financial crisis.\nThere is nothing more important, however, than to do the right thing during times of market stress. Bad decision-making in times like this can undo a lifetime of hard work and sensible investing.\nAt the very least, investors need to make sure they ride it out. If you are fully invested at the top of the market, make sure you are still fully invested at the bottom. This is a perfectly sensible strategy. The average return from being invested in equites is significantly higher than in the bank, so as long as you ignore the inevitable ups and downs of the market, you will do better than most.\nIn an ideal world, though, you want to be a beneficiary of panic. Almost all of the world's great investors have earned their reputations by having a contrarian bent. They are prepared to go against the crowd and wade in when others are rushing for the exit.\nOur investment firm, Forager, is only six years old but we have this contrarian bent wired into our DNA. It's not easy. If it were easy, we wouldn't have market panics to begin with. But there are some things that help us make the right moves in stressful times.\nDon't ever let yourself be a forced seller. Panicked selling is one thing, but forced selling is even more of a disaster. It can be caused by a number of things, like margin loans, fund redemptions or mandate changes, but you need to make sure you are never on the wrong side of one of these transactions. That means little or no debt and lots of liquidity, and you'll never have to sell a stock that you know is screamingly cheap.\nCheck that the world is still turning. While many people do view it as a casino, the stock market is actually a place where you can buy a small part of a real business. When markets are panicking, I find it soothing to take a little tour around some of the businesses you can buy on the stock market. I stroll down to Woolies. It seems like people are still doing their shopping. I take a drive on a toll road and the traffic is as bad as ever. It looks like the owner Transurban is still collecting toll revenue. People are still using their mobile phones, maybe Telstra is going to be OK? I usually come back content that the world is not actually coming to an end, despite what the newspaper headlines are telling me.\n Stick to what you know. This is not the time to be researching new stocks you have never heard of because their prices have fallen 50 per cent. You have hopefully been working away in boom markets to develop a list of stocks you would like to own at the right price. This is the time to dust it off and put it into action.\nFocus on better-quality businesses. We were sifting through the rubble of the 2008-09 bear market two years after the subsequent recovery and were still finding screaming bargains. In times of turmoil, invest in the businesses you know are great and come back for the rest later.\nKeep some ammunition. Last week the market bounced back from Monday's lows very quickly, but it won't always be like that. There will be times it falls 10 per cent, then another 10 per cent, then another 20 per cent after that (the All Ordinaries index saw a peak to trough correction between October 2008 and March 2009 of 57 per cent). There's nothing worse than getting all excited over a 10 per cent fall only to see the market plummet further, so don't use all of your spare ammunition at the first sign of turmoil.\nDon't be blindly contrarian. In the financial crisis many value investors piled into banks and financial services companies as their share prices plummeted. It turned out the panic merchants were right to panic. This time around it is China's economy that has everyone panicking and there are some good reasons for it. Be wary of stocks that are genuinely exposed to the risk of a slowing Chinese economy, even if these are the stocks that have fallen the most.\nAnd finally, act. Subject to the caveats above, don't sit on your hands waiting for some divine signal that the market has \"turned\". Last week provided further evidence, if you needed any, that prognosticators don't have any ability to predict what the market is going to do from day to day. Markets could always fall further (in which case you will still have some ammunition to take advantage of it) but the aim is to be a buyer of stocks in times of turmoil. Override those emotions and make sure you act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:02:30.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
