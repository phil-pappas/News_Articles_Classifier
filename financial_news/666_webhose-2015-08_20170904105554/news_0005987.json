Shire and Baxalta each had revenues of about $6 billion in 2014. \nOrnskov said it was Shire's \"strong preference to immediately enter into a negotiated transaction to explore the full potential of the proposed combination and finalize the terms of an agreement\". \nHowever, Baxalta said Tuesday that it rejected the Shire bid because it \"significantly undervalues\" Baxalta and its potential. \n\"Our board strongly believes that Baxalta's independent global infrastructure and world-class manufacturing operations will provide an excellent platform to grow value for our shareholders,\" Baxalta chief executive Ludwig Hantson said in a letter to Ornskov released shortly before 2000 GMT. \n\"We are just in the initial stages of implementing our growth strategy as a standalone company and our stock has not yet achieved a price level that appropriately reflects the company?s value and prospects. A transaction at the exchange ratio you proposed significantly understates Baxalta's true value.\" \nBaxalta was spun off from Baxter International (NYSE: BAX - news ) on July 1 with a focus on bleeding disorders, immunology and oncology. \nLast October, US pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (Xetra: 4AB.DE - news ) pulled the plug on a proposed $54 billion takeover of Shire (Amsterdam: QB8.AS - news ) -- handing the latter a $1.6 billion breakup fee. \nAbbVie had said the transaction became untenable owing to the \"unacceptable level of risk\" following new US Department of Treasury rules intended to discourage deals in which US companies merge with foreign competitors to shift their headquarters to countries with a lower tax rate. \nBaxalta jumped 11.9 percent to $37.10, while US-traded Shire shares fell 5.4 percent to $253.60.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:16:30.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
