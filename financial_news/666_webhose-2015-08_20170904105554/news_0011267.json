Net income amounted to US$208m from a loss of $573m last year. Gross margin widened to 23.1% from 21.7% in the year ago quarter, while sales were down $1.8bn to $6.2bn in the quarter ended 1 August. The latter was related to streamlining actions taken by the company last year. \nNeil Saunders, CEO of Conlumino, noted: “While Sears can play for time with its various financial machinations, it cannot shrink its way to long term profitability. To do that it needs to grow same store sales and to improve productivity.” \nThe Bon-Ton Stores US department store retailer The Bon-Ton Stores has warned on the second half and adjusted its full-year guidance as its net loss widened in the second-quarter. For the three months ended 1 August, net losses amounted to US$39.6m from $36.2m a year earlier. Gross margin increased 24 basis points to 36.8%, but net sales fell 1.4% to $555.4m, pressured by unseasonably cool weather. Comparable sales were down 1.3%. For the full year, Bon-Ton is forecasting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $145m to $155m. \nL Brands L Brands, owner of lingerie brands Victoria's Secret and La Senza, has lifted its full year earnings outlook after booking a 7.5% increase in net profit. Net income reached $202.5m for the three months to 1 August, compared to $188.4m in the same period last year. Sales rose 3% to $2.77bn from $2.68bn a year ago. Comparable store sales were up 4%, helped by a 3% gain at Victoria's Secret and a 5% increase at Bath & Body Works, while direct posted a 5% decline. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to range from $3.58-3.73, up from its earlier guidance of $3.50 to $3.70. \nAlthough third-quarter EPS is forecast to be between $0.40 and $0.45, below the street's estimate of $0.49, Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe believes it is likely “a case of under promise, over deliver”. \nTarget Corp General merchandise retailer Target Corp has raised its full-year earnings guidance after seeing its second-quarter profit increase more than threefold. Net earnings reached $753m for the three months to 1 August, compared to $234m in the same period last year. Sales increased 2.8% to $17.4bn from $17bn last year, while comparable store sales rose 2.4%. Online sales grew 30%. Gross margin improved to 30.9% from 30.4%, reflecting the benefit of annualising heightened promotional markdowns in the second quarter of 2014, and a favourable merchandise mix this year. Target now expects full-year 2015 adjusted EPS to reach $4.60-4.75, compared to its previous guidance of $4.50-4.65. \nChairman and CEO Brian Cornell said: \"While the momentum in our financial results is encouraging, we have much more to accomplish. Looking ahead, we are focused on making further progress against our strategic priorities and are committed to improving operations as we move through the important back-to-school, back-to-college and holiday seasons.\" \nAmerican Eagle Outfitters Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters saw its net profit increase more than fivefold, thanks to record sales. Net income reached $33.3m for the 13 weeks to 1 August, compared to $5.8m in the same period a year ago. Revenue grew 12% to a record $797m from $711m last year, while comparable store sales increased 11%. Gross margin rose 230 basis points to 35.7%. Interim CEO Jay Schottenstein said he was \"pleased\" with the performance, adding that customers have taken notice of improvements to our merchandise and overall customer experience. \nStifel analyst Richard Jaffe said: \"We believe the momentum of American Eagle Outfitters' merchandise turnaround is strong and sustainable. Going forward, merchandise improvement, combined with easy comparisons, should drive EPS growth.\" \nCiti Trends Value fashion retailer Citi Trends returned to profit in the second quarter, thanks to higher sales. Net income reached $200,000 for the three months to 1 August, compared to a loss of $2.6m in the same period last year. Sales increased 6.1% to $153.9m from $145m, while comparable store sales were up 3.9%. \nPhoenix Footwear Phoenix Footwear saw its net loss widen, weighed down by lower sales and margins. The company's net loss amounted to $651,000 for the three months to 4 July, compared to a loss of $375,000 in the same period of the prior year. Net sales fell 5% to $4.1m from $4.3m a year ago, primarily due to an increase in discounts and markdown allowances provided to US online and big box retailers. Gross margin declined to 28.1% from 33% last year. \nWal-Mart Stores Retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores cut its full-year earnings outlook after posting a 16.6% decline in second-quarter net profit. Net income amounted to $3.64bn for the three months to 31 July, compared to $4.36bn in the same period a year ago. Earnings were pressured by currency fluctuations, lower Wal-Mart US margins and investments in customer experience. Net sales were flat at $119.33bn, with growth of 4.8% in the US and a 9.6% decline in its international business. Sam's Club saw a 0.9% fall in sales. Total online sales (both national and US) grew by 16%. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to a range from $4.40-4.70, compared to its previous guidance of $4.70-5.05. \nConlumino analyst Neil Saunders said: \"Wal-Mart has struggled to generate overall growth across its global operation. However, this masks a great many initiatives and developments which are now powering the domestic operation. At home, Wal-Mart is fighting back – arguably, something that should be a concern to many other retailers.\" \nTJX Companies The TJX Companies has upped its full-year outlook after posting a 6.1% increase in second-quarter profit, thanks to higher sales. For the three months to 1 August, net income reached $549m, compared to $517.6m in the same period of last year. Sales increased 6% to $7.4bn from $6.92bn in the prior year, while comparable store sales were up 6%. Gross margin improved 0.5 percentage points to 29.1%, primarily due to buying and occupancy leverage on the 6% comp growth. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to range from $3.24 to $3.28, compared to its previous guidance of $3.21-3.27. \nConlumino analyst Neil Saunders said: \"Looking ahead, we remain positive about the future prospects of TJX – especially because we believe the company has a very balanced growth programme which will allow it to drive gains from a number of different initiatives.\" \nDick's Sporting Goods Dick's Sporting Goods has lifted its full-year earnings guidance after booking a 30.8% hike in net profit. Net income reached $90.8m for the 13 weeks to 1 August, compared to $69.5m in the same period in the prior year. Sales increased 7.9% to $1.82bn from $1.69bn last year, while same store sales climbed 1.2%. Same store sales at Dick's Sporting Goods rose 1.5%, while Golf Galaxy fell 2.9%. The company now expected full-year earnings per share to be $3.13-3.21, compared to its earlier guidance of $3.12-3.20. \nUrban Outfitters Lifestyle retailer Urban Outfitters saw its net profit edge down 1%, despite record sales. Net income amounted to US$66.8m for the three months to 31 July, compared to $67.5m in the same period last year. Sales increased 7% to a record $867m from $811.3m last year. Comparable retail store sales, which include its comparable direct-to-consumer channel, were up 4%, with Free People increasing 14%, Urban Outfitters 4% and Anthropologie Group 2%. Wholesale sales grew 21%. Gross margin declined by 71 basis points year-on-year, primarily driven by higher delivery and fulfilment centre expenses. \nFBR & Co analyst Susan Anderson sees good Urban Outfitters progress, but light Anthropologie trends decrease visibility. \"While we are encouraged by Urban Outfitters momentum and its initiatives, Anthropologie did not appear to show significant inflection in late 2Q,\" she said. \nAmerican Apparel Ailing retailer American Apparel reported a wider loss, with both sales and margins falling. Net loss amounted to US$19.4m for the three months to 30 June, compared to a loss of $16.2m in the same period of the prior year. American Apparel said the results includes $8.3m related to significant charges. Sales fell 17.2% to $134.4m from $162.4m last year. Gross margin dropped to 45.8% from 50.7%, primarily due to lower retail sales coupled with the negative effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes and an increase in workers compensation and health benefit costs. \nJC Penney Department store retailer JC Penney adjusted its full-year earnings outlook after seeing its net loss narrow. For the three months to 1 August, net loss amounted to US$138m, compared to $172m in the same period last year. Sales were up 2.9% to $2.88bn from $2.80bn, while comparable store sales increased 4.1%. Men's, home, Sephora and fine jewellery were the company's top performing merchandise divisions. Gross margin improved 100 basis points to 37% from 36% a year ago, driven by improvements in our clearance and promotional selling margins. The retailer now expects full-year EBITDA to reach $620m, up from its earlier guidance of $600m. \nConlumino analyst Stephen Ward said: \"Although there are many criticisms of JC Penney, none of these are to denigrate the work done to date, which has helped stabilise a company that was at risk of failing. However, there is no doubt that JC Penney remains a work in progress.\" \nNordstrom Upscale fashion retailer Nordstrom booked a 15.3% increase in second-quarter net profit, reflecting new strategic initiatives and growth investments. Net earnings reached US$211m for the three months to 1 August, compared to $183m in the same period of the prior year. Sales grew 9.2% to $3.6bn from $3.3bn, while comparable store sales increased 4.9%. \nConlumino analyst Neil Saunders said: \"Overall, we believe that Nordstrom is striking the right balance between ambition and caution. Its steady pace of expansion, coupled with its innovation to services and products, mean its sales outperformance looks set to continue.\" \nKohl's US department store retailer Kohl's saw its second-quarter net profit slide, due to a delay in back-to-school shopping, as a number of states shifted their tax-free sales from July to August. Net income plummeted 44% to $130m for the three months to 1 August, from $232m in the same period a year ago. Sales, however, edged up 0.6% to $4.27bn from $4.24bn, while comparable store sales climbed 0.1%. Gross margin dropped to 38.9% from 39% last year. Conlumino analyst Stephen Ward said: \"Despite a weaker quarter, we believe Kohl’s remains one of the long term winners.\" \nDillard's US department store retailer Dillard's said it was \"disappointed\" with its second-quarter performance, after reporting a 13.3% decline in net profit. Net income amounted to $29.9m for the 13 weeks to 1 August, compared to $34.5m in the same period of the prior year. Sales rose 2.6% to $1.51bn from $1.48bn last year. Total merchandise sales edged up 0.5% to $1.47bn from $1.46bn, with comparable store sales also climbing 1%. Gross margin declined 119 basis points year-on-year. \nMacy's US department store retailer Macy's has lowered its full-year sales guidance after reporting disappointing second-quarter results. Net income amounted to US$217m for the three months to 1 August, down 25.7% from $292m in the same period last year. Sales fell 2.6% to $6.10bn from $6.27bn in the prior year, while comparable store sales were down 2.1% year-on-year. The company blamed the decline on the removal of a major Friends & Family event, planned markdowns due to delayed shipments from the West Coast port slowdown, lower demand in many categories, and a stronger US dollar, which impacted international tourist spending. The company expects sales to fall 1%, compared to its earlier guidance of a 1% increase. \nWhile Stifel analyst Richard Jaffe expects near-term weakness at Macy's, he believes the retailer's strategic initiatives, including the sale of its downtown Brooklyn store to Tishman Speyer, will \"play out favourably\" in the longer term. \"We believe Macy’s continued focus on improving the customer shopping experience through both ease of shopping and through a better product assortment, will continue to help the company gain share and drive sales profitably.\" \nBlack Diamond Outdoor equipment and apparel business Black Diamond widened its net loss in the second quarter to US$5.4m from $4.4m a year earlier as a result of restructuring costs. Gross margin increased 280 basis points, despite headwinds from foreign currency, while sales were up 7% on a constant currency basis to $35.1m. \nIconix Brand Group Brand management company Iconix Brand Group saw its second-quarter net profit halve, due to lower revenues. Net income amounted to $19.4m for the three months to 30 June, compared to $38.8m in the same period a year ago. Revenues fell 17.2% to $98.5m from $118.4m last year, but included a 1% increase in licensing revenue to $98.5m. Licensing revenue was negatively affected by approximately $3.7m due to foreign exchange rates. Excluding this, licensing revenue rose 5%. Chairman and CEO Peter Cuneo said the company's core underlying licensing business \"remains healthy\". \nKate Spade & Co Kate Spade & Co returned to profit during the second quarter, helped by rising sales. Net income reached $8.5m for the three months to 4 July, compared to a loss of $4.4m. Sales increased 5.7% to $281m, with direct-to-consumer comparable sales growing 10%, or 12% excluding e-commerce. Kate Spade North America saw sales rise 13.1%, while international sales declined 17.3%. Adelington Design Group sales plummeted 44.3% to $5m. \nWeyco Group Weyco Group saw foreign exchange headwinds drag on second-quarter earnings. Net earnings amounted to $2.1m for the three months to 30 June, compared to $2.5m in the same period last year. Sales, however, rose 2% to $63.9m from $62.9m a year ago. North American wholesale sales grew 7% to $48.1m, while the North American retail segment saw sales fall 5% to $5m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:12:43.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
