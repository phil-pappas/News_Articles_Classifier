Most of them do so for obvious reasons such as being retired or still in school. \nBut 6 million of them--up 12% since 2007--work part time because they have a vision for their life that doesn't include being tied to a single employer. Many of these workers are young and well-educated. \nHaving seen their parents dedicate their lives to a single profession they didn't necessarily love and then suffer through the Great Recession anyway, more young people are pursing a better work-life balance and making time for pursuits that they're passionate about. With a patchwork of freelance gigs and part-time jobs, they can earn enough to get by while pursuing the creative or not-for-profit work that excites them. \nIf this sounds enticing and you want to slash your income in order to give you time to follow your dreams, here are some financial changes worth considering. \nMinimize fixed expenses. \nTo make this work, you're going to need to live a frugal lifestyle and get your monthly expenses as low as possible. This could include living with your parents or roommates when many of your peers are living alone. Think about it as not cutting expenses, but paying for the time you'll need to follow your dreams. \nLook into a small loan. \nIf you're trying to finance a small online venture or a side gig as a freelancer, see a credit union about a personal or small business loan to help cover your startup costs. Many credit unions have programs designed to help entrepreneurs, and as not-for-profit financial cooperatives, they are more service and relationship oriented than other lenders. \nPlan for taxes. \nIf you're earning income through a small business, online or as a freelanceranything where you're self-employedbe sure to set aside enough to cover income and self-employment taxes. Many first-time self-employed individuals are caught off guard by how much they owe come tax time. Also, keep careful records of your expenditures so you can take advantage of all allowable deductions.
