That came despite WTI falling Monday to its lowest close in six and a half years, at $38.24 a barrel. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's just incredible,\" said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group. \"The reason why oil prices have come back is we're feeling the sell-off was overdone.\" \n\"Most of the sell-off wasn't about demand destruction but fears of future demand destruction. When oil prices went below $40 a barrel, that was a signal people thought that because of China, the global economy was going to grind to a halt,\" he said. \n\"But now, you look at the economic data that's coming from both Europe and the US, those fears that the China slowdown is having a big impact on the global economy are probably overstated.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T22:46:44.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
