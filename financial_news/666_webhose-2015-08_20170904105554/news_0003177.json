Photo: Tesla Motors\nPeople like the electric cars produced by Tesla Motors so much that the company can't crank them out fast enough. Most companies would love to be in such a position. But for Tesla, it's becoming a problem.\nTesla Motors fell in extended trading on Wednesday after the electric-car maker backed off its full-year vehicle sales forecast.\nTesla said it now aims to deliver 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles this year, compared with a previous target of 55,000. The company sees third-quarter production and deliveries of just more than 12,000 vehicles including just a few Model X sport utility vehicles.\nReaching the initial target may be a stretch because some interior suppliers might not be able to increase the flow of high-quality parts fast enough to meet the Model X production plan, chief executive officer Elon Musk said on a conference call with analysts. Because the SUV and the existing Model S share the same assembly line, a shortfall by one Model X supplier could slow output of both vehicles.\n\"The pace of progress is really dependent on which supplier is the slowest and least lucky,\" Musk said on the call. \"It's a complex product, with thousands of suppliers.\"\nSome analysts had been skeptical about Tesla's plans to increase deliveries by 74 per cent this year, especially with so much of the increase coming late in the year.\nMusk insisted the SUV would be worth the wait.\n\"The Model X is a particularly challenging car to build, maybe the hardest car to build in the world,\" he said. \"But it is an amazing vehicle and I think it will blow people away.\"\nThe company said it still expected to begin delivering the SUVs late next month and that final testing is \"going well\". But even a one-week delay could reduce output by 800 vehicles, Tesla said.\n\"Simply put, in a choice between a great product or hitting quarterly numbers, we will take the former,\" Musk and chief financial officer Deepak Ahuja said in a letter to shareholders, posted on the company's website. \"To build long-term value, our first priority always has been, and still is, to deliver great cars.\"\nTesla stock fell 5.8 per cent to $US254.35 ($345.88) at 7.25pm New York time after tumbling as much as 9.3 per cent following regular trading. Tesla had gained 21 per cent this year through to Wednesday's close, outpacing the 2.4 per cent increase by the Russell 1000 Index.\nMassive battery factory The loss excluding some items was 48 cents a share, the Palo Alto, California-based company said. The average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for a 60-cent loss.\nThe Model X had previously been targeted to go on sale in 2013, then by the end of 2014.\n\"We have been producing release candidate Model X bodies in our new body shop equipped with more than 500 robots as we fine-tune and validate our production processes,\" Tesla said in the letter.\nAs production of the SUV increases, the company would become free cash-flow positive, probably near the end of this year and \"certainly\" for the first quarter of next year, Ahuja said.\nConstruction on the massive battery factory, called the gigafactory, east of Reno, Nevada , continues. Manufacturing of battery cells, modules and packs is set to start early next year. Tesla also said it would ramp up production and delivery of its Tesla Energy suite of batteries for use by homes, commercial businesses and utilities in the fourth quarter.\nStates like California see energy storage as a critical tool to better manage the electric grid, integrate a growing amount of solar and wind and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Tesla has said that its stationary batteries have the potential to scale faster than vehicle sales.\nMusk said in the letter that second-quarter Model S orders in Asia \"nearly doubled from last quarter, helped by the initial success of our revised China strategy\".\nTesla said last quarter that sales in China were \"showing encouraging signs\". The world's largest car market has the potential to become Tesla's biggest customer base, too, but concerns about charging and early mistakes by the sales staff stymied the company's entry. Now the market is slowing a bit and China's SUV-loving consumers won't get the Model X until the first half of next year.\nTesla said it will reveal the design of its Model 3 - a $US35,000 \"mass-market\" car - in the first quarter. Deliveries are expected to start in late 2017.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/energy/the-latest-view-of-teslas-massive-nevada-gigafactory-20150725-gikl8t"], "published": "2015-08-06T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:53:43.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
