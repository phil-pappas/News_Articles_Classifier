Investors are keen for any details on when and how the Fed might shrink its holdings. \nIn minutes of its July meeting released Wednesday, the Fed made clear that officials expect to keep up the reinvestment policy during the early stages of interest-rate normalization, and to only pare reinvestments when economic conditions and the outlook allow. \nNo decisions on how to shrink the balance sheet were made at the meeting, and officials agreed to discuss the policy further at future meetings. \n\"Most participants thought that it might be best either to wind down reinvestments or to manage them in a manner that would smooth the decline in the balance sheet in a predictable way,\" the minutes said. \"However, some participants supported ceasing reinvestments all at once at the appropriate time.\" \nOfficials also discussed using different strategies to pare mortgage-backed securities and Treasuries.
