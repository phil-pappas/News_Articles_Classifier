Palm is down 4 percent so far this month. \nTraded volume stood at 37,256 lots of 25 tonnes each, above the roughly 35,000 lots usually traded by the close. \n\"Production in the third quarter will be excellent,\" said a trader with a foreign commodities brokerage in Kuala Lumpur. \"Demand is tapering (off) at rates not seen before. India and China are on the sidelines watching and commodity funds are largely sellers.\" \nIn other vegetable oils, the U.S. August soyoil contract added 0.7 percent in late Asian trade, while the most active soybean oil contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange climbed 1.6 percent. \nPalm oil stocks in Malaysia, the world's No.2 oil palm producer after Indonesia, likely rose in July as output picked up, while lower demand for exports after the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan also added to inventory levels, a Reuters poll showed. \nAs production looks set to rise during the coming peak weeks, the uncertain demand outlook remains, made worse by economic concerns and top buyer China. \nAsian share markets were in a mixed mood as the mounting risks of a hike in U.S. interest rates as early as next month lifted the dollar and bond yields, pressuring currencies across the region. \nHelping cap losses, the Malaysian ringgit is the worst performing emerging Asian currency in 2015 and is the currency that benchmark palm is priced in, offering some support to the tropical oil. \nOil prices rose for a second day, recovering from a drop below $50 a barrel after weekly data showed a fall in U.S. crude stocks, although a stronger dollar tempered gains. \nPalm, soy and crude oil prices at 1008 GMT \nContract Month Last Change Low High Volume \nMY PALM OIL AUG5 2030 -25.00 2030 2070 6 \nMY PALM OIL SEP5 2036 -25.00 2024 2079 992 \nMY PALM OIL OCT5 2035 -27.00 2023 2082 20255 \nCHINA PALM OLEIN JAN6 4644 +18.00 4624 4676 485372 \nCHINA SOYOIL JAN6 5496 +84.00 5456 5508 563128 \nCBOT SOY OIL DEC5 30.26 -5.40 30.24 30.53 4450 \nINDIA PALM OIL AUG5 401.80 -5.40 401.40 408.00 1017 \nINDIA SOYOIL AUG5 566.45 -2.95 566.00 570.50 22170 \nNYMEX CRUDE SEP5 45.91 +0.17 45.79 46.32 25910 \nPalm oil prices in Malaysian ringgit per tonne \nCBOT soy oil in U.S. cents per pound \nDalian soy oil and RBD palm olein in Chinese yuan per tonne \nIndia soy oil in Indian rupee per 10 kg \nCrude in U.S. dollars per barrel \n($1 = 3.8770 ringgit)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:38:46.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
