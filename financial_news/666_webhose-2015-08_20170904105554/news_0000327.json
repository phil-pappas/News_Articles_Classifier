Thanks to a 362% growth rate between 2011 and 2014, Clearent came in at #1166 and continues to prove that it is one of the fastest growing payment processing companies in the U.S. Clearent’s organic growth has been driven by the company’s unique approach to the payments business. By focusing on honesty and transparency and delivering superior customer service, Clearent empowers its sales teams, ISOs, and agents to quickly grow their portfolios. While there are many payment processing companies they could partner with, an increasing number of them are turning to Clearent because in addition to receiving a unique offering for their merchants, they get a true partner they can trust and know will look out for their best interests.\nLooking ahead, Clearent anticipates additional growth from the OptBlue® Program from American Express. Clearent’s sales teams, partners, and merchants are excited about the benefits that OptBlue provides as merchants will now receive one efficient and fast deposit, one statement, and one customer service contact for all card brands that they accept.\nIntegrated payments is a new area of growth for Clearent thanks to its secure payment gateway. Developers receive live support from payments experts, working code samples, and flexible integration options so they can seamlessly process both one-time and recurring payments within their software programs and applications. Clearent provides an end-to-end solution for software developers, from simple APIs to robust settlement and funding options.\nClearent is no stranger to earning prominent accolades in the payments industry and beyond. Earlier this summer Clearent was named the sixth fastest growing company by the St. Louis Business Journal, which marks Clearent’s fourth straight year on this list. Clearent also jumped 10 spots this spring to land at #41 on the Nilson Report’s list of Top Merchant Acquirers in the U.S., which was the company’s third straight year to achieve this milestone.\n“I’m honored that Clearent has once again been named to the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing private companies,” said Dan Geraty, CEO of Clearent. “Receiving this recognition four years in a row would not be possible without the dedication of our employees, sales teams, and partners, and I am grateful for their continued support and loyalty.”\nAbout Clearent\nClearent is a complete payment processor that leverages its proprietary payments platform to make doing business easier and more profitable for its sales partners.
