In London, the FTSE 100 was down 0.01%. \nAsian stocks were mixed on Friday. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 closed up 0.29% and the Topix gained 0.34%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng closed up 0.73%. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite closed up 2.26%. \n2. -- The economic calendar in the U.S. on Friday includes the nonfarm payroll employment situation report at 8:30 a.m. and the consumer credit report at 3 p.m. \n3. -- U.S. stocks on Thursday fell ahead of the Friday jobs report as Tesla and 21st Century Fox \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.69% to 17,419.75. The S&P 500 dropped 0.78% to 2,083.56. The Nasdaq flopped 1.62% to 5,056.44. \n4. -- The highly important jobs report comes out Friday at 8:30 a.m. Economists at Econoday expect an unemployment rate of 5.3% , unchanged from the prior month, with an expected 212,000 new nonfarm jobs added. In June 223,000, jobs were added. \nThe jobs report will influence when the Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates. A stronger employment situation would make the central bank more inclined to raise rates in September. \n5. -- Activist investor Carl Icahn announced that funds he controls have bought an 8.2% stake in Cheniere Energy . The investment cost more than $1 billion. Icahn said shares in the Houston-based natural gas company were cheap. Icahn will likely have a lot to say to Cheniere about how it can unlock more shareholder value and cut expenses. \nIn premarket trading, Cheniere stock was rising by 6.2%. \n6. -- Shares in Keurig Green Mountain fell 29.8% on Thursday after the company reported weak sales of its coffee brewers and lowered its outlook. Keurig widely missed its sales targets for the quarter as its home coffee brewers, which use sealed coffee pods to brew, lost market traction. The stock has fallen more than 60% in 2015. \nIn premarket trading, Keurig stock was edging higher by 0.25%. \n7. -- Thursday was an ugly day for media stocks , as a selloff at Disney , 21st Century Fox , Time Warner and other media companies continued for a second day. The drop was prompted by spreading concern that cable-TV subscribers were canceling their service and turning to streaming video like Netflix . \nDisney, for its part, reported record profits on Tuesday, but its stock fell 9.2% on Wednesday and 1.8% on Thursday on concerns over a declining number of subscribers at its cable news channel ESPN. In premarket trading, Disney stock was falling another 0.12%. \nTime Warner, Fox and others also fell as investors fear spread through the industry. Time Warner was falling 0.05% in premarket trading after a drop of 0.79% Thursday. Fox -- which dropped 6.4% on Thursday -- was level in premarket trading. \n8. -- Royal Dutch Shell is selling its 75% stake in Chinese energy company Tongyi to private-equity company Carlyle and to Huo , a group controlled by Tongyi's founder. Shell has had difficulty in exploring for shale oil in China, and with global oil prices weak, the company is reining in its Chinese efforts with the sale. \nShell is buying BG for $70 billion and is selling about $15 billion in assets before the deal is completed. \nShell's stock was rising by 1.1% in European trading. \n9. -- The U.S. dollar has leveled off after gaining strength against the euro and the Japanese yen this week. Currency investors will be closely watching the nonfarm payrolls report for clues about when U.S. interest rates may rise. \n10 . -- Earnings reports for Friday include E.W.
