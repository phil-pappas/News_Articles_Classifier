Even so, Briscoe's managing director Rod Duke says the offer reflects fair value and remains on the table. \"Right now, we think the offer is sufficient to get the deal done,\" he told AAP. However, he did not rule out increasing the offer if the majority of shareholders were to reject it by the September 17 deadline. Kathmandu has warned its unaudited net profit has more than halved to $20 million in 2014/15. Mr Duke points the finger at the retail part of the business, saying the product design and manufacture stages appear solid. \"They simply do not know how to sell merchandise; to market and promote online or in stores,\" he said. \"Their weakness is our particular strength.\" Kathmandu's same store sales growth has been steadily falling since 2010/11 and the company expects a decline of nearly two per cent in 2014/15. Mr Duke said Kathmandu cannot blame the weather for the weak result. \"It's been very very cold during their very very busy period and their second half profit is down 30 per cent on the prior year,\" he said. \"Something is radically wrong.\" He said Kathmandu's forecast for a five per cent rise in same store sales growth in 2016 was \"laughable.\" Kathmandu will release its full year results on September 29. KATHMANDU'S SAME STORE SALES SLIDE: *Up nearly 13 pct in 2011 financial year *Up 7 pct in 2012 *Up 5.6 pct in 2013 *Up 4.2 pct in 2014 *Down 1.9 pct in 2015 (unaudited result) *5 pct rise forecast for 2016 ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331&title=Briscoe+offer+remains+on+the+table", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331&title=Briscoe+offer+remains+on+the+table", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331&h=Briscoe+offer+remains+on+the+table", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Briscoe+offer+remains+on+the+table&c=KIWI+retailer+Briscoe+says+its+cash-and-scrip+takeover+offer+for+Kathmandu+reflects+the+value+of+the+company%27s+shares.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/briscoe-refuses-to-lift-kathmandu-offer/story-e6frfkur-1227474139833?sv=4ae57b40b17d4e1e95186ff99167f331"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T17:04:46.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
