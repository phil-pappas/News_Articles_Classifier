Photo: James Davies\nBendigo Bank and ME Bank have joined rivals in jacking up interest rates for property investors, in response to a clampdown on lending to landlords.\nBendigo will raise rates on all housing investor loans by 0.2 of a percentage point, while superannuation fund-owned ME Bank will raise rates for existing investor customers by 0.41 of a percentage point, and slightly less for new investor borrowers.\nThe banking regulator's 10 per-cent-a-year speed limit on housing-investor credit growth triggered the hikes, both banks said.\nHowever, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority on Wednesday said banks' tendency to copy each other on pricing meant such moves may have a \"limited\" impact on loan growth.\nAdvertisement Bendigo's change will increase its standard variable rate to 5.76 per cent from 5.56 per cent and will affect both new and existing customers.\nME's existing investor customers will experience a bigger rate rise, of 0.41 of a percentage point, while rates for new investors with a \"basic\" loan will rise by 0.4 of a point and 0.36 of a point for those with a package deal. It is also cutting fixed rates for owner-occupiers.\nThe changes come after the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, and ANZ Bank last month raised housing interest rates 0.27 of a point, and National Australia Bank raised rates on interest-only loans by 0.29 of a point.\nAll the banks have blamed their moves on APRA's demand that housing investor credit growth slow to less than 10 per cent a year, from slightly above this now.\nBendigo chief executive Mike Hirst, who earlier this month said the bank would \"sit it out\" until other banks' rate changes were complete , said the latest change would help it limit investor loan growth to less than the threshold.\nBendigo's housing investor loan book expanded by 7.8 per cent in the year to June, according to APRA figures.\n\"When it comes to setting interest rates, our bank takes into account a wide range of factors and carefully consider its key stakeholders including borrowers, depositors, staff, shareholders, partners and the wider community,\" Mr Hirst said in a statement.\nME Bank chief executive Jamie McPhee said raising investor rates was a difficult decision, but banks had been forced to review their lending practices and pricing.\n\"The changes we have announced today will advantage owner occupied borrowers particularly those seeking to buy their first home,\" Mr McPhee said.\nHowever, analysts have argued banks' decisions to raise rates for all investor customers, rather than only new borrowers, are an attempt to boost profit margins.\nA speech by APRA chairman Wayne Byres on Wednesday said these changes reflected a preference for price-based measures, but they \"may well have limited impact on loan growth given the tendency for competitors to match pricing changes.\"\nMr Byres also welcomed recent moves by banks to test borrowers' sensitivity to higher interest rates more rigorously, saying they gave \"greater comfort\" about the quality of new loans being written.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/apra-talks-down-sydney-and-melbourne-property-lending-constraints-20150826-gj7v0p"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:45:10.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
