Simon Bullard by Ewin Hannan Lucille Keen Dyson Heydon's preparedness to associate himself with the Liberal Party was enough to disqualify him from heading the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption, the Australian Council of Trade Unions said on Friday.\nMaking the ACTU application for Justice Heydon to disqualify himself, the peak union body's counsel, Robert Newlinds SC, said \"people don't speak at fundraisers of a political party unless they believe in the cause\".\nJustice Heydon faces allegations of bias, conflict and incompetence for accepting an invitation to give the annual Sir Garfield Barwick address, which doubled as a NSW Liberal Party fundraiser, while leading a commission that the labour movement called an $80 million political witch-hunt.\nUnions have applied for Justice Heydon to recuse himself and resign his commission on the grounds that he was unable to afford any union, or any person associated with any union, procedural fairness as a result of his apprehended bias.\nUnions said the legal test means a judge would be disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.\nMr Newlinds said Justice Heydon's actions were enough to cause disquiet in a lay observer that he might be partisan against the Labor Party.\nThe ACTU submission says it was not possible for the fair-minded lay observer to rule out a sense that Justice Heydon \"might have a persuasion towards the Liberal Party and thereby might harbour a prejudice to the Labor Party\".\nIt says these matters were seriously compounded by Justice Heydon's statement last week that he was not prepared to give the Sir Garfield Barwick address \"at least whilst he is in the position of Royal Commissioner\".\n \"By the time of this statement there could be no doubt that the nature of the event, including the political fundraising nature of the event, was known to the commissioner,\" it says.\n\"It follows that the fair-minded observer must be taken to know that the Commissioner is prepared to speak at a function to raise funds for the Liberal Party in the future.\n\"The fair-minded lay observer would conclude from this fact that one does not state such a position or agree to speaking at such an event in the future without having a persuasion or alignment toward the Liberal Party.\"\n'Political controversy' The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union's submissions argued the commission's Melbourne hearings into the union were held in September last year, just weeks before the Victorian state election.\n\"Those allegations were widely reported in the media in Victoria and were relied upon by Liberal Party politicians during the election campaign,\" its submission says.\n\"This is another example of the political controversy that surrounded the work being done in the Commission.\"\nThe CFMEU claims the release of the interim report led to a press release from Employment Minister Eric Abetz, which \"uses the report in a political context\" and argues that the report supports the push of particular legislation to pass the parliament.\nThe CFMEU said that upon reading the correspondence between Justice Heydon and the organisers of the Sir Garfield Barwick address, a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that he was made aware that the event was a Liberal Party event, was aware of the conflict between speaking at a party political function and presiding over the Commission, failed to recall or overlooked the event was a Liberal Party event and was willing to speak at a Liberal Party function.\n\"These conclusions demonstrate the Commissioner has an affinity with, and particularity in favour of, the Liberal Party,\" the CFMEU submission says.\nThe Australian Workers Union claims in its submission that what emerges from the email correspondence is that the Commission was aware at the outset that the function Justice Heydon was to attend was a Liberal Party branch function.\n\"He was aware when he accepted the invitation on April 11 2014,\" the submission states.\n\"Nothing thereafter changes that.\"\nThe AWU says in its submission that the commission has sought to examine the activities of unions and union officials in relation to the internal functioning of the ALP.\n\"In circumstances where the Commissioner has associated with a Liberal Party function, the apprehension about his examination of affairs involving the ALP is particularly strong,\" the AWU says.\nThe AWU raised the issue of Opposition Leader Bill Shorten appearing in a public hearing last month.\n\"Having regard to his current position, the political sensitivity of these investigations are self evident, and they underscore the particular importance of the perceived political impartiality of the inquisitor,\" the submission says.\n\"The situation is one of which justice is not seen to be done if the Commissioner continues with the inquiry.\"\nJustice Heydon adjourned the hearing, saying he would announce his decision on Tuesday.",
