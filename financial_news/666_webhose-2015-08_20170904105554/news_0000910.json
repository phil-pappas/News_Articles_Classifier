Nick Moir by Stewart Oldfield Global insurance giant Zurich cut its pricing on a key commercial insurance product offering in the Australian market by 10 per cent in early June.\nThe move came at a time of already soft conditions in the commercial general insurance market, prompting some to describe conditions as the worst they have seen in more than a decade.\nThe cause is the unprecedented liquidity available to the global insurance market, the same liquidity that is driving extreme outcomes in the banking and wealth management industries.\nA Zurich spokeswoman said of the price changes: \"In the current environment and at this peak time of year for commercial insurance we have taken steps to ensure our brokers are armed with the tools necessary to meet the needs and expectations of our customers.\"\nIt's great news for your local butcher or mechanic and other SMEs who each year buy a business pack product which typically covers about a dozen different risks.\nBut Zurich's price cuts also have repercussions for the rest of the Australian commercial underwriting market, which has been trying to rebuild margins after a period of declines.\nThe cuts also affect the listed general insurance product distributors - Steadfast and Austbrokers - who clip a smaller ticket every time premium rates are cut.\nThere has been talk that big losses by reinsurers and higher claims levels might lead to stabilisation of pricing in the local commercial general insurance market.\n But there remain signs of market instability.\nAt the top end of town there are stories of the big US insurers dramatically undercutting local players on insuring prime office blocks in Sydney and Melbourne.\nEye on Austbrokers\nAustbrokers (AUB) is an established financial risk product distribution and underwriting agency business which is expanding into related services.\nIt is trading at a discount to the small industrial index and other insurance distribution peers despite having a proven track record of growing earnings through an insurance cycle (2003 to 2008) which other players don't yet have.\nThis is a well-established, well-run company but it will take some uncertainty into its full-year results released in late August around what sort of acquisitions the company might announce and what means the company will use to fund those acquisitions.\nAUB operates at multiple points in the general insurance value chain, with a broad range of products sold to thousands of customers who require professional advice on the purchase of those products. On our analysis, this makes AUB a lower risk prospect than some of its peers.\nWe expect AUB will seek to make further acquisitions as it looks to take advantage of a downturn of valuations in line with the softening insurance cycle and, like rival Steadfast, as a means of locking in future profit growth.\nBut after a record level of acquisitions in FY2015, a $50 million St George Bank facility is now 85 per cent drawn and AUB's acquisition war-chest has shrunk to about $15 million. Any future acquisitions are likely to be funded by a mixture of debt and equity.\nIn terms of consensus forward EV/EBITDA multiples, AUB is currently trading 20 per cent below its peak in January 2014. It now trades at a discount to its closest peer Steadfast.\nRecently AUB has been trading at an 8 per cent discount to the Small Industrials Index whereas historically AUB has traded at a premium to this index.\nAUB is well positioned for any tightening of the insurance cycle over the next two years given that the majority of its broking revenues are commissions and fees earned as a percentage of written premium.\nDespite shrinking ticket sizes because of the downturn in the cycle, AUB has been growing policy numbers which means it offers further leverage when the market does harden. We also note broking client numbers grew 4.3 per cent in the first half of 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:06:46.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
