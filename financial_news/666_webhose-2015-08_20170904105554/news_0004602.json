Other banks are understood to be adopting a similar approach. According to the industry trade body, the British Bankers' Association, banks have no alternative but to comply. \n\"Banks operating in the UK are compelled by UK law to meet their due diligence and reporting obligations, including those under the US-UK Intergovernmental Agreement to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA,\" a spokesman said. \n\"Banks do not have discretion in the application of these laws.\" \n• Information on expats opening offshore accounts to be shared with HMRC \n• British families billed £500 to prevent Americans dodging tax \nSome financial institutions, annoyed by the bureaucracy required to comply with FATCA, are pulling out of doing business with people with American connections, both US citizens and those living in the USA. \nA number of UK stockbrokers have said they will not deal with US residents. Worse, some firms are ending relationships with existing clients who have moved to the US. \nThey are deciding that the demands of FATCA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which governs trading in shares, have made the cost of doing business in the US unviable. \nFATCA was introduced by the US Government to tackle tax evasion by its citizens who were sheltering money abroad and not declaring it. \nIt also applied to nationals who were not living in the country. And Green Card holders must file details of any savings they hold overseas above $10,000 (£6,400). \nThe penalties for non-compliance are ferocious. Failure to declare savings can lead to a fine of $100,000 (£64,000) or 50 per cent of an expat's largest overseas account, whichever is higher. \nA bank which fails to report a single customer with savings over $50,000 (£32,000) could see 30 per cent of its US income withheld by the Treasury in Washington. \n\"It was predictable when the Act (Frankfurt: 0LW.F - news ) was passed in 2010,\" said Robert Wood, a tax lawyer based in San Francisco. \"But no one anticipated the draconian impact it has had. I am guessing the US government didn't expect this to happen.\" \nOne industry source said: \"The reality is that the US Treasury is using banks as tax collectors across the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T14:48:36.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
