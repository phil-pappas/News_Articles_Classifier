Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Big business has accused the Productivity Commission of failing to grapple with how to fix the \"overly-complex conflict driven\" system of enterprise bargaining, calling for more sweeping changes.\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on the commission to go beyond its draft report into workplace relations when it delivered its final recommendations to the Abbott government later this year.\nDelivering the Kingsley Laffer Memorial Lecture in Sydney on Thursday night, Ms Westacott said the need to make changes to awards and the enterprise bargaining process \"have not been properly dealt with to date\".\nShe said the current rigidities in enterprise agreements discouraged employers and had \"created a class of conservative risk-averse managers in many industries\".\n\"While there is no doubt the business community needs to improve our management culture, there is also no doubt that part of the problem should be attributed to the many and varied clauses in EBAs [enterprise bargaining agreements],\" she said.\n\"I am deeply concerned that the Productivity Commission has not yet grappled with this.\"\n\"I am concerned there is a view that these difficulties ultimately don't matter because companies can simply hold out, or work around them.\n\"My response is – why should they? Why should this be harder than it needs to be? Why should the system drive a culture of conflict rather than one of collaboration?\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Now, with so many sectors under the hammer to cut costs and change the productivity equation, this really matters.\n\"To tell companies in these sectors that to reorient their business models to stay profitable and keep people in jobs they have to work around an overly complex, conflict driven system is simply not a modern, forward looking proposition.\"\nShe said the commission proposal to cut Sunday penalty rates to Saturday levels was \"understandably controversial but it's practical and takes us down a path towards fixing the problem\".\nShe renewed the council's call for a fundamental redesign of the workplace relations system, including a dramatic cut in the number of awards and the stripping back of the content of workplace agreements. It wants rates for casual work, overtime, penalty and shift work removed from awards and replaced by an economy-wide minimum rate for each category, to be determined by the Fair Work Commission. The current 122 modern awards would be reduced to one per industry. Eventually, one universal award would apply across the workforce.\n\"The Productivity Commission believes awards need to be repaired rather than abolished,\" she said. \"We agree with that but the task is more than a cosmetic renovation,\" she said.\nShe said the commission had done a good job tackling a number of issues including the settling of the minimum wage, agreement making for greenfield sites and the appointment process for Fair Work Commissioners.\n\"Now, if I ask the question 'Does the report offer us a way of designing a workplace relations system that will equip us for the future I have painted?' I'm not so sure,\" she said.\n\"The issues which we believe are central to that challenge – awards and the enterprise bargaining process – have not been properly dealt with to date.\n\"So what I would conclude about the review so far is this: let's get on with implementing the recommendations that are just common sense, and let's focus the consultation period and the final report on how we actually create a durable, well balanced and future-oriented system,\" Ms Westacott said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-13T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:05:03.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
