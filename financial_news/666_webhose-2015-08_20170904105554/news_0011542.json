Crude prices are back down,\" said Vishnu Varathan, senior economist at Mizuho Bank. \nVarathan noted the price of onions, a staple ingredient in Indian cooking, was beginning to rise, putting upward pressure on food inflation. \nBut, he said the RBI would find it harder to cut interest rates later in the year, if the U.S. Federal Reserve delays raising interest rates, which it is expected to do. \nThe RBI left interest rates unchanged at its last policy review on Aug.4, having already cut them by 75 basis points this year as a slump in global commodity prices brought inflation under control. By holding rates steady, Rajan went against the majority on an advisory panel, who had recommended a reduction. \nIndia is due to release economic growth data for the April-June quarter on Monday. \nThe median forecast given by 27 economists put year-on-year growth at 7.4% for the quarter, slowing from 7.5% in the January-March period. \nWhereas the headline figure looks healthy, many economists have treated the data series with caution since the statistics department revised its methodology for measuring gross domestic product earlier this year. \nOther indicators and on-the-ground evidence suggest the economy is struggling, and there is growing impatience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to implement more policies that can galvanise growth. \nThe government is trying to introduce a nationwide goods and services tax to create a more unified market in a country where levies can differ from state to state. \nTwelve of the 21 economists polled doubted whether the government could roll out the tax before the next fiscal year begins in April.
