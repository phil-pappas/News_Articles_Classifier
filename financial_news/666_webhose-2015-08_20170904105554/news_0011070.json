He'll have a special affinity with the pet food aisles at Woolworths. Photo: Rob Homer\nThe pet food aisles of the ailing supermarket chain Woolworths will mark a sort of homecoming for Gordon Cairns, who was anointed as chairman on Friday morning .\nThe Scottish-born Cairns has a back to basics, no-nonsense approach ingrained early in his working life where part of his first job with British pet food company Spillers involved examining dog excrement each Friday.\nThe young sales representative in the 1970s was initially stunned when told he'd have to pick apart dog poo on the Friday from the hounds who'd been fed new varieties of pet food. Spillers wanted to be completely confident there were no adverse side effects for the canines, before the new products were sent out out into the market in a highly-competitive pet food industry.\nBut he knuckled down and got on with the job after graduating from Edinburgh University and it was at Spillers he learnt about the value of hard work and staying focused on the task at hand. It was also a lesson in being an optimist and taking a glass half-full approach. Some of his colleagues had an even tougher job. On Monday mornings some of them had to actually taste tiny portions of new pet food varieties as part of the product development process.\nAdvertisement Cairns is a pragmatist at heart. For Woolworths shareholders he is likely to be a breath of fresh air as an outsider to the company, but one who has had plenty of experience as both a big customer to the core supermarkets and liquor business when he was running the Lion Nathan beer and wine business for eight years until 2004, and since then as a prominent director and chairman in the boardrooms of blue-chip companies.\nWhile Cairns isn't a retailer, he's been immersed in the fast-moving consumer goods industries for decades. Lion, with its main beer brands XXXX and Tooheys, wrestled with the rising power of Woolworths in liquor retailing during Cairns' stint running the company and he has an intimate knowledge of the way duopolies operate.\nHis short chairmanship of David Jones for just five months in 2014 was an important circuit-breaker for a department store which had lost its way after on-and-off talks about mergers with rival Myer, with shareholders ultimately benefiting from an increased takeover offer from South African retailer Woolworths which put $200 million extra on the table with a final bid of $2.1 billion.\nCairns is chairman of under-siege electricity and gas company Origin Energy and is also on the board of Macquarie Group. But it's a lower-profile chairmanship over the past five years which has much more in common with Woolworths. Since 2010, Cairns has been chairman of Quick Service Restaurants, which runs 620 fast-food outlets under the three brands of Red Rooster, Chicken Treat and Oporto. They are high-volume, low-margin operations where store leasing costs, supply chain efficiency, good customer service and slick consumer marketing are central to success. Quick Service Restaurants is owned by private equity firm Archer Capital and the business turns over more than $850 million a year.\nIt will be one of Cairns' crowning glories in corporate Australia if he is able to steer the fallen giant back to a position of power, and restore shareholder value.\n\"Woolworths is a great Australian business and it is an honour to be appointed to serve as its chairman,\" he said on Friday.\nThe challenge is enormous but Cairns is a hard nut and there is a groundswell of support from institutional shareholders backing him to up-end the business and fire it up again.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/woolworths-confirms-gordon-cairns-as-new-chairman-profit-falls-125pc-20150826-gj8ofx"], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:48:05.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
