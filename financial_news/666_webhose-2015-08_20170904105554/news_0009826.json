The men said they could not comment until after the weekend.\nIf Uber plunges more deeply into developing or adapting self-driving cars, Miller and Valasek could help the company make that technology more secure. Uber had no immediate comment.\nUber on Tuesday announced a partnership with the University of Arizona, offering the university grant money to fund research into the optics and mapping technology needed for autonomous vehicles, and the San Francisco company will test self-driving cars on the streets of Tucson, Arizona.\nThis partnership follows a more tumultuous effort with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, one of the world's top robotics research institutions, that resulted in Uber hiring away more than 40 of its experts in autonomous vehicles.\nMiller and Valasek's Jeep efforts, which were coordinated with manufacturer Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, prompted the first vehicle recall to protect drivers from possible malicious hacking.\nFCA USA LLC recalled 1.4 million vehicles to install software intended to prevent hackers from emulating the experiment, which used the cellular network to enter the entertainment system and then win control of the engine, brakes and steering.
