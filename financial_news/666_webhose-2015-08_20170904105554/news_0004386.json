Lexmark and Invoiceware aim to utilize their combined suite of compliance and financial process automation solutions to help multinational companies reduce the risk of government audits and penalties, while improving operations in one of the most complex regulatory environments in the world.\nThis partnership will leverage a powerful combination of AP automation from Lexmark and Invoiceware’s sophisticated solution for compliance in Latin America’s strict regulatory environment. With eight countries enforcing mandates, the alliance will help companies proactively manage compliance and optimize AP processes, including invoice collection, intelligent data capture, government validation, commercial approvals and associated fiscal reporting.\nIn combination with e-invoicing standardization, countries across Latin America are implementing stringent tax reporting requirements, such as Brazil SPED and Mexico eContabilidad, to ensure that the government receives an accurate (and the maximum) amount of VAT tax revenue. Through this partnership, Invoiceware combines local knowledge and a regional compliance platform with fully integrated AP workflow and archiving operations from Lexmark to seamlessly integrate AP processes with mandated tax reporting.\n“We’re excited to focus on Latin America with Invoiceware International in order to help companies improve accounts payable processes while proactively managing compliance,” said Ailie Kofoid, Director of Global Back Office Solutions at Lexmark. “Together we will streamline accounts payable processes across the region, while improving VAT tax deduction accuracy and reducing compliance costs.”\nLexmark is a global leader in financial process automation, specializing in helping companies to improve processes and reduce costs. Since 2010, Lexmark has invested in a number of strategic software acquisitions, including process application leaders Perceptive Software, Readsoft and Kofax. With growing operations in Latin America, Lexmark enlisted Invoiceware International’s e-invoicing and fiscal reporting platform in 2014 to manage compliance in Brazil, and has continued to expand the relationship into new countries and processes since.\n“We are happy to expand our relationship with Lexmark from a customer of Invoiceware to a partner where we will jointly help global companies manage compliance issues across Latin America,” said Scott Lewin, president and CEO, Invoiceware International. “This provides multinationals with an opportunity to leverage our combined business process expertise and minimize the risks of compliance errors.”\nInvoiceware International offers the only Latin America Business-to-governement network focused on the challenges facing multinational companies.
