This is the highest level since 2007, and up 118 per cent year on year. More Dirty money pushes up London house prices \nNearly three-quarters of buyers were backed by overseas money, CBRE found, providing the latest evidence of the significant role foreign investors have begun to play in London real estate. \nCash from around the world has been flooding into the property market in a bid to benefit from the returns it can generate. Although prices and yields for top-quality assets are back near pre-credit crunch levels, the sector is still generating better returns than most other asset classes, such as stocks and bonds. \nForeign investors are developing some of London’s largest sites, from Battersea Power Station on the south bank of the river Thames — which is funded by a Malaysian consortium — to the new Asian Business Port at the Royal Docks in east London, backed by Chinese capital. \nFour of the London market’s five biggest price tags in the three months to the end of June were paid by overseas money. The largest transaction was the sale of three sites for £428m to a partnership consisting of Malaysian investor Eco World and Irish developer Ballymore. \nA Singaporean and Malaysian consortium paid the second-highest price — £308m — for a pair of offices including former Express Newspapers headquarters Ludgate House. \nThe figures include land for both residential and commercial use. About half of the deals were for developments of offices, shops and restaurants, with the other half being sold for the construction of homes. FT Special Report \nCommercial real estate news and analysis from aroundthe world \nFurther reading \nAlastair Perks, CBRE’s senior director of central London development, said the market for land on which to construct new buildings “is accelerating at a rate of knots”. \nLondon’s housing shortage has sent housebuilders scrambling to fill the gap. The capital’s population is growing by about 52,000 households a year but last year only 18,260 new homes were built. \nThe number of homes approved by councils in London has risen by more than a third year on year, to 49,190 in the year to the end of June, figures released last week by the Home Builders Federation and data analysts Glenigan showed. \nA shortage of new office space and an uptick in demand from commercial tenants, owing to the economic recovery, are also driving developers’ appetite for land, Mr Perks said. “The leasing market continues to strengthen and, with supply of office space remaining historically low, these factors are creating good opportunities for speculative development.” \nThe amount of office space being built in central London rose by 24 per cent in the six months to the end of March, a survey of construction activity by advisory firm Deloitte found earlier this year — the second-biggest increase in 20 years.
