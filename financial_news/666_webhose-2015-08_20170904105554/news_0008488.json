Led by Gisella Alvarez and Dr. Bruce Sands, the 40-member team offered primary medical care including general medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, wound care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing and an incredibly successful education process to over 1,400 patients. They gave 10 wheelchairs, 15 walkers and 30 canes. Our first partnership with a medical school brought 6 3rd year medical students onto the team and they acted as translators for the physicians and part of the education team. We hope to have a Skype session with them during the program so everyone can hear their amazing message about the mission. The entire mission team saw lives changed and miracles every day! You will experience more of those during the program! It will be great!\nPrevious Missions and Community Service:\nJuly 2014:\nMedical and Wellness Mission in Bucaramanga, Colombia.\nApril 2013:\nRoof Rafters for a HABITAT FOR HUMANITY house in Tampa, FL.\nJuly 2012:\nHouse repairs and painting for a needy family in Kansas City, MO.\nJuly 2011:\nMedical and surgical supplies at PARTNERS FOR WORLD HEALTH in Portland, ME.\nJune 2010:\nCleared a vacant lot for the use of a Community Garden in Fort Lauderdale, FL.\nAbout the LAUGHH Foundation:\nThe purpose of the LAUGHH Foundation is to serve those who are underserved through medical missions, support of educational ministries, and community service. A major component of these is to go beyond traditional medical treatment. Our mission includes providing tools that enable and empower people to change their lives.
