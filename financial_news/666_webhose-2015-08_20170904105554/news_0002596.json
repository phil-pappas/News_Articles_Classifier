Advertising Print This Post \nAfter experiencing three consecutive quarters of solid FX volume results between Q3 2014 to Q1 2015, activity at Hotspot FX has been on the decline. The fall continued in July, as average daily volumes (ADV) for the month were 8.6% lower than June to $23.51 billion. The figure was the lowest recorded month ADV at Hotspot since December 2012. \nThe multi-year low occurs as most trading venues and broker have experienced a drop off of volumes from Q1’s levels. However, Hotspot specifically has underperformed its rivals. Like Fastmatch which has been unable to return to volume levels prior to January’s Swiss franc volatility, Hotspot appears to be similarly be affected by changes taking place in the FX market. \nSpecifically affecting many players has been a contraction of credit available from major foreign exchange prime brokers (FXPB) as well as higher commission prices from them. As a result, many buy-side funds have received termination notices from their FXPB’s or instructions to increase collateral. In relation to Hotspot, the FX ECN may be affected by this changing climate in the industry if their clients are among those scrambling to source new credit relationships to trade on the platform. \nAlso possibly affecting the ECN has been a policy change, of which Hotspot announced that it would no longer support ‘last look’ quoting. While viewed as a beneficial move for liquidity takers, technology providers that service both the buy-side have stated to Finance Magnates that the initial response from many banks is to raise spreads when such dealing changes take place. As such, Hotspot could be currently experiencing temporary issues of worsening liquidity quality until the market adjusts to the changing trading conditions on the platform. \nFinance Magnates has reached out to Hotspot FX representatives during the current weekend after office hours for an explanation about the reduction in volumes and will provide an update as it becomes available.
