Viacom this morning reported lower revenue and earnings and missed expectations. Fox late Wednesday beat earnings views, but missed revenue estimates and lowered its profit outlook. Viacom plunged to its lowest level in nearly five years. Volume was heavy. The stock has been in a downtrend for more than a year, and is now trading about 50% below its 52-week high. Fox also crumbled, falling to a more than two-year low. Trade has been choppy for about two years, and the stock is now trading nearly 30% below its 52-week high. Disney is still looking dismal as its quarterly revenue too fell short of views earlier this week. The stock gapped below its 50-day line on Wednesday and is nearing its 200-day line today. Local TV station owner Gray Television also tumbled in reaction to its quarterly report, falling to its 200-day line and ending a run that had the stock up more than 61% from the start of the year through July 21st. And AMC Networks plunged well below its 200-day, after falling below its 50-day line on Wednesday. The TV network had also been on a big run, gaining 37% in 2015 through Monday. Shares are now more than 20% off of Monday's high. AMC topped second quarter forecasts, but its international revenue dropped for the first time in nine quarters.
