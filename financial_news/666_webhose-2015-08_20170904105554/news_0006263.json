Alex Ellinghausen by Luke Malpass Misa Han Productivity Commission chief Peter Harris has defended the complex award wage system as \"probably the cheapest way to employ people in this country\" and resisted moving towards a deregulated New Zealand labour market model.\nBut his New Zealand counterpart says the deregulated labour market across the Tasman has been good at employing people by letting the market work.\n\"Life goes on and the markets work their way through. The New Zealand labour market has actually been pretty good at employing people,\" New Zealand Productivity Commission chair Murray Sherwin said at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle event.\n\"I am really loath to attempt to even ascribe that to regulatory frameworks. I think a lot of it's really come down to market forces as much as anything else,\" he said\nBut Mr Harris said it was incumbent on those making the case to change Australia's onerous industrial relations regime to prove that small businesses wanted it.\n\"I'm not sure if you're offering them something that they have shown any inclination to pick up.\"\nHe said awards offered employers the least costly option to hire workers.\n\"It's actually probably the cheapest way to employ people in this country, not necessarily but probably, and moreover the firms that use awards are small to medium enterprises.\"\n There are more than 120 awards in Australia that set out different pay rates and conditions depending on industry or occupation. In a 1000-page draft report, the Productivity Commission said overhauling awards would not be a practical option because only few have suggested a complete shift from awards and the cost of the overhaul would be high.\nMr Harris comments reflect what some observers consider to be the \"industrial relations club\" nature of Australian IR â€“ a reluctance to venture outside the current complex regulatory framework or look at alternatives such as the deregulation of the labour market that exists in New Zealand.\nRichard Clancy, director of workplace relations of Australian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said the complex award system encouraged small businesses to come up with ways to get around the system.\n\"Its complexity creates apprehension, encourages avoidance strategies and acts as a barrier to employment as far as small businesses are concerned,\" he said.\nThis month alone, at least six small businesses faced investigation from the Fair Work Ombudsman for short-changing their staff, in some cases because they didn't know about the minimum pay rates under the awards.\nMarket speaks louder in NZ Executive director of Independent Contractors Association Ken Phillips says awards add complexity and compliance costs to the system, and are difficult to navigate. He argues penalty rates, for example, need not be prescribed.\n\"They don't even know they are talking like this. They are so locked into the current system. There are too many snouts in the trough, too many people getting advantaged out of all this.\n\"They've done away with penalty rates in New Zealand and they still pay penalty rates because if they don't, people don't want to work weekends,\" Mr Phillips said.\n\"The market speaks much, much louder that the regulated system here,\" he said.\nNew Zealand's Employment Relations Act sets standard conditions that apply to the entire workforce such as minimum wage and leave entitlements, leaving the rest to the market.\nIn practice this means in sectors with unions, employees have a choice between individual employment contracts and a collective agreement negotiated by the union.\nMr Phillips described the Australian system as a make-work scheme for \"legislative bureaucracy\".\n\"You've got to understand that this is a collusion between employers and unions to manipulate the markets. This is the dirty secret in industrial relations.\n\"The big end of town is extremely keen on complexity as they can leverage off it. They really don't want to see a simpler system.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:47:41.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
