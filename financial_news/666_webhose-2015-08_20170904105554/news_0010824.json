In short, the market was not impressed,\" wrote DBS Chief Investment Officer Lim Say Boon.\n\"You can't stimulate consumption via interest rate cuts. At least not in Asia anyway ... Also, you don't stimulate net exports through interest rates.\"\nThe monetary easing nevertheless propped up shares in banking and real estate stocks, sectors that investors believe will benefit the most from additional liquidity.\nMajor carmakers, including BYD, Dongfeng Auto and Changan Auto also rose sharply as investors bet the central bank's supportive policies toward auto financing and leasing firms would aid car sales.\nBut small-caps remained under selling pressure, with Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext down 1 percent, and the CSI500 index tracking small listed companies declining 0.5 percent.\n\"The previous days' slumps have triggered margin calls and forced liquidation in some stocks, which is why you see some investors dumping shares at whatever prices they can sell,\" said David Dai, Shanghai-based investor director at Nanhai Fund Management Co.\nHe added that some blue-chips are relatively cheap now and have attracted bargain hunters.\nImproved sentiment in mainland and regional markets aided Hong Kong stocks.\nThe Hang Seng index added 0.2 percent, to 21,443.80 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 1.3 percent, to 9,638.14.\nAll main industry indexes, except for services, rose in the city.
