He added that the Government had already asked for the filing of refund claims by 31 August so that priority settlement of these claims could be carried out. \nThe Finance Minister also used the meeting to announce the establishment of a committee comprising representatives of APTMA and government officials, headed by SAPM on Revenue, Haroon Akhtar, to further deliberate on these issues. \nThe APTMA delegation vowed that given the right kind of incentives, the textile industry would be able to play its role in enhancing the country’s foreign exchange earnings. Members expressed complete agreement with the Minister that promoting tax culture in the country was the key to economic prosperity. They also assured him of full support on all matters aimed at economic progression of the country and said any attempt at disrupting the process of economic development would be discouraged. \nPakistan’s textile industry continues to be pessimistic about its prospects , warning of wholesale closures amongst fabric mills unless the government steps in to help. \nDespite the fact that Pakistan has been benefiting from its GSP+ trade preference status for exports to the European Union (EU), its upstream textile sector has been struggling to compete against competitors, notably in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T22:35:17.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
