Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Analysts are bullish that Australian tech stocks can mark a bright spot in the Australian market following annual reporting season, tipping good growth for the next 12 months from rising profits, a weakened dollar and distance from China.\nLike all sectors, tech stocks were hammered by macroeconomic factors throughout August, including concerns over China's slowing economy and the first interest rate rise in the United States in almost a decade.\nGood performances of the smaller players were weighed down by hefty hits to the share prices of the bigger tech stocks.\nDespite the information technology companies in the S&P/ASX 300 index losing 11.63 per cent in August, companies such as SMS Management and Technology, Appen and Catapult posted strong results.\nIT services businesses, cloud providers and niche players were the highlights this reporting season.\nMorgans senior analyst Nick Harris said the evolution of subscription, cloud-based services had changed the way many companies viewed buying technology.\nStrong performers This change in thinking has boosted the coffers of IT services firms offering cloud products.\n \"Customers are choosing to pay as they go for services,\" he said.\n\"The past few years had been really hard for companies like SMS Management and Technology and Data#3, but they've had a good year. There is also a bit of a technology replacement cycle coming through.\"\nSMS Management and Technology lifted its net profit after tax by 34 per cent to $17 million for the full year to June 30.\nThe IT services company's revenue was also up 13 per cent to $356.2 million. The result pushed its share price up to near its 52-week high of $4.53 and it has continued to trade close to that mark â€“ a feat given the market volatility.\nCloud computing and ICT solutions provider Data#3 also recorded a good result, with net profit after tax up almost 40 per cent to $17 million.\nMr Harris said investors were willing to pay more for SaaS businesses.\n\"Ultimately it comes down to a company's competitive position. Some IT services businesses are also more pegged to cycles, so when the cycle is turning there's some upside.\"\nDomain name registration and cloud services business Melbourne IT was rated by all surveyed Bloomberg analysts as a buy, with a 12-month price target of $2.20.\nIt recorded a revenue jump of 16.5 per cent to $68.9 million for the half year and net profit after tax rose 125.4 per cent to $1.2 million.\nAnother IT services business, Empired, posted a record full-year net profit of $5.27 million, up 39 per cent. It also had positive revenue growth of 92 per cent to $130 million.\nIts impressive growth was sparked by a strong second half, with $65 million of annuity-based contracts secured. But its share price did not respond well, and investors may have been spooked by its dwindling cash flow.\nTelsyte managing director Foad Fadaghi said all companies in the services space seemed to be doing well.\n\"We've seen a pickup in IT spending in the economy,\" he said. \"The pessimism over the past six months has started to evaporate.\"\nMr Fadaghi said IT services firms with government clients would be particularly well positioned for the next 12 months.\n\"There's been increased spending from government on IT services,\" he said. \"A lot of this is on managed services and cloud-based solutions.\"\nCloud services business Bulletproof Networks, which boasts the federal government Treasury as one of its clients, booked a revenue increase of 59 per cent to $29.2 million for the full year and its underlying net profit after tax was up 22 per cent to $548,000.\nOther decent results came from IT advisory and consulting company UXC Ltd and technology consulting business RXP Services.\nAway from IT services businesses, there were also some solid performers.\nAustralia's largest tech stock, MYOB, met analyst expectations this reporting season.\nIt recorded revenue growth of 14.2 per cent to $161 million for the half year, despite a $65 million loss, associated with one-off costs from its ASX listing in May.\nMost of its revenue growth was driven by new SME clients taking up one of its cloud accounting solutions.\n\"It has international opportunities and exposure, but it requires investors to take a leap of faith that they will be able to execute their strategy,\" Mr Fadaghi said.\nLanguage and search data services business Appen posted a $2.68 million net profit after tax for the first half, exceeding analyst forecasts by 9 per cent.\nCatapult excites Another niche performer which creates tracking software for athletes, Catapult Group International, was also a standout result.\nCatapult beat its own revenue forecasts by 26 per cent, posting revenue up 49 per cent to $11.8 million for the full year. But its net loss also worsened by 39 per cent to $2.5 million.\nIt suffered a blow on Monday when it was informed that the A ustralian Football League had entered into preferred partner negotiations with Champion Data for athlete tracking services. This pushed its share price down more than 14 per cent by midday.\nIG markets analyst Evan Lucas said Catapult Group was the \"most exciting tech stock in Australia\".\n\"They've come ahead in leaps and bounds and they'll go further still if they can get into the United States or materialise their tech into everyday use for running.\"\nMr Lucas said the tech sector was \"very exciting\" but highly risky for investors.\n\"Most of these companies have developed quickly, they're start-ups and in the early stages of business development there can be big mistakes,\" he said.\n\"If you're a tech company that's not innovating, resting on your laurels, then you'll struggle.\"\nLooking ahead, Morgans senior analyst Mr Harris tipped Nextdc and battery energy storage business RedFlow as stocks to watch.\n\"NextDC has hit its price point and it's in a good spot operationally,\" he said.\n\"RedFlow has knocked 70 per cent of its product cost in the past 18 months and it's now the best price in the market. In places like Germany, storing energy is now on par with buying it off the grid.\"\nMr Fadaghi said most local tech stocks would be somewhat insulated from the current sharemarket volatility, because they had limited exposure to China.\n\"This year should be a better performance than last year. For those companies which grew this year, it will be a continuation of growth.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/aussie-tech-legend-says-battery-startup-redflow-can-take-on-tesla-20150827-gj9331", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-08-31T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:05:10.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
