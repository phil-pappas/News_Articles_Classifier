Dean Sewell Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson Low interest rates have created a growing class of uber-landlords with huge property portfolios who risk big losses if the market turns or rates rise, warns the chairman of a parliamentary inquiry into the housing market.\nCoalition MP John Alexander agreed with Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens that overheated property market, in Sydney and Melbourne, had the potential to cause serious \"social dysfunction\" .\n\"Some have said we are on track to becoming a Kingdom where the Lords own all the land and the biggest Lord will be King and the enslaved serf tenant is paying rent to the Lord to become wealthier. Is that an over-dramatisation or is it very, very close to the truth?\" Mr Alexander said.\nMr Alexander said his inquiry had found lending to housing investors was now routinely outstripping lending to owner-occupiers, and the \"contagion\" could be spreading from Sydney to other regional areas.\nMr Alexander said there were investors with $30 million housing portfolios with 60 properties would have to find $600,000 to cover their losses with loan rates moving from 4 to 6 per cent. The member for Bennelong in Sydney's northern suburbs said people from Geelong were reporting investors from as far afield as Perth and the Gold Coast buying up Geelong rental properties with a rental yield of 6.5 per cent.\n\"If home buyers are being eliminated from the market in Sydney, are they now being eliminated from the market in Geelong? These are the questions we have to ask,\" Mr Alexander told The Australian Financial Review , ahead of the House of Representatives inquiry hearing into home ownership Thursday and Friday in Sydney\nLandlords 'positively geared' Mr Alexander said most of the political debate over negative gearing and the 50 per cent discount on capital gains tax was dominated by \"people who don't understand what is happening because the smart investor is positively geared at this point\".\n \"When interest rates were at 10 per cent and rentals yields at 4 per cent, for every million dollars in property an investor held, they had to fund a $60,000 loss so you were limited to the amount of properties you could buy by your capacity to have other income to fund your real estate holdings losses,\" he said.\n\"With positive gearing, an investor who might have been limited to $3 million or $4 million worth of properties may now have $30 million or $40 million worth of properties.\"\nThe latest Australian Taxation Office statistics from the 2012-2013 income year show low interest rates have allowed some of the country's 1.3 million landlords to cut back their tax deductions on investment properties and make a profit for the first time, slashing the cost of the nation's negative gearing regime by almost a third.\nAccording to the most recent figures, the overall cost of negatively-geared rental properties has fallen by $2.4 billion, or 31 per cent, due to record-low interest rates and higher rents.\n'Some real cowboys' Mr Alexander said negative gearing was no longer relevant now that interest rates were lower than rents.\nHe said the House of Representatives inquiry had started to uncover evidence that many landlords, now in profits because rents were returning more than the investors' interest rate payments, could destabilise the market because of their sensitivity to interest rate movements.\nEven an increase in home loan rates from the 4 per cent to 6 per cent was not a 2 per cent increase, but a 50 per cent increase in investors' mortgage repayments.\nMr Alexander said there were investors with $30 million housing portfolios with 60 properties would have to find $600,000 to cover their losses with loan rates moving from 4 to 6 per cent.\nEven if they could afford to fund $200,000 in losses, they would have to sell 40 properties to get to a comfortable level of gearing.\n\"There are more and more properties owned by fewer and fewer people, and it's an area of concern,\" he said.\n\"What constrained them before doesn't constrain them now. You might find some are very prudent people but within that group, some are real cowboys who are riding this wave for all its worth.\"\nThese investors were crowding homebuyers out of the market in Sydney, and were moving into other regional areas like Geelong where some investment properties were returning rental yields of 6.5 per cent.\nRBA to be quizzed Reserve Bank officials will appear before the inquiry in Sydney on Thursday and Mr Alexander flagged investors crowding homebuyers out of the market could fall within the Reserve Bank's responsibility.\n\"Reading the charter of the Reserve Bank is instructive because it says they are charged with the stability of the currency, the maintenance of full employment, economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia,\" he said.\n\"If you take that charter and you understand we have people ranging from nurses to the very wealthy investing in real estate, and very high proportion of people owning their homes – about 60 per cent – and half of those are mortgaged, then the economic prosperity of people is expressed in their ownership of property.\"\nThe Greens will on Wednesday release Parliamentary Budget Office costings showing the abolishing the discount on capital gains tax and negative gearing changes could return $127 billion to the budget over the next decade as part of \"fixing structural unfairness in the tax system\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:07:24.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
