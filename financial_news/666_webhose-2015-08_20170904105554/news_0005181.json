Professional and amateur photographers submitted stunning images, showcasing all the wonders of Earth and offering snapshots of humanity and nature from all corners of the world.\n“Sometimes you just look at this thing and go, ‘Yeah, I get it,’” Jim Richardson, a National Geographic photographer and 2015 contest judge, told CBS News . “ And those moments are wonderful because they expand me. They take me someplace I haven’t been before, either physically in the world, geographically, or emotionally ... the kinds of reactions you get out of a great novel.”\nSee all entries for the 2015 National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest\nFaisal Azim / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 2 of 8 Second place: Gravel Workmen by Faisal Azim “This gravel-crush working place remains full of dust and sand. Three gravel workmen are looking through the window glass at their working place in Chittagong, Bangladesh.” -- Faisal Azim\nAhmed Al Toqi / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 3 of 8 Third place: Camel Ardah by Ahmed Al Toqi “Camel Ardah, as it called in Oman, is one of the traditional styles of camel racing … between two camels controlled by expert men. The faster camel is the loser … so they must be running [at] the same speed level in the same track.” -- Ahmed Al Toqi\nBeth McCarley / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 4 of 8 Merit: A Night at Deadvlei by Beth McCarley “The night before returning to Windhoek, we spent several hours at Deadveli. The moon was bright enough to illuminate the sand dunes in the distance, but the skies were still dark enough to clearly see the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds. Deadveli means ‘dead marsh.’ The camelthorn trees are believed to be about 900 years old but have not decomposed because the environment is so dry.” -- Beth McCarley\nStefane Berube / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 5 of 8 Merit: White Rhinos by Stefane Berube “The night before this photo, we tried all day to get a good photo of the endangered white rhino. Skulking through the grass carefully, trying to stay 30 feet away to be safe, didn’t provide me the photo I was hoping for. In the morning, however, I woke up to all three rhinos grazing in front of me. Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary, Uganda.” -- Stefane Berube\nStefano Zardini / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 6 of 8 Merit: Sauna in the Sky by Stefano Zardini “A sauna at 2,800 meters high in the heart of Dolomites. Monte Lagazuoi, Cortina, eastern Italian Alps.” -- Stefano Zardini\nEduard Gutescu / National Geographic Traveler Photo Contest Slide 7 of 8 Merit: Romania, Land of Fairy Tales by Eduard Gutescu “White frost over Pestera village.” -- Eduard Gutescu\nMarketWatch Slide Shows\nFOOD & DRINK Getty Images • How much it costs to shop at Whole Foods\n• 7 reasons some shoppers hate Costco\n• 5 things NOT to buy at Costco and Sam’s Club\n• Trying to avoid trans fats?
