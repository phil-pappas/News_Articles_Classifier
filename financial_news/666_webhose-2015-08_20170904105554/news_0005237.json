Woodside gave up 1.6 per cent to $32.05, Santos dived 2.3 per cent to $5.84, and Oil Search retraced 2.3 per cent to $6.40.\nThe release of the Reserve Bank minutes in the afternoon had little impact on market sentiment, she said.\nThe banks held up until the afternoon and then plummeted and steep falls in Chinese equity markets did not help sentiment.\n\"It is a bit of a turnaround,\" CMC Markets chief market analyst Ric Spooner said. \"Commonwealth Bank lost its dividend today, so it was weaker as a consequence. I'd put the bank sell-off down to the usual market fluctuations.
