Simon O'Dwyer by Jared Lynch David Blackmore is no stranger to the spotlight â€“ his wagyu beef is prized by celebrity chefs and cooked in high-end restaurants worldwide.\nBut the thought of going to court scares \"the shit\" of him. The fifth-generation farmer faces a looming showdown to protect his right to farm on his property near Alexandra in north-east Victoria.\nThe Murrindindi Shire Council has refused to grant him a permit to farm on about 140 hectares after about a dozen of his neighbours complained about dust, the smell of feed and manure, as well as increased birdlife and cattle trucks.\nMr Blackmore has until the end of the month to appeal against the decision at the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal or move his farm elsewhere.\n\"I'm 65, and my wife isn't far behind,\" he said. \"We have never been to court in our lives and thought of going to court frightens the shit out of us to be honest..\n\"We haven't decided anything yet. Hopefully, we get to stay where we are.\"\nCelebrity chef and Rockpool Bar & Grill owner Neil Perry has launched an online petition, which has attracted 25,000 supporters, against the council's decision.\n\"David's farmed here for over a decade, producing delicious beef that I, along with many other celebrity chefs undoubtedly trust in our wagyu dishes,\" Mr Perry wrote in a letter to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.\n \"This is the type of Australian agriculture that should be encouraged, not stopped.\n\"It's outrageous that complaints on machinery noise and birds from nearby residents and hobby farmers led to [the] council's removal of David's farming rights. Now this incredible farmer and his 1300 cattle face being forced off his property in just 30 days.\"\nVictorian Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford said she was concerned that \"faming families who have been on the land for generations are now required to seek a permit to farm\".\nShe will meet with Planning Minister Richard Wynne this week to review red tape around agriculture and planning issues to help \"grow our food and fibre industry and support our farmers\".\n\"It's important to make sure we get the balance right between supporting and growing our vital agricultural sector and land users, and community concerns around planning and the environment,\" Ms Pulford said.\n\"My department has already been in touch with council and I can confirm that my office has met with Mr Blackmore to better understand these issues.\"\nMurrindindi Council acting chief executive Michael Chesworth said rejecting Mr Blackmore's application was \"very difficult and complex\".\n\"Council had to weigh up the need to balance growth and economic development with the need to manage impacts of intensive farming practices on the amenity of the surrounding area\", Mr Chesworth said.\nIn a statement, the council said Mr Blackmore's land use and cattle stocking levels had \"scaled up incrementally over the past few years and was now classified as an intensive farming enterprise\".\nMr Blackmore moved his cows from a feedlot to pasture about four years ago. He said his farm was more intensive than a regular beef farm, but on par with a dairy operation.\nMs Pulford said the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport and Resources and the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning were working together to clarify the definition of \"intensive animal husbandry\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:41:57.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
