It is producing ore at a cash cost of only $US16.20 a tonne, and at a cost of $US15.20 a tonne, taking lower energy costs and a lower Australian dollar into account.\nRio Tinto chief executive Sam Walsh in London for the company's first half earnings announcement. Photo: Julian Andrews\nThe iron ore division's profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is still running at more than 60 cents in every dollar of sales, and Rio's iron ore production is steadily rising, offsetting price weakness to an extent.\nIron ore accounts for almost three quarters of Rio's earnings, however, and if the iron ore price doesn't recover, the second half of this year will be even tougher.\nStill sliding Source: Bloomberg.\nThe market-Quote: d price of iron ore slid from around $US135 a tonne to about $US90 a tonne in the June half last year, and averaged $US111.79 a tonne.\nIn the second half of 2014 it continued to slide, hitting a low of $US66.84 two days before Christmas, and averaging $US82.54 a tonne\nIn the June half that Rio is now reporting on, it hit a low of $US47.08 a tonne at the beginning of April, but averaged $US60.46 a tonne.\nIt was $US56.78 a tonne on Thursday as Rio reported, however, and since June 30 has averaged $US52.60 a tonne - 13 per cent lower than the June half year average, and 53 per cent below the June 2014 half year average.\nWalsh says that when times are dark, quality producers shine. He also says that new iron ore production is now roughly in balance with production that is being sidelined because it is unprofitable.\nWeaker outlook The chances of iron ore once again super-charging Rio's profit as it did when prices were above $US100 a tonne between 2010 and the middle of last year are hugely remote, however. Predictions are perilous, but the current trend is for Rio's December half profit to be even weaker that the June half one was.\nRio has maintained its progressive dividend policy however, and the slide in the value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar is helping Rio shareholders in this country.\nRio's progressive dividend policy aims at boosting US dollar dividends over time. It pays dividends here in Australian dollars, which means they are affected by the $A-$US exchange rate.\nA year ago when the Australian dollar was worth about US93¢, it declared an interim dividend of US96¢, and an Australian currency dividend of 103.1¢.\nThe $A was down to about US78.3¢ in February this year, when it declared a final dividend of US119¢ and an Australian dividend of just under $1.53 a share.\nThe new interim dividend is US107.5¢ - half the previous full-year dividend, as per the progressive dividend policy settings.\nThat is 11.5¢, or 12 per cent, above last year's interim payout in US dollar terms.\nWith the $A now down around US73¢ cents however, the $A dividend is a fraction below $1.45 - almost 41 per cent better than last year's $A interim payout.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:16:32.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
