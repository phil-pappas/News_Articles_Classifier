Coal miners such as \nIndo Tambangraya and Adaro Energy were among \nthe decliners. \nThe Philippine index erased most early gains, ending \nnearly flat amid foreign-led selling in energy shares with First \nGen Corp hitting a three-week low. \nBangkok's SET index eased 0.6 percent in the final \nweek of the quarterly reporting season. Shares of Thai Airways \nInternational Pcl fell 0.8 percent ahead of its \nearnings results due on Tuesday. \nBucking the trend, Vietnam's benchmark VN Index \nclosed 1.78 percent higher, its biggest jump since July 22, led \nby Vinamilk and BaoViet Holdings. \nThe Singapore market was closed for National Day holidays. \nFor Asian Companies click;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T13:45:26.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
