Their resilience, focus and hard work have not gone unnoticed by the corporate world, Kenyan media and the rest of East Africa,” he said. \nKwinika invited Kenyan and East African banks, ICT companies, energy companies and mining companies to make use of CAJ News Kenya since it was there to service them. \n“After the corporate world had tried the rest, now it is time to try the best Pan African news service to market their products and services.
