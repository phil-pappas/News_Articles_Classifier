Power's annual survey on credit card customer satisfaction, Discover ranks highest with customers, usurping American Express for the first time in the survey's nine years. Last year, the two companies tied for first place.To earn the top spot, Discover scored a 828 out of 1,000, based on responses from customers who rated credit card issuers on customer service interaction and problem resolution, credit card terms and conditions, billing and rewards.\"The fact that Discover ranks highest in satisfaction among all credit card issuers...is a testament of the relentless focus and importance the company has placed on the ease of redemption and use of benefits,\" says Jim Miller, senior director of banking services at J.D. Power.Rewards and benefits are the two main reasons customers select a credit card, according to the survey, and it's also what drives their satisfaction with the card and the amount they spend on it.Discover offers a popular, no annual fee rewards card and was the first major credit card issuer to offer free FICO credit scores to cardholders, a move that has since been mimicked by the likes of Chase and Bank of America.Discover also boasts that all of its 24/7 call centers are based in the U.S. and touts customer-friendly policies like waiving the late fee the first time you make a late payment. It recently introduced a feature that allows you to freeze purchases on a lost card online -- and unfreeze them just as quickly when you find it.While the main beef customers have had with Discover is that it isn't accepted at as many merchants as other cards, it's been catching up. Some 9.2 million locations in the U.S. accepted Discover cards in 2013, according to the most recent data from the Nilson Report, up 2% from 2012 and 24% from 2009.American Express ranks second on the list with a score of 820 and Chase comes in third with a score of 792. The overall satisfaction credit cardholders reported is at a record high of 790, topping last year's record high of 778, said J.D. Power.Where does your credit card company rank?
