There has never been a better time to come explore this South American nation, where pro cyclists on the world circuit train year-round,” commented Anisha Munoz , President and Co-founder of Equipo. Equipo is a cycling travel and adventure company with its own line of innovative sportswear. The Colorado-based company is led by the husband and wife founders, Anisha and Rene Munoz. “Come ride with us. We’re meeting you at the airport in the second most biodiverse country on the planet, and we are by your side for the entire trip,” commented Anisha Munoz. Co-founder Rene Munoz leads many of the tours in Colombia , where he is from. “Being local allows us to share that special ingredient that can’t be found by flying in a guide,” added Rene Munoz. “Ride at an easy pace or prep this winter for an Ironman or Gran Fondo in our training camps.” Colombia was chosen in 2014 as the best eco-tourism destination by the World Travel Fair held in Shanghai. The Andes has mountain peaks that rival the Alps; however, the near-constant warm weather in Colombia is a huge draw. “Equipo surpassed my expectations and is opening the doors to a beautiful destination in a very unique and special way. They know the roads and set a high standard for cycling tours,” commented Founder and President of Nalsani-Totto , Yonathan Burztyn. A 5-day tour starts at USD $2,400 and includes lodging, all meals, van and motorcycle support, pro cyclist guides and mechanics, Equipo cycling kit, transfers and more. Leave your bike at home, as Equipo features a carbon bike fleet for rent by Denver-based Alchemy Bicycles . Non-riding options include Latin cooking classes, cultural sightseeing, trekking, spa packages and coffee cupping. For information, visit Equipo at www.equipo.pro .
