Talks over London night tube service to restart By Aideen Kennedy | Sharecast – 5 minutes ago Print \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - Talks aimed at resolving the impasse over new all-night tube services in London will resume on Monday between transport chiefs and unions representing London Underground workers. The fresh negotiations, to be chaired by conciliation service Acas, will be aimed at avoiding further disruptions after the 24-hour strike last Thursday over terms and conditions for the introduction of 24-hour train services from 12 September. \nLondon's mayor Boris Johnson admitted that the introduction of the night service tube would face delay due to the dispute with unions. \n\"I want it starting in the autumn. What I am fussed about is the offer being put to union members,\" Johnson commented. \n\"I am not going to authorise any more money. Most people would recognise that this is a very generous deal.\" Last week the unions rejected a 2% salary increase, an extra £200 per night shift for drivers and a £500 bonus for Night Tube staff after accusing London Underground of being \"completely inflexible\" about the terms for the night tube, leaving them \"no other choice\" than to go ahead with the strike.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:33:38.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
