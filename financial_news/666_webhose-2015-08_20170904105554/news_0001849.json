But over time, their operation became overly discretionary and complex, as political and patronage agendas surpassed the importance of maximizing returns. \nThe report identified five key areas bordering on the most pressing problems enveloping NNPC oil sales. \nResearchers said they arrived at their findings after reviewing published and unpublished official records, together with data from trade publications and secondary literature, and conducted dozens of interviews between 2010 and 2015. \nThe report made valuable recommendations, which somehow buttressed a recent statement by Kaduna Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, about the need to either scrap the NNPC or reform the oil and gas sector as a whole. \nExcepts from the reports relating to the five summary issues are presented as images below: Nigeria \nBoko Haram has released a new video on the insurgency in Nigeria, with its leader Abubakar Shekau again failing to … see more » Copyright © 2015 Premium Times.
