A host of new competitors, however, are much more imaginative about how they recruit new customers.\nTake Kabbage, a startup based in Atlanta which began lending to small companies online in 2011. A third of their applicants did not qualify for business loans because they had not yet started operations, had insufficient revenue or no formal legal structure. Many of them, however, did qualify for personal loans. So in September Kabbage launched a subsidiary called Karrot to give personal loans of up to $30,000 at interest rates of 6% to 26%.\nIn this section The battle of midpoint Yuan thing after another Whom to trust A new contract for growth In jeopardy Asset-rich, cash-poor Third time lucky? Automation angst Reprints Karrot worries less about borrowers’ credit history—the conventional approach—than about their cash flow. Customers must allow Karrot to monitor their current accounts and other financial data, such as credit-card bills. A big decline in income prompts an inquiry about an extended payment plan (to pre-empt a default); an increase prompts an offer of more credit. The initial evaluation takes only four minutes. Growth has been impressive: Karrot expects to lend $1 billion this year. Its default rate is 5%.\nUpstart, based in Palo Alto, is another firm learning to look beyond the credit record, in this case to borrowers’ educational history—an indicator of future earnings and thus the capacity to repay debt. It offers borrowers the chance to refinance credit-card debt, which comes at an average interest rate of 22%, with loans that typically cost half as much. Its credit model considers what college applicants attended (its database rates 5,000 of them), what their grades and scores in nationally administered tests were, and what subjects they studied. Those who specialised in science, technology, engineering and maths are better credit risks, predictably enough. But so are those studying teaching or nursing. They may not be future millionaires, but they are likely to find secure employment with stable salaries.\nAmong the most novel experiments is Vouch, based in San Francisco, which began providing small amounts of credit to people with poor credit scores last October. Its first customer was a medical student who received $5,000. To diminish the risk of default, borrowers must get several friends or family members to guarantee a small part of the loan.\nVouch determines the amount customers can borrow based on its assessment of their ability to pay. But the interest rate hinges on the amount pledged by supporters. It is still early days: just a few hundred loans have been granted so far, worth $2m. Not one has defaulted. That may merely reflect how recently the loans were issued, but it may be also be that borrowers are less inclined to disappoint friends than a faceless financial firm.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T00:11:32.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
