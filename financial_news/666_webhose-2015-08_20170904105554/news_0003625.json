Reuters by Andrew Kramer Ramping up enforcement of a ban on European food imports, the Russian authorities on Thursday destroyed hundreds of tonnes of foodstuffs they said violated the proscription, instituted a year ago in retaliation for Western sanctions over Ukraine.\nFollowing an order by President Vladimir Putin, officials threw huge piles of pork, tomatoes, peaches and cheese into landfills and garbage incinerators.\nThe frenzy, remarkable even by the standards of Russia's recent politicization of food supplies, was gleefully reported by Russian state television.\n\"You can see behind me cheese that was made nobody knows where, without labels,\" Yekaterina Mironova, a journalist on Rossiya 24 television, said, standing before a gigantic mound of orange cheese rounds as a bulldozer revved its engine in the background.\nThe offending cheese, she said, would be ploughed into a landfill in the Belgorod region of western Russia.\nNews reports chronicled the destruction throughout the day, along the entire breadth of Russia's western border, from Orenburg in the south to St. Petersburg in the north.\n\"German cheese being burned in Pulkovo,\" stated one headline on the news portal Gazeta.ru.\nThroughout the Ukraine crisis, there has been a war in which more than 6,000 people have died and, on the sidelines, a food fight. Russia has a track record of applying food import rules politically.\n In 2013, the Kremlin banned Ukrainian chocolate, ostensibly for health reasons. As tensions escalated, Russia banned European milk products like yoghurt, giving rise to the term Milk Curtain for the new East-West divide in Europe.\nAfter Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian banks and oil companies over Moscow's support for separatism in eastern Ukraine, Russia turned, as it has so often before, to food, banning European and U.S. imports.\nBut Russia's notoriously corrupt customs inspections turned out to be as porous as, well, Swiss cheese. Many products, like Danish canned ham, easily found in Moscow grocery stores, were slipping through.\nImporters had taken to obscuring the origins of shipments, suggesting they came from Turkey rather than a European Union country, for example, or importers used other ruses to slip sustenance over the borders.\nIn response, Putin on July 29 issued a decree, \"On Special Economic Measures to Protect the Russian Federation's Security,\" ordering the destruction of contraband food discovered inside Russia starting Thursday.\nIn one instance in southern Russia, workers fed 114 tonnes of pork into an incinerator, while 73 tonnes of peaches labelled as Turkish reached the end of the road on a highway west of Moscow.\nIn the Smolensk region on Thursday, agricultural and sanitary officials said they had detected a load of European tomatoes.\n\"The European origin of the tomatoes was established by the logistics of the load,\" the regional office of the inspection agency tasked with the food destruction, Rosselkhoznadzor, told Interfax.\nVladimir Severinov, the head of the agency in the Smolensk region, said the \"cargo will be destroyed with the aid of heavy machinery, tractors, bulldozers. The process will be recorded on video.\"\nIn a country with a history of food shortages, the televised destruction of food evoked a sense of pride in a country that can afford, if it so chooses, to grind cheese into the ground or donate it to others. Russia last accepted food aid in 1998.\nThe daily newspaper Izvestia Quote: d a member of the group Communists of Russia as saying that the seized food should be sent to Africa, where it would \"elevate the prestige of our country among the people of Africa.\"\nOther public figures suggested feeding the confiscated contraband food to orphans.\nHowever, in a country where food prices have in some cases doubled and tripled with the collapse of the ruble and the import ban, tens of thousands of people endorsed an online petition asking Putin to cancel his decree and stop wasting food. A spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, said Putin would be informed of the petition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T00:46:16.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
