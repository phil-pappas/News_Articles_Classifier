Stocks added to gains in the hours after its release. \n\"The Fed, as usual, is keeping its options open,\" said Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Ian Shepherdson. \nIn the week's most prominent economic report, the Commerce Department estimated second-quarter growth at a solid 2.3 percent, slightly below the 2.5 percent consensus estimate, but the strongest pace since the 2014 third quarter's 4.3 percent. \nThe government also upgraded its appraisal of the first quarter to 0.6 percent growth from a 0.2 percent contraction. \n- Earnings mixed bag - \nSeveral prominent technology names suffered big sell-offs after earnings reports disappointed investors. \nSocial networking stocks LinkedIn, Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) and Yelp (Xetra: Y9L.DE - news ) all experienced double-digit routs after their reports suggested dimmer-than-expected growth prospects. \nWhole Foods Market (NasdaqGS: WFM - news ) also suffered a drop on this scale after executives said sales had been dented from its acknowledgement that it had overcharged customers in New York City stores. \nPetroleum-linked stocks were another weak area, with both ExxonMobil and Chevron (Swiss: CVX.SW - news ) closing the week out sharply lower after reporting big earnings drops on low oil prices. \nBut other companies won accolades from the market. \nAmong tech companies, Expedia (NasdaqGS: EXPE - news ) soared after earnings quadrupled following acquisitions. Biotech companies Amgen (HKSE: 4332.HK - news ) and Gilead Sciences (NasdaqGS: GILD - news ) also did well. \nAmong older companies, Ford Motor (NYSE: F - news ) and UPS gained on better-than-expected results, while Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) also rose after lifting its profit forecast. \nThe week's biggest deal was the purchase of Allergan (NYSE: AGN - news ) 's generic drug business by Israeli giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries for $40.5 billion. \nNext (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) week's earnings calendar includes reports from Disney, Time Warner (Xetra: AOL1.DE - news ) and 21st Century Fox. Auto companies are scheduled to release US sales data for July. \nA heavy schedule of economic releases includes reports from the Institute for Supply Management on the services and manufacturing sectors and culminates Friday with the Labor Department's US jobs report for July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T01:48:40.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
