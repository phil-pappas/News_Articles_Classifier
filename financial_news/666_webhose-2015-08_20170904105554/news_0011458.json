The benchmark 10-year yield recorded its sharpest one-day rise in six weeks. It had been on track for its biggest one-day jump in two years but retreated from its session peak as Wall Street swung into the red in late trading. Encouraging data on domestic housing and consumer confidence helped revive some bets the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by year-end. A few well-known investors including Ray Dalio, however, warned the Fed will hurt the global economy if it ends its near-zero rate policy. \"The People's Bank of China move has benefited the stock market and pulled some of the safe-haven bids out of the bond market,\" said Larry Milstein, head of U.S. government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co in New York. The latest bout of investor jitters has touched off bond market volatility, as measured by Bank of America Merrill Lynch's MOVE indexes , to the highest levels in five months. It was unclear whether China's latest step would stop a domestic stock market plunge that has spread to other markets, analysts said. \"I don't think we are necessarily done. They have capacity for more easing,\" said Anthony Valeri, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial in San Diego. The global market turmoil may force Fed policymakers to abandon plans to raise rates at their September meeting, analysts said. On the supply front, the Treasury Department sold $26 billion in two-year notes to tepid demand. It will sell $13 billion in two-year floating-rate notes and $35 billion in five-year fixed-rate debt on Wednesday. On the open market, benchmark 10-year Treasuries notes fell 26/32 point in price for a yield of 2.091 percent, up 9 basis points from late Monday, while the 30-year bond shed 2-4/32 points in price with its yield at 2.822 percent, up 10 basis points for its largest one-day jump in six weeks. Major U.S. stock indexes reversed all their gains in late trading with the Dow and S&P losing more than 1 percent at the close. But oil and other key commodities managed to recover from multi-year lows. The bond market selloff accelerated after data showed slighter faster U.S. home appreciation in June and a rebound in new home sales in July. The Conference Board said its barometer on U.S. consumer confidence rose its strongest level since January.
