The Cupertino, California-based company said it had profit of $3.06 per share. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The maker of iPhones, iPads and other products posted revenue of $74.6bn in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Analysts expected $67.38bn... \" \nThe paragraph was picked from the newswire, Associated Press (AP). Newswire organisations offer a service to media organisations and newspapers, such as this one, by providing breaking news stories, stock-market results, or other up-to-the-minute information. \nThe news item on Apple is an example of straight forward reporting on facts as they obtain that could have been written by any reporter; only that it was purely written by computer software developed by Automated Insights, a company that \"has worked out a way of teaching machines how to write journalism.\" \nThe Guardian explains that Automated Insights is \"one of a number of companies that have married huge advances in pattern recognition software with the revolution in natural language generation to create algorithms that resemble a writer.\" (Google the article, \"And the Pulitzer goes to... a computer\"). \nSuch softwares are only one nail on the reporter's coffin. There are the business and social aspects. \nAs a business, mainstream media organisations have been subjected to serious competition in advertising sales and in information provision on the Internet. This has had an effect on the employability of reporters as many get laid off. \nConsumers would rather read free news online as advertisers look to exploit far lower rates to reach far more highly targeted audiences through online channels such as Google, Facebook and other social media. \nThis underscores the social aspect of media. News has distinctive, socially advantageous qualities throughout human evolution. \nIn fact, as media researchers point out, journalism as we know it required the growth of cities, while editorial content made news into a successful business with a generous complement of crime, sports, human interest and entertainment. \nIn this manner media channels can pull together large groups of people with diverse perspectives and interests into a shared public conversation. \nThis is how social media on the Internet has thrived, especially given that people interact in real time no matter where they are in the world sharing news and other interests. \nIt is because of this media organisations have had to meet a much higher standard of originality and distinctiveness in the face of Twitter, Facebook and other social media. \nFactor in mobile phone penetration, as the smartphone and the Internet continues to make inroads even in rural communities. Mobile networks remain the only way that people are getting connected, with Internet playing an exceedingly important social role. \nBut while the social media has its merits, even as it spells doom to the reporter, it is remains a noisy marketplace offering up a cacophony of opinion and conflicting claims. \nAnd, as The Guardian observes, the machine is not about to write nuanced profiles or wisecracking think pieces. \nAt least, not yet, according to the developers of the writing software. Rwanda \nEconomic experts are calling for more focus on simple cross-border trade in order to boost incomes and living standards. see more » Copyright © 2015 The New Times. All rights reserved.
