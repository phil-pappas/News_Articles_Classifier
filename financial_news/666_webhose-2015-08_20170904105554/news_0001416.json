Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! By Kailash Babar MUMBAI: Real estate-focused private equity fund Milestone Capital is planning to raise Rs 500-800 crore through a commercial property fund in the next six months, said a top company official. The private equity player has raised Rs 2,800 crore so far for investing in real estate, of which over Rs 1,200 crore has been raised and deployed in commercial real estate across the country in a joint venture with IL&FS Investment Managers. \"We are confident that our expansion in commercial fund business will be well supported by investors, given our performance so far. We have divested 25 projects in the last three years and have returned close to 100% of entire real estate portfolio, probably the first by any domestic private equity real estate fund platform,\" Rubi Arya, executive vice-chairman, Milestone Capital Advisors, told ET. \"Apart from consistently distributing returns to our investors through regular exits across our funds, we have also been steadily making investments.\" Recently, Milestone Real Estate Fund exited from its investment in Vikhroli Corporate Park that owned 247 Park commercial complex at Vikhroli suburb of Mumbai. â€” Kailash Babar Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
