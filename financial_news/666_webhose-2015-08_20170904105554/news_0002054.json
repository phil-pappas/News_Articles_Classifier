Symantec could not immediately be reached for comment.\nBloomberg had reported first last month that Symantec was nearing a deal to sell Veritas to Carlyle for between $7 billion and $8 billion.\nSymantec has been seeking buyers for Veritas for several months, but interest from potential buyers was limited because of a tax burden associated with splitting the company.\nSymantec had been planning to separate its business focused on corporate and consumer security software, which had $4.2 billion in revenue last year, from Veritas, which has about $2.5 billion in revenue. It announced the tax-free spinoff last October.\nInvestor pressure has been building on legacy technology companies such as Symantec to become more agile and capitalize on faster-growing businesses, whether it's through corporate breakups or divestitures.
