Getty Images by Joanna Mather and Sally Rose Fund managers have expressed interest in doing what human rights activists and journalists have been begging for but been denied: a tour of Australia's remote detention centres on Manus Island and Nauru.\nAFR Weekend spoke to several fund mangers, none of whom wished to be Quote: d. but all said they wanted to see first hand the centres operated by ASX-listed Transfield Services.\nDelivering its full-year results last week amid ongoing allegations about mistreatment of detainees, Transfield signalled its intention to let fund managers see the centres first hand.\nSuch site visits are not unusual, especially where a business is being run in challenging circumstances. The centres are owned by the Australian government, which does not allow visitors but may grant visas for the company.\nGreens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young has objections to journalists being excluded from Manus Island and Nauru. Alex Ellinghausen In response Greens' immigration spokesperson Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said if fund managers were given a tour of detention centres, journalists should be allowed to accompany them.\n\"Journalists and independent human rights groups have been shut out of Nauru and Manus Island for too long,\" she said. \"This veil of secrecy has allowed a disturbing culture of abuse to fester.\"\nMs Hanson-Young has welcomed the decision by a handful of superannuation funds to either sell out of Transfield or pledge not to invest in the future.\nTransfield expects the government to renew a $2.2 billion contact to provide operational, maintenance and welfare services on Manus and Nauru. The contract expires on October 31.\n Analysts from Citi and Credit Suisse upgraded their advice on Transfield shares to \"buy\" after the company released its results for 2014 on Thursday. Transfield said it had $24 billion of contract opportunities in the pipeline.\nTransfield's shares recovered 9.1 per cent over the past week to $1.08 at Friday's close.\nFurther allegations due on Monday A senate inquiry report due to be released on Monday will draw further attention to allegations of mistreatment of detainees on Nauru.\nAnalysts not wishing to be named, told AFR Weekend it has been difficult to determine whether Transfield and its contractors are in fact responsible for any wrongdoing.\nTransfield chief executive Graeme Hunt said he was confident the company was doing the best job possible.\n\"I have no doubt that our participation in the contracts are making a positive impact to many asylum seekers,\" he said.\n\"Some of the people we have engaged with on this issue have told us they feel sorry for us because we are the meat in the sandwich,\" he said.\nAs Fairfax Media revealed earlier this month, industry super funds HESTA, NGS and Unisuper have sold out of Transfield.\nHESTA, which sold $23 million worth of shares based on concern Transfield's financial value was at risk, said an information blackout made assessing the risk difficult.\nThe board of NGS Super last week agreed to dump $5.5 million in Transfield shares. The fund's chief executive, Anthony Rodwell-Ball, said the divestment decision was made on moral grounds but could be justified on economic grounds.\nThis was because NGS \"will actively seek replacement sources of earnings and growth in the market, such that our members' retirement outcomes will not be prejudiced by the decision\".\nFinancial Services Council policy director Andrew Bragg blasted the NGS approach. \"Super funds are there for retirement savings, not for running moral or political campaigns,\" he said.\nIndustry Super Australia chief executive David Whiteley said decisions to divest had been made after thorough assessments.\n\"Super funds decided to divest from manufacturers of tobacco, cluster bombs and uranium,\" he said.\n\"Ultimately these decisions reflected community expectations, changing moral attitudes and the long-term financial prospects of these companies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:19:55.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
