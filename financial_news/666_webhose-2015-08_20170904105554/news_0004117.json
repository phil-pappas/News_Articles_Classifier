Getty Images Share on twitter by John Stensholt Holden will on Wednesday sign one of the biggest sports club sponsorship deals in Australian sport with AFL team Collingwood, in an agreement understood to be worth more than $3 million annually.\nThe car giant will replace banking group Westpac as the naming rights sponsor for Collingwood's training and administration facility near the Melbourne Cricket Ground and step up to be a top-tier premier partner.\nHolden's deal is understood to top the five-year $10 million agreement Collingwood signed with Emirates last year for the airline to remain a premier partner alongside CGU, Latrobe Financial and Star Athletic.\nCollingwood president and media identity Eddie McGuire is expected to announce the deal in Melbourne on Wednesday alongside Holden executives at what will become known as the Holden Centre.\nCentre revamp The centre is currently being expanded as part of a $32 million revamp that includes new training, office, community and event areas.\nHolden is currently a second-tier or platinum sponsor of Collingwood, having signed a three-year agreement in early 2012. The car company also agreed to a $10 million three-year deal with the NRL, including being the main sponsor of the popular State of Origin series.\nIt is understood the car company's rugby league deal is being renegotiated as part of several State of Origin sponsorships the NRL is seeking to extend.\n Holden is ceasing the manufacturing of its cars in Australia by 2017 and has focused more on large sporting sponsorship deals to maintain a visible presence for its brand.\nAs well as motorsport, Holden sponsors a women's professional cycling team and counts Tour de France winning cyclist Cadel Evans and netball stars Laura Geitz and Kim Green among its ambassadors.\nCollingwood is considered the richest and most popular club in the AFL, though it has struggled on the field in the second half of the 2015 season and is set to miss the finals series starting in September.\nThe club recorded a $2.02 million profit in 2014 from $76 million revenue, which included more than $19 million from commercial activities such as sponsorship.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-18T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:10:38.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
