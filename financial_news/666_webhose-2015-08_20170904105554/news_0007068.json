As we discussed earlier, the company will focus on ten product categories and 65 brands. P&G expects its core EPS (earnings per share) to be restated from $4.02 to $3.77 per share due to the exit from beauty business brands. \nP&G also estimates a 4%–5% negative foreign currency impact on the EPS that might affect the first half of fiscal 2016. \nIn its 2015 outlook, Kimberly-Clark (KMB) expects its adjusted EPS to come in at $5.65–$5.80. Clorox (CLX) expects its diluted EPS from continuing operations to be $4.68–$4.83. Both companies are expecting EPS growth compared to the previous year. Strong cash flow productivity \nP&G expects another strong year of free cash flow productivity driven by improved payables and continued steady improvement in inventory. P&G won’t include the results from its Venezuelan operations in the consolidated results. This will create a minor drag on organic sales growth trends and a $0.05–$0.06 per share headwind on core EPS. Future growth by reshaping its portfolio \nAlso, P&G’s divestiture of its beauty brands to Coty (COTY) will likely improve P&G’s profitability after the exit. Coty has offered $12.5 billion for P&G’s 43 beauty brands. In addition, Duracell’s deal with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) would also lead to changes in P&G’s capital structure. \nAs a result of these deals, P&G expects to retire about $13 million and $16 billion worth of shares through share exchange transactions. This would reduce the number of outstanding shares by ~18%, according to comments by P&G’s CFO Jon Moeller.

P&G’s CEO, Alan Lafley, expects to deliver strong margins—driven by another year of strong productivity-driven savings. \nP&G has exposure to the iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV). It accounts for 1.20% of the total weight of the portfolio. \nFor more industry updates and analysis, please Market Realist’s Consumer Products page . \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T02:56:08.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
