In the last two months, we have extended this further by piloting the IMPS refunds programme, which has seen positive adoption and traction from our end users,\" Flipkart chief product officer Punit Soni said. \nAn instant, hassle-free refund experience, combined with consistent and accurate communication to the customer is definitely going to be a breakthrough, and a way forward for all future payment innovations, he added. \n\"We strongly feel that enabling our fast-growing product IMPS with Flipkart's quicker refund strategy will create a benchmark experience to customers,\" National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) COO Dilip Asbe said. \nTransactions on IMPS can be accessed and initiated across different channels like mobile phones, PCs, NUUP, ATM and at bank branches. More than 12 million successful transactions are been processed every month, Asbe said.
