When could we see an important break? Relatively limited FX event risk in the week ahead suggests traders may have to wait for bigger currency swings. And indeed, last week’s US Nonfarm Payrolls report failed to force sustained volatility as market attention shifts to the US Federal Reserve’s highly-anticipated September 17 meeting. It’s possible we may have to wait until the month of September for a much larger US Dollar break; our Senior Market Strategist expects that a break below 12,050 would mean the larger move will be to the downside. Forex volatility prices have fallen noticeably as traders predict slow market moves through the foreseeable future. Forex Volatility Prices Pull Back on Lower Risk of Large Market Moves Data source: Bloomberg, DailyFX Calculations Our focus thus turns to lower-volatility trading strategies until further notice. One key exception is the US Dollar/Canadian Dollar currency pair; high volatility prices keep our focus on the Breakout2 strategy. See the table below for full detail on market conditions and preferred trading strategies.

Contact David via Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/DRodriguezFX Definitions Volatility Percentile – The higher the number, the more likely we are to see strong movements in price. This number tells us where current implied volatility levels stand in relation to the past 90 days of trading. We have found that implied volatilities tend to remain very high or very low for extended periods of time. As such, it is helpful to know where the current implied volatility level stands in relation to its medium-term range. Trend – This indicator measures trend intensity by telling us where price stands in relation to its 90 trading-day range. A very low number tells us that price is currently at or near 90-day lows, while a higher number tells us that we are near the highs. A value at or near 50 percent tells us that we are at the middle of the currency pair’s 90-day range. Range High – 90-day closing high. Range Low – 90-day closing low. Last – Current market price. Bias – Based on the above criteria, we assign the more likely profitable strategy for any given currency pair. A highly volatile currency pair (Volatility Percentile very high) suggests that we should look to use Breakout strategies. More moderate volatility levels and strong Trend values make Momentum trades more attractive, while the lowest Vol Percentile and Trend indicator figures make Range Trading the more attractive strategy.
