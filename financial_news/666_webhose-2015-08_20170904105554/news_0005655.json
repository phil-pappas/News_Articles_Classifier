Photo: Louie Douvis\nAll is not well at the farm gate. At a time when dining is meant to be the boom to help replace mining – even iron ore tycoons Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest have got in on the act – farmers targeting the premium end are running into regulators.\nIn the next fortnight, wagyu beef farmer David Blackmore – whose produce takes pride of place at Neil Perry's restaurants – has to make a decision to defend his livelihood.\nIn late June, his local council, Murrindindi Shire, in the high country north-east of Melbourne, refused to grant him a permit to continue farming beef in a non-intensive way.\nChef Neil Perry with a raw Blackmore wagyu steak at Rockpool. Photo: Louie Douvis\nThis is despite him earning the name \"Mr Wagyu\" in the dish's traditional market, Japan, and exporting to high-end restaurants in some 20 countries.\nBut Mr Blackmore, 65, said he is not fighting alone. \"This is a much bigger issue that David Blackmore and Murrindindi Council,\" he told Fairfax Media this week.\nVictoria's planning and agriculture ministers Richard Wynne and Jaala Pulford are reviewing farming zone laws after an increasing number of \"treechangers\" have butted heads with their farmer neighbours over smells, noises and other issues associated with agriculture practices.\n\"I am concerned about some recent cases where we are seeing farming families who have been on the land for generations now required to seek a permit to farm,\" Ms Pulford said.\nIn Mr Blackmore's case, it began just over five years ago when Perry invited him to a private screening of controversial US documentary, Food, Inc .\nBefore he watched the movie, Mr Blackmore had used feedlots – an intensive farming practice, where animals are fattened up before slaughter.\nThe movie, Perry said, showed the harm factory farming, combined with the low cost of corn, was doing to the US agriculture industry.\n\"David walked away, saying 'Gosh we have to do something about this', and hatched the plan to bring his animals out to walk on grass, lay on grass, roam the paddock and walk up to the end of the paddock to supplement feed from time to time, and run 25 cattle, where you'd normally lot feed 500,\" Perry said.\n\"That's the difference between intensive factory farming and what David is doing.\"\nBut five years after setting up his new system, Mr Blackmore was forced to apply for an intensive animal husbandry permit. Neighbours complained about his new way of farming, which he said was more intensive than traditional beef farming but on par with a dairy operation.\nHe also said his stocking levels – the number of cows he keeps in his paddocks – was significantly less than the previous owner's, who established the farm, which borders the Goulburn River near Alexandra about 165 kilometres north-east of Melbourne, in 1998.\nThe council rejected his application against advice from its planning officers and agriculture consultant Professor Roger Wrigley, who recommended Mr Blackmore's operation continue subject to a few conditions.\nThis raised the ire of Perry, who started an online petition at change.org and has now attracted more 91,000 supporters.\n\"This absolutely should be held up as the benchmark of how supplement feed animals in Australia should be treated because it's ethical and sustainable,\" Perry said.\n\"That's why I'm so pissed off about the whole thing. He is a pioneer and creative guy but he's one of the leading farmers in the country. Essentially they don't have a box to put him in, so they put him in the intensive, factory farming box, and it's just not the case.\"\nA retired couple who bought a lifestyle acreage, surrounded by Mr Blackmore, were among those who complained. Mr Blackmore says he doesn't blame them or anybody, instead taking issue with planning regulations.\nHe said rural zone policies were at odds with state and federal governments urging farmers to become more productive and adopt more efficient farming practices.\nMr Blackmore said an unintended result from shifting his cows to pasture was increasing his yield – or cattle weight gain – by about 20 per cent.\n\"People said I was mad when I did it, saying I could wreck a good business because the meat would become tougher because the cows would be using their muscles walking around,\" he said.\n\"But the opposite happened. The animals are content. They lay down on the grass all day, chewing their cud. In the feed lot, they'd only lay down if they were absolutely exhausted.\"\nCindy McLeish, the local Liberal MP representing Eildon where Mr Blackmore's farm is located, said this type of innovation should be encouraged.\nInstead she said the confidence of farmers in her electorate \"has certainly taken a hit\".\n\"The farmers now question their right to farm,\" she said.\n\"People that move to [farming] areas really need to have their eyes wide open about what it means to be living next to a farm and understanding that the paddocks might be green at the moment but it's an operational farm.\"\nThe state's peak farm lobby, the Victorian Farmers Federation, has called on the government to \"make sensible planning reforms to protect agricultural land\".\n\"We are calling for ... planning schemes that encourage the growth of farm businesses, rather than stifle them with uncertainty,\" VFF president Peter Tuohey said.\n\"Farming needs to take precedence in a farming zone. While tree and seachangers may love the rolling hills and open spaces, they can't then object to the dust, smell and noise that are part of everyday life in the farming zone.\"\nAmong the VFF's recommendations to the government are scrapping planning permits for wool and beef farmers, but retaining them for piggery, feedlots and broiler chicken operations.\nMr Wynne has heard the message. \"I am working with Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford's office and we are identifying problems and potential solutions for farmers,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure the definition and interpretation of farming policy is clear – one thing farmers can be very sure of is this government's commitment to protecting their industry.\"\nIn the meantime the clock is ticking for Mr Blackmore, who is yet to decide whether he will appeal Murrindindi's Council's decision or close the gates of his farm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:46:22.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
