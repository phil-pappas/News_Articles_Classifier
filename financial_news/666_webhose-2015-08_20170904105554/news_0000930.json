Daniel Munoz by Joyce Moullakis Jonathan Shapiro These are not crisis times for Australian banks. Yet in the space of a week ANZ and then CBA raised $8 billion worth of capital taking the total raised this year to $16 billion.\nThis surpasses the $13 billion raised at the height of the global financial crisis.\nThe origins of the greatest capital build in Australia's corporate history can be traced back to July 2014 when David Murray delivered the interim findings of his Financial System Inquiry.\nThe former Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief's review was expected to call for an end to an era of red tape that had tied the banks up after the crisis.\nBut after touring the world in search of answers he found global forces moving in the opposite direction. Even before the interim FSI report, investment bankers were circling, ensuring frequent conversations with the big four in preparation for any changes to capital requirements.\nThe world's regulators were demanding that their banks demonstrate they were among the safest and best capitalised around the globe. Australia's institutions might have withstood the financial crisis but were in danger of falling to the middle of the pack.\nWhen Murray delivered his final report on December 7, 2014, the essence of his message was that while we were reliant on foreign funding, our banks had to be 'unquestionably strong\". He doubted this was the case.\nMurray's inquiry also called for an end to the free kick given to the biggest banks that allowed them to hold less capital per dollar of mortgages on account of their advanced risk models.\n The second recommendation had two aims. One was to support competition in the banking system by reducing the big banks' advantage. The other was to reduce the leverage to the housing market. But a change to the risk weighting on mortgages would require the banks to increase their capital levels. Sell-side analysts crunched the numbers and estimated about $20 billion would need to be raised.\nYet the sharemarket's initial reaction was muted – the banks had plenty of capital and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which would enforce Murray's recommendations, would give the banks plenty of time.\nAPRA's new head sheriff, Wayne Byres, is indeed a pragmatist. But that trait meant he saw no reason to delay the capital build and began sending that message to the banks at every opportunity. And with a global initiative dubbed \"Basel IV\" in the works that would further ratchet up the capital requirements of the big banks, it was time to get on with it.\nHe made the point at the AFR Banking & Wealth Summit in April, warning the banks the call to hold more capital would come sooner than they were thinking. It was then that bank shareholders took note, and financial institutions bankers again refreshed their pitch books.\nNow was the time to strike, before the cycle turned. The pressure began to build and in May Westpac was the first to budge, with new chief Brian Hartzer unveiling a $2 billion raising through an underwritten dividend reinvestment plan . Later in the week, ANZ Banking Group presented its earnings with chief Mike Smith defiant that the pressure to raise capital was more in the interests of the investment banks than shareholders . They would do it in their own time in their own way. In the background ANZ was also preparing for asset sales, including its Esanda dealer finance unit.\nLater that week National Australia Bank upped the stakes, announcing a surprise full-blown rights issue . At $5.5 billion it was the largest-ever raising on the ASX. NAB had to plug a hole created by its legacy UK assets but the quantum raised allowed them to leapfrog their bank competitors to the top of the capital pile.\nIt was a turning point. The global capital arms race had gone local and gone large. It was a bold move by the new NAB chief, Andrew Thorburn, but a few pointed to the role chairman Ken Henry, the former Treasury secretary, had in reading the regulatory tea-leaves.\nIn July, the banks got clarity when APRA told them they'd need 200 basis points, or $28 billion collectively , to be among the top quartile of capitalised global banks.\nA week later APRA lifted mortgage risk weights from 16 to 25 per cent , further upping the demands for capital by an extra $12 billion, but also giving the banks 12 months to get there. The analyst community made up their minds the banks would act soon.\nAt ANZ a hint that the mindset had changed came when finance boss Shayne Elliott told the company's website BlueNotes on July 21 that a rights issue such as that done by NAB was an \"option\". The transcript was lodged on the ASX given its materiality.\nElliott's signal was a deliberate one; showing investors the bank would do more to raise capital than sales of assets including stakes in Asian banks.\nThe bank didn't want to be last of the big four to tap investors, so the race was on. But if ANZ wanted to get in and out before CBA's full-year result announcement in mid-August it would have to move quickly.\nRick Moscati, the bank's long serving treasurer, had done a range of capital raisings including a $3.6 billion renounceable rights offer to fund the purchase of its National Bank of New Zealand in 2003.\nHe took his plans to raise $3 billion via an institutional placement and a share purchase plan to the board as the most appropriate structure. The combination would allow the bank to raise the funds quickly, at a small discount and would broadly reflect the bank's share register, which was two-thirds institutions and one-third retail investors. CBA was the elephant in the room and ANZ wanted to be in and out before its rival started its issuance.\nOn the evening of August 5, the banks were appointed to fully underwrite the deal. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan were called and told the deal was almost live, and signing confidentiality agreements was next. Project Roselend – as the raising had been dubbed – would be announced the following day. The name likely reflected the deal team and Moscati's love of cycling. The Cormet de Roselend has been crossed 10 times during the Tour de France.\nThe investment banks scurried to secure the relevant offshore approvals and the clock was ticking.\nMichael Richardson and Geoff Tarrant were Deutsche's points of contact, Andrew Best and Richard Galvin at JPMorgan, and John McLean and Rob Jahrling at Citi.\nA trading halt across the Ditch was followed by a local one. The ANZ deal was, however, a tough sell, at a tight 5 per cent discount at a time when markets were already reflecting an oversupply of new bank shares. The details were also unveiled alongside an ANZ trading update that wasn't well received.\nThe raising structure was criticised by some as being unfair to retail shareholders , but ANZ was adamant the structure was in the best interests of shareholders and allowed the majority of smaller investors to participate at a discount.\nBy the end of the week the institutional placement was covered and focus moved to CBA. Machinations in China and a sell-off in bank stocks saw ANZ's stock dip below the offer price as all sorts of questions were being asked.\nBy Monday this week the size structure and discount of the deal – a $5 billion pro-rata accelerated institutional, tradeable retail entitlement offer at a 10 per cent discount – was an open secret as a raising was sounded. On Tuesday, the final terms were signed off before the final structure was announced on Wednesday along with a record profit .\nThe second largest rights issue ever in Australia, underwritten by Morgan Stanley and UBS was structured to reflect the banks share register – which unlike ANZ's, was dominated by retail investors.\nCBA shares will begin trading again on Monday and Westpac's capital plans are now the latest subject of scrutiny and speculation. The great big bank capital build has a way to run yet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:08:24.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
