Fallon | Bloomberg Snapchat Inc. has tapped a former finance executive at Mattel, as its vice president of… more Mobile messaging company Snapchat Inc. has tapped Drew Vollero , a former finance executive at Mattel Inc. , as its vice president of finance and acting chief financial officer. Snapchat told the Wall Street Journal that Vollero will report to Imran Khan , a former technology banker hired last year as chief strategy officer at the Los Angeles-based company. The company has been searching for a CFO since late 2014, according to the Journal. A company spokeswoman told the newspaper although Vollero was named acting CFO, there is “every expectation” that Vollero will eventually become the permanent CFO Vollero worked for more than a decade at El Segundo-based Mattel (Nasdaq: MAT), most recently as senior vice president of corporate strategy, development and investor relations. Mattel, the world’s largest toy company, has recently launched turnaround efforts to revive lower sales and profits and replaced its CEO earlier this year. Among Vollero’s tasks as Snapchat’s CFO will be building the company’s finance department to prepare for an initial public offering. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in May the company plans an IPO, but didn’t specify the timing. The company is valued at about $16 billion by investors and is aiming to reach $50 million in revenue this year and $200 million in revenue next year, according to Re/code. Snapchat says it has 100 million users who watch 2 billion videos per day and its Live Stories attract an average of 20 million people every 24 hours, according to MediaPost . \nGet Los Angeles Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T09:14:11.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
