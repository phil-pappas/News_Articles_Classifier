Photo: Brook James Photographer\nThe expansive Dixon Hospitality Group has added another two venues to its growing pub business, taking control of the Middle Park and Newmarket hotels.\nFormer Spotless chief executive Bruce Dixon will step down this year from his top job at the cleaning and catering firm to help his son Mike grow his hospitality business.\nThe pair have since snapped up three venues in as many months.\nThe Newmarket and Middle Park pubs are their latest additions, closely following the May purchase of Albert Park's Vincent Hotel.\nThe fast-expanding pub group now has half a dozen leasehold hotels, including the Trading Wayside Inn, Station Hotel and the Hawksburn Hotel.\nMike Dixon said the group's \"gastronomic\" venues had a focus on quality food and functions.\nThe Newmarket in St Kilda, renovated by Six Degrees architects, retains its original facade while the Middle Park, a historic 1889 pub, boasts a 70-metre-long bar.\nMr Dixon would not be drawn on acquisition costs but said both pubs had more than 25 years on their leases and were bought at three-to-five times earnings.\nThe acquisitions were expected to completed by the end of September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:47:01.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
