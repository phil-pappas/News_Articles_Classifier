Nonetheless, the performance of the country?s growth engine has been disappointing in light of the boost expected from the decline in the euro exchange rate,\" said Jonathan Loynes, Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) 's chief European economist. \nThe industrial production figure for May was revised to 0.2 percent growth compared to April, against zero percent reported earlier. \nGermany's trade surplus narrowed to 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in June, according to seasonally adjusted figures released by federal statistics office Destasis. \nExports fell one percent to 101.1 billion euros from a month earlier, while imports contracted by 0.5 percent to 79.1 billion euros. \nFor the first six months of the year, however, the trade data looked better -- German gross exports reached nearly 600 billion euros, up seven percent from the first half of 2014. \nOther European Union member nations remained the biggest market for German exports. \nBut the rise was most marked to non-euro EU countries, where exports grew 8.5 percent in the first half, and to other world regions, where they increased 8.2 percent overall. \nThe weakness of the single currency against the dollar reduces the cost of European products for foreign buyers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T18:57:42.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
