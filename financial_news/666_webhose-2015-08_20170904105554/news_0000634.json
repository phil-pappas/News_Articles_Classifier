According to a recent survey from Deloitte , 31% of parents will wait until the school year has already begun to finish checking items off their shopping list. \n“Consumers are sending a message to retailers that says the back-to-school shopping season just isn’t that important anymore, and that could dramatically disrupt an industry that traditionally relies on this defined period for a significant portion of annual sales,” said Alison Paul, Deloitte LLP vice chairman and retail and distribution sector leader. \nAn increasing number of families are willing to reuse school supplies, with 39% planning to do so this year, compared to 26% in 2011. “If consumers are content with the items they already have, the two-for-one promotion may no longer get them to the register,\" Paul added. \"Instead, retailers will have to provide something more meaningful or exclusive that fits their customers’ needs when they are ready to buy.” More Headlines Retirement Gone Rogue: the Epidemic of Senior Citizen Drug and Alcohol Abuse \nBack-to-school shopping jumped 5% in 2014, with Americans spending $74.9 billion on K-12 and college supplies, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). For comparison, 2015 spending is expected to shrink slightly, to an estimated $68 billion. A surplus of supplies from previous years is one explanation for the declining spending, especially with Americans reporting a willingness to reuse what they already have on hand. \n“As seen over the last 13 years, spending on ‘back to school’ has consistently fluctuated based on children’s needs each year, and it’s unlikely most families would need to restock and replenish apparel, electronics and supplies every year,” said Matthew Shay, NRF president and CEO. “Parents this summer will inventory their children’s school supplies and decide what is needed and what can be reused, which just makes good budgeting sense for families with growing children.” \nDiscounts and sales may be less of a driver this year, with a reported 14% decrease in coupon clipping since 2011. A majority of parents (80%) will turn to their smartphones to research products and deals before heading to the stores. Good deals can be found, and parents should continue to look for ways to save on whatever supplies they are planning to buy. Here are the top three ways parents can keep their budget in check as summer comes to a close and the kids head back to school. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:09:54.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
