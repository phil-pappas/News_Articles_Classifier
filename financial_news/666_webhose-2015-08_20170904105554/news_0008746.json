It now ships about 65 kegs a week to about 50 customers, Gillies president Donald Schoenholt said from the company's roasting plant near Brooklyn's waterfront.\nThat's only about 3 percent of the 1 million pound-a-year roaster's business, but Schoenholt said entering the space was crucial for capturing summertime coffee drinkers.\n\"We think 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now, we're going to see a significant bump\" in summer coffee sales, Schoenholt said while pouring a cold brew from a tap this week.\nFROM STUBBY TO STARBUCKS\nTo be sure, not all cold brewers use a higher dose, and some specialty roasters argue it fails to extract quality beans' full flavor potential.\nStill, Americans' thirst for cold coffee has been rising for years.\nLast year, they consumed 90 million gallons of ready-to-drink coffee beverages, ranging from bottled Starbucks Frappuchinos to cartons of Stumptown cold brew, up 52 percent from 2009, data from Beverage Marketing Corporation show.\nBy contrast, sales of carbonated soft drinks, which still swamps the coffee market, dropped for five straight years to 12.8 billion gallons last year. That was down 9 percent from 2009.\nIn addition, the percentage of coffee shops and restaurants serving iced coffee rose from 19 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in 2013, data from market research firm Mintel show.\nCold brew was popularized when Portland-based, private equity-backed Stumptown Coffee Roasters started selling ready-to-drink coffee in a \"stubby\" bottle in 2011. Now with Starbucks' entrance, cold brew has hit the mainstream.\n\"Having Starbucks come into it is the 5,000-pound gorilla in every conversation about coffee,\" Pollack of Brooklyn Roasting said.\nThe popularity growth of this stronger brewing method may support overall U.S. coffee demand, providing a counter-weight to the growth of single-serve coffee pods, which are widely seen as limiting demand by reducing coffee waste.\nU.S. coffee consumption will fall next year for the first time in six years, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast.\n\"If we can make cold a more compelling thing, that will take out a little bit of the sting,\" said Brett Struwe of Caribou Coffee.\nSchoenholt recalled entering a Brooklyn convenience store this summer and noting the large quantities of ready-to-drink cold coffee drinks for sale on shelf space once dominated by more traditional American summertime favorites.\n\"We're winning,\" he said.
