Ideally located between North and South America, as well as the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, Panama City has developed an unrivalled transportation and communication network. It operates two of the busiest ports in Latin America, including the Colon Free Trade Zone - the world's second largest free trade zone. Additionally, the ongoing expansion of the Panama Canal has helped contribute to Panama’s economic growth in recent years. \n“Panama City will be our first destination gateway in Central America, providing a convenient option for our passengers travelling from or through our global hub in Dubai and onward to destinations throughout Central America, the Caribbean and the northern part of South America,” said His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive of Emirates Airline & Group. “We’re also pleased to be the only commercial airline to offer a daily, First Class service to travellers on what will be the world’s longest non-stop flight.” \n\"It is gratifying to see how diplomatic efforts focused on generating development and prosperity for Panama materialise,\" said The Honourable Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado , Vice President of the Republic of Panama. “New doors to the country will open with a direct connection to the Middle East - a strong and thriving region with great synergies to both Panama and Latin America.” Other Stories Follow Us Here's something to think about: How come you never see a headline like 'Psychic Wins Lottery'?
