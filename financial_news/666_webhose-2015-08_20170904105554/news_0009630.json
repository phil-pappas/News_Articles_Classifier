Reuters by Alan Mitchell China is a source of anxiety for global markets, but it is Europe that may be the more immovable stone in the shoe of the world economy.\nThe market's focus has been on Greece because of the potential for a default to trigger another financial crisis. Undoubtedly this risk has affected business confidence and investment in the euro area.\nBut Greece certainly is not fully responsible for the deterioration in the euro area's potential economic output since the global financial crisis.\nThe euro area is not functioning properly, and responsibility for the problem is shared by the high-performing economies as well as the heavily indebted ones.\nLike many other economists, Ben Bernanke has been critical of Germany for its failure to reign in its current-account surplus, which is expected to reach almost 8.5 per cent of its gross domestic product this year.\nGermany, says the former Federal Reserve Board chairman, has effectively chosen to rely on foreign rather than domestic demand to ensure full employment at home.\n\"Within a fixed exchange rate system like the euro currency area, such persistent imbalances are unhealthy, reducing demand and growth in trading partners and generating potentially destabilising financial flows,\" he argues.\n\"Importantly, Germany's large trade surplus puts all the burden of adjustment on countries with trade deficits, who must undergo painful deflation of wages and other costs to become more competitive.\"\n However, the Germans are not the only sinners. There also has been insufficient effort to reform in the euro area's less competitive economies.\nIn a paper published by the US Journal of Economic Perspectives , Christian Thimann of the French AXA insurance group and the Paris School of Economics argues that the euro area's indebted economies have been unwilling to properly reform their product and labour markets.\nIn the euro area's first decade, he says, France and the crisis economies increased their productivity at only about half the rate of Germany and several of the smaller northern states. However, wages in France and the peripheral states grew at almost double the rate of the northern economies.\n\"This cost-productivity disadvantage of 20-to-25 per cent has been corrected only partially, and a substantial competitiveness problem remains.\"\nThere is a lack of adjustment on both sides of the euro area's economic divide.\nIn Germany there remains a deep reluctance to use fiscal policy to expand demand and dull Germany's competitive edge to help its reform-shy partners, particularly when its own ageing population will add to the fiscal burden.\nThe International Monetary Fund has proposed an expansion of public investment in infrastructure as a way to temporarily boost demand and permanently increase productivity.\nGermany's service sector, including its telecommunications, railways and professions, also is in need of reform.\nThis argument about Germany's current-account surplus has been going on for years, but so, now, has the weak global recovery, and the realisation that Europe is an impediment to that recovery could see much stronger pressure for change from the US Congress.\nBut, as Thimann explains, the euro area's problem is not just the usual one of vested interests resisting reform.\nCountries joining the euro, he says, were promised that their membership would not affect their social models.\n\"The main focus of European economic integration has been the single currency and a mixture of rules about the 'four freedoms' of movement across European borders: of people, goods, services, and capital.\n\"The European project is explicitly based on respect for national diversity, and in particular the notion that each country retains authority over its own labour and social policies.\"\nEuropean intrusion into individual country microeconomic policy debates therefore is likely to be seen as a challenge to national identities.\nThe economic crisis and the consequent elevation of microeconomic reform to discussion between heads of government, Thimann contends, has been counterproductive.\n\"Foreign politicians, even in the European context, do not have legitimacy to deliberate on reforms that deeply interfere with the economic and social fabric of another country.\n\"Whenever they do so, they expose themselves and the European project to political backlash.\"\nThis is similar to the problem encountered in international trade reform negotiations. Historically, internationally negotiated rules to reform trade have been peppered with escape clauses and have been undermined by backsliding.\nThe underlying problem has been a lack of domestic popular commitment and an unwillingness to accept reforms imposed from outside.\nThe answer to that problem in Australia has been a very long process of building domestic political support for change.\nIt took decades in Australia to reach the point where the public was ready to embrace economic reform.\nIt may be a similarly slow process in Europe, in which case the euro area's fixed-exchange-rate regime will be a continuing source of trouble, and the world will look to Germany to do more of the heavy lifting.", "external_links": ["http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/thimann-christian/publications/"], "published": "2015-08-30T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:29:28.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
