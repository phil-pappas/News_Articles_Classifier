They would also benefit India’s overall sovereign credit profile because they would lead to higher incomes, stable and lower inflation, and a lower fiscal burden related to food subsidies,” it said.\nThe report compares India with several other countries in which agriculture has a major share of GDP and concludes that Indian economy’s vulnerability to drought stems from a combination of factors like a relatively high share of agriculture in overall employment and weak rural infrastructure and irrigation.\nBesides, “inefficient food distribution, a large proportion of Indian household spending on food and share of food subsidy costs in the government’s fiscal deficit makes India more vulnerable to drought”, Moody’s noted.\n“Because of the above characteristics, drought can simultaneously lower GDP growth, raise inflation and add to fiscal pressure, leaving India’s sovereign credit profile more susceptible to the effect of drought compared with those of other Baa-rated sovereigns,” it said.\nIndia’s economic exposure to annual fluctuations in rainfall constrains the ability of the monetary policy to respond to ongoing macro-economic developments. This is particularly so in years such as the current one when a weak monsoon forecast coincides with an uncertain cyclical recovery, Moody’s added.\nThe report said India’s vulnerability to drought could decline over the longer term as average incomes rise.\n“But in the near to medium term, policies to improve infrastructure, food distribution, and non-agricultural employment opportunities hold the key to reducing the annual economic uncertainty that is linked to the performance of monsoon,” it stated.\n 11, 2015 11:32 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:38:15.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
