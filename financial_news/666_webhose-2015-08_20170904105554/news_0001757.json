An analysis of 70 companies with a market capitalisation of at least $100 million showed net income fell by 5 percent in April-June, the second consecutive quarterly decline, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nHCC, for example, reported last week that its April-June net profits slumped by about 70 percent to 80.2 million rupees.\nThe builder is looking to sell additional shares and has sold stakes in an commercial complex in Mumbai and in a highway, with proceeds going to service debt or interest costs.\n“High interest rates at this point of time are basically killing the growth of the company,” said Sood.\n“When inflation has gone down so much, there’s no reason why interest rates shouldn’t be coming down.”\nSome economists now worry the RBI is excessively focused on prices, having this year shed its previous policy of managing multiple objectives towards one that targets consumer inflation while “keeping in mind the objective of growth”.\nSoumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser of State Bank of India, argues that weak commodity prices are keeping inflation down, giving the RBI scope to do more to help companies.\n“The RBI should also try to boost growth,” he said.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 9:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:45:45.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
