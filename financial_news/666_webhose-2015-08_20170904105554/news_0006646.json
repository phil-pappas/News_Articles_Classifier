Josh Robenstone Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose The big bank lobby is refusing to fund a \"last resort\" compensation fund for victims of dodgy financial planners that go bust, arguing smaller companies should pay for it.\nSix large players own about 80 per cent of Australia's financial advice industry: AMP Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Group, National Australia Bank, ANZ Banking Group, and Macquarie Group. All have been rocked by poor advice scandals over the past couple of years.\nThe Australian Bankers Association (ABA) argues that these large institutions are well resourced enough to clean up their own messes so should not be burdened with a new government levy.\n\"The focus needs to be on what can be done to make sure those who have done the wrong thing are held accountable rather than making those who have done the right thing, or are at least able to pay to compensate their own customers when things go wrong, pick up the tab for the mistakes of others,\" said ABA chief executive Steve Munchenberg.\n\"If we were to agree as an industry that we were going to pay compensation to people who aren't our customers that would set an uncomfortable precedent.\"\nMore insurance the answer Instead, the ABA wants more pressure put on its members' smaller rivals to prove they are well credentialled, hold adequate capital buffers, and have enough insurance.\nThe Financial Planning Association of Australia is also on record as an opponent of introducing a new industry levy to create a back-up fund for those left destitute by negligent advice.\n \"It would at best provide a band-aid solution without fixing the real problem of small operators falling over and leaving debts unpaid, and at worst it would exacerbate the problem by creating regulatory moral hazard,\" said FPA head of policy Dante De Gori.\nInstead, the FPA has offered to help oversee better self-regulation of its members and is in the early stages of working on a plan to help coordinate stronger and more affordable insurance coverage for non bank owned planning businesses.\nWhile the Australian Securities and Investments Commission requires all planners have professional indemnity insurance, it does not have the resources to police that coverage is adequate, Mr De Gori said.\nInsurance Council of Australia spokesperson Campbell Fuller said: \"There may be issues with ASIC's scrutiny of professional indemnity insurance across the financial planning industry â€¦ this might benefit from ongoing assessment.\"\nSenior executives of the six largest wealth managers have all been pressed by the Senate committee into scrutiny of financial advice on whether they would back a so-called \"scheme of last resort\" compensation fund.\nLabor Senator Sam Dastyari, who chairs the committee, has acknowledged that while the big six wealth managers would provide most of the funding for such a scheme it is very unlikely any of their clients would ever need to draw on it.\n\"Let's face it if Westpac goes bust we've got bigger problems,\" Mr Dastyari said during a hearing last week.\nANZ breaks ranks Before a Senate hearing last week both Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer and AMP Ltd chief executive Craig Meller spoke in support of the ABA's position but when pressed each said their organisations would give their \"in principle\" support for a scheme of last resort .\nSpokespeople from both Westpac and AMP have since told Fairfax Media that their companies fully support the ABA's stance that proposals to establish an industry funded back-up compensation fund should be put on ice indefinitely.\nNeither Mr Hartzer or Mr Meller have been available for further comment.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia and National Australia Bank have both provided Fairfax Media with written responses to questions ruling out their support for an industry funded compensation scheme of last resort.\nANZ Banking Group is out on a limb as the only one of the big four banks supporting the immediate establishment of such a fund.\n\"ANZ supports action being taken sooner rather than later, the problem is not going to go away,\" ANZ deputy chief executive Graham Hodges told the Senate committee earlier this month.\nA 2012 government inquiry chaired by Richard St John advised against establishing a scheme of last resort as part of the future of financial advice reforms (FOFA), arguing it could prove counter productive. Mr St John warned that a safety net funded by big financial institutions would take the pressure off smaller advice providers to maintain high standards.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-08-16T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T01:00:08.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
