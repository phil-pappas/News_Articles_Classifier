HSBC protested after the levy was raised in March, and so in July the Chancellor promised to cut the levy’s rate over the coming years, and instead introduce an extra tax on profits made in the UK. \nThe board plans to make a decision on domicile by the end of the year, but chief executive Stuart Gulliver will be expected to give a progress report this week. \nInterim results \nHSBC Holdings (HKSE: 0005.HK - news ) , Keller, Fidessa, Trinity Mirror (LSE: TNI.L - news ) \nAGMs \nAkers Biosciences (NasdaqCM: AKER - news ) , Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) \nEconomics \nRetail sales (Germany), PMI manufacturing (EU, UK, Germany), construction spending (US) \nTUESDAY AUGUST 4 \nJust Eat (Other OTC: JSTLF - news ) will publish its half-year results after a period dominated by its acquisition of Menulog and the price it paid for its Australian rival. Despite months of debate, the market is expecting positive figures with robust order volume growth.

As negative rhetoric around the industry builds, Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) has recently downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”, pointing to concerns such as the introduction of a living wage and single staffing.
