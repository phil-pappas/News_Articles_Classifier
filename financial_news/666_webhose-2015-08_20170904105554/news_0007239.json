By 1545, the blue chip index was down 1.35% at 6,438.07 points, with only a dozen companies' shares in positive territory. \nLeading the fallers were shares in Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) , which have halved since May to a new all-time lows as investors took fright at first-half results. As well as posting a 29% drop in core first-half earnings on the back of declining commodity prices, the commodities mining and trading giant cut its capex target for the full year and said earnings at its trading division would be lower than previously guided. \nWith oil and metals prices remaining subdued, natural resources peers Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) were also down, while engineer Weir was hit too. \nInvestors saluted Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) after the insurer's interim pre-tax profits sailed 1% higher as it roped in a growing number of customers. Pre-tax profit of £186.1m beat consensus expectations for a drop in profit to around £163m. \nAnother high flier was Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) , as the drug group reiterated full-year guidance in spite of the strong currency headwinds dragging its interim pre-tax profit 22.3% to $170m. Full-year revenue is expected to grow approximately 6% at constant currencies or around 2% at actual exchange rates. \nHousebuilder Persimmon also bounded higher, the day after reporting its own results.
