The 10-year US yield rose four basis points to 2.26% at 17:43 BST. \nThe Institute for Supply Management said its index on US services surged to a 10-year high in July. Figures released on Wednesday, showed the index rose to 60.3 from a 56 reading in the previous month, comfortably ahead of analysts' expectations of 56.5. \n\"Just as the doves were ready to call for a December lift-off (something the Dow Jones took to heart after the bell as it rapidly approached 3 digit gains), that ISM figure once again muddies the rate-hike waters,\" said Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex . \n\"Of course, all of this chatter is somewhat premature given that the government released non-farm figure isn't out until the end of the week; however, it shows that just when the Fed's path is looking clear (ish) another potential obstacle jumps in the road.\" Dennis Lockhart, the president of the Atlanta Fed, on Tuesday said that unless there is a significant deterioration in the economy, he would favour a September hike. \nMeanwhile, ADP said the US private sector added 185,000 jobs in July compared, alongside a downwardly revised 229,000 in June. The figures fell short of the 210,000 gain analysts had expected. \nThe report comes ahead of the all-important non-farm payrolls figures out on Friday. \nThe US trade deficit rose beyond expectations in June, on the back of an increase in automobile imports and drugs from the European Union. The deficit rose 7.8% in June to $43.8bn from a revised $40.9bn in May the Commerce Department said. Analysts had forecast a shortfall of -$42.8bn. \nThe Greek 10-year yield was down three basis points to 11.81% at 17:57 BST despite a parliamentary spokesman for the Syriza party Nikos Filis on Wednesday ruling out accepting the bridge loan proposed by the European Commission in July. Filis said country needed a full bailout programme instead. Athens had said it expected a bailout deal with lenders to conclude on 18 August, two days ahead of its deadline to pay off â‚¬3.5bn in debt to the European Central Bank. \nThe National Institute for Economic and Social Research warned that the country's economy will suffer fresh damage from austerity measures demanded by its creditors. The think-tank added that Greece will remain stuck in permanent depression unless it receives substantial debt relief. \nTen-year Gilt yields ended up 10 basis points to 1.98% a day ahead of the so-called \"Super Thursday\" when the Bank of England releases its interest rate decision, meeting minutes and Inflation Report. Analysts expected the BoE would keep rates on hold amid weak inflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T08:38:05.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
