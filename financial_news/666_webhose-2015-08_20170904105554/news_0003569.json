The banks are raising capital to meet higher capital backing standards including for housing loans from July next year, and by the time CBA announced its raising, the surprise element was gone.\nSecond, CBA dealt all of its shareholders into its raising. NAB did that too: ANZ's $2.5 billion raising was less democratic, because it included a $2 billion placement to institutions.\nAdvertisement Third, CBA priced its raising at a decent discount to its previous market price. It is giving its shareholders the right to buy one new share for every 23 shares held, at a price of $71.50 a share, a 10.5 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price of $82.12 after allowing for the fact that the new shares will not qualify for CBA's June half dividend of $2.22 a share (the annual payout is up 5 per cent to $4.20).\nNAB was also raising money to set capital aside for its exit from its troubled UK banking, and priced its $5.5 billion share issue at a very healthy 15 per cent discount to market. ANZ plumped for a skinny 5 per cent market discount on its raising. Its shares were sold off last week, but CBA has better defences when its shares come out of a trading halt on Monday.\nFourth, CBA has raised enough to make substantial headway on lifting its capital backing in a single stride. NAB's share issue boosted its tier one, or core capital ratio – the amount of capital that backs its lending, basically – to 10 per cent. ANZ's raising boosted its tier one ratio to 9.3 per cent. The CBA raising will lift its tier one ratio to 10.4 per cent, reclaiming its position at the top of the capital adequacy league table in this country. Westpac will probably make it a capital raising quadrella, and top up capital – if the banks need it – will come from retained profits and dividend reinvestment schemes.\nWhile CBA's $9.14 billion cash profit was a new high for the Australian banks, its profit increase of 5 per cent only met expectations because expectations for bank profits have been downgraded, however.\nThe group lifted cash earnings by a much more impressive 12 per cent in the year to June 2014, and analysis of the latest result, which began on page 158 of CBA's profit presentation, confirmed that the June half was tough.\nCash earnings at CBA's retail banking division in the June half were 6 per cent below the December half. Business and private banking cash earnings were 4 per cent lower on the same time comparison, institutional banking and markets earned 6 per cent less, and cash earnings at CBA's wealth management division were 13 per cent lower (and 12 per cent down compared with 2013-2014).\nCBA chief executive Ian Narev and the group's chief financial officer, David Craig, pointed out that CBA had three fewer working/lending days in the June half. They also said income growth outpaced costs growth in the June half if one-off costs including remediation payments to victims of bad wealth advice are ignored. Lending-rate rises for housing investor borrowers that the banks announced last month will also boost bank earnings.\nCraig says the revenue outlook is still solid, and Narev says there are some early green shoots for lending – signs of an improved business appetite for debt for example. CBA also didn't report a meaningful rise in loan impairments.\nCBA's net interest margin fell by 5 basis points to 2.09 per cent however. The rate rise for housing investment loans will get that back – it is capable of boosting earnings by between 2 and 3 per cent – but it's difficult to see CBA repeating last year's 12 per cent profit rise in the current financial year.\nThe group's share issue is keenly priced and should be well supported, and like the other three big banks, CBA still offers an attractive dividend income stream. The banks are still solid investments for those who want to buy and hold.\nCBA has less earnings momentum this year, however. There is not enough positive news in its profit report to get its shares quickly back up above $90, where they were in March and April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T04:39:00.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
