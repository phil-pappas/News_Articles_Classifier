More Fraudsters spurn UK confiscation orders \n“We fully recognise that decisions to close branches are ultimately commercial, and that banks must be able to adjust their networks to reflect changes in customer behaviour and maintain profitability,” they wrote. \n“However, it is important that closure decisions are made responsibly, and that efforts are made to provide adequate alternative banking arrangements reflecting local circumstances — including small business needs — before a branch closes.” \nThe letter comes after an agreement between the coalition government and big banks that the UK’s 12,000 Post Office branches would provide basic services . \nThe deal, agreed in March, aims to provide customers with facilities to pay in cheques and withdraw cash. \nBut in their letter, Ms Baldwin, economic secretary to the Treasury, and Ms Soubry, small business minister, said they “are concerned at the pace at which advances are being made”. \nThe agreement also stipulated that before a branch closure, banks must consult local communities, provide a three-month notice period, communicate the decision to customers and clearly outline alternatives. \nOf the 477 branches that shut last year, 24 were the “last bank in the community”, according to figures from the Campaign for Community Banking Services. \nBanks, under pressure to reduce costs and improve shareholder returns, are closing branches and are increasingly focused on mobile banking to address changing consumer demands. \nThis year, Royal Bank of Scotland said it planned to close at least 99 branches in 2015, partly due to a shift to digital services. Lloyds Banking Group said last year it is aiming to cut 200 branches, leaving it with a 2,000-strong network. \nCaci, a consultancy, forecasts customers will use mobile devices to check their current accounts 895m times this year — against 705m branch interactions. \nBut about 63,000 people across the UK still have no acceptable digital access, Caci said. \nThe BBA said: “We’re confident that the branch will remain an integral part of banking in the 21st century, even if networks do become smaller as millions of us choose to bank in new ways.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T23:37:19.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
