Debt climbed 3.8 percent from a year ago to 2.67 billion reais, which is still considered manageable by analysts at 2.4 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA of 225.1 million reais in the first quarter was down almost 1 percent from a year ago.\nThe company said it has set aside financial provisions against a debt of 295.5 million reais it holds with Copersucar, Brazil's biggest sugar trader. Sao Martinho is in the process of unwinding its commercial relationship with Copersucar.\nCost of products sold fell 11 percent from a year ago.\nOn June 30, Sao Martinho had sold 740,000 tonnes of equivalent sugar in nondeliverable forward contracts through March 2016 at an average price of 16.59 U.S. cents/lb as hedge against its expected production this crop.\nDespite a wet start to the harvest season on April 1, which also corresponds with the start of the group's financial year, Sao Martinho crushed 7.4 million tonnes of cane in the first quarter, or 38 percent of its expected crush for the year.\nThe crushing season normally ends around Christmas, which would give Sao Martinho ample time to harvest the crop before the summer rains intensify, but meteorologist expect a strong El Nino to increase the odds of the cane belt turning wetter than normal in the coming months.\n(Reporting by Reese Ewing ; Editing by Ed Davies and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T05:03:47.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
