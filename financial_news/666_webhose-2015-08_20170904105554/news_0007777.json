I argued that there are ways that the investment industry could, and should, make it easier and more appealing to save.\nOf course it is unlikely that it will ever be as easy or attractive to invest as it is to get into debt, but efforts should be made to close that gap. And it’s not just up to the industry to do that. Government and regulators have a big role to play too.\nTo be fair, at the moment, this probably isn’t very high up on the industry’s list of concerns. The scale of regulatory change that they are currently dealing with makes it difficult for them to think of much else.\nThere is however still a general agreement in the industry that they could be making things easier for investors. To get the ball rolling, here are a few simple, ‘easy wins’ that might be considered.\nMinimum investment amounts\nA concern that is often raised by investors is that the minimum investment amounts required by most unit trust companies are a disincentive to younger- or lower-income investors. There aren’t enough ‘entry level’ products that allow small monthly debit orders of R50 or R100.\nThese are the products that can introduce the concept to new investors so that hopefully in time they will appreciate the benefits of investing. In my own experience, my parents invested me into a unit trust that allowed investments from R50 when I was still at primary school, and being able to make additions and see how they grew over time was probably the single biggest influencing factor in my subsequent interest in investment products.\nSome asset managers will argue that people who only want to put away R50 or R100 a month are not their target market, and administering those kinds of investments is not cost-effective. However, they might want to consider the marketing pull that these kinds of products could offer, the potential size of the market they could reach, and that many investors who start off with R50 a month end up investing a lot more than that.\nOffer solutions, not products\nPerhaps the key thing that the investment industry has to deal with is that probably the majority of consumers don’t really know, or care, how their products actually work. They know that, over time, the point is to grow their money, but the finer details of the traits of different asset classes and how they should be used is of little interest to them.\nTo some extent, regulation which is meant to help consumers, does complicate things. Asset managers have to present their products in a certain way to provide clarity on things like which category of fund it is and what its asset allocation is.\nThis is very good for more sophisticated investors, but not of much use or interest to many others. For most people, they have a goal that they want to save towards, and they just want a solution to get there.\nThe challenge for the industry is therefore to present what they do in a more user-friendly way – to understand the question from the investor’s point of view. The Fundisa Fund products do exactly this. They are a solution to the problem of saving for educating one’s children and they have been reasonably successful.\nThe industry, in conjunction with government, is considering other solution-type products that have a clear end objective. They are a huge step towards making investing more understandable and attractive.\nGuarantees\nCurrently, the investment industry is not allowed to offer any products that promise guaranteed returns. The argument for this is that future returns cannot be known, and so it is misleading to make any promises about them.\nOn one level, this does make sense. Nobody can know what markets will deliver, and there is no way to ensure a fixed total return in anything other than a bank deposit. Offering guarantees has also been a tactic of many investment scams and so it has become seen as synonymous with dishonesty.\nIn reality, however, any decent asset manager should be able to guarantee an absolute return of CPI +3% over any five-year time period. If they can’t, they deserve to have to pay out the difference, and if they can do better, then why not allow them to claim extra fees?\nThat kind of guarantee would be a win-win for both consumers and asset managers and be a very powerful way to make a product more attractive. Government and regulators should think seriously about whether there isn’t actually scope for this to give investors a greater sense of certainty from the start.\nTax\nGovernment must be commended for introducing tax-free savings accounts. They are one of the best innovations in this industry in many years.\nHowever, there is also scope to make the tax treatment of all unit trusts much easier.\nHaving to fill in all the information about interest, dividends and capital gains onto a tax return is a hassle for investors. It’s unlikely to be a reason for anyone to choose not to make an investment, but it’s probably an unnecessary and time consuming exercise.\nIf the South African Revenue Service is able to collect payroll data directly from employers, why can it not collect personal tax information directly from asset managers to populate income tax returns? There are far fewer unit trust managers in South Africa than employers, and so putting the technical infrastructure in place to do this must be possible.\nFICA\nIn the same vein, the administrative burden placed on people to invest is quite heavy. This is primarily due to regulation and legislation designed to protect consumers, but there are also ways to make this easier.\nThe need to re-submit FICA documentation every time you want to make an investment is the most obvious issue. The good news is that there are moves afoot to create a central database so that once anyone is FICA’d by any financial services provider, that same information is available to all product providers and the consumer therefore won’t need to go through the process again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T07:43:59.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
