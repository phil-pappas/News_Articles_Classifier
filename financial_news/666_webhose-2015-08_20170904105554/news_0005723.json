Though bank lending to small businesses has come back since the depths of the financial crisis, the rise of alternative lenders and online lending has changed the playing field. Small business owners – including those with less-than-stellar credit – have an array of financing options that didn’t exist a decade ago. But many of these loans and advances are complex, and in some cases the cost of financing is exorbitant. MultiFunding joined a group of lenders, marketplaces, brokers and small-business advocates this week to launch a “small business borrowers’ bill of rights” against abusive practices and non-transparent pricing. I sat down with Kassar recently in New York City for a wide-ranging discussion of the new lending environment over Dr. Brown’s cream sodas. What follows is an edited and condensed version of that conversation.\nFeldman: How has the space changed in the past five year?\nKassar: We’ve witnessed the continuous evolution of the alternative lending space, and the pros and cons that is creating for borrowers. People think alternative lending is a new phenomenon, but I like to joke that it’s as old as prostitution. The thing that’s new is the advent of cash-advance lenders for businesses and daily-debit lenders for businesses that offer speed and convenience to borrowers. In many cases, they lend for terms of three or six months at exorbitantly high APR rates that borrowers don’t have the cash to support, and it forces them into multiple rounds of loan renewals that become very expensive and can lead to the downfall of their businesses.\nFeldman: What type of rates are we talking about?\nKassar: I’ve seen interest rates, if you calculate the effective APR, as high as 200%?\nFeldman: 200%?\nKassar: Oh yeah.\nFeldman: How is that legal?\nPage 1 / 4 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/small-business-advocates-lenders--online-credit-marketplaces-unveil-small-business-borrowers-bill-of-rights-300124536.html"], "published": "2015-08-07T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:26:27.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
