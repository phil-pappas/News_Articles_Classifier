Calling it the “Vision G” this concept coupe is an introduction into Hyundai's future premium luxury line. Hyundai is looking to make an impression on markets usually reserved for Bentley, Maybach and Rolls Royce. This premium coupe will have it all; luxury, performance and style with the value and responsibility that is the foundation of Hyundai’s branding. \n\"The concept,\" according to Hyundai's president and chief design officer Peter Schreyer , \"was designed with coordinated input from Hyundai design studios around the world, but was led by our team here in the U.S.” Schreyer, continues with, “The design is our interpretation of the idea that Hyundai breathes into all of its vehicles – a DNA that balances design and performance with the idea that you don’t need to be over the top in terms of glitz and stereotypical luxury cues.” \nOver the course of the process was a theme. Hyundai wanted \"chivalry\" to play a key role in the design. What they meant by that was something that didn't need to shout to be noticed and respected. While dramatic looking, \"Vision G\" is still intentionally understated. However, the doors open themselves like an invisible valet, so it's luxury that's not only respectful, but pretty slick too. \nUnder the hood of the is an award-winning 5.0-liter Tau V8 engine producing 420 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 383 lb. ft. of torque at 5,000 rpm. The exterior styling gives the \"Vision G\" a certain slingshot-like appearance with the intention of maintain a design that speaks more to the owner rather than the people watching it's luxurious streak on the highway. Christopher Chapman wants the Vision G to appear dynamic and in constant motion. Christopher Chapman is the head of Hyundai’s U.S. design center and he's also the leader of the coupe’s design team. “After all, he says, \"the only time an owner sees the exterior of the car is when it’s standing still.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T03:09:20.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
