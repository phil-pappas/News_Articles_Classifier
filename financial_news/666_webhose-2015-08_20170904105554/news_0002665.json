Would you like to find out? 43081 How safe is your building? Would you like to find out? 0 Comments, Be the first to comment Follow @mldigital Buying your precious home is not enough. One needs to be constantly alert to the need for regular maintenance, watch out for illegal alterations by other members and deterioration due to salt and moisture. Find out all about this and more on 22nd August at a seminar organised by Moneylife Foundation in Mumbai A home or apartment is the most expensive and precious investment for most Indians. However, while choosing your apartment building and after moving into it, do you ever think about safety and maintenance? Remember the five-storey Altaf Manzil from Mahim? In June 2013, the entire building collapsed killing 10 people and injuring several others. The reason? According to reports, car showroom owner on the ground floor allegedly carried out some alterations that caused the collapse. A small error in the fire safety instructions by a watchman, who shut down a lift without bringing it to the ground floor killed several people few years ago. In May this year, a young girl died in a Malad housing society, when the doors of the lift closed and it started moving upwards. The Bombay Lift Act, 1939, specifies that the public works department (PWD) must inspect elevators twice a year. However, the PWD faces severe crunch of manpower and people living in high rise are left to face mishaps. Buildings near the sea shore needs to be regularly inspected for damages caused by water and salty air or salt deterioration. Water, dust and salty air also cause huge damage to structures - are you aware what you need to do on a regular basis to maintain your home? The salt deterioration can extend through the brickwork and may even cause the wall to collapse in extreme cases. Are you one of those who is too diffident to protest when other members block up fire exits with cupboards and furniture? Or convert refuge floors that are to be used for fire safety into gyms? You may want to remember that one 90-meter snorkel acquired by the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s Fire Brigade will not even be able to negotiate our crowed streets in time to help your super luxury apartment 40 floors above the ground. All over the world, you need to speak up and take care of your protection and learn some basics of construction safety. To understand this and more, Moneylife Foundation is conducting a FREE and non-partisan seminar titled 'How Safe Is Your Building?' on 22 August 2015. Moneylife Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation and the seminar will not promote any company or its products. This is meant as a learning experience for homeowners, especially office bearers of cooperative societies who share a legal responsibility for ensuring proper maintenance. It is also a learning experience for ALMs leaders to help understand critical issues. A stellar line up of speakers with vast experience in the building and construction industry is also an opportunity for students of architecture to learn and benefit from it at a time when the media is overflowing with tragic reports about unsafe buildings and the sad plight of victims. The speakers include Umesh Joshi and Achut Watve, Designated Partners of JW Consultants LLP, which is a highly regarded name in structural consultancy that works with reputed construction companies in India and abroad. Prakash Deshmukh, Director of Associated Space Designers Pvt Ltd and the immediate past President of Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) is the other speaker. The speakers have consented to make time to look at the safety issue from the user perspective to flag warning signs and highlight issues on which there should be no compromise.
