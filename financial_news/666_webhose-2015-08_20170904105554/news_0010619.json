About half of the losses came during the firm’s fiscal third quarter, which began in June, one of the people said. The bank said it made $153.4 million trading across all fixed-income markets during the previous quarter.\nDistressed-debt investors, who buy beaten-down debt that firms such as mutual-fund managers want to sell, have had a tough year. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s distressed group lost between $50 million and $60 million in 2015, people with knowledge of that unit said Wednesday. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch index of distressed bonds has lost 23 percent since May.\nThe Jefferies distressed team is run by Drew Doscher, who was hired in October 2013. Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined to comment about the performance.\nEnergy Deals Jefferies, a unit of Leucadia National Corp., has underwritten high-yield bond and leveraged loan deals for some of the riskiest energy companies over the past two years. It helped sell $2.25 billion of bonds in July 2014 for KKR & Co.-owned Samson, before a collapse in oil prices that prompted the company to negotiate a deal with creditors to put it into bankruptcy protection by mid-September. It’s also helped underwrite debt during the past year for oil explorers Halcon Resources Corp. and Energy XXI Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nBanks that underwrite deals typically keep an inventory of the securities they sell so that they can make markets for buyers that want to purchase them in the secondary market.\nJefferies has been generating less money this year from fixed-income sales and trading, which includes the distressed desk. In the six months ended May 31, revenue from that division slid 45 percent to $279.5 million, the bank said last month in a regulatory filing.\nThe distressed-debt group’s loss for the quarter will reduce Jefferies’ tax bill, making it sting a little less. It will cut after-tax profit this quarter by about $30 million, said one of the people. Leucadia had $11.8 billion of capital as of May, with $5.5 billion of that at Jefferies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:43:09.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
