More strike action is scheduled from 8pm until midnight.\nThe Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) has given notice of work stoppages at \"all Department of Immigration and Border Protection work areas in all states\", a statement on the department website says.\n\"The department is working closely with stakeholders to minimise the impact on the travelling public and on cargo and mail operations,\" the statement says. \"We are ensuring appropriate contingencies are in place for visa and citizenship services. However, we strongly encourage passengers booked on international flights to get to the airport early.\"\nCPSU deputy union president Rupert Evans, who has spent Monday morning at Melbourne Airport, said border force (customs) officers, immigration and biosecurity staff walked off the job to strengthen their campaign for a fair enterprise bargaining agreement.\n\"That's happening in protest of the federal government's attack on their pay conditions and rights at work,\" he said. \"It's serious industrial action because members are facing a serious attack on their pay rights and conditions at work.\n\"The government praises the work that these people do, but is showing absolute disrespect to the workers by proposing to cut their allowances and pay by up to $8000 a year for what is highly skilled, dirty and often dangerous work.\"\nMelbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said delays were yet to occur, but she also asked international passengers to \"come in as early as they can, noting that check-in only opens three hours beforehand\". She said the two strikes were planned during the airport's peak periods.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:10:05.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
