Currency experts believe though the weakness in the rupee will continue, but the pace would not be similar to what was witnessed earlier this month after China had announced devaluation of its currency. \n\"For the rupee, the bias will be towards weakness and the broad range is seen between 65.75 to 66.50 per dollar this week,\" said Sandeep Gonsalves, forex consultant and dealer, Mecklai & Mecklai. \nFriday too the rupee had ended weak at 66.16 per dollar. During the week the rupee had weakened by 33 paise due to persistent dollar demand from importers. \nMeanwhile, government bond yields are seen trading in a range. \"The recent global volatility and rupee volatility seems to have become stable for now. Yields should be in a range because the underlying sentiment is reasonably okay and investors appetite is strong. The broad trading range will be 7.75 per cent to 7.85 per cent for the 10-year benchmark bond this week,\" said Suyash Choudhary, head-fixed income, IDFC Mutual Fund. \nThe yield on the 10-year benchmark bond ended at 7.78 per cent on Friday compared with previous close of 7.77 per cent. Friday's government bond auction worth Rs 14,000 crore had sailed smoothly.
