Nevertheless, while on maternity leave with her son Ethan, now two, the 30-year-old from Hertfordshire decided to give up her job to put pen to paper. \n“I had been umm-ing and ahh-ing for a while,” says Louise. “Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) before I was pregnant with Ethan, I hadn’t been enjoying my job as much as I had hoped. Being an author is everyone’s dream, but having my son gave me the space to consider it seriously. I had no expectations. I just wrote for the enjoyment of it, and kept it under my hat initially.” \nThe result was 'Holy Island', a crime novel inspired by the desolate landscape of her childhood home in Northumberland, which was published in January this year. Since then, the book has sold more than 70,000 copies, reached no.1 in the Kindle bestseller list, and made her £70,000 virtually overnight. More surprisingly, she managed it without a book deal or agent, and despite a stack of rejection letters from publishers. \nLouise is one of a rapidly growing number of authors taking the literary game into their own hands, and self-publishing ebooks (digital books) through companies such as Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) iBookstore and Smashwords. For as sales of print dwindle, self-publishing has become a ferociously rising sector. In 2013 the UK market for self-published books grew by 79 per cent with 18 million bought by UK readers, despite print sales falling 10 per cent overall. \nLast year it was reported that the Big Five publishers Penguin Random House, Macmillan, HarperCollins, Hachette and Simon & Shuster accounted for 16 per cent of ebooks on Amazon and self-published novels represented 31 per cent of sales on Kindle. Tales of those who shift seven-figures’ worth of ebooks such as Rachel Abbot , Amanda Hocking and John Locke are becoming all the more common, too. \nEven my grandmother, who turned 85 this year, is at it. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has arranged for her first book 'The Mammals that Moved Mankind', an anthropological sweep through history, to be self-published by AuthorHouse later this month. After more than five years slogging away without success through traditional channels, she’d had enough. \nMy grandmother aside, the result of authors choosing to go it alone is a new digital literary landscape where romance, erotica and science fiction reign supreme and people rather than publishing houses are deciding what sells. \nThis week also marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Kindle in the UK \nThis week also marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Kindle in the UK, the platform that has allowed hundreds of thousands of authors to independently publish and whose self-publishing arm has been growing substantially year-on-year. \nThe only trade-off? You’ve probably never heard of them. That’s because the DIY sector, no matter how many hundred of thousands of ebooks get sold, rarely receives mainstream media attention or plaudits thanks to years of being thought of as either vanity publishing or low quality. Those going into it do so largely for cash over credibility, and the priceless opportunity of an audience, rather than a Pulitzer Price or a headlining spot at Hay Festival. \nRuth Tross, senior editor at Hodder & Stoughton, says: “It is a trade-off in some respects, although some authors self-publish and manage print publications successfully. As an author you have to decide what you are writing for; for your book to be available or for critical acclaim.” \nBut times are changing and a low profile is not putting off thousands of would-be, talented authors. And Kindle’s deal is simple; anyone can self-publish via Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) - authors keep control of the rights, set the price, design the cover, edit and proofread their work and can make changes to their book, or its price, at any time. It’s free to self-publish and authors earn a 35 per cent royalty rate for books below £1.99 or 70 per cent for books priced between £1.99 and £9.99. Once you’ve uploaded your treasured manuscript, it can be available to the world within 24 hours and even translated into multiple languages. \nMarketing, however, is a problem. Louise Ross relied on her husband, James, a 31-year-old barrister, to come to the rescue as Kindle, unlike traditional publishers, offer no help in this department. “We are like Batman and Robin,’’ she explains. ‘‘I do the writing and he does the marketing; posting on forums, replying to messages on social media and chatting to other writers and readers online. I am like a dinosaur when it comes to technology.” \nOn the question of notoriety, she is relatively sanguine. “I’m quite happy to remain anonymous although it can be frustrating from a networking point of view.” \nTracy Bloom, 44, from Derby the second bestselling independent author in Kindle’s charts is another runaway success story. She’s published four books and sold more than 300,000 copies of her debut comic novel 'No One has Sex on Tuesday'. \nAfter giving up a high-powered job in marketing and development to raise a family and follow her husband to America for his job, she took up writing, became an ‘‘authorpreneur’’, moved back to the UK and has never had to ‘‘work’’ again. \nFrom the start, Tracy, a mother-of-two, admits, her attitude was strategic she watched the industry like a hawk, plotted her release strategy for months beforehand, compiled a survey and press release to coincide with the ebook’s release on Kindle, and researched the most successful price points for similar books. \n“I didn’t just want to self publish,’’ she explains. ‘‘I wanted to do it successfully. To sit and watch it soar up the charts was the most wonderful and satisfying experience I’ve ever had. \n“We sprayed Champagne around the garden when I reached number four on the charts, and then did the same again when I overtook Dan Brown and was number one.” \nFor Tracy, the instant interaction with readers has also been invaluable. “It’s lovely to see your book on a shelf, but I’d trade that every time for a big readership and fabulous reviews from my readers. Massive commercial success doesn’t always get the recognition it deserves. There is value in being able to entertain the masses.” \nIn 2013 the UK market for self-published books grew by 79 per cent with 18 million bought by UK readers \nPaul Pilkington, a 38-year-old university lecturer from Gloucestershire, has played the game from both sides, having first published through KDP, and then afterwards via Hodder & Stoughton. Years of rejection letters had prompted him to go down the independent route with a trilogy of suspense mysteries. The first, 'The One You Love', is about a heroine whose fiancé vanishes in bloody circumstances and sold more than 300,000 copies. It led to a flurry of attention and 12 agents trying to sign him within three weeks. \n“I did nothing to market it,’’ he says. ‘‘I don’t know what it was - maybe something about the synopsis or being at the right time and in the right place. It hasn’t stopped since then. I still can’t get my head around it but it has been very exciting achieving something which didn't necessarily involve any of the gatekeepers.” \nPaul won a UK publishing deal for the trilogy, and had to write all three books through the night and during annual leave as he was keen to keep his day job. “I try to write 1,000 words every day in an hour and a half. With this, you can’t afford to wait and release a book in two years’ time or you’ll have missed your readership.” \nHaving experienced both sides Paul is remaining loyal to his roots and continuing to self-publish other novels. “With traditional publishing,’’ he explains, ‘‘you have a lot of support from an editor and a whole team that has input into the book’s cover, title and almost every element. With self-publishing you have complete control. \n‘‘Really, you don’t know how much control you have until you lose some of it. When you are your own mini publisher, you only have yourself to blame if it doesn't go right - but you don't have that with a big publisher.” \n= Top selling authors on Kindle of all time: = *EL James *Lee Child *Stieg Larsson *Suzanne Collins *George RR Martin *Gillian Flynn *Diane Chamberlain *James Patterson *Peter James *Sylvia Day = Most well-read towns and cities: = *Huntingdon *Doncaster *Rochester *Truro *Chorley *Spalding *Dunfermline *Sevenoaks *Newton Abbot *Chichester", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T18:01:14.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
