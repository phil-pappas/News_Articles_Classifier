AP Share on twitter by Karen Maley How long will it take before the rout in commodity markets forces the US central bank to officially jettison its plans to raise interest rates this year?\nThat's the big question for investors after Wednesday's release of the minutes of the US Federal Reserve's July policy meeting showed its top officials are deeply divided when it comes to raising interest rates.\nAlthough Fed boss Janet Yellen has been diligently preparing investors for an increase in short-term interest rates this year, it's clear there's a lot of hand-wringing among top US officials about the lack of inflationary pressures in the United States.\nAccording to the minutes, most Fed officials expected inflation to move towards the central bank's target of 2 per cent and were confident that the \"downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past [US] dollar appreciation would prove to be temporary\".\nAFR graphic But some Fed officials questioned this position, arguing that there were \"downside risks to inflation\" from further rises in the US dollar and declines in commodity prices.\nAnd it's this position that is likely to be proved correct. The deflationary pressures roiling global markets have only strengthened since the Fed's last policy meeting, particularly after China's surprise move to devalue its currency, the yuan.\nAnalysts believe that the devaluation of the Chinese currency is confirmation that Chinese growth is much lower than the official figure suggest, and probably running around 4 per cent to 5 per cent. According to China's National Bureau of Statistics, the country's growth remained at 7 per cent in the second quarter.\nCommodities hamstrung A slowdown in China – which for a decade has accounted for more than a third of global growth – is a massive negative for commodity prices. After all, China represents roughly 50 per cent of global demand for coal and nickel and more than 40 per cent of global demand for copper and zinc.\nInvestors are also worried that the lower yuan will exacerbate the deflationary pressures in global markets, because it will allow Chinese exporters to cut their prices even further and force competitors to cut their prices in order to preserve market share.\nIn addition, a lower yuan pushes up the cost of commodity imports such as oil and copper, which are denominated in US dollars. This will further crimp China's demand for commodities, which has already fallen as a result of slower growth.\nFears of a further contraction in demand triggered a further sell-off in commodity markets this week, pushing prices for US crude oil, copper and aluminium to levels not seen since the depth of the global financial crisis.\nAnd it's only a matter of time before this latest slump in oil prices is reflected in even lower US inflation.\nThe impact of lower energy prices was highlighted in the July US consumer price index, released this week. Headline US consumer price index rose by a scant 0.2 per cent year-on-year basis, although core US CPI, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, rose by 1.8 per cent (still short of the US central bank's 2 per cent target).\nEven the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure deflator, is running well below the US central bank's target, with the core PCE up only 1.3 per cent from a year earlier.\nMeanwhile, concerns over slowing Chinese growth sent global sharemarkets reeling this week, with the US sharemarket falling to its lowest level this year.\nNot surprisingly, investors reacted to the turmoil by seeking a safe haven in US bonds. As a result, the yield on 10-year bonds has fallen to just over 2 per cent after climbing as high as 2.5 per cent in June. (Yields fall as prices rise).\nBut falling US bond yields are also a clear indication that, while the US central bank might believe that it is still on track to raise rates this year, investors are taking a contrary view.\n'Less than 25pc chance' of increase The US central bank has run an extremely loose monetary policy since the financial crisis, keeping its key policy rate pinned at close to zero since December 2008.\nThe effect of this loose monetary policy has been to push up the price of financial assets, including bonds. If investors really believed that the Fed was preparing to raise interest rates, they would be selling bonds (and pushing up bond yields), on the grounds that bond prices have been artificially supported by the US central bank's monetary stimulus and would therefore probably fall when the Fed removes some support.\nAt the same time, the US bond market is also signalling that it believes a plunging oil price will continue to weigh on US inflation.\nThe gap between the benchmark US bond rate and the 10-year inflation protected bond fell to just over 1.5 per cent this week, suggesting that investors believe the US inflation rate will be running at an extremely low annualised rate of just over 1.5 per cent on average within a decade.\nWhat's more, Fed-funds futures, which are used to place bets on the US central bank's policy changes, show that investors and traders believe there is now less than a 25 per cent chance of a rate increase at the US central bank's September meeting – a sharp drop from 45 per cent earlier in the week.\nInvestors have become increasingly convinced that the steep slide in commodity prices, including the important oil price, will force the US central bank to postpone its plans for raising interest rates until next year at the earliest.\nIt remains to be seen how long it will take for the Fed to reach the same conclusion.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-08-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:00:58.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
