The company also said it would calculate and provide key metrics including the lifetime value of a customer directly to developers, frustrating developers who had built such systems on their own.\nGame publishers and advertisers immediately pushed back, saying the change would make it more difficult to calculate the effectiveness of an ad campaign. They said the device information was helpful for retargeting ads and determine whether users who had seen an ad later installed an app. Advertisers also objected to using Facebook’s metrics after investing in their own analytics.\nInitially, Facebook said the change would go into effect in August. It pushed that back to November after the uproar from advertisers.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/08/04/facebook-reverses-plan-to-limit-data-for-advertisers"], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:26:37.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
