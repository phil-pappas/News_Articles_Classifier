View gallery . \nRebuilt inside and out with an all-new powertrain and enhanced suspension tuning, Toyota says the new Tacoma was designed to meet the needs of active drivers on a variety of tamed and untamed surfaces. To help drivers reach their destination, both on and off-road, the Tacoma TRD Off-Road grade will rely on Goodyear's Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure with Kevlar® tires in size P265/70R16. \n\"For decades, both Goodyear and Toyota have built a reputation on helping off-road enthusiasts conquer some of the world's toughest terrains,\" said Johann Finkelmeier, Goodyear's vice president of North America original equipment sales. \"Our Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure with Kevlar® has been tuned specifically for the 2016 Tacoma to provide superior performance during everyday highway driving, while allowing drivers to go off-road at a moment's notice.\" \nThe Wrangler All-Terrain Adventure with Kevlar® features a number of innovative technologies, including Goodyear's Durawall Technology, which helps resist sidewall cuts and punctures.
