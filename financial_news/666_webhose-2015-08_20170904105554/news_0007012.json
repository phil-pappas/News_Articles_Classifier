Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Philip Baker No stock has been hammered more in the past few months than Slater & Gordon, the \"no win, no pay\" personal injury law firm that was briefly one of the top 100 companies but has now unnerved an army of investors with an accounting error .\nHowever, Simon Shields and Shane Fitzgerald from Monash Investors have got a different stance on it all and since its fall from grace, have snapped up shares in Slaters, betting the market has got it wrong.\nSince hitting a record high of $7.85 in April, short sellers have gone into overdrive about the company's ambitious growth strategy and the stock has now fallen 60 per cent. It closed at $3.13 on Friday.\nSo what do they see that others don't?\n\"Well, lately people think it is very risky, as they don't understand the cash flows, and there is an element of panic in the reaction of investors,\" explains Shields.\n\"But we've done a lot of work on this stock and we think that the risk of a significant re-statement of its own earnings is very small. This is a stock that ASIC [Australian Securities and Investments Commission] has looked at in terms of the approach its taken to its profit recognition twice over the last 10 years or so without finding significant issues\" he says.\nLocal methods Shields also points out that the company is using a method that is consistent in Australia, of recognising revenue and expenses.\n Shine, for example, another listed law firm company, uses the same method.\nShields says that the recent disclosure by Quindells in the UK, which sold its professional services division to Slaters, that it was the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office , did not have any implications for Slater & Gordon.\n\"It will be interesting to see what happens, because ASIC may conclude their review by the result (slated for this month). So we'll see what they have to say,\" says Shields, who also points out the stock trades on a forward multiple of six times earnings.\nThis isn't the first time Monash Investors has taken a stake in the company and the two principals are no doubt hoping they can replicate the 70 per cent gain they made first time round.\nThe stake in Slater's is just the sort of investment the two managers are on the look out for.\nThe boutique fund manager has around $30 million under management and has been up and running for just over three years. In that time the fund has delivered a 16.2 per cent per annum return for investors.\nWith almost 45 years of experience between them, the two aim to use opportunities they see in the sharemarket to reliably grow wealth.\nShorting stocks Rather than roll with the market's ups and downs, Monash try to deliver positive returns every year and do so using a range of investment styles, including shorting stocks.\nWoolworths and Myer are two stocks the fund has been short but in essence they are looking for companies that have in some way been misunderstood or underestimated by the market.\nIt could be the largest company going around, or it could be the very smallest.\nSo what are some of the stocks that make the Monash grade?\nLend Lease, Harvey Norman and Challenger Financial have all done well for the fund but so too some of the smaller stocks such as Yowie Group, the Perth-based confectionary company that is up 117 per cent so far this calender year, and Catapult the sports technology firm that is up 140 per cent.\nAnother on the radar is 1-PAGE, the ASX-listed, Silicon Valley-based company that has a global reach and has disrupted the recruitment process.\nAs Fitzgerald explains, the total amount of money spent globally on human resources is about $500 billion a year and if they can just get a slither of that they can make a lot of money.\nIf 1-PAGE can offer companies a cheaper and more efficient way of putting up the best candidates then all of a sudden it changes the way companies hire staff.\n\"At the moment they're talking to thirteen Fortune 50 companies about coming on and using the service. So when you look at that and say why is that exciting, well you can kind of see why this is an incredibly disruptive service going into the HR departments of these organisations,\" he said.\nBackground Shields has been buying and selling shares since he was in high school and has had stints running funds at Colonial First State and UBS Global Asset Management. Fitzgerald spent 14 years at JPMorgan as an analyst and broker but also spent 4 years at UBS with Shields, who has always wanted to run his own business.\n\"My father's family always had a pretty entrepreneurial background and when I grew up he always had magazines like Fortune and Forbes and Entrepreneur lying around the house,\" Shields says.\n\"He left school in year 10 to work in his father's firm, and unfortunately on his father's death, his firm subsequently collapsed and so he had to come up to Sydney and basically bring himself up by his bootstraps with a young family and no education. So he went, he put himself through law school by driving taxis and starting up an agency that was delivering summonses and he went on to have a career in the NSW public service,\" explains Shields.\nBut it was that drive his father had that helped him understand business and the fact that he was always very keen on trying to find new things that prompted Shields to set up his own shop.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-16T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:13:27.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
