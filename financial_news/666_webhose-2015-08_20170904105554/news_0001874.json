But I don't think it deserves to on the basis of fundamentals,\" she said.\n\"If you look at the supply side, the market looks a bit tighter, but prices don't reflect that.\"\nOne of several recent supply issues is a strike at a Codelco mine in Chile, which has prompted the world's top copper producer to stop offering spot refined copper to China for two weeks, sources said.\nSome traders said supply remained adequate despite the strike, highlighted by a rise in LME copper stocks MCUSTX-TOTAL by 14 percent since June 26.\nDespite Wednesday's stronger data on Chinese services, slowing factory growth is still weighing on metals markets.\n\"Sentiment here among Chinese investors is quite bearish at the moment, it's hard to see any sustainable rebound from here,\" said analyst Judy Zhu of Standard Chartered in Shanghai.\nIn other metals, resilience in LME nickel prices may not prove sustained as consumers stay away, said broker Triland in a report.\n\"There is nothing to suggest any greater upward correction is around the corner just yet ... Physical trade and the scrap sector are noticeable for their absence from the market at present.\"\nNickel bucked the weaker trend, rising 0.7 percent on bargain hunting to $10,900 a tonne.\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin (Additional reporting by Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Editing by Pravin Char)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:38:50.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
