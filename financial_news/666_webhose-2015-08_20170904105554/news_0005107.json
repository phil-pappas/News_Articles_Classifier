Waiting too long would risk undermining the recovery, especially if interest rates then need to be increased faster than the gradual path which we expect.\"\nForbes, a U.S. academic and member of the BoE's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee, said China's yuan devaluation and falling energy and commodity prices meant there was a \"bit more time\" before inflationary pressures build in Britain, but she would be looking closely for signs of stronger domestic price pressures.
