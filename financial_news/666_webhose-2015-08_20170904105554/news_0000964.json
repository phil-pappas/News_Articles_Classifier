We now expect the Reserve Bank of India to go for a 25 basis points (bps) repo rate cut in September policy.”\nDevendra Kumar Pant, chief economist, India Ratings and Research, said, “Retail inflation at 3.78 per cent in July 2015 was much below the expectation and was mainly due to sharp fall in food inflation. It is contradictory to daily price data released by the government. July vegetable prices has declined by nearly 8 per cent. This will have a favourable impact on bond pricing and increase in probability of monetary easing.”\nThe BSE Bankex plunged over 5 per cent in the past four trading sessions till August 12.\n 13, 2015 10:20 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T08:34:01.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
