With the enhancements in this release, staffing and recruiting agencies will enable their recruiters, sales representatives, and back-office teams to further streamline their business processes. This release of AdaptSuite focuses on:\n Improved tracking of contingent employee benefits New dashboards and reporting that facilitates management decision-making Online importing of contacts into the AdaptSuite CRM to reduce data entry efforts Introduces a new Desktop Agent that offers tight integration between AdaptSuite and other third-party applications\nEnhanced Contract/Contingent Employee Benefits Eligibility Tracking and Management\nGovernment mandates have increased the importance of tracking sick time benefits across the US. As a result, staffing agencies need to define how they will structure their contingent employee sick time benefits and be able to simply track who is eligible to receive pay for sick time, how much, and when. In certain jurisdictions, making available balances visible to employees is required.\nThe new eligibility module within AdaptSuite staffing software offers the flexibility to meet the various requirements specific to sick time simply and efficiently. In addition, the eligibility module simplifies the tracking and management of other benefits awards such as vacation, holiday pay, and/or other benefit programs that the agency may have. AdaptSuite delivers these benefits in a unified front and back office staffing software system that reduces the time and effort typically associated with these tasks.\nNew Dashboard Framework and Dashboards Empower Agency Management Insights\nGrowing staffing and recruiting agencies are fast-moving and highly responsive to the needs of their customers as they seek out the best candidates, contractors, and contingent employees for the job orders they receive. It’s important that agency management as well as front-line recruiters and sales representatives have real-time insight into all of the various activities among internal sales and recruiting staff, so that they can understand how those activities translate into effective sales, talent acquisition, and job order fulfillment. This enables clear and effective decision-making that improves business results.\nThe new AdaptSuite staffing software dashboard framework offers innovative technology to view and interact with data to provide real-time visibility into the key metrics that matter most to recruiters and sales representatives. Along with the new framework, a set of new dashboards for Activities, Candidate information, and Connections are introduced in this release. Among the many benefits of the data supplied in these instantly accessible, real-time dashboards are:\n The ability to track activities to ensure open positions are filled or matched with the right candidate Understanding which key activities are delivering the highest quality and volume of placements Using key performance metrics as one of the indicators of employee future performance Allows management to adjust recruiting strategy or process to ensure maximum returns\nAdaptSuite Reduces Data Entry Effort with Online Contact Import\nOne of the most tedious tasks for a staffing and recruiting sales representative is entering new contact data. AdaptSuite staffing software simplifies this with the online import of individual contacts and lists of contacts. This provides an effortless way to get new contacts into the AdaptSuite CRM Sales Studio system so that sales representatives can spend their time making the connections that lead to sales and not entering data.\nImproved Third-Party Application Integration\nThird-party applications, such as Microsoft Outlook, are often vital to staffing and recruiting business success. The new AdaptSuite Desktop agent provides unparalleled interaction between AdaptSuite staffing software and other applications for tightly integrated email, calendar and task entries as well as one step document editing.\nDoug Weinbach, Bond International Software Inc. VP of Sales stated that: “Bond’s commitment to our customers is to offer them innovative tools to help them succeed. In this release Bond focused on four areas of enhancement to advance core staffing and recruiting processes. In addition, there is much more in this release that will further improve AdaptSuite’s overall usability and back-office functionality. I’m especially proud of how the Bond development team is leveraging the ideas and input from our customers to deliver these enhancements. It demonstrates again that Bond is not only listening to the needs of our customers, but is acting upon what we learn.”\nFor more information on Bond AdaptSuite recruiting and staffing software or to schedule a demonstration, please visit http://www.bond-us.com or call 800-318-4983.\n###\nAbout Bond International Software PLC (UK, AIM: BDI)\nLondon stock-market listed Bond International Software has been a global provider of Recruitment, HR and Payroll software & services for 40 years.\nBond is one of the largest, and most established, global specialists in staffing software for recruitment agencies worldwide and is a rapidly growing provider of web-based e-recruitment and talent acquisition software to the corporate market.
