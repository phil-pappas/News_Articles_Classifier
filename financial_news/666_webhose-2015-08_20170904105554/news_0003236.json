When he brought the set home, it was 27 inches. \nThe bench found merit in the company’s argument that there was no attempt to cheat Chaurdia but it was rather a misunderstanding. \nChallenging the Madhya Pradesh High Court order that prima facie held the company had cheated Chaurdia, the company said as a practice all leading television companies in the country mentioned the actual dimensions of the picture tube and the consumers took it as the screen size. \n“TV manufacturers including the petitioner shall in future mention specifically the actual dimension of picture viewing tube to avoid confusion among the customers,” the court, however, ordered. \nChaurdia had earlier filed a complaint in the trial court, with bailable warrants issued against the two executives in 2005. Samsung moved the High Court for quashing the charges but the same was dismissed in 2008, with the court allowing the trial to go on.
