Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Warning. If you wish to believe that our capital markets are built on solid logical foundations rather than mind-altering Escher-like feedback loops that distort you perception, then read no further.\nIf you're ready to have your brain twisted by Origin's $900 million magically morphing corporate hybrid , welcome to wonderland.\nA hybrid security is by definition part-debt, party-equity, but Origin's ORGHA notes have the ability to appear as two distinct funding forms at once.\nAt first glance, $900 million looks like equity that shores up the balance sheet. But when you look a little closer, its appears more like debt, that Origin had better pay back when its due or else.\nOrigin Energy's ASX listed hybrid has taken a hit as punters question whether they'll get paid out in December 2016 as scheduled AFR/Thomson Reuters It's flexible but constraining at the same time. But the question for investors is whether this money could or should get paid in December 2016, just like debt, or whether Origin can leave it out there until it's in better shape, like a share.\nConfused? You should be.\nOrigin treasurer Peter Rice actually has an obligation to leave hybrid investors in a quantum state of uncertainty as to whether it will repay $900 million of hybrids when they fall due in December 2016. You see, if he hints that Origin will redeem the notes, that creates a debt like-obligation and the rating agencies might reclassify the hybrid as debt rather than flexible equity. So he can't tell you how important it is to the company that the notes get paid back on time.\nHe said as much (or as little) on a recent European debt investor call. What makes the fate of Origin's hybrid even more confusing is that even though the rating agencies have granted these securities equity-like status, the $900 million will be reclassified as debt if Origin doesn't repay the hybrids on the first call date. This would have an obviously adverse impact on Origin's balance sheet and credit rating that these equity instruments were meant to enhance.\n In other words, if Origin doesn't pay back the hybrids there's a good chance they'll get downgraded - by the same agency that wants them to pretend this capital is flexible.\nA downgrade brings with it a whole range of complications which are understated or overstated depending on whether it's a shareholder or a lender that's being briefed.\nTo explain that simply: Origin raised hybrid capital to help its credit rating, but if it doesn't pay them back it will hurt it badly. Sounds like debt doesn't it?\nOrigin's hybrids have come under pressure of late as falling energy prices put its balance sheet under more pressure than expected. The price has fallen from a peak of $105 to trade as low as $97; a 9 per cent yield to maturity, suggesting rising doubts Origin will repay in full and on schedule.\nHybrids have had their critics for being complex but all the sermons to date have been preached to buyers. Actually in some cases, such as this, it's a case of 'seller-beware.'\nThe methods set out by Standard & Poor's for rating hybrids were gamed by investment bankers and capital hungry companies and have been exposed as flawed and warped interpretation of the capital structure. S&P has been forced to change the rules to the ire of some companies.\nThe net result is that firms like Origin and Santos have to scramble to repay \"equity\" capital when it morphs into expensive debt at their first call date â€“ the precise moment of potential strain these hybrids are meant to shore up the balance sheet.\nAnd most bizarrely Origin has to pretend that it's not debt, even if it creates debt-like refinancing pressures.\nOrigin may one day be in a quandary but this dynamic works in favour of investors in the hybrids. The transformation of this equity into debt at repayment date, and subsequent threat to its rating, creates a huge incentive for Origin to repay.\nWhile Rice's comments to debt investors are open to interpretation, for reasons explained above, he outlined a number of initiatives the company could, if required, consider to maintain the credit rating (which some analysts assumed would require paying back the $900 million of hybrids). One was suspending the $500 million of dividends paid annually to ordinary shareholders. If the situation calls for a choice, hybrid holders do pull rank on shareholders, reflecting the appropriate hierarchy of the capital structure.\nIf a failure to repay the hybrids does result in a loss of Origin's investment grade credit rating, Rice has to create a wave function of uncertainty around whether Origin will protect it. Here the message is, as you would expect, mixed. The board is committed to an investment grade, but its loss would not materially impact the company requiring it to post more collateral as an energy retailer and draw down more bank debt. They're committed to not losing the rating but its not biggie if they don't. Again, draw your own conclusions\nMuch of the commentary about hybrids is to highlight the hidden and complex risks to retail investors that have bought these deals. But it's the issuers of these instruments, who took advantage of obviously faulty rating agency rules, that are finding they were too smart for their own good.", "external_links": ["http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20150820/pdf/430n76plcwcgm5.pdf", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-08-31T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:03:23.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
