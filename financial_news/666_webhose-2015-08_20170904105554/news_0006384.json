Insurers are complaining, and so are state Medicaid programs and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which are legally entitled to lower prices. \nInsurers and employers often require patients with private coverage to pay a bigger share of the cost of new drugs. At the same time, prices for some of the old generic stand-by medications have soared. \nAs a result, the drug industry seems to be taking a beating when it comes to public opinion. Only about 4 in 10 in the poll viewed pharmaceutical companies favorably, about the same share that holds a positive opinion of oil companies. Even airlines, the target of consumer complaints about bag fees and on-time performance, were viewed favorably by 55 percent. \nOverall, 73 percent said drug companies make too much profit. \n\"It's clear that drug companies have overreached and their pricing is not sustainable,\" said Topher Spiro, the top health policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a think tank often aligned with the White House. \nBut it won't be easy to translate public sentiment into government policies that don't spawn new problems. \n\"To arbitrarily limit the price of drugs without regard to benefit or value would not be wise,\" said Spiro. More transparency is needed about how pharmaceutical companies price their products, and more research is needed to establish which drugs work best, he added. \nAlthough the public says it wants action, the poll also found an undercurrent of skepticism about government. \nAs a general proposition, Americans prefer marketplace competition over government regulation to keep drug prices in check, by 51 percent to 40 percent. There was a clear partisan division. Seventy-six percent of Republicans prefer competition, while 57 percent of Democrat prefer regulation. Independents are about evenly divided. \nThe poll found that about half of Americans take a prescription medication, and of those, 7 in 10 said their prescriptions are easy to afford. But one-quarter have difficulty paying for their drugs, including 43 percent of those who are in poor health, and 33 percent of those with low incomes. \nAs for Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act, Americans remained divided. Forty-four percent had a favorable opinion, while 41 percent disapproved. Only 28 percent want to see a complete repeal, while a similar share want it expanded to do more. \nThe poll was conducted by telephone Aug. 6-11 among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 adults 18 and older. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for questions based on the total sample.
