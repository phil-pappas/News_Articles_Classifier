In 2014, it beat its sales record from 2007, selling almost 466,000 vehicles. CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Swedish news agency TT the company expects to sell 500,000 cars this year. \nThe number of Volvo employees has risen by 10 percent in the past year, to 28,000 worldwide. \nDespite its economic slowdown, Volvo plans to boost its presence in China and has acquired 50 percent of three joint ventures from parent company Geely: two assembly plants and one research and development centre. \nGeely paid $1.8 billion to buy Volvo from US carmaker Ford in 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:46:37.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
