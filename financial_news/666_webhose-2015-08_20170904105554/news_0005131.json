Some point in the first half of next is currently the best bet. \nA similar change of direction is expected for US rates before then. \n= What happens to bonds when rates begin to rise? = \nAlong with making borrowing cheaper and pushing returns on savings lower, the rock-bottom rates have also helped spur a rise in bond prices. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas \nThat’s because anyone looking for an income, which bonds provide, have been willing to pay more for less because the alternative cash pays so poorly. \nAs interest rates around the world begin to normalise, therefore, bond prices could go into reverse. \n= Which bond funds will be hit the hardest? = \nSome bond funds will be better placed than others to cope if and when prices fall. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) all comes down to the types of bond they hold. \nBonds that are scheduled to pay out for longer - with a longer “duration” - stand to fall further because the holder faces a longer period during which their yield is less attractive, relative to cash. Anything over ten years is generally considered \"long\". \nThe tide turned for these longer-duration at the start of this year as expectations for rates began to shift. \nAn index of long-dated bonds (see chart) is down almost 10pc since the end of January. \nSmoother ride: Strategic bond funds have ridden fast rising bond prices more steadily than other types of fund. \n= Which funds to ride a rise in rates? = \nFunds that hold shorter duration bonds should fare better as rates rise. \nAdvisers at Chelsea Financial Services produced analysis to show the aggregate duration of the bonds held in some of the most popular funds. \nThe shortest aggregate durations come in ‘strategic’ bonds funds - those where the manager is able to select from all types and duration of bonds, rather than focus on a particular part of the market, such as gilts or high-yield corporate bonds. \nSome strategic funds can to use sophisticated financial instruments to manipulate the duration of their portfolio. \nInvesco Perpetual Monthly Income Plus, a strategic bond fund, has an aggregate duration of just 2.95 years, compared to 9.49 years for the BlackRock UK Gilts AllStocks, a popular government bond fund. \nThe chart shows how the extra flexibility of strategic funds has given investors a smoother rise and may provide a softer landing if bond prices fall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:51:30.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
