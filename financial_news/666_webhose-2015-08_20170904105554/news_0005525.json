Photo: Bloomberg\nThe US Federal Reserve will probably raise interest rates twice this year, with the first increase in almost a decade coming as early as next month, according to a Reuters poll of economists published on Thursday.\nThe survey gave a median 55 per cent chance that the US central bank would raise its short-term lending rate twice this year. Economists put a 60 per cent probability on a September rate hike and an 85 per cent chance that it would move by year-end.\n\"If the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) acts in September, there is a good possibility that it will in December as well,\" said economist Terry Sheehan of Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, New Jersey.\nThe case for a September monetary policy move was bolstered by solid job gains and a rebound in wages in July. In addition, economic growth accelerated in the second quarter after bad weather constrained it at the start of the year.\nAdvertisement After China's surprise devaluation of the yuan, US financial markets have slightly pushed rate hike expectations to December. The Fed, currently targeting a range of zero to 0.25 per cent, has not raised interest rates since 2006.\nThe midpoint of the range of federal funds rate expectations in the survey came to 0.375 percent by the end of September and 0.625 per cent at the turn of the year, unchanged from a July poll.\nEven if the Fed raises interest rates twice this year, the tightening process would still be gradual, economists said, citing a strong dollar.\n\"Their credibility requires a rate increase this year,\" said Georgia State University professor emeritus Donald Ratajczak. \"The strong dollar suggests that a very slow pace is needed until currency values stabilise.\"\nAverage hourly earnings are expected to rise slightly beginning in 2016, according to the poll.\nThe economists forecast wage growth averaging 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of 2016 and 0.6 per cent in the second. They had previously expected 0.3 per cent for both periods.\nThe more than 80 participating economists saw little impact on the economy from the anticipated slight tightening in monetary policy.\nThe growth estimate for 2015 was unchanged at an average of 2.3 per cent. The survey showed growth accelerating to 2.7 per cent next year, little changed from the July poll.\n\"Monetary policy will still be very accommodative even after the first couple of Fed rate hikes,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. \"Raising rates will be a sign that the Fed believes the recovery has made substantial progress and will continue to improve.\"\nInflation forecasts were little changed from the July survey.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/opinion/columnists/china-has-good-reasons-for-devaluing-the-yuan-20150813-giy8df"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:49:47.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
