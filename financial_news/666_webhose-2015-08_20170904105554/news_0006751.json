Commissioner, TC Memo 2013-245 , a taxpayer got drilled with tax and the 10% early withdrawal penalty when he funded a start-up business with cash from his IRA and then had the business pay him $10,000 in salary. This payment, unfortunately, was a \"prohibited transaction.\" because an IRA may not use funds to pay compensation to a \"disqualified person.\" As a result, the $10,000 compensation payment caused the taxpayer to be subject to ordinary income tax rates on the entire $300,000 used to fund the business, and a 10% penalty to boot.Then there was Dabney v. Commissioner , TC Memo 2014-108, in which a taxpayer desperate to buy land priced at a bargain made the unfortunate decision to use the funds in his IRA. Because his IRA refused to hold the land directly, the taxpayer took a distribution and bought the land personally, with the intention of selling the land quickly and repaying the distribution within 60 days to take advantage of the tax-free rollover provision. As you might imagine, things didn't go as planned -- the land wasn't sold in time, the 60-day window wasn't met, and the taxpayer got stung with tax and the 10% penalty.Then of course there was Bobrow v. Commissioner, TC Memo 2014-21 -- one of the 10 most important cases of 2014 -- in which the taxpayer believed he had done a tax-free rollover in each of his IRAs, only to have the IRS successfully argue against its own advice , asserting that a taxpayer was limited to one rollover per year, regardless of the number of IRAs he may own. As a result, Bobrow's second rollover of the year was fully taxable, and also subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty.Lastly in 2014, we had Alexander v. Commissioner, TC Summ. Op. 2014-18, in which the taxpayer tried to do everything right -- as advised by his IRA custodian, he took a distribution from his IRA with a promise that within 60 days, the IRA would loan him the amount necessary to repay the distribution, qualifying the initial distribution as a tax-free rollover. The custodian failed to deliver on his promise, however, neglecting to loan the taxpayer the funds until day 63, thereby disqualifying the initial distribution as a tax-free rollover and subjecting the taxpayer to tax and penalties.Earlier today, we were reminded by the Tax Court that things don't get any less confusing when you borrow money from your retirement annuity, as opposed to your 401(k) or IRA. In Tobias v. Commissioner, TC Memo 2015-164, the following facts ultimately doomed the taxpayer, an attorney and the holder of an inactive CPA license:\nIn 2003, the taxpayer purchased a variable annuity for $228,000. t In order to purchase the annuity, the taxpayer sold stock at a loss, generating a $158,000 capital loss carryforward. t In 2010, the annuity had a balance of $761,000, comprised of $580,000 of taxpayer contributions and $180,000 of earnings on those contribution. t During 2010, the taxpayer withdrew $525,000 from the annuity to purchase a new house. The insurance provider issued the taxpayer a Form 1099-R for 2010 indicating that of the $525,000 withdrawal, $180,000 -- the amount of earnings in the annuity -- represented taxable income subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty under Section 72. The taxpayer, however, removed the income from his return, attaching a statement explaining the omission -- more on that below -- that attracted the attention of the IRS. In response, the Service asserted that the taxpayer had ordinary income of $180,000 as reported on Form 1099-R, and was subject to the early withdrawal penalty and a underpayment of tax penalty. Annuity Gains, In General Section 72 and the related regulations provide that gains on investments within an annuity are not taxed until the purchaser receives distributions. The taxability of those distributions depends on the \"annuity starting date,\" the date on which required distributions from the annuity are slated to begin.If distributions are made after the \"annuity starting date,\" each payment represents partly taxable income, and partly a recovery of the taxpayer's \"basis\" in the annuity, which is comprised of his post-tax contributions to the plan. If distributions are made prior to the annuity starting date , however, the \"income first\" rule of Section 72(e) requires that the first dollars of distribution be treated as coming from the earnings of the annuity, and thus taxed as income. As a result, the taxpayer is taxed on the lesser of the income in the annuity or the amount of the distribution. Application to Tobias The distributions in Tobias were made prior to the annuity starting date; about this there was no controversy. The taxpayer argued, however, that despite this fact, he should not be taxed on the $525,000 distribution to the extent of the $180,000 of earnings in the annuity as required by the \"income first\" rule. His reasoning? In order to fund the annuity, he sold stock that generated a $158,000 capital loss, of which $148,000 remained in 2010. The majority of earnings inside the annuity, the taxpayer continued, represented gain from the sales of stock. Thus, when taken as a combined economic transaction, the taxpayer enjoyed little gain on the investment: his $180,000 of \"earnings\" inside the annuity should be offset by the $148,000 capital loss generated in order to acquire the annuity.While an interesting argument, the taxpayer was ultimately doomed by a basic tenant of the income tax laws: the character of income is just as important as the amount .Section 72 clearly mandates that annuity income is ordinary income, rather than capital gains. Thus, it is immaterial whether, as the taxpayer asserted, the annuity generated most of its income in the form of capital gains. Because once the annuity distributed the cash generated from those capital gains on to the taxpayer, the tax law required it to be treated as ordinary income. And as we know, ordinary income may not be offset by a capital loss carryforward, except to the extent of the $3,000 annual allowance permitted by Section 1211.As a result, the taxpayer was required to pay $76,000 in ordinary tax on the taxable portion ($180,000) of the $525,000 distribution. And an $18,000 10% penalty for early withdrawal as mandated by Section 72. And a $15,000 accuracy penalty. So if you're doing the math, that $525,000 withdrawal cost the taxpayer $110,000 in tax and penalties.And that, boys and girls, is why you should leave your retirement plan funds for, you know...retirement.follow along on twitter @nittigrittytax", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:42:59.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
