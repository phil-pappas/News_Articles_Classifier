Sean Davey Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin Banks, big business and the financial services sector will bear the brunt of a $260 million user-pays system to fund the corporate regulator, in the government's initial response to the David Murray financial systems inquiry.\nThe controversial shake-up to be announced by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Friday will mean an annual levy based on market capitalisation and an assessment of each sector's risk to investors, in a move which puts the funding burden squarely on the big end of town.\nA full user-pays system has long been advocated by Australian Securities and Investments Commission chairman Greg Medcraft and clears the way for the federal government to proceed with a $3 billion sale of ASIC's registry arm to ease the burden on next year's federal budget.\nBut the move will be fiercely opposed by banks and listed companies who face $53 million in fees while investment banks, stockbrokers, insurers and the super and planning industry will be stung another $91 million in meeting ASIC's budget from next financial year.\n\"ASIC can just say 'we need more resources to investigate this issue, we need to raise the levy' but how do we know we are not just creating a fat and lazy regulator,\" chief executive at the Australian Bankers' Association Steven Munchenberg complained.\n\"If the government doesn't bear the cost of new regulation, then there is no disincentive against more regulation. You also have the government undertaking a capability review of ASIC, so you think they would complete that before deciding to move to an industry-funded regulator,\" Mr Munchenberg said.\nThe backlash follows a warning by ASX chief executive Elmer Funke Kupper on Wednesday that the United States regulator which is funded by industry transaction fees was not working.\n\"Sometimes it is said the most profitable party in the US markets is the SEC, so we need a better model,\" Mr Funke Kupper said.\n But Mr Frydenberg - who has been touring the Torres Strait Islands with the Prime Minister - said the proposed model which was recommended by David Murray's financial system inquiry would boost accountability and followed similar moves overseas.\n\"[This] follows through on one of the key recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry, which found that an industry funding model could boost accountability, drive efficiencies, and strengthen ASIC's capabilities,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\n\"Importantly, an industry funding model would put ASIC on an equal footing with comparable regulators in other jurisdictions, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as APRA in Australia,\" he said.\nStockbrokers already fund ASIC to the tune of $18 million and some industry players question the regulator's spending such as $44 million used to buy the Market Analysis and Intelligence system to monitor the stockmarket.\nUnder the government's proposal, industry will contribute around $200 million of ASIC's budget with the remainder drawn from fees for services such as registrations and licence applications.\nThe ASX's 2,000 listed companies will shoulder the lion's share of $53 million allocated for public and unlisted companies.\nThe government has proposed a maximum levy of $320,000 a year for those with a market capitalisation of over $15 billion, disadvantaging those just over that mark such as Suncorp, Transurban, AMP, Westfield, Amcor and Brambles most.\nThe financial services industry will be the other big loser with licensees including investment banks, stockbrokers, insurers and the super and planning industry forced to contribute another $91 million.\nï»¿\nThe government propose that ASIC would calculate how much each business pays based on a tiered system, assessing the risk each sector poses for investors through a \"top down\" and \"bottom up\" review, overseen by an industry panel and reviewed each year.\nASIC said its \"top down\" process identified underlying risks, economic and market trends, investor and consumer behaviour while the \"bottom up\" review was a risk assessment of the risks for specific sectors.\n\"In industry sub-sectors where different entities have different risk profiles and receive higher levels of supervision, a different mix of supervisory activities, or both, the levy mechanisms will include tiers,\" the government consultation paper said.\nIf ASIC miscalculates its budget, industry stakeholders face a refund or additional fees.\n\"Under an industry funding model, over or under collections could occur for a number of reasons. ASIC would manage any variation in levies collected between years, at the sector level,\" the government paper said.\nNO DISCOUNT FOR BANKS\nMr Medcraft has made no secret of the fact that he expects the big end of town, including the banks to shoulder the burden of ASIC's costs which was confirmed in Friday's consultation paper.\n\"There is no discount for entities that operate across a range of sectors or subsectors because ASIC's supervisory teams focus on the specific activities of regulated entities, rather than the entity in its entirety. Therefore, there are no efficiencies of scope for ASIC in regulating more complex entities.\"\nAlthough the consultation paper asks for submissions by October 9, the proposal seems a done deal with no alternative funding models suggested in the paper.\nThe government announcement is a big win for Mr Medcraft whose term expires next May and could be the first casualty of a full scale review underway into ASIC.\nHe has long advocated for a user-pays system which he hopes will be the legacy of his five-year term.\n\"Frankly those that generate the need for regulation should pay for that regulation. The levy is actually the predominant method for regulators being funded around the world, it is transparent,\" Mr Medcraft has said.\n\"Fees will be tiered to align the cost of ASIC's work with the sectors that drive the cost,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-08-27T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:09:05.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
