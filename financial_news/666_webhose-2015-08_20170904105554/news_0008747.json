The combined sales category, however, showed the most impressive gain, jumping from 56.6 to 65.1. Durable goods orders as well as the Purchasing Mangers’ Index have seen similar upward movements, Kuehl added.For the first time since last year, all four of the favorable categories were above 60, reflecting a sign of impending growth. The index of unfavorable categories showed improvement as well with a combined reading of 51 in July, up from 49.2 in June—these gains though are not as impressive as the index of favorable factors. However, while three of the six unfavorable factors remain under the contraction zone, any sign of improvement within these categories is positive, Kuehl said.“This is a solid trend and one that everybody hopes will continue into the remaining months of the year,” Kuehl advised. “One cautionary note is to look at July and August of last year as they were strong and were followed by a dip.” Today's Other News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T16:46:09.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
