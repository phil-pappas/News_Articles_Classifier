Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow To borrow from our wise PM, people don't care about the \"Canberra insider gossip\" that is the race for the speaker.\nThey are too worked up about tax – particularly the obscenely high tax slugged on Australia's spirit producers. The rate is about three times that in Francois Hollande 's France, and that's before the GST is whacked on top.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey , what's that about? (Also, happy 50th for Sunday.)\nThis issue is white hot – as our political class would know if they would only leave their elite bubble and talk to the people. From the Chesterfield lounges of The Australian Club to the Bengal tiger-lined walls of the Melbourne Club, the nation's whisky drinkers are furious.\nCartoon: Rod Clement And after a visit to Bill Lark 's distillery near Hobart last week, so are we.\nLark's the visionary who fathered the local industry in the early nineties with some assistance from then federal minister Barry Jones . A law from Tasmania's colonial days had effectively banned the industry for 150 years.\nNow the stuff is toast of the world, as the lifestyle supplements in the papers keep telling us .\nAside from MONA founder David Walsh , in recent times few have done more for Tasmania (our new favourite state) than Lark (our new favourite distiller).\n But still the export-crimping, jobs-killing, uncompetitive excise regime hangs around like a smelly Wim Delvoye installation ( not a big fan of that thing ).\nWe hear Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie is also a recent convert. The ex-PUP took the Lark tour the week before us.\nHope of the side (and Finance Minister) Mathias Cormann is also on the case, which is promising.\nTo help things along we are thinking of starting our first Rear Window political campaign.
