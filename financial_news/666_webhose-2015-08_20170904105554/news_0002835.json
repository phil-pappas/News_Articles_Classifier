Let’s assume that customers spend around £50 a month, and that, on average, 10pc of customers cancel their service every year (figures which comes from Sky's own reports ). \nSky’s deliberate delaying tactics stand to net the company an additional £60m revenue a year and that’s if it only delays cancellations by one month. Not bad. \nIt’s no wonder that we routinely hear from readers who are at their wits end. They simply want to cancel, but are told that they don’t have the necessary “security data” or password, or that they must go through a lengthy “process” over the phone. \nSky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) customer gets £1,500 payout after two years trying to cancel his contract \nBuy why? Other companies are happy to accept written notice of cancellation. In fact most prefer it it gives both sides proof of communication and there is less chance of requests being misunderstood. \nSky is unapologetic about its tactics and the way it treats customers. Its tagline, \"believe in better\", must seem like a cruel joke to those who are trapped in its grip. \nThis week, Sky customer John Snoxell was being chased by debt collectors, even though he had given three months notice in writing of his cancellation. Sky insisted he owed almost £60, but this newspaper’s investigation showed that Sky actually owed Mr Snoxell money. I wonder how many more customers are in a similar position, but who pay the bill through fear of a poor credit rating. \nIf Ofcom hopes to make any difference here, it has to issue fines that outweigh the additional revenues Sky brings in by this deliberate prevention of customers from leaving. \nCome on Ofcom, step up and put an end to this profiteering. No one should be bullied into paying for a service they no longer want or need. \n- nicole.blackmore@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T14:18:08.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
