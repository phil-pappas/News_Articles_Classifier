But Kelly isn't the only one winning support. 21 st Century Fox ( FOXA - Get Report ) stands to get a boost in viewership and prestige after the Trump-featured presidential debate, in which a record 24 million viewers tuned into the company's under-appreciated asset Fox News . \n\"There's tremendous value in Fox News establishing its profile in the national conversation,\" said Paul Sweeney, a senior media analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \"Media stocks had the worst hit in years, with 21 st Century Fox feeling that hit as well. Fox News has to be very happy for the promotional value of (the presidential debate) Thursday night. The question is, 'Can it keep those viewers going forward?' \" \nThat's the question that has yet to play out, as Kelly, a Washington lawyer-turned-journalist on the successful prime-time Fox New s show The Kelly File , has been jettisoned into the post-debate stratosphere. Her heated line of questioning to Trump, early on in the presidential debate, included asking him to answer to his history of calling women he doesn't like \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.\" When the billionaire shot back, \"What I say is what I say. And honestly, Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be, based on the way you have treated me. But I wouldn't do that.\" Trump's response set off a media and political backlash. \nAnd this situation further escalated when Trump appeared on various TV outlets on Friday and through the weekend to verbally bash Kelly. He called her \"not very tough and not very sharp,\" during an interview with CNN , adding, \"There was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\" \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nHis planned appearance at Saturday's conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta was subsequently canceled. Plus, newly resigned Trump campaign strategist Roger Stone tweeted, \"Sorry @realDonaldTrump didn't fire me- I fired Trump. Diasagree with diversion to food fight with @megynkelly away core issue messages.\" The Associated Press praised Kelly in a story Sunday as being recognized \"as successful, whip-smart, commanding.\" \nThe heightened attention to the host could lift ratings for her Fox News show even more, and strengthen Fox following last Wednesday's earnings report. Fox raked in $6.21 billion in revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to $8.42 billion in the same quarter in 2014. The cable TV segment, Fox's largest division, posted a 7% increase in revenue to $3.57 billion.Fox shares were little changed on Monday at $30.70 after losing 11% last week after investors sold out of media companies including Disney ( DIS - Get Report ) on signs that viewers and advertisers are moving to digital platforms from television. Fox's outlook wasn't helped Monday following the underwhelming performance of its superhero film Fantastic Four , which managed to generate just $26.2 million over the weekend. \nResearch analysts at Deutsche Bank continue to stand behind their positive post-earnings report Friday emphasizing a \"buy\" rating and maintaining that Fox's domestic cable networks, including Fox News , are growth drivers, despite advertising revenue having declined 9% in 2Q. \nDeutsche Bank, in its post earnings report, confidently maintains that Fox will have one of the highest profit growth rates among the big five diversified media companies on a three and five year basis, and that Fox's high mix of advertising in sports content and Fox News makes it more insulated from secular TV advertising pressures. It also claims that fears over pay TV subscribers' cord-cutting and opting for slimmer cable packages have been over exaggerated. \n\"Still, cord-cutting issue is definitely a real issue, and the pace for these media conglomerates are going to change,\" Sweeney said.
