Photo: Louie Douvis\nFormer Telstra chief executive David Thodey has been appointed chairman of CSIRO, Australia's troubled flagship scientific body.\nThe Minister for Industry and Science, Ian Macfarlane, announced the appointment, alongside Mr Thodey, at CSIRO's Food Innovation Centre at Werribee on Thursday.\nMr Thodey replaces former CSIRO chairman Mr Simon McKeon, whose term expired in June and was not renewed by the Federal Government.\nMr Thodey was chief executive of Telstra from May 2009 to April 2015 , and prior to that had a 22-year career with IBM, working in senior marketing and sales positions, including as chief executive of IBM Australia/New Zealand.\nHis five-year appointment as chairman of Australia's national science agency begins in November. The CSIRO board has seven members, including Mr Thodey and chief executive Larry Marshall, who began his term in January.\nMr Thodey, however, avoided the delicate question of how much revenue CSIRO ought to be making. For decades, scientists and politicans have debated whether Australia's flagship scientific organisation should be devoted to pure scientific research regardless of cost or a break-even commercial business.\nCurrently, CSIRO makes about one-third of its revenue, the shortfall funded by government.\nMr Macfarlane took the question instead. \"It's a bit unfair to David because he hasn't actually seen the books,\" he said. \"CSIRO currently cover about one-third of their budget...it would be good for both industry and science and CSIRO if they were able to increase that.\"\nMr Thodey added that \"that doesn't mean you don't need pure scientific research. It's critically important that you have that opportunity to have great scientists doing that research.\"\nCSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski said that the Association \"welcomes the appointment of Mr Thodey.\"\n\"CSIRO continues to suffer the effects of heavy cuts to funding, jobs and research. Alongside new Chief Executive Larry Marshall, the challenge for Mr Thodey is to provide leadership and repair confidence.\n\"Staff morale at CSIRO remains low, with the workforce reeling from the loss of one in five jobs over the past two years.\"\nMr Popovski also said that Mr Thodey would also face challenges in protecting staff against the Government's push to cut CSIRO working conditions and championing the cause of scientific integrity within political and policymaking circles.\nMr Macfarlane described Mr Thodey as \"one of Australia's most well-known and respected businessmen ... he will bring a wealth of industry acumen to Australia's peak science agency as it plays an increasingly central role in maximising our economic opportunities and industry growth.\"\nHe said Australia needed to lift the rate of collaboration between industry and researchers.\n\"CSIRO is at the heart of this process and Mr Thodey's appointment to work alongside our nation's most respected scientists will further enhance our record on collaboration and commercialisation.\n\"Mr Thodey is an innovative Australian businessman and an experienced board chairman and senior executive who offers expertise in management, corporate and government relations, information and communications technology, and sales and marketing.\n\"Mr Thodey's experience in building business networks will be valuable to CSIRO as it implements its new 2020 Strategy.\"\nMr Thodey said that he felt \"privileged and honoured to be asked to contribute to the future of the CSIRO, an outstanding community of researchers and scientists.\n\"We as a nation have an important opportunity to collaborate across the research community and industry to improve Australia's global competitiveness. This is essential for the future of our country.\n\"Consistent with the new CSIRO vision, I hope that the CSIRO can be a catalyst for innovation across key focus industries and the wider community. We must make sure that Australia remains a global leader in the areas of science, research and industry innovation.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/i-cant-defend-my-high-salary-says-telstra-ceo-david-thodey-20150430-1mwtby.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:46:09.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
