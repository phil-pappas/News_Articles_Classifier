He waited two months and the documents still did not arrive. \nEarlier this week he was informed that Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) \"could not process the information at present\", citing the transfer of portfolios from one division of the banking giant to another. \nAnother customer who inquired in January was told he would have to wait until the end of September to find out how much his deceased father's estate is worth. \nA Barclays spokesman said: \"The delay is because of the complexity around having two reporting tax packs this year. Formerly, customers would have received their packs in May and June. The focus on ensuring quality and accuracy between a consolidation of the two has also added time to the process. \n\"As part of an administration migration in January, Barclays Personal Investment Management customers have experienced some delays with the issuance of their tax packs. We apologise for this and are working hard to resolve the situation as quickly as possible for our customers\" \nkatie.morley@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T11:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:59:16.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
