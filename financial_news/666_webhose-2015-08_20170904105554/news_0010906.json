Yet the move proved wildly unpopular on Wall Street the day it was announced, with the company's stock falling 15 percent.\nRockov holds 411,578 shares of Linn, worth roughly $4.9 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nRottino joined Linn in 2008 and was most recently the company's chief accounting officer. He previously worked at ConocoPhillips.
