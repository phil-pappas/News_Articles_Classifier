Although Ethiopia is attracting foreign investors, they are more concerned with profit making unlike the diaspora investors who want to help their people while doing businesses. \nNoting that the government is committed to facilitate conditions for the diaspora to engage in various investment activities to increase foreign direct investments, the President urged the Ethiopian diaspora to pay due attention to joint venture with foreign investors. \nOromiya State Chief Muktar Kadir also said that as they visted differnt parts of the State the diaspora would be able to get a true picture and first hand information as regards the developmental activities in the country. The government understands that the diaspora community have interest to invest in their motherland but their engagement has been limited for various reasons. \nBesides sustaining the ongoing economic development, ensuring good governance is one of the major assignments of the government in the country. In this regard, the diaspora and the government should step up their cooperation to tackle maladministration that discourages investment. \nFollowing the Oromo Gada system, a culture of negotiation should be applicable today to resolve conflicts, hence, cooperation and discussion should be put in place to address grievances. \nMembers of the Oromo diaspora also pledged to contribute to their nation's and State development by engaging in different sectors. Panel discussion was held on issues of development and good governance. \nBY DESTA GEBRE-HIWOT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T14:15:13.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
