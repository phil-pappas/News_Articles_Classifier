This also marks a slight slowdown on the 0.4 per cent month-on-month rise recorded in July. The annual pace of price growth is now less than a third of what it was a year ago, hitting double digits for much of last summer, with a 11 per cent annual increase recorded in August 2014. Nationwide said the slowdown in annual house price growth provides further signs that it may be stabilising close to the level of earnings growth in the UK, which has historically settled at around four per cent.
