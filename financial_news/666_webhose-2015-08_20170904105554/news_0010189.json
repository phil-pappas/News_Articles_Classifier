Barclays disclosed on 29 July that it was putting aside £250m , and the following day Royal Bank of Scotland said it was lifting its provision to £307m.\nLloyds and Bank of Scotland have the Silver and Platinum packaged accounts, which cost £9.95 and £17 a month respectively, while NatWest and RBS have Select Silver and Select Platinum, costing £10 and £16 a month.\nBut packaged accounts have long been criticised by many commentators – consumer organisation Which? labelled them a “useless financial product” – while customers have complained they were “unfairly pressured” into signing up to an account they did not need.\nOthers have said to the ombudsman they were told they could not have the mortgage or loan they wanted unless they also took out a packaged account.\nThere have also been complaints that when customers came to claim on the insurance that is often a big selling point of these accounts, they were told they were ineligible.\nIn mid-2014, complaints to the financial ombudsman about these accounts were running at around 50 a week, though within a few months the figure had risen to 300-400 a week. The ombudsman service has now revealed it is receiving around 1,000 new complaints a week.\nHowever, the banks are likely to be cheered by the ombudsman’s disclosure that with packaged account complaints, the “uphold rate” – where it finds in the customer’s favour – is just 10%, compared with an average rate for financial products of 57%. This may suggest many people are trying their luck with a claim through a management firm. There is no indication of how many complaints the banks have paid out on without the ombudsman’s involvement.\nAbout 80% of the complaints are being submitted by claims firms. The ombudsman service indicated it was surprised to see claims firms taking such a keen interest because most packaged account claims do not involve amounts of money as high as PPI claims.\n“We have concentrated our efforts on working with these businesses so they understand our approach,” it said. “As a result, some claims managers have withdrawn a large number of generic complaints where it’s clear the case isn’t going to succeed or we agree with the compensation offered by the bank.”\nWhile some claims firms have attempted to suggest fee-paying accounts are the next big banking scandal after PPI, the ombudsman rejected this interpretation.\n“Packaged accounts are different to PPI – a product that was widely mis-sold,” it said. “Though undoubtedly some people were signed up who didn’t want, couldn’t use or didn’t need the accounts, for many people, the benefits packaged with the accounts were widely used. For example, mobile phone and travel insurance, preferential rates for overdrafts etc.”", "external_links": ["http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/technical_notes/packaged-bank-accounts.html", "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2010/06/top-10-useless-financial-products--216088/"], "published": "2015-08-26T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:49:39.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
