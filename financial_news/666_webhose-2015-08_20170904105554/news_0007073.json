AT&T engineers also were the first to use new surveillance technologies invented by the NSA, the Times reported. \n\"This is a partnership, not a contractual relationship,\" according to one NSA document describing the link between the agency and the company. \nAT&T's \"corporate relationships provide unique accesses to other telecoms and I.S.P.s,\" or Internet service providers, according to another NSA document. \nAT&T started in 2011 to provide the NSA more than 1.1 billion domestic cellphone calling records daily after \"a push to get this flow operational prior to the 10th anniversary of 9/11,\" referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, the Times reported. \nAT&T's providing of foreign-to-foreign Internet traffic has been especially important to the NSA because large amounts of the world's Internet communications pass across U.S. cables, the Times reported. The company gave access to contents of transiting email traffic years before Verizon started in March 2013, the Times reported. \nAsked to comment on the Times report, AT&T spokesman Brad Burns told Reuters by email: \"We do not voluntarily provide information to any investigating authorities other than if a personâ€™s life is in danger and time is of the essence. For example, in a kidnapping situation we could provide help tracking down called numbers to assist law enforcement.\" \nBurns said AT&T would have nothing further to say on the report. \n(Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T06:56:44.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
