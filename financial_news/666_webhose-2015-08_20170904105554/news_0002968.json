Photo: Reuters\nChina's central bank moved to devalue its currency on Tuesday – sending the Australian dollar tumbling with it – as the world's second-largest economy waded into the global currency war to support its faltering economy.\nThe People's Bank of China's surprise \"one-off\" devaluation of the yuan by a record 1.9 per cent was seen as a two-pronged move to both bolster struggling exports, while moving its currency away from a crawling peg and towards a more market-based rate.\n\"It wants the world to see this as a move to liberalise the exchange rate but on the other hand the real economy is desperately needing a weaker currency as well,\" said Michelle Lam, a Hong Kong-based economist with Lombard Street Research.\nOn Tuesday, the Australian dollar dropped from US74.4¢ to US73.5¢ within minutes and fetched US73.1¢ in late local trade. Other regional currencies, including South Korea's won and the Singapore dollar, were also hit.\nAdvertisement Alliance Bernstein's director for Asia-Pacific fixed income Hayden Briscoe said the yuan's devaluation had \"effectively unleashed a deflationary impact on the rest of the world\".\n\"This is just as impactful as the oil pricing dropping, because everybody trades with China,\" he said. \"Every commodity-based currency is now under pressure as well.\"\nMr Briscoe said Beijing's move could influence central bank policy around the world, with most taking a more dovish position on interest rates.\nEven the US Federal Reserve, which is edging closer to its first interest rate increase in almost a decade, may be forced to slow the pace of its easing, he said.\nIn what has been dubbed the global \"currency wars\", the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have embarked on aggressive bond-buying programs, aimed at stimulating their respective economies while sending both the euro and yen downward against the greenback.\nThe Chinese yuan, with its broad peg to the US dollar, has risen sharply as a result. Against the Australian dollar, the yuan has gained more than 20 per cent in the past year.\nThe high exchange rate has rendered Chinese exports – still a key engine of its gross domestic product – less competitive. Export figures last month tumbled more than 8 per cent year on year. The high greenback, in turn, is shaping up as a key headwind for the American economy.\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the Chinese central bank said the yuan's value had diverged considerably from the market rate, and that the devaluation was designed to make it more market-based.\nIn a bid for greater clout on the world stage, the Chinese leadership has been lobbying the International Monetary Fund to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies which are used to denominate loans to sovereign borrowers. This would elevate the currency to the same level as the US dollar, euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.\nWith a decision due by year's end, the IMF released a report last week praising its progress in financial reforms but outlining remaining concerns including the lack of foreign access to its stock and bond markets.\nEconomists and currency strategists are tipping the Chinese government to act to weaken its overvalued yuan further to boost exports and its broader economy.\nBut the extent it can do so is limited given the upcoming IMF decision and the potential for a rapidly-declining yuan to spark a cash exodus. Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises, have also borrowed extensively in US dollars and a depreciating local currency will make it harder for them to repay.\n\"The risk is that depreciation triggers capital flight, dealing a blow to the stability of China's financial system,\" Tom Orlik, chief Asia economist at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note.\nThe Australian dollar had hovered above US74¢ in the past week amid a weakening US dollar and a jump in oil prices.\nWhile it's unlikely the local currency will lose another full cent this week, it is facing downward pressure with the Fed's expected interest rate rise considered a contributing factor to volatility.\n\"The Aussie is going to go down the stairs rather than the elevator but the fundamentals for a lower dollar are there,\" Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Elias Haddad said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T12:50:42.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
