The breakeven payout on milk solids is $NZ4.50/kg. Labour's David Shearer says the four Australian-owned banks - ANZ, Westpac, BNZ and ASB - made a total $NZ4.4 billion ($A3.89 billion) profit last year, double what they achieved 10 years ago. \"That's a before-tax profit of $NZ1,354 for every man, woman and child in New Zealand,\" he said on Thursday. \"No other sector has been able to make that sort of return. It's only right that banks should trim their profits now to allow our farmers to ride out the dip resulting from falling international dairy prices.\" Mr Shearer says the banks weren't shy about encouraging farmers to increase their borrowing when dairy prices were booming. \"With prices now on the way down these banks should share the pain.\" Finance Minister Bill English believes the banks will do the right thing. \"In general they'll be supporting the industry,\" he said on Wednesday. \"We're expecting them to act responsibly, like they did last time.\" He was referring to the global financial crisis, which put farmers under pressure. Mr English says the Reserve Bank has been working closely with the retail banks during the dairy crisis. The finance minister, and Prime Minister John Key, have said this week they didn't expect global dairy prices to fall as low as they have. Mr English says many farmers could be running at a loss after Friday's revised forecast, unless they have very low debt levels.
