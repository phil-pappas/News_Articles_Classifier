Chevron Corporation by Angela Macdonald-Smith Chevron has warned it may miss its revised year-end target to ship its first cargo from its huge $US54 billion Gorgon liquefied natural gas project in Western Australia due to the risk of labour disputes, bad weather and equipment malfunctions.\nJay Johnson, executive vice-president upstream for the California-based energy giant, told investors on Friday that several issues still hanging over the project meant the first cargo could slip into early 2016.\nChevron has been building the massive Gorgon project, Australia's single-biggest resources investment, for more than five years at a remote island off the coast of north-west Australia.\nThe project was initially budgeted at $US37 billion and was due to begin production at the end of the third quarter of 2014, 60 months after the investment was sanctioned, but both the budget and timing have gradually slid.\nMost recently, the project is being threatened by potential work stoppages of up to 24 hours by members of the Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union and the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, which have blocked the adoption of a new enterprise agreement as they seek shorter roster cycles for the fly-in, fly out workforce.\nThe unions got approval last month from the Fair Work Commission to ballot their members on strike action.\n\"The schedule is dependent on managing commissioning and start-up risks including equipment malfunctions, possible labour and weather disruptions, as well as other unforeseen issues,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\"Our focus is on a safe and incident-free start-up that leads to reliable long-term operations. We are working to achieve the first LNG cargo by year end; however, given these risks, it's likely to occur in early 2016.\"\n Profits down 90pc Mr Johnson was speaking at Chevron's second-quarter investor briefing, at which the United States major reported a 90 per cent collapse in profits to $US571 million ($781 million), from $US5.7 billion in the June quarter last year.\nIncluded in the result were impairments of $US1.96 billion and $US670 million of charges because of project suspensions and tax costs, due to the bleaker outlook for crude oil prices, which have slumped almost 50 per cent in the past 12 months.\nThe international exploration and production division, which includes Australia, suffered a loss of $US1.18 billion in the quarter, down from $US4.21 billion a year earlier.\nThe figure was again dragged down by write-downs, which Chevron has yet to detail. But the hit was partially offset by a $US1.6 billion gain on the sale of its 50 per cent stake in Caltex Australia, which helped profits from the downstream business.\nGorgon, in which ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell are equal 25 per cent partners, comprises three LNG production units being built on the Barrow Island nature reserve off Western Australia. Gas will be fed from the Gorgon, Jansz and Io fields in the Carnarvon basin.\nThe sticking issue for the enterprise agreement negotiations remains the work cycle, with some hardline union members pushing for a shorter roster of 20 days on followed by 10 days leave, a significant change from the existing system.\nOn four occasions in the past several months, workers have voted down a proposed new enterprise agreement, despite the inclusion of pay increases and other enhanced terms as Chevron and one of its main contractors, CB&I, have given only limited ground on FIFO rosters.\nMr Johnson said it was important to recognise that a strike at this point \"is really not going to be in anyone's benefit\".\n\"And so, the negotiations continue between our contractors and the unions and I am optimistic that they will be able to find a solution and a way forward\n\"I think the issues have largely been addressed. The primary one appears to be just around work schedules. And so that is an area that is receiving quite a bit of focus as we move forward.\"\nWheatstone under pressure Mr Johnson also said Chevron had taken action to avoid delays at its second major LNG project under construction in WA, the $US29 billion Wheatstone venture being built at a site near Onslow on the mainland coast.\nWhile Wheatstone is more than 65 per cent complete, the target for a start-up in late 2016 is coming under pressure after delays in the delivery of equipment from an overseas fabrication yard to the site.\nAs a result, Chevron has widened the work to include an additional yard, and has had to increase bed capacity at the plant site at Ashburton North to try to prevent delays.\n\"Our objective remains first LNG by year end 2016, and we will continue to provide updates on our progress over the next 18 months,\" Mr Johnson said.\nThe depreciation in the Australian dollar was helping to offset other factors so the budgets for both projects remained unchanged from the latest guidance, he said.\n\"In general we are facing cost pressure on the projects, just as we are around the world,\" he said. \"At the same time we are seeing very favourable exchange rates in Australia that are a countervailing force to that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T12:12:35.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
