According to the reply, received by activist Anil Galgali, Nagpur region is receiving full priority for filling up the government vacancies though it is way down in the list requiring attention. “Possibly due to the favouritism shown by the CM,” says Galgali. Amravati, Konkan, Pune and Nasik are way above in the list requiring attention as the vacancies are higher in these areas. The CM has now finalised the priority of Nagpur, Amravati, Aurangabad and Nasik in cyclical order to fill up the pending vacancies through direct recruitment or promotions to the posts. This information has been provided by the government to Galgali. In this cyclical process, the regions of Konkan and Pune have been given a short shrift. The RTI activist had filed a query with the state government seeking information about the government resolution (GR) issued on filling up the vacancies for various posts either through direct recruitment or through promotions in the region wise rotation for recruitment. The Under Secretary and Public Information Officer (PIO) in the General Administration Department (GAD) AK Gagare informed Galgali that, the government on 28 April 2015 issued a GR for filling up vacancies in the revenue department for Group A and Group B of gazetted and non-gazetted officers through direct recruitment or through promotions. Prior to the notification, on 3 March 2015, Fadnavis, the CM issued an order in supersession of the Divisional Cadre structure and Divisional Cadre allotment for direct appointment by nomination to the posts of Group A and Group B Gazetted and Non-Gazetted of Government of Maharashtra rules 2010. At the end of year 2014, vacancies all over state was 13.79%, with Amravati division being the highest at 16.61%, followed by Konkan division at 15.3%, Pune division at 14.18%, Nasik at 13.18%, Nagpur at 12.26%, and Aurangabad division at 11.14%. “However, the CM gave priority for Nagpur division and issued orders for filling up the vacancies in the rotational order of Nagpur, Amravati, Aurangabad, and Nasik totally overlooking the need of Konkan and Pune divisions. Also, in the order leaving apart category of widows and abandoned women the women recruitment has also been ignored,” Galgali said. After widespread criticism of the GR, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Swadheen Kshatriya called for a meeting on 21 May 2015, inviting office bearers of 11 different unions. Recruitment through direct nomination and promotions rules of 8 June 2010 was cancelled and the Cabinet approved new rules on 9 April 2015, but the approval of the law department was taken much later. The government further modified its order in the cabinet meeting held on 16 June 2015, in which the postings of spouses in the same place, persons with three years pending for retirement was left out, and the implementation of the order for police and sales tax department was stayed for one year. RTI activist Anil Galgali has questioned the motive of CM Devendra Fadnavis on according priority to some divisions when there are widespread vacancies all over the state. Also, the priority should be given to areas where there are a higher percentage of vacancies in a simple understanding policy, giving priority for Nagpur over Konkan and Pune divisions, where the ratio of vacancy is higher amounts to injustice stated Galgali. In a letter addressed to the CM and CS, Galgali demanded that equal Justice should be applied to all divisions. There were 1,30,251 posts vacant in the state. “The vacancies in the end of year 2014 all over state were 1,30,251 out of 9,44,713 jobs in six division with Konkan division being the highest at 32,703. There were 8,14,462 staff working throughout the six divisions. There are 27,040 vacancies in Pune, 18,400 in Amaravati, 18,300 in Nasik, 18,256 in Aurangabad and 15,552 in Nagpur division. Why are the facts and figures being ignored by the Chief Minister is a question,” says Galgali.
