The euro now trades around 1.0780 francs, its strongest since February but still below the level the SNB once sought to defend. (EURCHF=) \nThe paper had posted most of the interview on its website on Friday, citing Zurbruegg as saying the SNB will maintain its negative interest rates despite the franc's dip. \nAt its last policy meeting in June, the SNB kept its target range for three-month Libor rates at -1.25 to -0.25 percent and a 0.75 percent charge on some cash deposits. \nIn the print version of the interview, Zurbruegg said the worst should be over for Swiss economic growth after the first half of the year. \"We are counting here on recovering global economic growth that should support demand for Swiss products.\" \nZurbruegg laid some responsibility for the franc's surge on Swiss investors who have sharply scaled back foreign investment. \"We thus have to reduce the overall attraction of the franc. That works only if the market rates fall overall,\" he said. \nZurbruegg dismissed suggestions that the SNB put a large part of its foreign currency reserves into a special fund, saying managing reserves was a central part of monetary policy. \nHe also said the risk that major banks like UBS (UBSG.VX) or Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) were too big to fail had not been completely eliminated, noting crisis plans needed improvement. \n\"More measures are needed to strengthen the Swiss package, especially in the area of equity,\" he said, adding big banks had improved capital ratios when measured by risk-weighted assets but had room to improve when it comes to leverage ratios. \nDomestically focussed banks were well capitalised but should be very cautious on lending and interest rate risk, he added. \nHe cited imbalances in the residential property market that made it too early to sound the all-clear on bubble risks. \n(Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T18:13:21.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
