Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith KPMG Australia will continue its push into the technology industry with the acquisition of long standing Australian Microsoft partner Hands-On Systems, which will help it sell more services to larger corporate clients.\nThe deal is the firm's ninth local acquisition in the past 18 months, which has included several other technology related businesses, as it broadens its scope into the booming digital realm.\nCommercial terms for the deal are not being disclosed publicly, but the acquisition follows KPMG UK, Netherlands and Malta's €26 million ($40.6 million) acquisition of similar European firm Crimsonwing in February.\nKPMG Australia's partner in charge of technology Richard Marrison said Crimsonwing was roughly three times larger than Hands-On Systems, which would peg the latest deal at about $13.5 million.\nMicrosoft Australia managing director Pip Marlow said the deal between KPMG and Hands-On Systems would benefit the technology giant. Louise Kennerley Hands-On Systems has been around since 1985 and specialises in selling Microsoft products to medium-sized businesses, and then advising on their implementation and supporting the hardware and software. It focuses mainly on the Microsoft Dynamics enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management products, and is one of the tech giant's most important local resellers.\nIt employs 80 staff, who will all move over to the newly-created KPMG Hands-On Systems division, within KPMG's Technology Enablement business. Some of the best known clients on Hands-On System's books are Harvey Norman, Komatsu and Harris Farm Markets.\nGrowing alliance KPMG Australia chief executive Gary Wingrove said the acquisition marked the company's growing strategic alliance with Microsoft, which has seen it select Dynamics for use by its 5000 Australian employees. It was also reflective of the firm's broader growth agenda.\n \"KPMG has traditionally consulted on the strategy side of transformation programs, with implementation being delivered by third parties,\" Mr Wingrove said.\n\"However clients with an eye to the future are looking for multi-disciplinary business partners. Hands-On Systems' capabilities considerably enhance our systems integration, implementation and overall technology enablement capability.\"\nMr Marrison said KPMG was following a global plan to expand into what it describes as technology enablement. He said the acquisition would help Hands-On Systems win some bigger clients, and was being welcomed by Microsoft, which wanted a \"tier one implementation partner\" to help it sell the Dynamics products to larger enterprises.\nMicrosoft Australia managing director Pip Marlow said she was delighted a global collaboration with KPMG, which was announced in March, was being built on in Australia.\n\"The deep collaboration between the two companies, backed by the investment in Hands-On Systems, adds immeasurably to the Microsoft family and can only help in delivering benefits to our customers,\" Ms Marlow said.\nBusiness as usual Hands-On Systems CEO John Munnelly said the company had been run on a private partnership model for the last eight years, and had realised 12 months ago that it needed external financial backing to grow any further.\n\"We went out to market looking for an investor. We originally weren't looking to be acquired outright but KPMG came along with a culture that was so similar to ours, with an opportunity to expand that we decided it would be best for the business, best for customers and for the staff,\" Mr Munnelly said.\n\"KPMG is giving us a lot of autonomy to get out there and make it happen … we don't just get swallowed up into the behemoth, we actually have our own identity and can still leverage off the brand that we have built over the last 20-odd years.\"\nOther acquisitions in the last 18 months by KPMG Australia include social media consultancy SR7, Cyber Security business First Point Global and mining services consultancy Momentum Partners.\nMr Marrison said it was reasonable to expect further acquisitions as part of its growth plans.\nBuild capacity \"We are looking to build out our capability in the technology enablement space across a number of different areas, and effectively we are looking for capability that lines up with the strength in our broader advisory business,\" he said.\n\"That could be around finance transformation, digital and customer or supply chain, we are looking to build implementation capability across all of those specific domains.\"\nKPMG's rivals have also been dipping into the market to bulk up on tech expertise. Deloitte Australia has bought four tech-related firms in the last year, most recently hoovering up Oracle tech specialist Dataweave in June .\nPwC has partnered globally with Google and focused its local business on science, technology, engineering and maths, while Ernst & Young acquired Australian data analytics firm C3 Business Solutions in February.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-08-31T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:11:39.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
