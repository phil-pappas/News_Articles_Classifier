Reuters by Noah Buhayar and Sonali Basak Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway may be downgraded by Standard & Poor's after agreeing to buy manufacturer Precision Castparts for about $US37.2 billion ($51.3 billion).\nMr Buffett's company was put on CreditWatch Negative because of \"uncertainty around the funding of the acquisition and how it may affect current cash resources and leverage metrics at the holding-company level,\" the ratings firm said in a statement Tuesday on Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire. \"To fund the acquisition, Berkshire is likely to use some of the capital resources available at its insurance companies.\"\nMr Buffett, 84, has built Berkshire over the past five decades into a sprawling conglomerate, largely by using premiums held at insurance units to fuel his stock picks and acquisitions. Its operations now include power companies, retailers, manufacturers and one of the largest US railroads. The deal for Precision Castparts is among his biggest ever and a rare instance of using debt to finance a deal.\nBerkshire has a AA rating from S&P, the third-highest of 10 investment-grade levels. The company was stripped of its AAA rating in 2010, a year in which Mr Buffett cut the cash pile and took on additional debt to buy railroad BNSF. It was later lowered one step further in 2013 after S&P revised its criteria for evaluating insurance companies.\nMr Buffett has long said that he likes to keep a sizeable financial cushion to deal with major claims at Berkshire's insurance operations. The company had more than $US66 billion in cash as of June 30, about $US23 billion of which he plans to use for the Precision Castparts deal.\nHe said Monday after announcing the deal that he plans to borrow the remaining $US10 billion. The target company, which makes turbine blades and fasteners for aircraft, also has more than $US4 billion of debt.\nS&P said it expects to update or resolve the CreditWatch listing within 90 days following discussions with Berkshire management. The ratings firm said it could affirm or lower the rating, after its review.\nMr Buffett didn't immediately return a message left with an assistant seeking comment on S&P's stance.\n The cost of insuring Berkshire's debt through credit-default swaps rose to 59.14 basis points in late New York trading Tuesday from 59.07 last week. The price is still below its average since December 31. The swaps climb when perceived credit risk increases.\nBoth Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed their ratings on Berkshire after the Precision Castparts deal was announced. Moody's has an Aa2 rating on Buffett's company, the third-highest possible, while Fitch gives Berkshire the fourth-best rank.\nIn a note Tuesday, Moody's said that the transaction would improve Berkshire's earnings and cash flows, while diminishing financial flexibility in the near-term. Fitch said Monday that Mr Buffett's company will be approaching limits for leverage after the Precision Castparts deal is completed, and another similarly financed transaction could put pressure on the ratings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:07:17.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
