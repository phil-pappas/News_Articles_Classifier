Second, inflation projections for January 2016 are still at the upper limits of RBI’s inflation objective,” Rajan noted in the Governor’s overview to the annual report.\n“Third, the willingness of banks to cut base rates — whereby they forgo income on existing borrowers to attract more new business — is muted. Not only does weak corporate investment reduce the volume of new profitable loans, some bank capital positions weakened by NPAs may prevent them from lending freely.”\nOn delays in resolving stressed projects, Rajan said RBI has been working on getting the projects back on track, but there a number of constraints, especially on the legal side.\nHe added that despite a bunch of creditor-friendly legislations like the Sarfaesi Act, the judicial process tends to hamper the ability of creditors to collect their just dues from influential promoters.\nThe Governor reiterated his stance against regulatory forbearance, saying “this is not a solution”.\nOn the monetary policy committee, the Governor said RBI has signed an agreement with the government wherein its mandate is clearly spelt out in terms of a flexible inflation objective.\n 27, 2015 7:37 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:36:24.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
