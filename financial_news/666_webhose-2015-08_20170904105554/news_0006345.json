Last year it published new consumer lending rules which gave it the power to cap retail lending at individual banks and limit fees that banks can charge. \nConsumer lending, including credit card use, climbed 8.8 percent to 322 billion riyals ($85.9 billion) in 2014, according to the central bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T15:35:22.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
