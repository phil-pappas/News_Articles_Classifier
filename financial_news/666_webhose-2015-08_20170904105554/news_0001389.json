One in three say they are given fewer training and development opportunities because of their youth.\nWestpac uses formal and informal mentoring programs and enterprise-wide initiatives such as the Youth Network employee action group to help combat any feeling among Gen Y workers that their older peers aren't sharing knowledge or developing talent.\nAs well, half of all graduates and participants in the bank's high-potential talent programs must be female, a requirement that helps combat traditional barriers in the pipeline for female talent.\nConfidence is key Sony Foundation chief executive and Women of Influence 2012 Young Leader Sophie Ryan said she had some experience of the issue working as a 25 year old with the United Nations on prison reform in the Sudan.\n\"I had an all-male prison staff team, and definitely when I walked into the prison on that first day, I was judged purely on my age and because I was female. I was in the minority and made to feel it.\"\nShe said while it was intimidating and confronting, people in those situations need to have confidence in themselves. \"It came down to believing that I had been sent there because my boss believed I was the right person and capable of doing the job\".\nBut Ms Ryan, who by coincidence rather than design works with an all-female team, said she was shocked to hear so many young women still think their gender is a barrier to greater success.\n\"What it actually comes down to is ... respect for the people who are working. At my current workplace that is at the core of what we do, so you're respected for what you bring to the table, you're respected for doing a good job.\"\nOther women The Australian Financial Review has spoken to are happy to admit their career trajectories have plateaued as a result of childcare requirements, part-time work or senior managers' expectations that young female workers will eventually leave to start families.\nOthers say they have seen male colleagues fast tracked with better opportunities and training despite little evidence to suggest they could or would do the job better than their female counterparts.\nBut they're not happy to admit that on the record, saying there is still the potential for their comments to be misconstrued by bosses as \"playing the gender card\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:07:58.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
