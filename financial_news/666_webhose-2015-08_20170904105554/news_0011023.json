(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: EBSB ), the holding company for East Boston Savings Bank, today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per common share, payable on October 1, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 17, 2015.

Gavegnano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “The payment of dividends represents our long-term commitment to enhancing stockholder value and we intend to continue paying a quarterly dividend in the future, assuming that our financial position continues to allow such payment.” Meridian Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for East Boston Savings Bank.
