The slowdown in China and the sharp fall in commodity prices are increasing the strain on many emerging market economies and this could lead to a slower global growth rate and less demand for US goods and services,\" he said. \nHowever, Mr Dudley cautioned that it was \"important not to react to short-term market developments\". He said it remained unclear if the recent volatility reflected a \"temporary adjustment or something more persistent for US growth and the inflation outlook\". \nHe also said the gyrations in the stock market would have to be \"persistent\" to \"impinge\" on policymakers' outlook for global growth. \nFed policymakers will meet on September 16 to discuss monetary policy. Investors now believe there is a 22pc chance of a rate hike in September and 48pc chance the Fed will raise rates by the end of this year. \nEarlier this month, investors believed there was a 40pc chance of a sSeptember rate hike and a 70pc probability that rates would rise by the end of this year. \nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) said on Tuesday that waiting too long to raise rates risked sending \"the wrong message to markets\". \nIn a note to clients, they said: \"We think the Fed remains a cautious body that would want to see the dust settle before making a determination to move forward with a rate hike. \n\"We believe they will take a pass on September, but we continue to stay hopeful of a hike in the not too distant future. We think that not too distant future is December. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is too early to throw in the towel on a rate hike this year - to do so at this point we think would send the wrong message to markets and risk pushing market jitters to greater heights (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T19:58:56.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
