Glenn Hunt by Matthew Stevens The existential struggles of a hard-working skink and slightly poisonous but otherwise unremarkable snake have left Queensland's $16 billion Carmichael coal project on life support and its sole proponent, Adani Group, in emergency-room discussion with the state government.\nBut it is increasingly difficult to believe that Adani will linger too much longer before pulling the plug on this pariah of a coal project that has, so far fruitlessly, absorbed just shy of $2 billion.\nCarmichael was planned to be Australia's biggest coal mine. The first phase of the central Queensland mine was supposed to cost $US6.5 billion ($8.9 million), making it one of the bigger countercyclical resources investments in Australian history. And preconstruction work was supposed to begin at the mine site some time in September so that first coal could start sailing off to Adani's power stations in India by late 2017.\nBut a bureaucratic stuff-up that was cleverly identified, and then impressively prosecuted in the Federal Court , by the coalition of anti-coal lobbies that have lined up against a fleet of six Galilee Basin projects means that Adani's September deadline will be missed.\nIn May and June, the head of Adani's Australian operations, Jeyakumar Janakaraj, told The Australian Financial Review that there was ever less tolerance at head office for further delay of progress at Carmichael and the window of investment opportunity would be put at risk of closure if schedules were again pushed out by Australia's approval lethargy.\nTime is the factor of critical importance to an investment decision most often overlooked by politicians and observers alike. It is an issue, though, well-appreciated by the activists armed to stop coal.\nProjects are designed and costed around schedules. Carmichael's milestones, ultimately, reflect Adani's increasingly immediate need for coal to feed its own power stations. By our reckoning Adani needs about 10 million tonnes a year of reliable high-quality coal supply by 2017. For four years Adani has worked to make Carmichael the solution. But all the evidence suggests the project is now the problem and that Adani is close to burying Carmichael and seeking more certain alternatives.\nDepending on you view point, that is either a massive win for the environment regionally and globally, or a highly indicative setback for the Australian economy and for the people whose current and future welfare depended on development of the Galilee Basin's coal.\n Carmichael the frontier project That is the great thing about living in a democracy: people can own and propagate vastly different views on matters trivial or important. And let's be very clear here: this one is important. Carmichael is the frontier project in the Galilee Basin. If Adani walks then this new energy horizon closes for the forseeable future and possibly permanently.\nTo appreciate what is up for grabs here, you need to understand that Carmichael is about 800 kilometres from the coast. Adani, in the form of either the company or its billionaire senior owner Gautam Adani, wants to build the mine and the railway that will link it to an already expanded coal terminal at Abbot Point.\nThere are five other proposals to build mines around the Galilee Basin. Only one other had a realistic plan to build a railway and that project (the Hancock-GVK joint venture) has collapsed into legal contest over the Indian group's failure to meet payment schedules.\nSo, as coal globally reaches what the anti-coal lobby hopes is an investment tipping point of no return, Adani's is the first and maybe last hope of any sort of progress for the Galilee.\nCoal is a relatively ubiquitous and cheap source of energy. That is why it is a cornerstone of most serious long-term forecasts of global and regional energy needs. Coal is also the biggest single contributor to the global accumulation of carbon emissions that an informed consensus says is changing our climate. That is why the Financial Times has dubbed coal the world's most hated commodity.\nThe First World's problem with coal has, in a moment of classic economic perversity, made it all the more attractive to the emerging world. Coal is suddenly in relatively shallow and apparently permanent oversupply, and that means the price is flat-lining at historically low levels.\nSo, while the underlying economics of Carmichael are being tested by the current low coal price, Adani suddenly has a whole lot of choice about where it might source its coal. The market for mines and the commodity they produce is highly liquid. Adani needed to spend another $US4 billion to bring the first phase of the Carmichael story to a close. The fact is that Adani's capital might easily be redirected to more mature opportunities less likely to be critically delayed by activists legal and direct.\nThere is a lot of talk, for one example, that Rio Tinto's Hunter Valley coal system is on the market, with both Glencore and Mick Davis' X2 said to be circling the dataroom.\nSince March there has been gathering evidence of Adani's growing ambivalence about Carmichael as work on planning, preconstruction preparations and project financing was either pulled or slowed. Most recently, Adani withdrew a funding mandate from the Commonwealth Bank, which had been the Australian bank charged with marketing Carmichael's three-layered funding package.\nSkewed confusion There has been some typically skewed confusion over this decision. Some have preferred to believe that the CBA dropped Adani's business, and to market this as a sea-change in Australian banking's embrace of coal as an asset class. But we have been reassured by both bank and former client that Adani ended the mandate, and that Australia's biggest bank remains open for coal business.\nCertainly this fits with advice consistently offered by the CBA's chief executive, Ian Narev. Like his peers among the pillars, Narev routinely receives anti-coal's most important advocates and, just as routinely, insists that just walking away from coal would be as bad for his shareholders as it would be for the Australian economy.\nUntil the canning of the CBA, Adani presented each of these retreats as sensible brinkmanship. The foreign investor was simply announcing to governments state and federal that it would spend no more without final tick-off on the last of its Commonwealth environmental approvals. But closing the door on finance appears to signal more enduring intent.\nJust to be clear on the approvals issue, the one Adani regarded as its investment trigger was a Commonwealth sign-off on the week's worth of dredging needed to drive a new shipping lane between Adani's new coal export pier at Abbot Point and the existing shipping channel that take boats through the Great Barrier Reef.\nThis approval has been a matter of local and global contention. It sat central to the environmental lobby's sustained effort to get the GBR placed on UNESCO's list of \"at risk\" environmental wonders. Had that happened, then Carmichael's goose would already have been cooked. But it didn't: in late May UNESCO decided not to risk-list the Reef.\nAdani and the state government (which is the applicant for the dredging approval because the port authority will do the digging and the spoil dumping) expected Commonwealth indulgence to arrive finally in August. And with that Adani would get work started at the mine site.\nBut that potential has been blown out of the water by Canberra's stuff-up. By failing to indicate that the Environment Minister had adequately contemplated the impact of the mine on a pair of endangered species that live around the impact area, the environment department has undermined the legal sustainability of Carmichael's approval and this little part of the whole has to be addressed all over again.\nThat is going to take maybe two months. But that might be time that Carmichael just doesn't have. And can we really expect that the even more fraught dredging approval will arrive in happy tandem with the redrafted mine sign-off? If not, then we might be into November and possibly beyond before Adani's approval-chickens are lined up. Again, that might be time that this project doesn't have.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:05:51.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
