Photo: Will Russell\nYou might not think vending machines would feature in Andrew Harding's cost cutting drive. But for the Rio iron ore boss, cost-cutting is coming down to micro detail, which can save millions for a business that will ship 340 million tonnes of iron ore this year.\nRio has started putting safety glasses and gloves in a vending machine that requires a staff access card to withdraw them. Previously, the equipment was left in boxes for workers to take, with no way of monitoring use.\n\"It's tracking and about feeling accountable for the use of the product,\" Mr Harding told Fairfax Media after the miner last week posted a 43 per cent fall in underlying earnings to $US2.9 billion for the June half.\n\"There is no restriction on them – it's safety equipment. But instead of someone going 'this is unlimited, what the hell' kind of thinking, it reminds people that it's an important item, contributing to cost reductions. People know that they need to be thoughtful about the use of them, they are not taking more than they need.\"\nAdvertisement The initiative has cut use of safety equipment by 15 per cent to 20 per cent at some iron ore sites, and almost halved usage of some items at others. That saves Rio millions of dollars each year, Mr Harding said.\nAt three sites, Rio has been replacing halogen bulbs with LED illumination in street lights and on haul trucks as they are more energy efficient and require no maintenance. This has reduced energy consumption by 125,000 kwh a year and will save several million dollars, at least, over the life of the light bulbs.\nThe miner is also reducing overtime and pushing out truck equipment component life.\nEye on even lower production costs Last week, Rio said it had cut its iron ore production costs, known as cash costs, to $US16.20 by June, from $US20.40 a year earlier, buoyed by falls in the Australian dollar and the oil price. Now, at current Australian dollar rates and diesel prices, costs are about $US15 a tonne.\n\"I hope to go lower (on costs), that is our intent, but I wouldn't want to paint a picture where people think you can keep going at the rate we have gone in the past,\" Mr Harding said.\nDeutsche Bank analyst Paul Young said the miner could reduce cash costs to $US11 a tonne through costouts and if further falls in the Australian dollar take it down to about US63¢.\nMr Young said Rio management had \"got the balance sheet under control and, with this result, have clearly demonstrated the elasticity of costs in the declining commodity price environment\".\nRio, the world's lowest-cost exporter of iron ore, has a break-even – the price at which it is not making or losing cash – of about $US31 a tonne. Iron ore is hovering about $US55 a tonne.\nRio is smashing its own cost-cutting targets, with $US600 million carved out across the broader group in the June half, as it targeted $US750 million in cuts for calendar 2015. That target has now been raised to $US1 billion for the year, and will come on top of $US4.8 billion in cuts made since the start of 2013.\nIn iron ore, Mr Harding has 300 \"improvement projects\" on the go. While all those projects will deliver cost reductions, Mr Harding is up against the inevitable – the mines he runs are getting older, which will push costs higher.\n\"We are facing pressures against cost reduction. When you set up a mine, you start by mining material [in an open cut mine] that is shallowest and closest to your processing facility, so you have the least cost of production. As the mine gets older, you get further and further away from the processing facility, so your inherent physical cost of movement goes up. All these [are] clever things we are doing, but ​we are competing against the life of the mine.\"\nSome of the big progress made on production costs can be put down to \"very real physical changes\", like increasing volumes, a 15 per cent lift in employee productivity, as well as currency an oil falls. Rio is piling more pressure on high-cost players across the globe by pulling its costs further down.\n Mr Harding says he will push staff to keep running on the cost-cutting \"treadmill\" and retain the mining giant's mantle as the world's lowest-cost exporter, even as gains become smaller and harder to achieve\nBut Mr Harding says automation and new technology will continue to create savings.\nRio will make an investment decision on whether to pursue a new $US1 billion iron ore mine in the Pilbara, Silvergrass, next year, likely by June. Silvergrass is needed to hit Rio's ultimate expansion target of 360 million tonnes of ore a year.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/mining/iron-ore/rio-tinto-to-slash-capital-spend-earnings-beat-analysts-forecast-20150806-gisqdd"], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:39:31.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
