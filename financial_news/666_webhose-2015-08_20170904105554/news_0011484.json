However, he does not believe Dilma Rousseff, the president, will be impeached. \nLatin America’s largest economy has fallen into its biggest recession since the Great Depression, hit by a triple whammy of lower commodity prices, a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, and a political crisis that has made Ms Rousseff the most unpopular president in Brazilian democratic history. \n“Five years ago, everyone felt that Brazil was on the brink of development,” said Mr Setubal, the chief executive of Itaú. \n“But happiness is the difference between expectations and reality, and expectations were too high. In a year, perhaps, expectations will be more realistic, and we will have a lot of hard work to do.” EM Squared \nContinue reading \nAmid a corruption scandal that has permeated the highest levels of government and an economy forecast to shrink 2 per cent this year, Ms Rousseff’s approval ratings have fallen to 8 per cent. \nHundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets calling for her resignation, while investors have pushed down the real by 25 per cent, making it one of this year’s worst-performing emerging market currencies. \nBut rather than the economy or financial markets, the government’s most pressing issue in coming weeks will probably be the fallout of the burgeoning kickback and bribery probe at Petrobras that has already jailed dozens of senior business executives. More Brazil hails long-awaited EU trade deal \nThe probe’s focus is shifting to Congress, probably increasing the political heat on Ms Rousseff and her fragile governing coalition. Last week, Eduardo Cunha, the head of Brazil’s lower house, became the first sitting politician to be formally charged with corruption. He quit Ms Rousseff’s coalition last month to join opposition lawmakers seeking her impeachment and has called the probe politically motivated. \nMr Cunha, who will be investigated by the Supreme Court, insists he is innocent and has said he will remain in his post. \nFernando Collor, a former president impeached on corruption charges in 1992 but who has since made a comeback as a senator, was also charged. \n“To her credit, Dilma has kept the [corruption] investigation going. The country’s institutions are holding,” Mr Setubal said. “I do not think she will be impeached.” \nAlthough Ms Rousseff is not being investigated, she chaired Petrobras when much of the corruption took place, and her government faces separate probes that it cooked the budget and broke campaign finance rules. \nBoth are possible grounds for impeachment, a process that would require the support of two-thirds of Congress where many lawmakers are increasingly focused on saving their own skins than pushing through unpopular economic stabilisation measures. \nBusiness leaders, fearful that political instability could turn a bruising recession into a more widespread economic crisis, have called on lawmakers to pull together and pass measures needed to put the economy on track and stave off a downgrade that could see Brazil’s credit rating cut to junk status. \nA mixed bag of spending cuts and tax breaks, called the Brazil Agenda and supported by Senate house leader Renan Calheiros of the centrist PMDB party, has made some progress through the legislature. But analysts said it was unlikely to be fully implemented.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T03:19:36.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
