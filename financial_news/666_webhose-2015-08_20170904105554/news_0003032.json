The state budget committee will vote in October whether to release the $25.5 million in state funds for the project. \nThe Indiana Legislature approved that money for the IU and University of Southern Indiana portions of the medical campus. The University of Evansville, a private institution, is contributing $6 million. City Council has approved a $57 million bond for the campus and related development. \nMayor Lloyd Winnecke said he doesn't see any reason the state budget committee wouldn't release the funds when it meets Oct. 12. \nInformation from: Evansville Courier & Press, http://www.courierpress.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T19:55:17.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
