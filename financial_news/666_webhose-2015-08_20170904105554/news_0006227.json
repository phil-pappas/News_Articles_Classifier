Of the total handsets shipped in Q2 CY2015, 24.8 per cent were manufactured and/or assembled in India compared to 19.9 per cent in the previous quarter (Q1 CY 2015),” it said.\nGovernment has been pushing for promoting manufacturing in the country, especially electronics. A significant volume of mobile handsets sold in India are manufactured in China and Taiwan and estimates suggest that given the strong growth seen in the Indian market, import bills for electronics could be higher than that of crude oil by 2020.\nWhile players like Samsung, Micromax and Spice have been assembling handsets in the country, firm like HTC , Asus and Gionee have evinced interest in setting up a manufacturing base in the country.\nIn the past few weeks, Xiaomi and Motorola, along with Lenovo have commenced assembly of smartphones in India.\nWhile CMR calls this a “positive development”, it also said the strong position enjoyed by Chinese brands (China OEMs and brands) in the smartphones category is a growing concern.\nThe contribution of Chinese brands grew 97 per cent year-on-year (YoY) during the June quarter as against 48 per cent for Indian brands within the smartphone segment, it said.\n“Such influence and acceptance of Chinese brands poses a challenge to emerging as well as incumbent Indian brands of smartphones,” it added.\nExpressing his concern, CMR Lead Analyst Telecoms Practice Faisal Kawoosa said: “Although domestic manufacturing of mobile phones has increased, the government must introduce minimum value addition norms for mobile handsets as a threshold for qualifying to be labelled as ‘Made in India’.”\nThis will push the industry to devise ways and techniques to increase the value of domestic contribution across the value chain, he added.\n 19, 2015 3:31 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:08:46.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
