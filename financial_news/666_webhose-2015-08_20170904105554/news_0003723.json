The Mutual Fund OneSource Select List is comprised of no-load and no-transaction fee mutual funds that the Charles Schwab Investment Advisory, Inc. has screened rigorously for performance, risk, and expenses. The purpose of the Select List™ is to help investors sort through the thousands of available mutual funds.\nProud of its inclusion on the Select List, The Perritt Ultra MicroCap Fund seeks to find the next generation’s winners during their earliest growth stage. The Fund only invests in the smallest companies listed on the exchanges – those with a market capitalization between $10 million and $300 million at the time of initial purchase.\nMichael Corbett, CIO and Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its 2004 inception, says, “We believe the fund is truly a distinct offering because it invests in the smallest of the small companies – companies that Wall Street traditionally ignores.”\nThe Fund has the lowest average market capitalization ($83 Million) of all 8,343 Domestic Equity Funds, according to Morningstar as of 6/30/15. The Fund tends to exhibit low correlation to the general equity markets due to the under-followed nature of its holdings (current R-Squared* is 0.30 as of 6/30/15).\nPerritt Capital Management has been investing in micro-cap for twenty-five years within its traditional MicroCap Opportunities Fund (PRCGX) . But the firm’s dedication to micro-cap investing continues to earn accolades.\nMatt Brackman, named Portfolio Manager in 2014 and analyst since inception adds, “Most micro-cap asset managers decide to go up-market and launch a small-cap product, but Perritt has taken the opposite approach with the Ultra MicroCap Fund. We go after companies that are even smaller. We believe this is in an exciting space where the upside is often the greatest.”\nAbout Perritt Capital Management\nPerritt Capital Management focuses on small- and micro-cap stocks, because they have historically outperformed the broader market.* The Firm’s investment philosophy is to own companies, not trade their stocks. This long-term perspective drives our investment professionals to evaluate management teams in a way that we believe will potentially provide our shareholders the most gain.\nPerritt’s goal is to provide investors the opportunity to profit from fundamentally strong small companies through its mutual funds, separately managed accounts, and placements on leading 401k programs.\nVisit us at http://www.perrittcap.com or contact Mark Oberrotman at (800) 331-8936, oberrotman(at)perrittcap(dot)com for more information.\nNote About Investment Risk\nThe Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory and summary prospectus contain this and other important information about the investment company and may be obtained by calling 800-331-8936 or by visiting http://www.perrittcap.com . Read carefully before investing.\nMutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Funds invest in smaller companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. The Funds invest in micro-cap companies, which tend to perform poorly during times of economic stress. The Ultra MicroCap Fund and Low Priced Stock Fund may invest in early stage companies, which tend to be more volatile and somewhat more speculative than investments in more established companies. Low Priced stocks are generally more volatile than higher priced securities.\nCorrelation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other. *R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s or security’s movements that are explained by movements in a benchmark index. In this instance, the benchmark index is the S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 Index is a broad based unmanaged index of 500 stocks, which is widely recognized as representative of the equity market in general. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.\n**According to Ibbotson & Associates Classic Yearbook 2015, $1 invested in micro-cap stocks on January 1, 1926 grew to $29,972 by December 31, 2014. $1 invested in small-cap and large-cap stocks grew to $17,800 and $5,317 over the same time period. Small cap stocks defined as deciles 6-8 of securities ranked by market capitalization from 1926-2014. Micro-cap stocks defined as the bottom two deciles, while large company stocks (broad market) are represented by the S&P 500 Index. S&P 500 is an unmanaged index which is widely regarded as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock market performance. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nWhile the Fund is no-load, management & other expenses still apply.
