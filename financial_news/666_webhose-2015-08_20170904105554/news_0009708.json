The share of indirect bidders purchase was below its 12-month average of 52 percent.\nThe modest rise in indirect purchase, which is seen as a proxy on foreign central bank demand for Treasuries, contrasted with the notable drops at the two-year and five-year auctions earlier this week.\nSmall bond dealers and other direct bidders bought 14.15 percent of the latest seven-year supply, their biggest share since January and above July's 12.01 percent.\nPrimary dealers or the top 22 Wall Street firms that do business directly with the Federal Reserve purchased 35.0 percent, less than July's 38.84 percent and near its recent 12-month average.
