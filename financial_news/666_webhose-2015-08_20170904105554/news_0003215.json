More measures will follow in October. \n\"We are very close. Two or three very small details remain,\" said Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece's finance minister, as he emerged on Tuesday morning from marathon talks with the country's creditors. \nPhone calls were scheduled on Tuesday between Jean Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, German chancellor Angela Merkel, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Francois Hollande, the French president, to finalise what an EC spokesman described as a “political agreement” across the single currency bloc. \nUnder the terms of Greece's third rescue package, the country will be required to post a primary deficit no larger than 0.25pc of gross domestic product (GDP) this year. In 2016, the country is required to post a surplus of 0.5pc of GDP rising to 1.75pc in 2017 and 3.5pc in 2018. \nGreece had previously proposed a primary surplus target of 1pc of GDP this year and 2pc in 2016. \nOfficials claimed the deal would reduce Greece’s obligations with regards to primary surpluses by 11pc of GDP over the next three years, meaning Greece would avoid austerity measures worth around €20bn over that period. \nThe Greek parliament must now pass the reforms agreed with creditors, ahead of a meeting of eurozone finance ministers expected on Friday. \nHowever, Costas Lapavitsas, a Syriza MP and professor of economics at SOAS university in London, criticised the package, and suggested he would vote against it. \n\"To lower the targets because the economy is in recession is one thing. To present this as lightening the recessionary burden is quite another and wrong. Nothing has been lightened because the tax rises have already been voted in,” he said. \nCapital Economics described the fiscal targets as \"fantasy\" and \"utterly unachievable\", while Raoul Ruparel, co-director at the think-tank Open Europe, said: \"The new targets have not been so much negotiated as made inevitable by the recent economic destruction claiming savings thanks to significant economic downturn has a touch of claiming success in cutting off your nose to spite your face,\" he said. \nAlexander Stubb, Finland’s finance minister, cautioned that a final agreement had not yet been reached. \"We must take one step at a time. Agreement is a big word. There remains work to be done with details,” he said. \nGreece needs more money by August 20 at the latest, when it has a debt repayment of €3.3bn to the European Central Bank. \nOfficials did not rule out a second bridging loan to Greece in case agreement could not be reached by then. UK Treasury ministers took part in a conference call on Tuesday to discuss the use of short-term bridging loans. \nHowever, Greek stocks rose and government borrowing costs fell sharply on Tuesday after the deal was announced in a sign investors are less worried about a default.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T22:17:19.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
