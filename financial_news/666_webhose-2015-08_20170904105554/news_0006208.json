Harrison Saragossi by Robert Harley Stockland, the largest diversified property group in Australia, lifted its underlying profit 9.4 per cent in the last financial year.\nChief executive Mark Steinert said all core businesses contributed to the result with Residential, Retirement Living and Logistics and Business Parks each up more than 15 per cent.\n\"Our residential business achieved a substantial 73.5 per cent uplift in profit and ended the year with a record 3,742 contracts on hand. This result reflected generally positive market conditions in the corridors where we operate and the progress we've made launching six key projects in two years and broadening our customer reach with diverse product offerings,\" he said\nThe number of lots settled in the year, 5876, while at the top end of the 5,000-6000 lots a year as forecast, will disappoint many analysts who expected the figure to go over 6000.\nRetail, which reliably provides about 60 per cent of group earnings, rose 4.2 per cent on a comparable basis\nStatutory profit for the year ended June 30 jumped more than 70 percent to $903 million. This included $297 million in revaluation uplift on Commercial Property assets and $80 million gross profit from the sale of our securityholding in Australand.\n\"Stockland is aiming for earnings per security growth of 6 – 7.5 per cent in financial year 2016 and FFO growth of 8.5 –10 per cent,\" Mr Steinert said.\n\"Commercial Property should maintain moderate growth in returns with comparable NOI growth expected to be 2 – 3% and comparable FFO growth 3 – 4%,\" he said.\n \" We expect to achieve around 6,000 residential lot settlements, allowing for some production constraints in Victoria and NSW and continued slowing in the WA market.\nImportantly, distribution will rise for the first time in years, to 24.5 cents per security. Mr Steinert said that group had updated its distribution policy to pay the higher of 100 per cent of Trust taxable income or 80 – 90 per cent of underlying profit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:06:39.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
