Photo: Reuters\nHSBC Holdings reported a 10 per cent increase in earnings for the first half of the year, boosted by bumper profits in Hong Kong as the lender considers whether to move its headquarters from London to the Asian hub.\nHSBC also announced the sale of its Brazil unit to Banco Bradesco SA, the country's second-biggest private-sector bank, for 17.6 billion reais ($7 billion) as HSBC seeks to cut underperforming businesses.\nEurope's biggest bank said on Monday pretax profits in the six months to the end of June were $US13.6 billion, up from $US12.3 billion a year earlier and well above analysts' average forecast of $US12.5 billion according to a poll conducted by the bank.\nHSBC's shares were unchanged in Hong Kong on Monday morning, against a 1 per cent drop in the city's benchmark Hang Seng index .\nAdvertisement HSBC said it sold its Brazilian unit to Banco Bradesco SA for $US5.2 billion ($7 billion), retreating from the second-largest emerging market economy after years of feeble performance.\nIn a statement released on Monday, HSBC said the agreement includes the disposal of the HSBC Bank Brasil SA Banco Múltiplo and the HSBC Serviços e Participações Ltda units to Bradesco. The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval and was sealed on July 31, should be completed by June next year.\nThe purchase price, which could undergo adjustments to reflect the net asset value of both businesses, is way above what investors and analysts had expected. Reuters reported on July 20, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter, that Bradesco had entered exclusive talks with HSBC for the unit and was willing to pay around 12 billion reais ($4 billion) , or 1.2 times book value, for HSBC Brasil.\nAccording to the statement, Bradesco paid about 1.8 times book value for the business. Bradesco, Brazil's second-largest private-sector bank, is currently trading at about 1.5 times book value. Bradesco confirmed the purchase in a statement.\nThe acquisition allows Osasco, Brazil-based Bradesco to close the asset gap with state-controlled Caixa Econômica Federal and, especially, larger private-sector rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA. HSBC Brasil's focus on high-income customers fits well into Bradesco's plan to ramp up sales of specialised financial services for the wealthy and larger corporations.\nStrategy missteps coupled with rising competition turned the unit into a problem for HSBC chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver, who in June laid out plans to slash nearly one in five jobs worldwide and fix operations which, like in Brazil, were grappling with operational underperformance, high compliance costs and fierce competition.\nHSBC, which arrived in Brazil late in the 1990s, never gained enough size to pose a real threat to Itaú, Bradesco or Banco do Brasil SA, the nation's top lender by assets.\nHSBC Brasil has 854 branches, 21,000 employees and about 170 billion reais in assets, or the equivalent of 2.3 per cent of the outstanding assets of Brazil's banking system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:30:13.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
