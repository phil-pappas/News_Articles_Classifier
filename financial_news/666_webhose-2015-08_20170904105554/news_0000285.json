For example, the first month we paid the midwife for the birth of our second child, so you’ll see a big variation in the health category. \nRelated: Dave Ramsey’s No. 1 Financial Tip for 2015 What was your lifestyle like right before you paid off your debt? \nIt was not extravagant. We were just meeting our family’s needs at that time. My husband was working full-time in Seattle as an architect, and I was taking care of my children and working on a freelance basis as work came my way, either architecture projects or blogging assignments. What was your first step? \nMy first step was realizing that even a small change could make a big impact. My family was technically living on a low income at the time, so it was hard to cut corners. We already had cheap rent and were living in a 730-square-foot home with our children. \nI decided to allocate $39 a month to our debt because after doing some calculations online, I realized that even that small amount was going to cut several months off of our debt payment timeline. I set up an automatic banking payment for that amount every month, and that way it’s done for you. What sacrifices did you make? \nWe were already frugal, but we continued to have one car. My family did not travel in our car for more than 40 miles from home to save on gas. My husband started commuting to work as part of a park-and-ride program. We lived in Washington at the time, and he would commute on a shuttle bus and his company agreed to pay for the monthly pass. \nI cut our grocery bill in half. The grocery total would vary every month. But in January 2014, I only spent $170 on groceries — my lowest total ever. I like to feed my family organic produce, but I had to let that go for the sake of a bigger goal. \nHere are a few tips that helped me get some fresh ingredients into our family’s diet: Meal planning for the week Price comparisons between stores (online and inside local grocery stores) Pick your own produce. You pick fruits and vegetables during peak season for a reasonable price, and then you freeze or can the food for the rest of the year. You can make jam, jelly, fruit preserves, salsa — the opportunities are endless. \nAlso, anything that would break in my house, I didn’t replace. When our bathmat unraveled we used an old towel instead. What challenges did you face? \nRealizing that I could not pay off our debt as fast as I wanted if I didn’t increase my income. I had already been working from home as projects came my way, but I set new goals and intentionally took on more projects. I gave up sleep to grow my blog and do more architecture projects. I opened an ETSY store — I did anything I could to make more money and put it all towards our debt. \nNow I tell people, “If you want to make progress on your debt you may have to find creative ways to increase your income.” You can buy and sell items online through Craigslist or Kijiji. Or, you may have to take on a second job. What’s the best part of paying off your debt? \nMy family was able to move because of getting out of debt. Within a couple of months we made the move from Washington to North Idaho to be closer to family, so my kids could grow up with their grandparents. We were also able to rent a bigger house and purchase a second car. \nAnd we even topped up our six-month emergency savings fund. It was fairly easy because we were already in savings mode. Plus, we met our end goal of having me stay home with our kids. Any money plans for the future? \nYes! Saving for retirement, family vacations and, hopefully, in the future saving for a house. What advice do you have for others that are in a similar situation battling debt? \nThe biggest thing would be to get started. Try paying off your smallest loans first because having that taste of success motivates you. And of course, sticking with your financial plan and remembering that it’s only for a little while … you have so much more freedom once you are debt-free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:42:56.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
