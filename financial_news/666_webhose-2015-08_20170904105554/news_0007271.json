European banks have further to go in reshaping their balance sheets. \nPwC estimates that there are still roughly €2 trillion of assets that need to be sold or run down on European banks’ balance sheets. \n“The UK started restructuring quite a long time ago, and now we’re seeing a renewed push to get things over and done with they are quite near the end of the process,” said PwC’s Richard Thompson. \n“Some European countries still have a way to go. We have seen the most activity in the UK, Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) and Spain. We talk about the Italian market being about to take off, but some European markets are further back in the cycle. The French banks have not been very active, for example.” \nThose continental European banks have also been slow to start selling non-core loans as they have only recently been pushed to do so by regulators. Stress tests in 2014 saw greater official scrutiny of their balance sheets, forcing banks to take a closer look at their books and decide what to sell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T03:52:25.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
