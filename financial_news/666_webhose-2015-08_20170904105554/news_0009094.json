Sure, he'd been hankering for a hog during our marriage. But a fun, expensive bike was not in our priorities, I said (and he agreed). Plus, motorcycles are dangerous, right? We had a baby. No matter, as soon as he was out the door, he bought the bike, even though -- like every other divorced person, ever -- we each had less money than when we were married. But here I was fighting for some child support he claimed he couldn't afford, and he bought a $#@$!$ motorcycle!After years of complaining about being broke, he finally sold the bike at a loss.[caption id=\"attachment_763\" align=\"\" width=\"1000\"] Why do men buy motorcycles after divorce?[/caption]Like most devastating life events, mine was far from novel, and just part of a sad old story. I recognized this sad old story when within the subsequent few years, several of my very closest girlfriends also got divorced, and their husbands also bought motorcycles they could not afford! Since none of these guys knew each other (ruling out any social influence), and I now have three solid examples in my very closest circle, that marks a clear trend, right?So what to make of it? Why do men buy motorcycles they can't afford when they divorce? One of my girlfriends, we'll call her Cory, learned her soon-to-be ex financed a $30,000 Harley Davidson (which he hid by parking it down the block) when the bank sent a statement to her address. His overspending and deceit was a long-time problem in their marriage, and the root of their split. She says:\"Even though he made six-figures and great benefits with a government job, he just overspent on everything -- and borrowed money from me, my parents, and our friends and paid only a tiny bit of child support, irregularly. When I learned about the motorcycle I was outraged -- especially since he didn't even have a car to transport his two kids!\"Cory's ex crashed the motorcycle three times, and after repairing it, three years later sold it at a loss. She pressed him about the purchase. \"I want to own a piece of Americana,\" Cory said he replied.Another good friend, \"Elaine,\" also sparred over money with her ex during marriage -- she says he lied about his income and spending and didn't pull his weight financially in the relationship. When Elaine moved across town, her ex protested, in part, because it would lengthen his work commute. He ultimately acquiesced, then bought one long-wanted motorcycle with the explanation that the bike would save gas money. He later bought a second motorcycle. \"Even though he was a great dad in so many ways, he was also selfish,\" Elaine says. Was. Her ex was killed in a motorcycle accident six months ago. He was 41.What is up with these guys? Why does divorce spur the purchase of motorcycles post-divorce? And motorcycles men can't afford?I called Harley Davidson. Spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim says the Milwaukee motorcycle giant doesn't keep data specific to marital status, though 62 percent of buyers are white men over the age of 35. Also, the company sees an influx of customers in their early- and mid-40s who had ridden motorcycles earlier in life, took a break while they had families, then revisit the pastime. \"Our purpose statement is 'To Fulfill Dreams of Personal Freedom. [tweet_Quote: display=\"&quot;When it comes to divorce, is there ever a better time for personal freedom?&quot; @harleydavidson via @forbes\"]When it comes to divorce, is there ever a better time for personal freedom?\" says Harley Davidson's Blaneknheim.[/tweet_Quote: ]\nK athryn Dickerson, a divorce attorney in Vienna, Va., points out the obvious when she says, \"P eople often buy things they cannot afford before and when they separate from their spouse. There are a number of personal and psychological reasons why people do this, but it ignores the simple fact that when people separate, they are able to afford less. There are now two households being supported by the same income. They may been barely able to afford the splurge while they were still together, but they certainly cannot do so apart.\" Keith Jacob, 47, bought a $4,000 Kawasaki 900cc road motorcycle when he separated from his wife in 2010. He also got a $1,500 Italian racing bicycle and became SCUBA certified. \"These were all things I wanted to do while I was married, but never felt I could,\" he says.Could he afford them?\"Depends on who you ask,\" says the St. Louis owner of a staffing agency. \"Throughout our marriage money was a problem -- we could never go on vacation because my ex didn't think we could afford it. We couldn't buy a bigger house because she didn't think we could afford it. And we couldn't afford a motorcycle, she said. She was also deathly afraid of them.\"That is what she said. What does Jacob say? \"I do very well for myself. I put five kids through private schools and college. I live comfortably within my means, and my ex lives very well,\" says Jacob, who then told me he was tempted to forward my Forbes posts urging women stop taking alimony.Jacob seized on his newfound freedom to buy a motorcycle, just like Harley Davidson advocates. However, he has dated five or six women since his divorce, and only one was interested in riding -- something he found \"disappointing, though not a deal-breaker.\"As much as I resented my ex's motorcycle, cursing him under my breath whenever I saw him riding it, a couple summers ago I dated a man who owns a Harley, which he seemed to be able to afford very comfortably. That, combined with the fact he had a fantastic body against which I grabbed on to while he rode me around was the highlight of my summer.Both Cory and Elaine attribute their ex's purchases to the same compulsion for freedom. Says Cory: [tweet_Quote: display=\"&quot;Men buying motorcycles after divorce is like women getting our vaginas waxed. Only waxing is cheaper.&quot; via @forbes\"]\"Maybe men buying motorcycles after divorce is like women getting pedicures and our vaginas waxed -- only waxing and nails are cheaper.\"[/tweet_Quote: ] Adds Elaine: \"It's their way of asserting their independence and rebelling. Soaring through the air on a motorcycle is an incredible feeling. And now that they are divorced, it's like, 'You can't tell me what to do anymore! Life is too short and I'm going to enjoy myself no matter how impractical you think this decision is! Besides, I look cool and chicks dig motorcycles.' In a sense, they are right. Life is too short. But buying a motorcycle is a good way to shorten it even more.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T23:32:38.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
