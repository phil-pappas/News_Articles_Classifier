Eighteen MPs abstained. \nWithin Angela Merkel's ruling Christian CDU-CSU coalition, 228 MPs voted in favour of the deal, with 63 voting against and three abstentions. In an earlier vote in July, 60 coalition MPs voted \"no\" to new aid for Greece. \nWolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, told policymakers in the Bundestag that a deal was in the \"interest of Europe\", and while his backing for a third bail-out deal was \"not easy\" and there was \"no guarantee of success\", denying Greece more aid would be \"irresponsible\". \n\"If Greece stands by its obligations and the programme is completely and resolutely implemented, then the Greek economy can grow again,\" he said. \"The opportunity is there. Whether it will be used, only the Greeks can decide.\" \nA Dutch backlash against a third deal was led by right-wing politician Geert Wilders, who has called for the Netherlands to withdraw from the European Union. \n\"Today we are here to prevent Dutch PM Rutte from indulging in his favorite hobby: sending money to Greece, this time €5bn,\" Mr Wilders told the Dutch parliament on Wednesday. \nMr Wilders said Mr Rutte had reneged on a pledge in September 2012 that \"enough is enough\" and that Greece would get no more financial help from the country. \n\"He's the Pinocchio of the low countries. This is betrayal,\" said Mr Wilders. \"We need this money to support health care and the elderly. This government hates the elderly.\" \nThe leader of the Freedom party said he was demanding the confidence motion because Mr Rutte's coalition of Liberals and the Labour Party had left vulnerable pensioners \"out in the cold”, while spending money on Greece and asylum seekers. \n“Millions of Dutch agree with me and have had enough of this prime minister,” he told Bloomberg. \nMr Schaeuble, who has previously called for Greece to leave the eurozone temporarily , said he was asking for approval from German MPs with \"full conviction\". \nHe described the involvement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a third deal as \"indispensable\" and said he had no doubt the Fund would join if all conditions were met. \nThe IMF has said it will refuse to participate in a new rescue programme unless there is an “explicit and concrete agreement” on debt relief from the country’s creditors. Mr Schaeuble said on Wednesday that there was \"limited\" scope to cut Greece's debt burden. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) came as the chief editor of Bild, Germany's most popular newspaper, argued that the third rescue package for Greece was \"terribly wrong\". \n\"This policy is not bringing salvation, not for Greece, not for the euro and above all not for Europe. Quite the opposite: it is damaging the European concept because it is dividing Europe rather than uniting it…Whoever invokes Helmut Kohl when backing this policy in today’s Bundestag vote has failed to understand Europe’s honorary citizen,” Kai Diekmann wrote in an editorial. \nMr Wilders' objection to the Netherlands' participation in the rescue deal is likely to be symbolic. The ruling coalition party has 76 seats in the 150-member lower house. The Freedom Party has 12 MPs. \nThe cabinet, which includes Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup, does not need parliament's approval to push the deal through. The Netherlands is expected to contribute almost €5bn the Greece's latest rescue package.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:19:13.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
