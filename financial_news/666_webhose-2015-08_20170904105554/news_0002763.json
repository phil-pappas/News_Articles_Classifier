His predecessor, Stephen, now Lord, Green, worked 28 years for the bank before leaving to become trade minister in the last Parliament. Its top two posts are currently filled by Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, who has spent 35 years at the bank, and Douglas Flint, chairman, a relative new boy having racked up just 20 years of service. \nBeyond the Asian-focused bank, one need only look at outgoing Standard Life chief executive David Nish’s comment earlier this week that he would mark his handover to Keith Skeoch at midnight on Wednesday “asleep, secure in the knowledge that the business is in safe hands” , to see how that mantra plays out. Nish, who the vast majority of Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) shareholders would say has done a good job at the life insurer, was not underplaying his role, merely pointing out that it is time to pass the baton. \nIn some ways he is right. Standard Life can trace its roots back to 1825, when it sold life insurance policies across the Empire (Stockholm: EMP-B.ST - news ) and beyond, from Ireland to India, from Canada to Shanghai. Its history is long and varied, but as a listed entity it is one of the youngest in the FTSE 100 having gone public in 2006. \nThe insurer’s shares rose approximately 70pc under Nish’s five-year tenure, and although he was responsible for major strategic achievements, not least the company’s surprise £2.2bn deal to sell off its Canadian business in September 2014, ending Standard Life’s 180-year-old ties to the country, the company is similar in form to that which he inherited in January 2010. \nIt could be argued that given the long-term nature of life insurance, the stewardship mantra is perhaps more relevant there. \nBut if Standard Life is the case study that fits that particular rule, there are many other companies the vast majority I would argue where success is far more linked to an individual chief executive than a succession of them. \nAnother Standard, Standard Chartered , is a case in point. Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) ’s new chief executive, Bill Winters, is, I would argue, the type of chief executive who will be instrumental to the company’s long-term future, way beyond his tenure. \nClearly his early strategic decisions such as his announcement on Wednesday that the dividend will be halved will be closely watched, and to date, investors seem to like what they see. \nBut I would argue Winters will make a difference because he brings three core skills, skills that not every leader has. \nOne is vision. He knows what he wants to do, and he will execute it accordingly. One of the benefits of being out of the public sphere for some time Winters previously ran privately-held Renishaw Bay is that he did not have to worry about external shareholders and stakeholders. That meant he could execute his plans, and do so successfully. He will repeat this at the Asian-focused bank. \nTwo: reputation. Winters is a bankers’ banker. Although he took the top job at Standard Chartered, he has been linked to every senior banking job that has come up since the end of the financial crisis. His time on the Independent Commission on Banking has given him a strong insight into what went wrong systemically and how to make sure it doesn’t happen again not to mention respect among regulators globally. \nThe third skill, which should not be overlooked, is charisma. Staff, particularly those at companies that have gone through a troubled time, are looking for leadership. A charismatic leadership can make all the difference between staff believing in a new strategy and choosing to jump ship. \nIf you’re not convinced by this argument in relation to Winters and it is early days look at Prudential (HKSE: 2378.HK - news ) under Tidjane Thiam. Thiam, who led the insurer from 2008 until earlier this year, was different. Not just because of his accent (French), or his place of birth (Ivory Coast), or his towering height (6ft 4in), but because of his experience. He’s not a normal chief executive. \nHis background in government and involvement in infrastructure investment through the world bank meant that he looked at business through a different lens. His curriculum vitae containing the names of McKinsey and Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) prior to the Pru (HKSE: 2378-OL.HK - news ) might look standard, but his outlook is far from standard. That’s why he was successful at the insurer, and why he was chosen to be the new chief executive of Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) among a strong field of career bankers. \nNigel Wilson at Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) is the same. He might be chief executive of a major life insurer, but he looks at the world in a different way, from a macro-economic perspective, and the business is all the better for it. It is men like Winters, Thiam and Wilson (Oslo: WILS.OL - news ) who are the antithesis of the stewardship mantra. \nLeaders lead and often change tack stewards simply keep a company on the same path. \nFor all the debates around the cult of the chief executive, it is worth remembering when investors look at which companies to back or bet against it is often just as important to follow the leader as it is to understand the business. \njames.quinn@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T01:02:14.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
