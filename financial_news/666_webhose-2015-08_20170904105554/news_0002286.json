Citigroup has already been picked by Drydocks as its adviser, the sources said. \nThe sources declined to be named because the matter is not public. Moelis, Citigroup and Drydocks all declined to comment. \nDrydocks is the latest United Arab Emirates company seeking to take advantage of low interest rates and a generally healthier economic backdrop to renegotiate a debt restructuring agreed after the 2009 financial crisis. Dubai World earlier this year revised the terms of $14.6 billion of debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:09:12.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
