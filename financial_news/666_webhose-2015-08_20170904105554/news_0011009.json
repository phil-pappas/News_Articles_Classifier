The currency snapped a four-day losing streak that brought prices to a two-month low after clearing support guiding the near-term uptrend from mid-May swing lows. Confirmation of a reversal is absent for now. Prices would need to overturn the series of lower highs and lower lows established from the August 7 high on a daily closing basis to reinforce the likelihood that a bottom is indeed in place. In the interim, the path of least resistance continues to favor weakness in the near term (although as noted previously, the longer-term tendency aims upward ). Near-term resistance is currently at 11892, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion. A break and close above this barrier initially exposes the 38.2% level at 11956 as the next hurdle for upside momentum. Alternatively, a turn below the August 24 low at 11789 clears a path to challenge the June 18 bottom at 11732.
