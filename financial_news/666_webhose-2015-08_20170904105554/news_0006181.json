On average prices have continued to decline month on month and the increasing unemployment levels are only going to add pressure on aggregate demand which will inevitably add to the deflationary pressures in the near term. \nThe year on year food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation remained negative at -3,65 percent from -3,32 percent recorded in June. The current trend in food inflation puts a squeeze on retailers operating margins and as such performance in the sector is expected to continue showing signs of weakness. The non-food inflation rate was -2,35 percent. \nThe month on month inflation rate for July was 0,06 percent gaining 0,20 percentage points on the June inflation rate of -0,14 percent. \nThe month on month Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages inflation stood at 0,81 percent in July, shedding 0,36 percentage points on the June rate of -0,45 percent. The month on month non-food inflation stood at 0.47 percent, gaining 0,46 percentage points on the June rate of 0,01 percent. \nThe CPI for the month ending July stood at 97,95 compared to 97,90 in June 2015 and 100,74 in July 2014.FinX More on This \nLocal Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere has stopped Harare City Council from … see more » Previous Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:22:33.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
