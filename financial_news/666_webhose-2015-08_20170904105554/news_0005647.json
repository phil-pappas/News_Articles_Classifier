Osman Orsal Share on twitter by Karen Maley It's enough to test the patience of even the most fervent gold bull.\nAfter climbing to a three-week high as traders worried that China's surprise move to devalue the yuan could spark retaliatory action from competitors, the precious metal slid 0.7 per cent to close at $US1,115.60 a troy ounce in New York trading overnight.\nGold's reversal comes as China's central bank reassured jittery markets that it does not want its currency to collapse , and as retail figures released overnight showed that US consumers are continuing to spend. At the same time, a report from the World Gold Council, drew attention to the world's diminishing appetite for the precious metal.\nAccording to the report from the industry body, global demand for gold plunged 12 per cent in the second quarter to its lowest level in six years on waning demand from the world's two largest buyers – China and India – who together account for about half of global gold consumption.\nAs a result, global demand precious metal to drop to 914.9 tonnes between March and June this year, down from 1,038 tonnes in the same period in 2014.\nLosing its shine The gold price has been under pressure since it hit its $US1,920 peak September 2011 as it has become increasingly clear that there is little risk of an outbreak of inflation, despite the aggressive money-printing by the world's major central banks.\nGold's woes have intensified this year as investors worry that the US central bank's looming interest rate hike will further dim the allure of gold, an asset which doesn't pay any interest. The rising US dollar has also weighed on gold, which is priced in US dollars, because it makes the precious metal more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.\n The vertiginous rise in the Chinese share market also played a role, with many Chinese investors preferring to gamble on the Shanghai share market, rather than pour their surplus savings into gold. Total gold consumption in China fell by 3 per cent in the second quarter.\nAt the same time, Indian demand fell as difficult weather conditions caused rural incomes to shrink.\nJewellery demand – which makes up about 60 per cent of global gold consumption – fell by 25 per cent in India and 5 per cent in China, according to the report.\nChina overtakes Russia in gold holdings And central banks have failed to fill the gap in demand. According to the report, central bank purchases of gold fell 13 per cent from a year earlier in the second quarter to 137.4 tonnes.\nLast month, the gold price fell to a five-year low after China's central bank revealed that its gold reserves stood at 1,658 tonnes at the end of June, up around 60 per cent since 2009. But even though China has overtaken Russia to become the world's fifth largest holder of gold, investors were disappointed because they expected China's bullion reserves to be even higher.\nBut that does not mean that all is lost for the gold bulls. As the World Council report noted, the lower gold price will eventually cause high-cost gold producers to shutter their operations, which should see some levelling out in gold production over the next year. This process appears to be underway already, with global gold supply falling 5 per cent in the three months between March and June this year from a year earlier.\nAnd although gold has forfeited some of its status as a safe haven, investors still turn to the precious metal during times of financial stress.\nEuropean investors boosted their holdings of gold during the last month's Greek bailout crisis, although this was not enough to boost its price. And gold could again find itself in favour as the shock wave unleashed by Tuesday's Chinese currency devaluation continues to reverberate through global markets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-08-14T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:09:12.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
