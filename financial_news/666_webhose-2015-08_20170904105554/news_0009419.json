The rupee depreciated 15 paise to 65.15 against the US dollar in early trade today at the Interbank Foreign Exchange due to appreciation of the American currency overseas. Dealers attributed the rupee's fall to increased demand for the US currency from importers and a weak trend in the domestic equity market in early trade. The rupee had recovered 10 paise to close at 65 against the US dollar in Friday's trade on fresh selling of greenback by banks and exporters on hopes of resumption of foreign capital inflows into equity markets. Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex plunged 328.18 points, or 1.16% to 27,739.13 in early trade today.
