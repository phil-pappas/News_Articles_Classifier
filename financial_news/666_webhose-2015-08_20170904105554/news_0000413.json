Ryan Stuart Share on twitter by Tess Ingram OceanaGold Corporation and Metals X have flagged an interest in striking more deals, despite both growth-hungry gold miners only announcing merger and acquisition activity last week.\nOn Thursday, Oceana lobbed a $C856 million ($884.86 million) takeover offer to Toronto-listed Romarco Minerals , which has been regarded by analysts as a positive step in the company's strategy to become the world's lowest-cost gold producer, albeit it at a reasonable premium.\nOn Friday, Metals X said it has agreed to pick up RNI's Grosvenor gold project and Panoramic Resources' Mount Henry project. The miner is also fighting with Tanami Gold for a right to acquire its Central Tanami project after the Northern Territory gold miner signed the mine away to Northern Star Resources. Metals X claims it was in there first and recently filed a legal claim against Tanami Gold.\nOceana chief executive Mick Wilkes said although the miner's plate was full after the Romarco acquisition – which will deliver it the high-grade Haile mine Romarco is developing in South Carolina and the Waihi, New Zealand, gold mine it recently picked up from Newmont – Oceana was still looking for good opportunities.\n\"You have to stay at the dance and engage with opportunities as they come up,\" he said on the sidelines of the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie. \"Our focus remains on going where the gold is, and quality assets, so low-cost, long-life quality assets.\"\nDefending the full price tag on the deal, Mr Wilkes said he thought the company had paid \"a fair price for what we see as the production potential of this asset in a Tier-1 jurisdiction that has a low cost and long mine life, and that's what investors want.\"\nMr Wilkes said Oceana had \"looked at a lot of projects and kissed a lot of frogs\", including in Australia, where it expects to continue to keep an eye out for deals as majors divest unwanted assets and juniors come under pressure.\nMetals X on hunt for distressed assets Metals X's Mr Cook said the miner was on the hunt for more distressed assets as a lot more companies become \"strangled\" by the high levels of debt they took on during the boom.\n\"There's a lot of people suffering a lot of stress out there,\" he said. \"When the market caps of some of the juniors are very low, [it is] the time to make a corporate takeover.\"\nBut Mr Cook bemoaned the fact the cost of a corporate takeover was \"excessive for juniors\" and the administrative requirements a burden.\n\"If I wanted to take over BHP it would cost me the same as it would to take over a $2 million market cap company,\" he said. \"There's a bit of a disconnect there.I've got five companies I'd like to have a crack at … but as soon as I do one I am paralysed for six months from doing anything else.\"\nOceana's bid for Romarco comes barely three months after OceanaGold paid $US101 million ($138 million) to buy Newmont's Waihi mine , and two months after it spent about $17 million buying a 14.9 per cent stake in Nevada-focused explorer Gold Standard Ventures.\nThe likely continuation of M&A activity in the gold space was a strong theme at the conference, with miners, including acquisitive producers Northern Star Resources and Evolution Mining, reaffirming their interest in striking more deals.\nPanoramic Resources boss Peter Harold told the conference the gold miner will sell its Gidgee project, while Gold Fields is understood to be reviewing the future of its Darlot operations.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TessIngram"], "published": "2015-08-05T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:12:08.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
