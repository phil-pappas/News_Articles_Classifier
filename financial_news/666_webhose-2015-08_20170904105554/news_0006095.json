Photo: Bloomberg\nChina's central bank injected the most funds in open-market operations since February as intervention to prop up the yuan strained the supply of cash and drove a key money-market rate to a four-month high.\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC) pumped a net 150 billion yuan ($32 billion) into the financial system this week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's the most since before the Chinese New Year holiday, when seasonal demand for cash spikes. The authorities are providing another 170 billion yuan through loans and an auction of deposits.\nThe injections come after China surprised investors by devaluing the yuan last week and shifting to a more market-oriented exchange rate. Under the new system, PBOC intervention has partly replaced the daily reference rate's role in guiding currency moves. Yuan purchases risk driving borrowing costs higher at a time of slowing economic growth unless the monetary authority releases additional cash.\n\"Front-end rates have been edging up, likely resulting from tighter liquidity conditions amid intervention,\" said Frances Cheung, head of Asia ex-Japan rates strategy at Societe Generale SA in Hong Kong. \"The PBOC needs to step up its open- market operations to offset the liquidity withdrawal on the foreign-exchange side.\"\nAdvertisement Authorities have to walk a thin line between boosting exports and satisfying the International Monetary Fund's requirements for the yuan to obtain reserve status, while at the same time ensuring financial stability.\nThe overnight repurchase rate, a gauge of liquidity in the banking system, rose three basis points to 1.80 per cent as of 1pm in Shanghai, according to a weighted average from the National Interbank Funding Centre. That's the highest since April 23 and reflects increased demand for cash.\nYuan intervention The yuan fell 3 per cent in three days last week after the PBOC cut its daily reference rate by 1.9 per cent on August 11. In the following sessions, the onshore spot price in Shanghai followed a pattern of rallies toward the close, sparking speculation the authorities were intervening.\n\"After two days of adjustment, accumulative depreciation pressure of 3 per cent has already released,\" PBOC assistant governor Zhang Xiaohui said at an August 13 press conference. \"The difference between the yuan's fixing and spot has been corrected.\"\nIntervention will result in a drop of $US40 billion a month in China's foreign-exchange reserves for the rest of this year, according to the median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\nIMF delays On the day of the initial devaluation, the PBOC said that market makers who submit contributing prices for the yuan's daily fixing must now consider the previous day's close, foreign-exchange demand and supply, as well as changes in major currency rates. The fixing limits onshore moves to a maximum 2 per cent on either side.\nThe IMF, which has welcomed the bigger role for market forces, said Wednesday that it is delaying the expansion of the reserves basket to September 2016. IMF staff had in July recommended the extension to minimise disruption if the agency decides to add the yuan at a review in November this year.\nThe yuan reversed an earlier decline to rise 0.09 per cent to 6.3899 per dollar in Shanghai on Thursday, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices. The PBOC's fixing was strengthened 0.08 per cent to 6.3915. In Hong Kong's offshore market, the freely-traded yuan climbed 0.02 per cent to 6.4400.\nCash injections The PBOC auctioned 120 billion yuan of seven-day reverse-repurchase agreements on Thursday, the same as Tuesday, as 90 billion yuan of the contracts matured this week. It will auction another 60 billion yuan of three-month deposits on behalf of the Ministry of Finance on August 25, according to a statement on the ministry's website. The authority provided 110 billion yuan of six-month loans to 14 financial institutions Wednesday via its Medium-term Lending Facility with an interest rate of 3.35 per cent.\nThe cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed payment to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose two basis points to 2.59 per cent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The PBOC will have to cut banks' reserve-requirement ratios by a total of 100 basis points by year-end if it wants to keep the rate at around 2.5 per cent, said SocGen's Cheung.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:32:30.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
