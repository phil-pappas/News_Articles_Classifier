Photo: Reuters\nUS stocks rose for the first time in four days, amid better-than-estimated earnings from technology companies while services-industry data indicated the economy is on track for faster growth.\nCognizant Technology Solutions and First Solar jumped at least 6.4 per cent after their profits exceeded analysts' forecasts. Priceline Group added 5.2 per cent as its earnings topped estimates. Apple climbed for the first time in six sessions. Walt Disney slid 9.2 per cent after its quarterly sales missed projections, and energy companies erased earlier gains along with oil.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.3 per cent to 2099.84. at 4pm in New York, after slipping 0.7 per cent over the previous three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 10.22 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 17,540.47, under Disney's 75-point drag. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.7 per cent. About 7.2 billion shares traded hands on US exchanges, 11 per cent above the three-month average.\n\"The market has been under a little bit of pressure looking for a reason to go back up,\" said John Manley, who helps oversee about $US233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. \"The market's moving in the right direction. A slow, steady recovery is probably a good thing. The single most important factor affecting stock markets is what the Fed is doing.\"\nInvestors are watching economic reports to gauge when the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates, a decision it has forecast for this year. Data today showed service providers from restaurants to real estate agencies expanded in July at the strongest pace in a decade, putting the US economy on track for faster growth. The share of services companies boosting employment was the highest since records began in 1997.\nA separate report Wednesday from ADP Research Institute said companies added fewer workers than expected to payrolls in July, casting doubt on whether labor-market gains can accelerate beyond this year's current pace. The government's monthly job report on Friday is projected to show employers took on 225,000 workers last month, while the jobless rate held at a seven-year low of 5.3 per cent.\nFed governor Jerome Powell said there is more labour-market slack in the economy than the jobless rate indicates, during an interview on CNBC. He also said financial assets aren't in bubble territory, and reiterated that a shallow path for rate increases would be appropriate.\n\"We're in a summer lull, having to digest the Fed apparently getting close to making its own moves, and it's going to be easy with short-term sentiment to move this market around,\" said Steve Bombardiere, an equity trader at Conifer Securities in New York. \"What you'd really like to see is the Fed saying the economy is strong and we're going to raise rates but you're not seeing that.\"\nInvestors are also weighing corporate earnings for hints on the economy's health. Four out of five S&P 500 members have reported results this season, with about three-quarters beating profit estimates and half topping sales projections. Analysts now call for a 2.8 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings, shallower than July 10 estimates for a 6.4 per cent fall.\nEquities pared earlier gains as energy companies declined and raw-material shares trimmed their advance. Chesapeake Energy tumbled 12 per cent following a 4.5 per cent jump today. Oil fell to a four-month low, after rallying 2 per cent, amid signs of ample crude stockpiles. Miner Freeport-McMoRan lost 1 per cent, reversing a 7.5 per cent climb that came amid its plan to cut back on oil and gas investments.\n\"Commodities, mostly oil, have turned around from being up earlier today,\" said Mark Kepner, an equity trader at Chatham, New Jersey-based Themis Trading. \"The combination of some of the growth issues out of China and the strength of the dollar as we're getting closer to a rate hike has been causing this overall weakness in commodities.\"\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell 3.8 per cent Wednesday to 12.51. The gauge, known as the VIX, in July posted its biggest monthly drop since February, down more than 33 per cent.\nSeven of the S&P 500's 10 main industries advanced today, with technology and consumer-staples shares rising the most, while energy and consumer-discretionary companies retreated.\nGains in First Solar and Cognizant led the strongest rise in the tech group in almost three weeks. First Solar jumped the most since March 2014, while Cognizant had its best increase since November. Motorola Solutions advanced 6.3 per cent to a four-month high after quarterly profit topped estimates, and the communications-equipment maker is receiving a $US1 billion investment from private-equity firm Silver Lake.\nActivision Blizzard soared 12 per cent to a record as sales and profit beat analysts' estimates on the strength of video-game franchises such as Call of Duty and Skylanders.\nFellow video-game maker Electronic Arts added 4.7 per cent, also to an all-time high. Sony, EA and Microsoft predict the releases of potential blockbusters such as Star Wars Battlefront, Halo 5 and FIFA 2016 will fuel holiday sales of games and consoles.\nH&R Block rose the most since March 2013 after receiving regulatory approval to sell its bank unit BofI Federal Bank, a deal that would end Federal Reserve oversight and capital restrictions. The shares surged 8.9 per cent to a record.\nWal-Mart Stores's 2.4 per cent increase, the biggest since January, paced a rise among consumer staples. Mondelez International, Kellogg and PepsiCo each gained at least 1.4 per cent.Walt Disney weighed on the consumer discretionary group, as well as other media companies, falling the most in more than six years after posting quarterly sales that fell short of analysts' estimates and cutting its forecast for cable-TV profit.\nTime-Warner slid 9 per cent, the most in a year, as the media company kept its full-year profit forecast unchanged after earnings topped analysts' estimates by a wide margin last quarter. The Bloomberg US Media Index lost 5 per cent, its biggest drop in four years.\nGenworth Financial tumbled after the insurer that has been selling units to rebuild capital said it will probably not get rid of its entire life and annuity operation. Shares dropped 20 per cent, the most since November and extended the decline for the year to 34 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:39:36.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
