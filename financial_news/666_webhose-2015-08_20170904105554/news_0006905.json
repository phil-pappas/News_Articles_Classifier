Women's birth control choice depends on relationship, sex A woman’s weight at birth, education level and marital status before pregnancy can have repercussions for two generations, putting her daughters and granddaughters at higher risk of low birth weight, a new study has claimed.\nThe findings by Jennifer B Kane, assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine are the first to tie social and biological factors together using population data in determining causes for low birth weight.\n“We know that low-birth-weight babies are more susceptible to later physical and cognitive difficulties and that these difficulties can sharpen the social divide in the US.\n“But knowing more about what causes low birth weight can help alleviate the intergenerational perpetuation of social inequality through poor infant health,” said Kane, formerly a postdoctoral scholar at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where the research was conducted.\nIn total, Kane looked at 1,580 mother-daughter pairs, focusing on their weight at birth, marital status and education level.\n“The odds of having a low-birth-weight baby were one and a half to two times greater for mothers who themselves were born low birth weight compared to mothers who were not born low birth weight,” she said.\n“But also important are social factors, including education and marital status. Putting all of these factors u2013 both intergenerational and intragenerational u2013 together in a single model can tell us even more,” said Kane.\nFor example, education level pre-pregnancy can be transmitted from mothers to daughters across at least three generations, and this intergenerational transmission appears to affect birth weight of future generations, Kane said.\n“And knowing that biological factors perpetuate the cycle u2013 being a low-birth-weight baby makes a woman more susceptible to delivering the same u2013 we start to see that we can’t look at these two factors separately,” she said.\nThis means that causes of low birth weight extend much further back than the time frame that’s typically focused on: pregnancy.\nKane’s work shows that key factors can be traced to the mother’s own early life experiences, in addition to factors dating back multiple generations.\n“This really makes a difference in how we think about planning future population-level policies or programs that intend to reduce social inequalities in birth weight,” she added.\nThe study was published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour.\n 18, 2015 3:33 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:39:45.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
