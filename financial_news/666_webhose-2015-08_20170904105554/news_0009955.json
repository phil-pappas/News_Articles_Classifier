Of those, 54pc said they are not ready to make a decision yet, while 34pc are keeping their pensions invested and spending other assets like cash savings before they need to access the long-term pots. \nA further 18pc are worried that if they do draw funds down from the pension pot, they could run out of money . \n“Most of those keeping their pensions intact aren’t ready to make a decision or are spending other savings first. Far from rushing to cash in their pots, many Britons seem prepared to use their pensions as they were intended - to provide an income through retirement,” said Zurich UK Life’s chief executive Gary Shaughnessy. \nHowever, he also said that excessive caution could lead to some savers missing out, if they fail to consider their options fully. \n“Almost 70pc of over-55s have yet to explore how they could benefit from the reforms. By engaging early with the new freedoms, savers can make more informed decisions on their retirement.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T08:13:41.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
