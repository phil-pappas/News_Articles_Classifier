Thus, a manufacturing undertaking or enterprise set up in any of these areas during the aforesaid period will be eligible for 35 per cent (instead of 20 per cent) of additional depreciation. This would be over and above the normal depreciation of 15 per cent,” the CBDT notification said.\nIt added that besides this, a company engaged in manufacturing will also be eligible for 30 per cent (instead of 15 per cent) of investment allowance if its investment in new plant and machinery during the period April, 2015 to March, 2017 exceeds Rs 25 crore.\nThe said section 32AD was first “inserted” in the I-T Act in the Finance Bill, 2015 in order to provide incentive and economic boost to the newly bifurcated states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\nAlready in a major pre-poll sop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had yesterday announced a Rs 1.25 lakh crore package, promising the state will touch new heights of development if the BJP is voted to power.\nBihar is slated to go to polls in September-October this year.\n 19, 2015 7:51 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T18:49:28.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
