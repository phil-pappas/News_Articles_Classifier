The first oil is expected to flow in 2019. The pipeline is a critical success factor of Lapsset, which will open 70 per cent of Kenya's landmass to economic development,\" he said. \nProject components include the Lamu port, a standard gauge railway, roads, refined products pipeline, airports, resort cities and a crude oil refinery in Lamu.
