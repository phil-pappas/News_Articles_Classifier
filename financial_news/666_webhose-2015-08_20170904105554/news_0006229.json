However, they wiped off some of their days’ gain in the second half of the day.\nAt 1.46 pm, Jaypee Infratech and DLF were trading 5.51 per cent and 0.20 per cent higher at Rs 15.52 and Rs 128.40, respectively.\nAs many as 55,000 home buyers will benefit immediately from the government’s move to reduce the area of the eco- sensitive zone (ESZ) around the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, leading real estate developers said yesterday.\nThe Union Environment Ministry’s notification last year, which was cleared yesterday, said that the ESZ will be the area up to 100 metre from the Eastern, Western and Southern boundary and up to 1.27 kilometres from the northern boundary of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary.\nThe ministry will come out with a final notification within a week, thus bringing in a huge potential relief to home buyers in and around the area.\nOnce the notification is issued, the government will allow home buyers outside the ESZ to get occupancy certificates of their flats, which had been pending for quite some time as the NGT had passed an order barring development of any infrastructure within 10-km radius from the sanctuary’s boundary.\nHousing projects of various developers, including Jaypee Green, DLF, ATS, 3C Developers and Supertech were affected due to order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which restrained the authorities from issuing Completion Certificate to the projects which are located within 10 km radius of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary or within the eco-sensitive zone.\nJaypee Infratech closed 5.30 per cent higher at Rs 15.49 on the BSE. DLF fell 1.02 per cent at Rs 126.70.\n 19, 2015 1:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:36:55.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
