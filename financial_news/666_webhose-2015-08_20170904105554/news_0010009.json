It will just cause further collapse in the stock markets,” said Lee at Phillip Futures.\nGold is holding above $1,100 support as U.S. rate hike expectations this year slowly shift to December from next month, said Lee. When those expectations were tilted towards September, bullion was closer to $1,000, he said.\nThe precious metal is still up nearly 5 percent from a 5-1/2-year low of $1,077 reached in July, but has given up more than 3 percent since touching a seven-week top of $1,168.40 last week.\n“Turmoil across global markets did little to bring people back to gold as investors ignored the metal’s haven appeal and focused on the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates,” ANZ Bank said in a note.\nInvestors will be eyeing key U.S. data tonight for more clues on the rate hike timing, including a second estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product and weekly jobless claims.\nA Reuters poll showed that U.S. second-quarter GDP growth would be revised up to 3.2 percent from the 2.3 percent advance estimate last month.\nOther precious metals rebounded from this week’s slide. Spot palladium rose 1.1 percent to $538.50 an ounce after falling to a near five-year low of $518 and platinum climbed 1.3 percent to $990. Silver gained 0.6 percent to $14.19.\n 27, 2015 9:42 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:11:26.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
