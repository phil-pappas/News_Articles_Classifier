Andrew Taylor Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Geoff Winestock An expert on climate negotiations has criticised Professor Warwick McKibbin's claim that Australia's pledge at the Paris climate talks represents a \"large contribution\", arguing the economic modeller's methodology won't be credible with the rest of the world.\nANU's Professor McKibbin claimed in an article in The Australian Financial Review that Australia's climate pledges for the Paris talks in December were \"at the top end\" because they would cause us more economic pain even though all other rich countries are cutting emissions more deeply than us over the same period.\nBut Climate Institute deputy CEO Erwin Jackson said it would be a hard argument to sell at international climate change debates in the coming decade.\n\"It's not seen as a credible way to compare countries internationally,\" Mr Jackson said.\nBernie Fraser, chairman of the Climate Change Authority, has pointed out that Australia's pledge to cut emissions to 26 percent below 2005 emissions is a smaller absolute reduction than all other developed countries except Japan. Josh Robenstone Professor McKibbin based his argument on his economic modelling for the federal government of what the economic cost of climate policies would be for different countries relative to a business-as-usual scenario.\nBut Mr Jackson said other countries would point out that his was just one model and was not transparent. \"It's based on a black box that no one can unpick,\" Mr Jackson said.\nNo special treatment for Australia Mr Jackson said that even if Australia had a credible estimate of economic costs, other countries would not accept the argument that Australia should receive special treatment because of its current high per capita emissions.\n \"The method proposed by Professor McKibbin benefits laggards. Other countries will say they have taken action and will ask why they should be penalised.\"\nBernie Fraser, chairman of the Climate Change Authority, has pointed out that Australia's pledge to cut emissions to 26 per cent below 2005 emissions is a smaller absolute reduction than all other developed countries except Japan.\nBut Professor McKibbin's modelling says that because Australia is so dependent on carbon-intensive fossil fuels its more modest pledge will reduce gross domestic product in 2030 by 0.2 to 0.3 per cent, which is more than other developed countries and the same as China.\nMr Jackson said Australia was unlikely to face much criticism at Paris because the major countries had a de facto \"non aggression pact\" to make sure the conference on emissions cuts after 2020 was a success.\nBut the Paris talks will likely establish a review mechanism for the next decade and Australia's weak target would come under criticism there.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/GeoffWinestock", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108137886892627412852"], "published": "2015-08-31T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:56:52.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
