According to the Commerce Department, housing starts climbed 0.2% last month to 1.21m, the highest rate since October 2007, and above the 1.19m analysts had estimated. \nIn response the yield on the US 10-year benchmark bond rose one basis point to 2.18%. Prices fall as yields rise. A stronger US dollar and sliding commodities prices have also pushed bond prices lower of late. \nIn the UK, gilts also fell as inflation turned positive in July with a reading of 0.1%. The Consumer Prices Index had been flat for almost six months and was negative in April. \nThe 10 year gilt yield was up six basis points to 1.87%. Investors are now looking at when the Bank of England will raise interest rates, but there is no certainty that consumer spending will underpin a longer term inflationary rise. \nIn particular, analysts are watching the continuing slump in oil prices, which will lead to cheaper energy for consumers. The slowdown in China, along with that country's devaluation of the yuan are also causing deflationary concerns. \nGerman bunds were unchanged, with the yield on the 10 year bund stable at 0.62%. Prices rose in Greece, with the 10 year yield down two basis points to 8.7% as the country awaits EU approval of the latest bailout. \nFrench and Italian benchmark yields were steady at 0.94% and 1.76% respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:55:53.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
