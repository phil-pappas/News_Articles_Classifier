Operating revenue rose six per cent to $NZ4.93 billion. \nThe airline's net profit after tax was $NZ327m - an increase of 24 per cent from $NZ263m a year earlier. \n\"Our strategic initiatives over the past three years have positioned us well to take advantage of market dynamics which have contributed to these results,\" said chairman Tony Carter. \nOver the last year, Air NZ has increased both passenger numbers and capacity and has been boosted by cheap fuel prices. \n\"Lower fuel prices and current sales momentum have strengthened the company's outlook, and this has seen the delivery of a record annual result that our shareholders and staff can be immensely proud of,\" Mr Carter said. \nIt will pay a bonus of up to $NZ1400 to 8,000 staff not on other incentive schemes on the back of the result. \nIt will pay a fully imputed ordinary dividend of 9.5 cents per share taking the full-year dividend to NZ16 cents per share. \nLast week, its major rival, Jetstar Group, reported its first-ever profit in New Zealand, carried by the same favourable conditions. \nAir New Zealand has had a stranglehold on the domestic regional market for years and earlier this month cut fares on most routes ahead of Jetstar's announcement next month of which regional destinations it will fly to from December. \nThe airline has said it will not be undercut on prices on the regional routes but analysts expect that will cut millions of dollars from its underlying earnings in the 2016 financial year. \nThe airline's shares last traded at $NZ2.65 and have risen 35 per cent in the past year. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Finance News Update, what you need to know AAP \nWORLD FINANCE UPDATE: The Australian dollar has slumped after China cut its interest rates to curb two days of …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:45:34.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
