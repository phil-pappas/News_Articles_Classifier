Andrew Meares The meeting ended with no clear consensus on tax reform. .\nThe federal government continued to insist any GST increase must be accompanied by income tax cuts to combat bracket creep and ensure there was no net increase in the tax take. NSW and South Australia want the GST increased to 15 per cent from 10 per cent and all the revenue spent on health. Victoria and Queensland are opposed to any increase in the GST and want the Medicare levy doubled to 4 per cent instead.\nThe Treasurers also shot down an offer by Mr Hockey, made on a TV show in May, to remove the GST from tampons. The exemption required unanimous agreement but some states, led by NSW, preferred to keep the revenue about $50 million a year.\nThe breakthrough came with the decision to abolish altogether the $1000 GST-free threshold for goods and services purchased online from abroad, rather than lower the threshold.\n Political parties of both persuasions say ending the exemption is an integrity measure rather than a tax increase and while collecting the GST from every overseas vendor is likely to be costly and complicated, the long start date is designed so more work can be done to maximise the changes of compliance.\nMr Hockey said tax officials will \"travel around the world\" visiting companies with turnovers in Australia of greater than $75,000 to ensure they collect and forward to the government GST.\nï»¿ He accepted that while it would be relatively simple to ensure such large companies as Amazon and digital providers complied, it coulds take several years. Europe, for example, would not have protocols in place until 2020.\n\"The earlier we start, the less effective it will be,\" he said of ushering in the change. At the same time, he said the start date could be brought forward if it turned out to be easier than anticipated.\nMr Hockey said there were still estimates being done on the extra revenue that could be collected and he defended the change as an integrity measure, rather than an extension of the application of the GST base.\n\"It is about the integrity of the system and it's also about giving Australian business a chance to compete on a level playing field with businesses located offshore.\n\"If a business offshore is able to automatically charge less for the same goods and services that are sold in Australia, then ultimately it costs Australian jobs. And what we want to do is make sure that people pay their fair share of tax because after all if someone or a company is not charging the GST, then in those circumstances the taxpayers are ripped off.\"\nThe Prime Minister and the Premiers will keep discussing increasing the GST as part of a broader tax reforms but there appears to be little chance of a consensus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:47:13.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
