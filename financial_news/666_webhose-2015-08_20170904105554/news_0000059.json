This skill of an Ethical Hacker has proven invaluable to protect organizations around the world. \n'There is a sense of alarm and dismay when some state websites are hacked and are down for a while. If the nation does not develop and implement a cyber-security strategy to address cyber warfare, sabotage and espionage there could be more of such attacks on public and private establishments. The need for information security for security compliance in Ghana is mandatory for all companies with an IT backbone.' \nThe information security industry is growing at a current worldwide growth rate of 21% percent, adding that there are an estimated 2.28 million information security professionals worldwide who are expected to increase to nearly 4.2 million this year. \nA business desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:03:49.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
