The planned operational life of the power station is 50 years. \nKoeberg unit to shut down for maintenance \nCabinet said Unit 2 of the Koeberg Power Station will be shut down for planned maintenance on 31 August. \n\"The unit is expected to return to service after three months,\" it said. \"The scheduled shutdown of Koeberg Unit 2 is part of Eskom's overall maintenance programme for its fleet of power stations. \n\"Every 16 to 18 months, each of the two units at Koeberg is shut down for refuelling, inspection and maintenance. The routine shutdowns are scheduled so as to avoid having both units out of service at the same time and to avoid the winter months in each year.\" \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:32:38.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
