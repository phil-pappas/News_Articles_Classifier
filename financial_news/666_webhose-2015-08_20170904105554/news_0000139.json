It has tested the value of its assets against forward prices for Brent crude oil, then assuming $US80 a barrel prices from the 2020 financial year.\nIt had already advised of a $53 million write-down on its New Zealand onshore petroleum business at the half-year stage.\nSome analysts have pointed to APLNG as a potential risk for write-downs, especially after last year's move by BG Group to cut the carrying value of its new LNG project in Queensland, partly on lower long-term assumptions for sales prices after last year's rout in oil prices.\nBut Origin specifically said APLNG, which is due to begin production in the December quarter slightly behind its original mid-2015 target, was not affected.\n\"There is no impairment related to Australia Pacific LNG, the economics of Origin's investment in Australia Pacific LNG remain robust,\" it said in the statement.\n The Australian Financial Review's daily reporting season blog.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:17:35.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
