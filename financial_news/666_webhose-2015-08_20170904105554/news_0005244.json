Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by Joanna Mather A Senate committee probing tax avoidance has junked a recommendation that would have limited multinational companies' ability to use interest deductions to reduce their tax bills in Australia.\nA widely-anticipated and leaked interim report by the Senate standing committee on economics, headed by Labor's Senator Sam Dastyari, was tabled on Tuesday.\nThe report makes 17 recommendations designed to give the public more information about the tax affairs of multinational giants.\nThese including establishing a public register of tax avoidance settlements reached with the Australian Taxation Office. Disclosure could be triggered once the value of the settlement reached a certain threshold â€“ $100 million is a figure that has been bandied about.\n\"The committee recommends that the ATO, in conjunction with Treasury and other relevant agencies, provides an annual public report on aggressive tax minimisation and avoidance activities to be tabled in Parliament,\" the report said.\n\"This report could include estimations of forgone revenue, evaluate the effectiveness of policy and propose potential changes.\"\nEarlier media reports suggested there would be 18 recommendations, including a proposal to alter existing thin capitalisation rules to reduce the debt multinational companies can claim tax deductions for in Australia.\nRecommendation excluded But that recommendation was excluded from the report.\nAs The Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday, energy giants Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell use the 'loophole' to claim nearly $3 billion a year of tax-free profits from the funding structure of the Gorgon gas project. Closing the loophole would have cut the Gorgon partners' allowable interest deductions to $460 million.\nChanges to thin capitalisation rules are part of Labor's policy, which might explain why they did not make it into the final report of the cross-party senate committee.\nAt present, companies can claim up to a 60 per cent debt-to-equity ratio for their Australian operations. Under Labor's policy, a company's tax deduction would be assessed on the debt-to-equity ratio of its entire global operation.\nFor example, if a company averaged a debt-to-equity ratio across all its subsidiaries of 30 per cent, then it could claim tax deductions only of that level in Australia.\nThe inquiry began its work in October last year and will continue in coming months. It has so far called before it representatives of the world's biggest technology, pharmaceutical and resources companies. Executives for Microsoft, Google, BHP, Rio Tinto, Roche and Novartis have given evidence.\nRevenue moved \"The American headquartered technology companies run their Australian operations as marketing and distribution companies and shift revenue earned in Australia to other jurisdictions,\" the report's executive summary said.\n\"The legitimacy of these transfers will continue to be a focus of the inquiry.\n\"Australia's largest tax payer, BHP Billiton, found itself in the awkward position of being unable to inform the committee at a public hearing about the activities of its marketing hub operations in Singapore, only to read in newspapers that these were a matter of public record in the city state.\n\"The pharmaceutical industry appears to set drug prices in Australia based on maintaining a small but astonishingly consistent profit margin of 3 to 4 per cent, while paying much larger revenues to parent companies overseas.\"\nA dissenting report from government senators said they \"have deep concerns about some of the recommendations made in the interim report\".\n\"Most significantly, the interim report fails to recognise that the Coalition government has taken strong action in our nearly two years in office to combat corporate tax avoidance.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-08-18T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:32:16.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
