Photo: Paul Jones\nFlexiGroup founder Andrew Abercrombie has effectively taken control of the company after chairman Chris Beare followed chief executive Tarek Robbiati out the door on Monday.\nMr Abercrombie, who owns 25 per cent of the $900 million lease and retail credit company, has taken over as chairman after Mr Beare, who had been in the role just over 12 months, and non executive director Anne Ward both decided to step down on Monday. Mr Robbiati, whose departure was announced last Friday, will become the chief financial officer at US telco Sprint.\nThe company has been searching for a replacement for Mr Robbiati since June but has yet to finalise the new CEO. In the meantime chief financial officer David Stevens and chief operating officer Peter Lirantzis are standing in his stead.\nIn a statement to the ASX after the close of trading, Mr Beare said he wanted to spend more time on small technology companies, which he is passionate about. Ms Ward had just taken on two extra board commitments.\nAdvertisement The company also released its unaudited annual profit results for 2015 and guidance for 2016 a week early in an effort to shore up confidence in the company.\nFlexiGroup reported net profit after tax of $90.1 million for 2015, in line with its forecast guidance and predicted its net profit for its 2016 financial year would be between $92 million and $94 million.\nRevenue for all divisions rose in the year to June, with New Zealand and its interest free cards business, which includes the recent acquisitions of Once and Lombard retail cards, the strongest performers. NZ income rose 63 per cent to $62 million, in part due to acquisitions there, and the credit card business rose 19 per cent to $237 million.\nFlexiGroup's biggest earner, Certegy, reported a 9 per cent rise in revenue to $552 million. Certegy revenue comes from financing solar panel purchases as well as education and jewellery purchases.\nFlexigroup has been branching out into business leases but revenue from both of these divisions fell sharply in 2015. Enterprise (or big business leasing) income fell 30 per cent to $105 million while small business leasing fell 23 per cent to $60 million.\nIt is understood Mr Abercrombie and Mr Robbiati clashed over the former CEO's approach to these businesses. While the former chief executive accepted lower earnings in the short term by focusing on investments to improve their technology, Mr Abercrombie is understood to have preferred more focus on maintaining earnings growth.\nIn a statement, Mr Abercrombie said he is \"looking forward to chairing the company that I once founded. I have been on the board since inception and I have watched FlexiGroup grow into a diversified financial services business with strong cash generating businesses and I am firmly supportive of the company's strategies\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:50:05.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
