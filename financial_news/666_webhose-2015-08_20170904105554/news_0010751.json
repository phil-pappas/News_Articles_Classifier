As Netflix spends money to make the jump into foreign markets, Liu wrote, the company is likely to face stiff competition from established players. With plans to launch in Japan, Spain, Italy and Portugal later this year, Liu wrote, Netflix will likely need to invest in new, market-specific content.\nDon’t miss: Netflix has star-studded original content up its sleeve\n“Most content licensing agreements for Netflix and its peers are for specific markets and involve separate negotiations, which elevate costs,” Liu wrote. “With global licensing agreements, Netflix could streamline the process somewhat and possibly lower its licensing costs. Netflix will need to be very selective in pursuing these global agreements, however, because if a specific show doesn’t translate well to international markets, it could quickly strain the company’s content budget.”\nSubscriber growth for Netflix in 2015 has been ahead of S&P’s expectations. If that continues, Liu wrote, it could warrant revising the company’s outlook to stable from negative.\n“On the other hand, if subscriber growth is significantly below our expectations, such that we believe it could limit Netflix’s access to capital markets, we could downgrade the company further,” Liu wrote.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:52:16.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
