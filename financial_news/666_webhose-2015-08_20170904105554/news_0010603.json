Thereafter, payroll taxes will cover only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2089, the latest year through which projections currently are made. \nDoes that mean you can't trust the estimates provided on your Social Security statement? \n\"When it was originally put into place, Social Security was intended to be a safety net for a minimal amount of income in retirement, and it was supposed to be augmented with other things,\" said Jim Blankenship, a financial planner in New Berlin, Illinois. \nHe added, \"Chances are, there will be something when you're ready to retire. But the onus is on you to make up the difference.\" \nHere are some points to keep in mind as you review your potential benefits. \nHow to get your statement. It used to be that Social Security mailed out a paper statement once a year, starting when you turned 25. Today, however, you will be mailed a paper statement once every five years from ages 25 to 60. (After 60, a statement is sent annually.) Advertisement \nIf you don't want to wait, head online. Workers 18 and older can forgo the paper statement and review projected benefits at any time online by creating an account, ( www.ssa.gov/myaccount ). \nYour estimated benefits. Once you have access to your statement, check your estimated benefits. Your statement will include projections for monthly retirement benefits, as well as payments you'd receive if you became disabled and benefits that family members would get if you passed away. \nTo be eligible for retirement benefits, you need to accumulate 40 credits. In 2015, you earn one credit for every $1,220 of earnings that are subject to Social Security taxes, up to a maximum of four credits (or $4,880 in earnings). \nIf you're young, you may not have earned enough credits to qualify for benefits. And because you likely haven't reached your peak earning years, your estimated benefits may be artificially low. (To calculate your benefits, Social Security averages the earnings from your top 35 working years.) \nYour earnings record. Blankenship says it's less important for a 20-something worker to worry about the estimated benefits, and more important to review the earnings recorded in your statement. \n\"If you see an error, now is the time to resolve it, rather than 40 years down the line,\" he said. \nWhat you should see: All the income earned in a given year that was subject to Social Security taxes. In 2015, earnings up to $118,500 are eligible. \nIf you see an error, contact Social Security at 800-772-1213. \nThe bottom line. Even if your retirement benefits are puny now, it's still a good idea to see how much you'd potentially take home each month in old age. If it's not enough to cover your monthly expenses -- keeping in mind that even those benefits may not be fully payable if Social Security runs short of funds -- think of how you'll make up the shortfall in retirement. \n\"This is the incentive,\" Blankenship said. \"Now is the time to save and make up the difference on your own.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T22:33:39.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
