He made international news headlines and generated a number of search requests, scoring 79 in the second week of May, versus Zuma's 33 and Malema's 15. \nZuma's popularity, though, is not matched by that of the ruling African National Congress according to Google data. Searches for the ANC scored 19, well behind that of the DA at 60. Malema's EFF matched the ANC in terms of its score. \nThe data seemed to suggest some discrepancy with the high score of the \"da\" search term with related searches such as \"da vinci\", \"da gama\" and \"da capo\" included in the list. \nGoogle Trends also indicated regional differences in the way locals searched for information on political leaders. \nZuma is a popular search topic in Limpopo (100), followed by KwaZulu-Natal (86) and the Eastern Cape (83), while Malema is popular in Limpopo (100), North West (55) and Gauteng (50). \nMaimane tops political searches in Gauteng (100), the Western Cape (99) and KwaZulu-Natal (87). \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:22:04.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
