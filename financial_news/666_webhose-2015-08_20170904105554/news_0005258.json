Last year, the top position was bagged by Tejaswin Jha from Bihar who scored 682 marks.\n17-year-old Vipul, son of a bag seller in Haryana’s Jind district, studied at New Holy Public School in Uttam Nagar area here.\n“It is a dream come true for me and my parents. I have always scored well in my exams but securing the first position in a medical entrance exam is not something I was sure of. I had performed well in the earlier test too but when it was cancelled I was disheartened,” he told PTI.\n“But later I used the opportunity to work on my weak areas. I want to join Maulana Azad Medical College and want to become a cardiologist,” he added.\nGarg had scored a perfect 10 CGPA in Class 10 and was awarded with a fee waiver for his further schooling.\n“I was also offered a scholarship for my medical coaching by a private coaching institute. I come from a humble family and my parents had to face lot of hardships to meet my education expenses. I am glad I have been able to make them proud,” he said.\nKhusi(17), who has secured the second rank comes from a family of doctors with her mother and father being in the same profession.\n“I did my schooling from Kota in Rajasthan and had scored 86.3 per cent in Class XII. I have already secured a seat in AIIMS, Jodhpur but I wanted to study at Maulana Azad. I am happy that I will be able to do that now,” she told PTI.\n“I want to pursue endocrinology as my specialisation. Although I believe I had performed better in the first examination but after the answer keys for the re-test were out I was confident that I will be among the toppers,” added Khushi.\n 17, 2015 6:15 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:03:48.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
