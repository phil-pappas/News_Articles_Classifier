Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MUMBAI: Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan has taken on the government for thrusting the Jan Dhan Yojana on public sector banks and has called for compensating the PSU lenders. This observation from Rajan comes in the central bank's annual report which has a new section - 'Governor's overview'. \"We should recognise that PSBs undertake public interest activities (like the rollout of accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana) that are not always fully compensated. Government should endeavor to keep the competitive playing field level by fully compensating banks for activities it wants undertaken in the public interest,\" the governor said in his review. The Jan Dhan Yojana has been trumped as a major achievement by the NDA government. The scheme allowed every unbanked person to open a basic bank account with zero balance requirement and avail of a debit card, Rs 1 lakh accident insurance cover, Rs 30,000 life insurance and an overdraft facility after satisfactory operation of the account for six months. In FY15 public sector banks opened 16.57 crore accounts under this scheme. Over 10 crore of the accounts are in rural areas and 45% of them have zero balance in them. The total deposits mobilized through the scheme was Rs 22647.35 crore. PSU banks have said that zero balance accounts are a drain on their resources but express hope that direct benefit transfers would improve cash balances. Acknowledging that the JDY had given a fillip to financial inclusion Rajan said that the government needs to ensure activity in these accounts by rooling out DBT for all payments. Also banks need to start rolling out credit products after due diligence and strengthen their business corresponent network and increase awareness through financial literacy drives. According to Rajan, psu banks are in a disadvantages position also because of skilled manpower. \"Because PSBs compete in the same market place for talent as do private sector banks and foreign banks, and may skill gaps are increasing tat the middle management levels because of past hiring freezes, they will be unnecessarily hampered if they are unable to pay appropriate compensation to the middle and senior managers as well as board members,\" said Rajan. He added that the higher compensation should be with higher accountability and cost rationalization to bring overall costs in line with private banks. Rajan said that the central bank on its part RBI has stepped away from micromanaging the functions of public sector bank boards through regulations and allowed board to determine how they will carry out their responsibilities for strategic planning, risk management , and accounting. RBI has also liberalised the compensation of private bank Board members, while maintaining some checks, to ensure Board members are properly incentivized,\" he said in the review.
