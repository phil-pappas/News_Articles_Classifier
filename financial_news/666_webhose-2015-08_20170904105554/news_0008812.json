Announces Quarter Ended June 30, 2015 Financial Results August 10, 2015 06:30 ET | Source: Fifth Street Finance Corp. \nGREENWICH, CT, Aug. 10, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fifth Street Finance Corp. (NASDAQ: FSC ) (\"FSC\" or \"we\") announces its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nThird Fiscal Quarter 2015 Financial Highlights Net investment income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $32.5 million, or $0.21 per share, as compared to $29.5 million or $0.19 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2015; Net asset value per share was $9.13 as of June 30, 2015 as compared to $9.18 as of March 31, 2015; and We closed $227.4 million of investments during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nPortfolio and Investment Activity \nOur Board of Directors determined the fair value of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 to be $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. Total assets at June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014 were $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. \nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we closed $227.4 million of investments in seven new and five existing portfolio companies, and funded $226.9 million across new and existing portfolio companies. This compares to closing $177.3 million in seven new and five existing portfolio companies, and funding $197.8 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2014. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, we received $214.3 million in connection with the full repayments of nine of our debt investments, all of which were exited at or above par. We also received an additional $157.3 million in connection with syndications and sales of debt investments. \nAt June 30, 2015, our portfolio consisted of investments in 132 companies, 112 of which were completed in connection with investments by private equity sponsors, one of which was in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (\"SLF JV I\") and 19 of which were in private equity funds. At fair value, 94.1% of our portfolio consisted of debt investments (78.8% of our portfolio consisted of senior secured loans). Our average portfolio company debt investment size at fair value was $20.5 million at June 30, 2015, versus $24.2 million at September 30, 2014. \nAs of June 30, 2015, SLF JV I had $348.9 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 27 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $3.9 million to FSC during the third fiscal quarter, which represented a 17.6% weighted average annualized return on investment. Subsequent to quarter end, SLF JV I closed on $200 million of additional leverage, which should allow SLF JV I to expand up to $600 million of assets. \nOur weighted average yield on debt investments at June 30, 2015, including the return on SLF JV I, was 10.9% and included a cash component of 10.3%, as compared to 10.7% at March 31, 2015. At June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of our debt investments at fair value bore interest at floating rates, which represented 76.1% and 70.0%, respectively, of our total portfolio of debt investments at fair value. \nResults of Operations \nTotal investment income for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 was $70.2 million and $74.3 million, respectively. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the amount primarily consisted of $59.3 million of interest income from portfolio investments. For the quarter ended June 30, 2014, the amount primarily consisted of $64.4 million of interest income from portfolio investments. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, PIK interest income net of PIK collected in cash represented only 3.9% of total investment income. \nNet expenses for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014 were $37.7 million and $39.6 million, respectively. Net expenses decreased for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2014, due primarily to decreases in net base management fee, which was attributable to an 11.1% decrease in our investment portfolio, at fair value, for the year-over-year period. \n\"We are pleased by the initial results of our strategic review, initiated earlier this year, which was focused on driving consistent and sustainable performance at FSC. For the second straight quarter, our net investment income exceeded our quarterly dividend, generating excess earnings and enhancing our operating flexibility,\" stated Todd G. Owens, Chief Executive Officer, adding, \"The credit profile of our portfolio was stable this quarter with no new investments placed on non-accrual. Additionally, we plan to begin utilizing our share repurchase program in the coming days.\" \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nAs of June 30, 2015, we had $181.7 million in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.3 billion, $12.8 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $225.0 million of SBA debentures payable, $315.3 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $115.0 million of unsecured convertible notes payable, $410.3 million of unsecured notes payable and $21.9 million of secured borrowings. \nAs of September 30, 2014, we had $109.0 million in cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), portfolio investments (at fair value) of $2.5 billion, $15.2 million of interest, dividends and fees receivable, $225.0 million of SBA debentures payable, $317.4 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities, $115.0 million of unsecured convertible notes payable, $409.9 million of unsecured notes payable and $84.8 million of secured borrowings. \nDividend Policy \nOn August 4, 2015, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends: $0.06 per share, payable on September 30, 2015 to stockholders of record on September 15, 2015; $0.06 per share, payable on October 30, 2015 to stockholders of record on October 15, 2015; and $0.06 per share, payable on November 30, 2015 to stockholders of record on November 16, 2015. \nDividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders. Our Board of Directors determines dividends based on estimates of distributable (taxable) income, which differ from book income due to temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition and changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. \nOur amended dividend reinvestment plan (\"DRIP\") provides for reinvestment of dividends, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board of Directors declares a cash dividend, our stockholders whose shares are registered in their name and who have not \"opted out\" of our DRIP will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends. We provide up to a 5% discount on newly-issued shares purchased through the DRIP (provided that shares would not be issued at less than net asset value per share). If you are a stockholder and your shares of our common stock are held through a brokerage firm or other financial intermediary and you wish to participate in the DRIP, please contact your broker or other financial intermediary. \nStock Repurchase Program \nOur Board of Directors previously authorized a stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Stock repurchases under this program are to be made through the open market at times, and in such amounts, as our management deems appropriate. Unless extended by our Board of Directors, the program will expire on November 20, 2015 and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. \nPortfolio Asset Quality \nWe utilize the following investment ranking system for our investment portfolio: Investment Ranking 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations and/or capital gains are expected. Investment Ranking 2 is used for investments that are performing substantially within our expectations, and whose risks remain materially consistent with the potential risks at the time of the original or restructured investment. All new investments are initially ranked 2. Investment Ranking 3 is used for investments that are performing below our expectations and for which risk has materially increased since the original or restructured investment. The portfolio company may be out of compliance with debt covenants and may require closer monitoring. To the extent that the underlying agreement has a PIK interest provision, investments with a ranking of 3 are generally those on which we are not accruing PIK interest. Investment Ranking 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below our expectations and for which risk has increased substantially since the original or restructured investment. Investments with a ranking of 4 are those for which some loss of principal is expected and are generally those on which we are not accruing cash interest. \nAt June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment ranking scale at fair value was as follows:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T17:21:19.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
