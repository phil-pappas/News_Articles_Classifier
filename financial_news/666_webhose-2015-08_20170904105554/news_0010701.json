We apologise for any inconvenience caused and are working hard to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.”\nHSBC customers writing on Twitter were mostly concerned about not getting paid their salary.\nAlan Charlesworth, who is the managing director of an insurance and legal recruiter, tweeted that none of his staff had been paid on Friday morning. “HSBC when will this be sorted?” he tweeted.\nCustomers such as Lydia Smith claim the bank’s problems had caused them to become overdrawn.\nThe problem appeared to surface early on Friday morning, although as recently as 8.30am the bank was tweeting people to say it was not aware of the problem.\nLater in the morning, the bank admitted it had a problem with BACS payments. Direct debits and deposits are made using BACS, the system that is responsible for the electronic processing of financial transactions within the UK.\nHSBC said it did not have any more information, including how many people have been affected, until it had fully investigated the problem.\nHave you been affected by the glitch?
