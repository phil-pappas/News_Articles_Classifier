(PROGREEN), ( OTCQB : PGEI ), is pleased to announce that the discussions with American Residential Fastigheter AB (AMREFA), as mentioned in previous press releases, have resulted in that several new agreements now have been signed, including a new joint venture addendum to the earlier investment agreement between the parties signed in July 2013. The agreement outlines further the investment strategies between the companies, with AMREFA funding all transactions and PROGREEN executing the work. Resulting profits are to be split equally between the companies. \nInitial hard cash investments from AMREFA under this new joint venture agreement, are estimated to $1,200,000 for September/October, with further tranches following. \nPROGREEN had several outstanding short term loan notes in favor of AMREFA, totaling some $289,000. These have now been restructured into a longer term installment agreement, with PROGREEN having paid the initial installment of $45,000, representing $16,000 in accrued interest and $29,000 of principal. \n\"We are very pleased to have seen a recent restructure of AMREFA, with the company replacing the majority of its board of directors. The new management are planning a fast increase in their US real estate activities. A much improved working relationship between the companies, is now in place and we have high expectations from AMREFA in the near as well as long term future,\" says Jan Telander, President \nAbout ProGreen Properties, Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T15:57:19.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
