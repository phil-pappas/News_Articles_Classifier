Investors are still betting the euro zone, for instance, will head back into deflation in a year's time which will only up the pressure on the European Central Bank to expand its bond-buying programme. \n\"Important links are likely to stem from potential disinflationary trends - both through exchange rate appreciation, but perhaps more importantly through the reduction in demand for commodities from emerging markets,\" said RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) in a note to clients. \n\"In this respect, the market measure of medium-term inflation expectations is worth keeping a close eye on.\" \nGermany, the euro zone's powerhouse economy, will release preliminary inflation data for August on Friday.
