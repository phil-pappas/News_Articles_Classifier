AAP Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The federal government could enter the house insurance business in northern Australia after a report found the risk of cyclones was pushing premiums up by as much as 25 per cent a year.\nIn a move which will anger some private insurers who have lobbied hard to have the option of a mutual cyclone insurer taken off the table, an interim taskforce report to be released on Monday has commissioned modelling to look at the costs to taxpayers of a government mutual or a reinsurance pool.\nIt is also exploring the option of incentives for individuals who attempt to make their homes or businesses \"cyclone proof\".\n\"Some of the options to reduce premiums to consumers involve the federal government taking the risk of losses due to cyclones onto its balance sheet,\" the interim taskforce report said.\n\"The taskforce will be commissioning specific modelling to estimate the possible risk to the Commonwealth balance sheet from the options being assessed.\"\nOptions on the table Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the federal government was keeping all options on the table as it looked for ways to reduce insurance premiums for those who lived in the north. The final report is due in November.\n\"Insurance premiums in Northern Australia are a real issue. The affordability of insurance goes to the heart of economic development, household budgets, and our capacity to develop Northern Australia,\" Mr Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review .\n \"For these reasons, the government is committed to examining various options for reform and that is why we have established an expert panel to provide advice.\"\nThe Northern Australia Insurance Premiums Taskforce, headed by former Treasury official Mike Callaghan, has been asked to look at ways to reduce home, contents and strata insurance in north Queensland, including a mutual cyclone insurer and a cyclone reinsurance pool.\nThe taskforce – which also includes Insurance Council of Australia chief executive Rob Whelan, Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation Board chairwoman Joan Fitzpatrick and National Insurance Brokers of Australia chief executive Dallas Booth – said it had commissioned modelling to look at how to remove \"cyclone risk\" from existing insurance arrangements.\n\"However, existing insurance and reinsurance arrangements do not have a separate, defined category of \"cyclone risk\" nor is there a \"cyclone policy\" that consumers can purchase,\" the interim report found.\n\"As such, it is important to clearly define what risks may potentially be shifted from insurance and reinsurance companies to the Commonwealth balance sheet.\"\nThe taskforce warned it could be complicated to separate cyclone risk from a broader insurance policy.\n\"Uncertainty on the issue could result in significant confusion for consumers and they may end up not being insured for certain risks,\" it found.\n\"Similarly, a lack of clarity over coverage of 'cyclone risk' can cause uncertainty for insurance companies with their reinsurance arrangements, which may reduce the benefits of any reduction in premiums.\"\nReinsurance pool It is understood some insurers are open to the idea of a reinsurance pool for cyclones – in the same way it is currently used now for terrorism – but there is almost universal rejection of the government entering the insurance market.\nQueensland-based insurer Suncorp has told the federal government to stay out of the insurance market in north Queensland , saying there was no need to use taxpayers' dollars to make the Commonwealth an insurer of last resort. They also believed there was enough competition in the market.\nThe insurance taskforce was created after lobbying from north Queensland Liberal MP Warren Entsch who was angry over locals bearing the brunt of higher premiums after a string of cyclones including Cyclone Marcia earlier this year, Cyclone Yasi in 2011 (which was the precursor to the Brisbane floods), and Cyclone Larry in 2006.\nThe report found insurance premiums on home and contents insurance in northern Queensland rose between 10 and 25 per cent a year from 2009-10 to 2012-13 and were about 1.5 times higher than Brisbane and 2.3 times higher than Sydney or Melbourne. Insurers have paid more than $3.4 billion in cyclone-related claims in the far north since 2008.\nOminous warnings The taskforce also ominously warned about the substantial costs of other government-supported insurance schemes around the world, including in the United States following Hurricane Katrina and in New Zealand after the Christchurch earthquake. The government insurer would offer cheaper insurance than market alternatives.\nMr Whelan, who is on the taskforce, last month said he hoped the taskforce would find practical, long-term and sustainable solutions that did not interfere with the market.\n\"Taxpayers from low-risk areas should not be used to subsidise premiums in high-risk areas based on a government decision,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-08-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:55:30.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
