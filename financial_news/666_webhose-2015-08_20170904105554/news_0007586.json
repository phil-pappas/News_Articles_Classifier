The next preferred method of payment was credit cards, followed by debit cards, prepaid cards and other payment methods including cheques and online banking. \nMore than a fifth of UAE residents (22 percent) said they do not have a debit card, while 29 percent said they do not have a credit card. \nAccording to the survey, which was conducted by YouGov during Q2 this year, UAE residents perceive cash to be quicker, safer and offering more control on spending than using a debit or credit card. \nThe survey found that only one in six residents (15 percent) use a debit card 2-3 times a week and just 12 percent use a debit card four or more times a week. Over half of UAE residents (51 percent) said they only use their debit card once or less than once a week. \nThe survey indicated that Western residents are the most frequent users of debit cards, with 30 percent using their cards between 2-5 times a week. Arab expats were the next most frequent debit card users (23 percent), followed by Asians (18 percent) and Emiratis (17 percent). Asian residents were the most frequent users of credit cards with 25 percent using a credit card between 2-5 times a week, followed by Arab expats (22 percent), Westerners (25 percent) and Emiratis (18 percent). \nBhairav Trivedi, CEO of Network International, said the extensive use of cash for payment UAE was different to other countries in the region. \n“Cash is clearly still king for UAE residents which is certainly unique to the region and a contrast to other global trade centres where cashless transactions are more prevalent,” said Trivedi. \n“This is not a new trend, but is certainly at odds with the UAE’s adoption of new technologies and drive to be a leader on innovation. Cash will remain important as a payment system in the UAE, but there is a huge opportunity to educate UAE consumers on the merits of alternative payment methods.” \nE-commerce is still witnessing a relatively low uptake in the UAE, with the majority of residents (77 percent) normally purchasing goods, ranging from groceries to luxury items, in-store or from a merchant. Less than one-in-10 (8 percent) said they purchased goods online and only 4 percent said they currently purchase goods using a mobile device. \nIn contrast, the majority of UAE residents (57 percent) said they would be comfortable using a smartphone to pay for goods and services. One in five (20 percent) said they would be very comfortable using a mobile device with only 19 percent saying they would not be comfortable. \nTrivedi said: “There is clearly appetite for new methods of payment here in the UAE. With one of the highest penetrations of smartphone use and an increasingly sophisticated young population, new technology will clearly shape the future of the payments landscape in the region.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T16:54:04.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
