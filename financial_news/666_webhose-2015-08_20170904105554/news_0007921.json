Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Abbott government ministers have been instructed to tell Federal Parliament that cabinet processes are \"functioning exceptionally well\" if asked about recent cabinet leaks, according to leaked documents.\nWith more revelations about federal cabinet's thin agenda in the past week, and revelations about what items cabinet discussed on Monday night – including a yet to be signed multibillion-dollar agreement with NSW on funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme – ministers were given guidance on how to answer questions about the leaks on Wednesday morning.\nThe briefing says that if ministers are asked about the leaks on the cabinet agenda, they are to say: \"We don't comment on cabinet discussions … The government is focused on delivering jobs and growth. Just yesterday the government announced its decision on lawfare .\"\nThe ministers are then told to say that \"in contrast to the experiences of the Rudd and Gillard governments, our cabinet is functioning exceptionally well\".\n\"Everyone knows that under Labor, cabinet submissions were almost never lodged on time and would instead more often arrive on the day or weekend before a cabinet meeting.\n\"Julia Gillard sent her bodyguard to NSW meetings. Our cabinet processes are more effective and productive than Labor's chaos.\"\nThe Abbott cabinet has been bitterly split in recent months on both citizenship laws and same-sex marriage, and the Prime Minister has faced renewed accusations that he has made decisions that have not been put through proper cabinet processes.\nSenate leader Eric Abetz told the ABC on Wednesday that he didn't know why journalists bothered to talk to leakers.\n \"I talk to my colleagues face-to-face or not at all. I am not one of those people that … [makes] unattributed comments in the media. One, I think it's gutless. Two, it's a breach of the rules. So if somebody is gutless and in breach of the rules, one really wonders why a journalist even bothers to repeat comments from such an individual.\"\nHe went to say that \"things are going exceptionally well with the government's agenda\".\nDisability row rolls on The government is due to sign bilateral deals with all states and territories by the end of this month on the transition to the full rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme .\nHowever, it has delayed signing an agreement with NSW – which is completed – amid revelations that the matter was discussed at a fractious meeting of cabinet's expenditure review committee last week after renewed pressure to try to slow down the rollout of the scheme.\nThe briefing notes for question time say that if ministers are asked about the NDIS rollout, they are to say: \"The Coalition government is committed to the full rollout of the NDIS and is determined to prioritise spending to accommodate this important reform into the budget.\n\"We have been working closely with state and territory governments, the National Disability Insurance Agency and disability services to deliver the scheme consistent with the Heads of Agreement,\" the notes continue.\n\"The NDIS is being rolled out as quickly as possible while being tailored to the needs of each jurisdiction.\n\"At full scheme, state and federal governments have committed to spend $22 billion per annum. Our commitment of about $11.6 billion has been confirmed in our last two budgets. This investment will improve the quality of life of over 400,000 Australians who have a significant and permanent disability.\n\"Labor's claim that they fully funded the NDIS is simply wrong. Labor left the scheme and its participants unfunded by more than $5 billion in the first full year.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-19T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:06:56.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
