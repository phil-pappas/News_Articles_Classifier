Earlier in the week, Walt Disney reduced its profit guidance for its cable networks unit. With heightened concerns television viewing habits are shifting to internet-based services, investors piled out of media stocks on both sides of the Atlantic (Shanghai: 600558.SS - news ) . * How a Mickey Mouse sell-off of Disney is bad news for the BBC Separately, the latest Communications Market Report from Ofcom published on Thursday, which pointed to a change in patterns of consumption of media, also dragged the shares lower. \nResearch by the telecoms watchdog revealed broadcast television viewing had fallen in the last two years, as younger viewers in particular shift from traditional TV to digital platforms, such as Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) and YouTube. \nThe FTSE 100 stock suffered its largest one-day drop in four months, down 9.3p, or 3.4pc, to 262.6p. \nIn the broader market, Britain’s benchmark index closed at 6,718.49, mounting to a weekly gain of 22.21 points, or 0.3pc. \nCommodity stocks have spent the week rotating between the position of FTSE laggard to leader, and Friday was no exception. Having dominated the top fallers on Britain’s benchmark index on Thursday, mining and oil companies recovered to become the darling of the FTSE 100. Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) jumped 25.1p, or 3.2pc, to 800.5p, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) added 3.9p to 203.2p, Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) rose 9.5p to 589.5p and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) advanced 15.5p to £11.91. \nElsewhere, it has been a testing week for builders’ merchant Travis Perkins after half-year results failed to impress investors. On Tuesday, the FTSE 100 company posted a 3.2pc rise in pre-tax profits to £158.6m and lifted its dividend by more than 20pc. However, it was the decision to maintain its full-year financial performance guidance, which spooked investors. \nCitigroup (NYSE: C - news ) lowered the stock’s rating on Wednesday, and on Friday, Panmure Gordon followed, downgrading it from “buy” to “sell” due to the lack of upward movement to earnings estimates. Adrian Kearsey, of Panmure Gordon, said “in the absence of any upgrades we think price-to-earnings ratio could well contract in the short-term”. The stock finished at £21.25 - bringing its weekly loss to 122p, or 5.4pc, its biggest drop in over a year. \nWilliam Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) plunged 26.6p, or 6.5pc, to 384.3p, recording its biggest one-day loss since January after half-year profit-before tax came in at £78.7m , down from £121.8m on the previous year. Nick Batram, of Peel Hunt, noted “while underlying momentum in the core online business remains positive, Retail Hill’s machines are beginning to stall relative to competitors”. \nMeanwhile, Wizz Air (LSE: WIZZ.L - news ) flew higher, up 89p, or 5.1pc, to £18.49 after JPMorgan Cazenove raises its target price to 1750p from 1700p to reflect stronger forward bookings. \nFinally, Aim-listed Imaginatik (LSE: IMTK.L - news ) rose for a second-consecutive day as former Quindell (Xetra: M6FA.DE - news ) boss upped his stake in the consultancy and technology products company. The controversial businessman only revealed his initial shareholding of 3.03pc in the British company in June, Mr Terry now holds 11.15pc, through his investment vehicle Quob Park Estates.
