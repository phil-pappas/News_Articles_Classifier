Passenger traffic grew 3 percent in the first half of 2015, although a 3-percent decline in fares during the same period kept operating revenues flat for U.S. carriers, Airlines for America said.\nYet a 34-percent decline in fuel costs, airlines' greatest variable expense, has boosted their profit.\n\"Six years post-recession, airlines are finally realizing profit margins that are on par with the S&P 500 average, a barometer of U.S. corporate performance,\" the group's Chief Economist John Heimlich said.\nThe 10 publicly traded U.S. airlines collectively had a profit margin of 11.2 percent in the first half of 2015, up from 4.9 percent in the prior year, according to the group.
