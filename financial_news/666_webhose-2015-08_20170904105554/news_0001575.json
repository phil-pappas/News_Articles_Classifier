Andrew Meares by Sally Rose Latest proposed changes to superannuation have sparked warnings they could lead employers to strike deals with banks over default superannuation investments that are not necessarily in employees' best interests.\nAddressing the Financial Services Council's annual conference on the Gold Coast on Friday, Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg foreshadowed one of the most controversial superannuation reforms yet.\nIt continues the Abbott government's push to break the dominance of the union-aligned non profit industry funds in the superannuation sector, paving the way for more direct competition with bank-backed retail funds.\nMr Frydenberg would not comment on whether the government is more inclined to completely open up the process to market forces, or if it was looking at a compromise to assemble a new panel of independent investment experts to oversee a tender process.\n\"My objective is to put in place a framework that will generate the strongest possible competitive forces for the benefit of every superannuation fund member. Opening the superannuation market to competition will require consideration of an alternative to the current, poorly-conceived Fair Work Commission process for the selection of default funds in modern awards\".\nMr Frydenberg said a formal competitive process would extend competitive pressures and reduce costs for funds and compliance costs for employers.\nChecks still needed However chief executive of the Association of Super Funds of Australia, which represents both retail and industry funds, Pauline Vamos urged the government to retain some form \"quality filter\" to ensure that the MySuper product an employer selects is the one that is most appropriate for its workers.\n \"It is absolutely vital that the process for default fund selection is transparent and contestable\".\nThe announcement was a coup for the Financial Services Council, which has previously taken the Fair Work Commission in the federal court over conflicts of interest in appointing directors of industry funds to its selection panel.\nFSC chief executive Sally Loane said, \"The Fair Work Commission process impedes competition and abolishing its role in super is in the best interest of consumers. Competition in the default market will put pressure on all funds to reduce fees and improve their services.\"\nIndustry Super Australia chief executive David Whiteley said a layer of oversight was needed to ensure that major financial institutions do not bundle up default super tenders with discounts on other products and services, such as business banking or transactional EFTPOS services, leading to employers make decisions based more on procurement benefits than the best interests of the workers the money belongs to.\nFSI chair David Murray acknowledged there are potential for conflicts specific to retail funds during a panel at the FSC conference on Thursday.\n\"People will become more engaged with super in the coming years and they will start to question, did my employer do a deal with a bank on my super that meant they got a discount on their banking services? Just as they will question the motivations of industry funds\".\nSpeaking on Friday Assistant Treasurer Mr Frydenberg said, \"Without true competition, MySuper will never achieve its full potential,\"\n\"We will also ensure that the wider regulatory framework is robust and appropriate to support moving to an open and competitive market. This will include carefully examining whether existing protections against funds or related parties offering inducements or inappropriately influencing an employer's choice of fund through the threat of industrial disputation are sufficient\".\nRetail funds make up only 5 per cent of all listings. Advocates of the current system say this a reflection of the better value provided to members by non-profit funds, while critics say it is symptomatic of union cronyism.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:40:07.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
