Once renowned and reputed companies are making huge losses, and in the process, draining taxpayers money. The latest entrant in this infamous league is Kenya Airways, which was once touted as the best Airlines in Africa. The airline is now a shell of its former self, and the management has announced the company needs at least Sh50 billion to recover. \nWhy is it that once fledging Kenyan companies are failing left, right, and centre.

We all remember the case of key managers of American companies such as Kennedy Lay of Enron, who was sent to jail to serve as a warning to those who engage in theft of public companies funds. \nPeople have invested and saved with the company. It saddens me that a management would be so cavalier as to see all these investments go to drain. It is no wonder that it is becoming increasingly difficult to convince a Kenyan to invest in stocks and securities. Why not just buy a plot of land instead, or construct some real estate, whose value will keep going up always, rather than investing in companies that may just collapse the next day?
