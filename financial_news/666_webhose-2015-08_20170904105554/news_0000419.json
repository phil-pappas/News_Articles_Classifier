This affects customers and employees alike.\nThe problem is that executives do not see the world through the eyes of their customers. As such, they miss not only coming trends but also how and why current models and processes are outdated and broken. Moreover, they are inherently designed to inhibit innovation and thus foster a culture of risk aversion, rather than risk diversion.\nTech for a 'smart enough' home (1:22) A smart home is a daunting proposition for many, but with these Wi-Fi-optional devices, you can connect your home with ease.\nThe bottom line is that reacting and adapting to changes because of tech and behavior is no longer good enough. To survive and thrive, businesses must create a culture of innovation or at the least, invest in innovation practices and communities.\nThe rise of innovation centers\nSome companies are blazing the trail as they move toward innovation. These companies recognize that the path toward shareholder and stakeholder innovation isn’t just about quarterly performance, but also long-term gains. To better understand what sets them apart, I partnered with CapGemini Consulting to study those companies that are investing in innovation, either through the establishment of new external centers or networks or internal work groups.\nWe studied 200 companies, 309 innovation centers, and interviewed scores of executives. Of the 200 top companies we studied, ranked by global revenue, just 38% have formally set up innovation centers to plug into disruptive tech. Most of them, 61%, call Silicon Valley home. While Northern California is at the top, emerging tech capitals including Austin, Tex, New York, Paris, London, Berlin, and Tel Aviv are strong competitors. But even still, the top 10 locations represent only 35% of all innovation centers.\nIt’s important to realize that innovation centers are different than R&D Centers. A common definition for R&D centers is this — they investigative new activities with the intention of making a discovery that can either lead to the development of new products or procedures, or to improvement of existing products or procedures. But the operate within the confines of traditional business dynamics.\nWhereas innovation these days rises from non-traditional business paradigms. Just look at the declining value of taxi medallions because of competitors such as Uber and Lyft.\nInnovation represents an intentional act of partnering with people and companies that offer new insights, expertise, and capabilities. It also represents the importance of looking outside traditional business models to establish a footprint in communities with the sole purpose of inventing and testing new products and markets.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/randd.asp", "http://www.slideshare.net/capgemini/the-innovation-game-why-how"], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T15:36:44.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
