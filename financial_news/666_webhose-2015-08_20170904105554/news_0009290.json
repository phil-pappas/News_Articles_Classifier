Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Internal tensions within the government have boiled over again with senior backbencher Arthur Sinodinos accusing ministers who are backgrounding against Joe Hockey of jeopardising the Coalition's chances in the Canning by-election.\nSenator Sinodinos has called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to sack those undermining the Treasurer, saying they were setting up Mr Hockey as a scapegoat for a loss in Canning.\n\"Ministers should be working hard to win the Canning by-election rather than backgrounding against a colleague to scapegoat a potential loss,\" he said.\n\"Holding out the prospect of a reshuffle and even a double dissolution election smacks of defeatism and a lack of focus on the substantive issues of governing.\nIt is coming mainly - but not exclusively - from within the Right of the party which wants to install Scott Morrison as Treasurer. Alex Ellinghausen \"The Prime Minister should sack any Minister or adviser who is engaged in such deliberate leaking and destabilisation.\"\nMr Hockey has been the subject of an internal whispering campaign for several months but it has developed a head of steam in recent weeks and days.\nIt is coming mainly - but not exclusively - from within the Right of the party which wants to install Scott Morrison as Treasurer.\nOthers are promoting Mr Morrison as a foil to Malcolm Turnbull should the Coalition lose the September 19 Canning by-election and Mr Abbott be deposed as leader.\n The PM should sack any Minister or adviser who is engaged in deliberate leaking and destabilisation. pic.twitter.com/qgMsXsdbmc\nâ€” Arthur Sinodinos AO (@A_Sinodinos) August 30, 2015 Last week, after Mr Hockey announced he would be advocating for Australia to become a republic , the internal criticism of him grew with several reports on Friday mentioning a growing mood to remove the Treasurer as part of a reshuffle.\nOn Monday, Fairfax Media Quote: d unnamed Ministers prevailing on Mr Abbott to dump the Treasurer shod the Coalition fare poorly in Canning .\nA senior source told The Australian Financial Review that there was no guarantee Mr Abbott would survive if Canning were lost.\nIf he did survive, he would be under pressure to undertake a significant reshuffle of his frontbench at Christmas.\n\"The minute Canning's over, that will be the topic,\" he said.\nSenator Sinodinos, who served as John Howard's chief of staff for a decade, was made assistant treasurer in 2013 but had to stand aside when he became embroiled in ICAC hearings in NSW.\nHe urged colleagues to consider Andrew Hastie, who has given up a career in the SAS to run for Canning as the Liberal candidate .\n\"We have an excellent candidate in Andrew Hastie who is prepared to serve the people of Canning with the same intelligence, courage and commitment he brought to the battlefield. The people of Canning deserve no less,\" he said.\n\"They have the opportunity to pass judgement on Bill Shorten, one of the most hollow individuals to ever occupy a leading political office.\"\n\"Mr Shorten is the real enemy, not fellow Liberals.\"\nDeputy leader Julie Bishop defended Mr Hockey, saying he was doing a good job in difficult budgetary and political circumstances.\nShe said he had inherited a bad budget from Labor and people should be giving him credit for the hard job of trying to fix it. She said she didn't go around rating other ministers performances.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/qgMsXsdbmc", "https://twitter.com/A_Sinodinos/status/638137842439352320", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-being-urged-to-consider-dumping-joe-hockey-and-calling-a-march-election-cabinet-ministers-20150830-gjaysw.html", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-31T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:03:39.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
