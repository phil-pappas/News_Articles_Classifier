A breakdown of the votes will be provided later Wednesday.\nThe approval in the Bundestag was a major step toward clearing the final adoption of the bailout by eurozone finance ministers. A first €13 billion payment is expected to take place on Thursday, when Athens faces redemptions on government bonds held by the European Central Bank.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/german-finance-minister-schauble-calls-on-lawmakers-to-ratify-greek-bailout-1439972312?link=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T17:01:20.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
