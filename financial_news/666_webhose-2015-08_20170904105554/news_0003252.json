Total dividends for the year are 66c per share.\nThe bank's net interest margin rose 1.6 percentage points to 1.89 per cent. Costs compared with earnings also rose marginally, with cost-to-income ratio up 0.7 of a percentage point to 55.2 per cent for the year.\nAdvertisement As expected, Bendigo's Homesafe product was a big contributor to earnings outside interest income. It added more than $63 million to revenue, up 26 per cent on its contribution in 2014.\nHomesafe allows the bank to help a home buyer pay for a house by taking a discounted part share in it. Bendigo gets income from the sale of the house and so earnings from this product rise when house prices rise.\nThe bank has said in the past the contribution from Homesafe will likely fall to about $20 million a year when the present run of sharp house price rises is over.\nAnalysts will be looking for an update on Bendigo's attempts to achieve Basel Advanced Accreditation, which will allow the bank to hold less capital against its home loans in the same way the Big Four do, at its results briefing today.\nThey will also be looking for an update on the collection of outstanding loans in the bank's controversial Great Southern agribusiness portfolio as well as the impact of recent repricing of investor loans by major banks.\nMore to come", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T02:47:25.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
