They will occur in the autumn but I have no illusions: The Americans will not give up on the 'Buy American' clause,\" she said. \n\"We must rebalance, because in the markets, Europeans are more open than Americans and we therefore want to obtain concessions from them,\" Malmstroem added. \nTalks on agriculture will also be complex as Brussels seeks to have tariffs lifted on wine, chocolate and cheese. \n\"It's very difficult to export cheese to the United States because of tariffs but also because of health codes,\" she said, adding the EU will not obtain a total lifting of duties on sensitive products. \nThe commissioner said she hopes to finalise the negotiations in 2016, just before US President Barack Obama's term ends. \n\"It's the optimistic scenario. I am not hiding this,\" Malmstroem said. \"I have time. I'm on duty until 2019.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T22:18:30.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
