Aaron Bunch Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Julie-anne Sprague A dramatic $20 billion cut in operational spending by the nation's three biggest iron ore miners is chilling a West Australian economy already under stress from falling investment in resources-related construction.\nAnalysis by The Australian Financial Review reveals that since 2012, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals Group have cut the amount they spend on extracting resources by $US14.3 billion ($19.9 billion).\nWhile this figure includes BHP and Rio's global operations, the majority of the cuts have been generated from their West Australian iron ore operations.\nThis excludes massive cuts to capital expenditure. With laser like precision the miners are tightening the cost screws beyond cutting staff and salaries.\nMiners are cutting meals served on flights to remote mine sites, pulling biscuits from the tea rooms and reducing the number of uniforms issued to staff. Manfred Gottschalk They're cutting meals served on flights to remote mine sites, pulling biscuits from the tea rooms and reducing the number of uniforms issued to staff.\nRio Tinto swapped leaving safety glasses and gloves in a box for staff to take for a vending machine. It has cut use by staff – who must swipe their employee card to access the free safety gear – by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent.\nRio Tinto iron ore managing director Andrew Harding said the move, which makes staff accountable for consumption, saves Rio millions of dollars each year.\nThe cuts in turn place pressure on suppliers.\n Wesfarmers' industrial and safety business supplies safety glasses to miners, which are among more than 200,000 various industrial and safety products it sells.\nIt has felt the impact of the downturn, responding by shedding about 10 per of its workforce in the past few years as part of restructuring its operations.\nIt may sell safety glasses but big drops in use by miners including Rio Tinto does not necessarily equate to similar volume drops for Wesfarmers, according to Wesfarmers industrial and safety managing director Olivier Chretien said.\nWesfarmers supplies the vending machines. Because the vending machines can only use its particular range of safety glasses and gloves it forces the mine site to buy in it's products rather than that of a competitor.\n\"There is a lot more volume reduction [for the customer],\" Mr Chretien said.\n\"For us, it means all our products get sold. We get better compliance with our contract so for us while it is a bit of a drop [in volume] it is not as much as that.\"\nMr Chretien said the business has also increased direct sourcing from Chinese factories to help cut its costs and improved its own supply chain.\nSuccess for Rio Rio Tinto's cost-cutting drive has been so successful that it has increased its target this year from $US750 million to $1 billion, taking total cuts since 2012 to $US5.8 billion.\nBHP will also keep cutting after stripping out $US7.8 billion from its global operations – including iron ore and coal – while Fortescue wants to drive down costs by $US1.4 billion this year, taking total cuts to $US3 billion since 2012.\nAbout a third of the cost cuts by Fortescue in the June quarter came from \"procurement initiatives\". Those initiatives it said are only half complete and shaved off $US2 per tonne from its cost base.\nThe miners are increasingly centralising buying, triggering a reduction in the number of suppliers that provide everything from safety protection to mine site equipment and services.\nWesfarmers' industrial business is not the only one being buffeted by cooling economic winds.\nCommercial property group JLL estimates 65,700 square metres of office space has been dumped by the mining industry and a further 58,500 square metres has been quit by businesses servicing the mining industry, such as engineering and consulting firms.\nThat is roughly enough space to fill Perth's tallest office tower, Central Park, two times over.\nPerth's central business district office vacancy rate is now the highest in the country, reaching 17.4 per cent in the June quarter, the since January 1996.\nA glaring example of the downturn is the vacant top four floors at Central Park.\nFor the first time since the building was built in 1992 that the top four floors are for lease.\nYet this prime CBD real estate has been empty for about two years, triggering a $4 million refurbishment by the building owners, which also spent $11 million upgrading the lifts.\nJLL regional director office leasing David Evans said his is in advanced negotiations for three of the four vacant floors to a professional business services group.\nMr Evans said while tenants were enjoying strong incentives to take up space he is confident the current downturn will not be as bad as the early 1990s, when the vacancy rate shot up to 32 per cent.\n\"The fundamentals of the WA economy are still very sound,\" Mr Evans said.\n\"There is a much broader and diverse economy. We have strong retail, agriculture and finance sectors.\"\nSavills director Graham Postma said rent for A-grade office space has dropped about 40 per cent.\n\"It has hit a point that it may not have bottomed but it is close to it,\" Mr Postma said. \"There has been a flight to quality.\"\nCBRE senior director Andrew Denny agreed the market was \"not as severe as the early 1990s recession\".\nMr Denny said rest of the market beyond mining and mining services was doing well and there was demand from professional services groups.\nJLL is tipping the vacancy rate to reach 24 per cent by the end of the year, the highest level in a decade.\nAt the peak of the mining boom in July 2008 Perth's vacancy rate touched 0.3 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SpragueJA", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117338550731714891115/posts"], "published": "2015-08-30T16:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:28:48.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
