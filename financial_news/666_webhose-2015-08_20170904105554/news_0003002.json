Nic Walker Share on twitter by Ben Potter With friends like the Abbott government, the coal industry might say, who needs enemies?\nThe government's half-baked climate policies are not helping its friends in the coal industry secure their long term future.\nAnd they're not doing much to hurt the government's \"enemies\" in the renewables sector in the long term either.\nNew governments like to put their stamp on policy. But chopping and changing policies is a cure worse than the disease.\nIt doesn't matter if you're going from bad policy to mediocre, or from mediocre to better, or from worst to best or best to worst. If the means by which you aim to get there are not clear, and policy keeps chopping and changing, it might as well be worst.\nBusiness will get no certainty, and have no incentive to invest in technologies that might help to achieve the goals set out for the time being by the government. If the national government can't agree on broad goals and policies, and stick with them, little gets done.\nThat's why mining giant BHP Billiton is calling for long-term policy that encourages investment in low emissions technology and - code for access to cheap international permits - links to global climate change efforts.\nEnergy sources with their own special treatment - such as renewables - will have confidence to invest.\n But the goal of overall transformation via the lowest cost methods of emissions abatement towards the low carbon future desired by most people will not be achieved by topsy-turvey, politically-motivated policy.\nThe target itself is not a problem. It could have been more ambitious . But it is not far shy of other resource-based advanced countries like Canada and New Zealand. And it is more ambitious than oil-rich Norway, whose parliament is nevertheless pressing its sovereign wealth fund to get out of coal and coal power companies.\nA growing country that supplies energy to poor countries - like Australia - is in a different position to a post-industrial society like Switzerland or Germany. The rich West can switch to renewables and bear the cost.\nPoor countries like India, Vietnam and Burma find renewables attractive too. But they are still investing in coal power and if they think they need Australian coal for the next stage of their development, we will be hard put to deny them.\nThe problem is the government's method, or lack of it. The coal industry knows something tougher is coming, if not in this parliament then in the one after it or the one after that.\nIt has done well in the short term from the repeal of the carbon price, and the lack of targets and climate change policies in Asian countries to which it exports. But things are changing.\nUntil the government gives the coal industry a fair idea of what to expect, it can not invest in its future.\nThis requires more efficient thermal power stations and viable carbon capture and storage technology - especially in countries where coal power is expanding.\nTo add insult, one of the few carbon capture and storage demonstration projects in Australia has just been pulled by Coal Innovation NSW and Delta Electricity due to a cut in commonwealth funding.\nAustralian industry should be doing more to share this load with the North Americans, Japanese and Chinese. BHP Billiton has flagged a bigger effort in low emissions technology.\nBut clearer policy direction from the government is needed for any of this to be effective.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-08-13T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:01:14.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
