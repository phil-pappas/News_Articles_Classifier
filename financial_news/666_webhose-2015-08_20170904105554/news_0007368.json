(icanteachyouhowtodoit/CC BY 2.0) \nExtroverted populations tend to have lower savings rates, new research shows. \n“Many of the choices that people make are influenced by their personality characteristics,” says Jacob Hirsh, assistant professor at Rotman School and University of Toronto Mississauga’s Institute for Management and Innovation. \n“I started to think about how that affect might play out across larger groups.” We know that personality traits have a powerful influence on an individual’s life outcomes. — Jacob Hirsh \nIn his previous work, Hirsh has shown that more extroverted individuals tend to choose smaller but immediate rewards instead of larger but delayed ones. \n“Extroverts are far more sensitive to rewards, which makes it harder for them to overcome their desire for immediate gratification,” says Hirsh. “When making financial decisions, this can contribute to impulsive spending, higher credit card debts, and reduced savings.” MORE: Brain Scans Show Extroverts Come in 2 Types \nIf personality traits are related to individual saving behavior, what would happen when entire populations differ in their personality characteristics? In the new paper, Hirsh examines this question using three different data sets. \nIn the first study, Hirsh found a correlation between United States extroversion levels and changes in the personal savings rate over time. During the same period that US savings rates underwent a sharp decline, there was a corresponding increase in US extroversion levels. \nIn a second study, Hirsh found that US states with higher average extroversion levels tended to allocate more of their income toward immediate consumption, rather than setting money aside for saving.
