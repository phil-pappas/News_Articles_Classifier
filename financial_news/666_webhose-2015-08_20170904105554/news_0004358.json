And there's a pretty good chance that your money managers -- whether big box financial corporation, mutual fund, or stockbroker -- have some remarkable conflicts of interest embedded in their businesses. \nAccording to the White House Council of Economic Advisors , $1.7 trillion of IRA assets are invested in products that are exposed to conflicts of interest. The estimated annual cost of all of this conflicted financial advice is $17 billion. For an individual investor, the forfeiture can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions, over the course of a lifetime. \nOf course, money managers are not bad people -- it's the system that's perverse.

The Department of Labor, with the support of President Obama, is trying to change this by expanding the \" fiduciary standard \" to a greater number of advisors. The financial industry is fighting the change tooth-and-nail, of course, and has already successfully prevented it for decades. \nThe takeaway: Be wary of investment advice from anyone who doesn't adhere to the fiduciary standard. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:12:59.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
