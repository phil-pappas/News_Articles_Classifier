Maybe he was simply hired to get it sold,” he questions. \n“I think it is a great shame that the strategy of the directors and management over the years has been to sell off the efforts of their predecessors and in several cases not even realising full value. \n“I am still a shareholder and must admit that I would welcome a bid to put me out of my agony of watching the company of which I was so proud disintegrate in the way it has over the last 17 years.” \nZurich first revealed it was considering a bid for RSA in late July, following newspaper reports it was considering a 550p-a-share approach. \nSince then RSA, led by former Royal Bank of Scotland chief Mr Hester, has delivered better than expected half-year results that will have bolstered any likely defence. \nStephen Hester joined RSA in February 2014 Photo: EPA \nThe Sunday Telegraph reported a fortnight ago that RSA and its advisers will only be interested in a bid above 600p-a-share. Zurich’s advisers, meanwhile, have weighed up bid prices as low as 525p, and executives have said that they would rather return the cash to investors than overpay for a deal. \nShares in RSA closed at 507p on Friday night, valuing the company at £5.16bn. \nIn the letter, Mr Gamble emphasises that he when he took over Royal in 1991 the shares were valued at £1, and when he left it was valued at £8 – or equivalent to £40 after taking into account the share consolidation in early 2014 that followed a £748m rights issue to shore up the group’s finances. \nHowever City sources pointed to the early teething troubles of the newly merged company, ahead of Mr Gamble’s departure in December 1997. \nReports from the time suggest Mr Gamble and Mr Taylor “squabbled” as joint chief executives, and the pair were replaced by American Bob Mendelsohn who came in with a plan to cut costs, increase efficiency and focus on general insurance. \nMr Mendelsohn was in the job until September 2002, when he departed ahead of a rights issue, and was replaced in 2003 by current Wonga chairman Andy Haste, who led the insurer for eight years until 2011. \nAn RSA spokeswoman declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T00:08:35.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
