However, European Commission economists calculated in 2013 that a 1% rise in German domestic demand would mainly benefit domestic production and its effect on the German trade balance would amount to about 0.2% of GDP; the greatest benefits would be for the Czech Republic, followed by Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and the Netherlands . The trade balances of Spain, Italy and Portugal would gain 0.02% of GDP, and the Greek balance would be less. \nIn recent years German pay increases have outpaced inflation and on a price basis, US manufacturing is more competitive than Europe's big manufacturing nations — German manufacturing workers are the best paid among the big countries. \nIn 2014 net exports only accounted for a quarter of the German GDP growth of 1.6% and most jobs added in the economy have been permanent ones in contrast with the position in the UK . \nDeutsche Bank economists say: \"Germany's overall economy will be driven primarily by private consumption in 2015 in particular. The healthy state of the labour market (high employment coupled with a low unemployment rate), above-average wage hikes as well as real income gains thanks to lower mobility and energy costs all play a key role. Private consumption is set to grow faster in 2016 than it did on average during the past decade. While investment in machinery and equipment is also expected to increase in Germany this year and next, the expansion will be modest compared with earlier upswing phases. Since German manufacturers are major producers of capital goods in particular, the demand stimuli from the domestic market as a whole will remain limited. Real domestic revenues were flat in H1 2015 relative to the year-earlier value.\" \nAccording to the OECD, the-think for 34 mainly developed country governments, while around 90% of the value of German and UK exports are made by companies exporting to more than ten markets, nearly three-quarters of German firms export to only one market , twice the rate of UK firms. In general, trade remains regional, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular tending to export disproportionally more to neighbouring countries. \"In a number of nations, such as Spain and the Netherlands, the contribution of SMEs to trade with emerging economies, notably China and India, is significant and growing.\" \nGerman firms from micro to the biggest companies in their global sectors, are good at exporting and not only is the structure of firms conducive to exporting, Germany has many more exporting firms than the other big economies in Europe — based on recent data, the population ratio per exporting firm is 187 in Denmark; 236 in Germany; 550 in France and 1,150 in Ireland. \nBruegel, the Brussels-based think-tank, says in a paper : \"the evidence indicates that the main differences across countries are dictated by the industrial structure. Similar firms behave similarly across countries, but Germany has a structure which favours the internationalisation of its economy much more than Spain and Italy. In particular, the greater presence of medium and large size firms dictates greater involvement in international activities.\" \nThis year a briefing note produced by economists at the Brookings Institution and JP Morgan Chase , examined why the United States had a $667bn manufactured goods trade deficit while Germany’s trade surplus in manufacturing was about $425bn in 2014. \nDespite the cost gap, more successful German innovation and employee training are key factors. \nLast month Bruegel economists in a blog post wrote: Germany is ‘Exportweltmeister’ (world champion in exporting) as it is phrased by the German media. Between 2000 and 2013 German exports increased by 154% compared to 127% in Spain, 98% in the UK, 79% in France and 72% in Italy. \nThey concluded: \nWhat explains Germany’s exceptional export performance relative to other European countries? We find that Germany is a world champion in exporting because it is a world champion in organizing. The export superstars of Germany base their export business model on quality by operating with a decentralized less hierarchical organization which empowers workers at lower levels of the firm hierarchy. As a result 40% of German exporters sell top quality export goods . Decentralized management has been effective to increase the export market share of top quality goods in Germany which demonstrates that decentralizing the organization may actually work to improve the product quality of exporters. Austria shares many of these features with Germany, while the superstars of all other European countries base their export business model mainly on price with or without a care for quality. The focus on quality may explain why export growth in Germany and Austria rebounded quickly after 2009 in spite of rapid rising nominal wages.\" \nExpecting Germany alone to reduce imbalances in the Euro Area would likely be a loss for Europe in the long-term as in sectors such as machine tools, chemicals and vehicles, other European countries would struggle to create new global brands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:20:33.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
