Memberships range from $70 to $500 a month; rents for the partially private campsites are between $1,600 and $2,000 a month, while startup suites rent for $1,000 to $3,200 monthly. \nA rooftop patio also offers work desks and places to lounge, and the 7-foot windows on the east side bring in a great deal of natural light. \n“Those vintage buildings have been very attractive to business owners as a recruiting tool,” says Peter Remes, Minneapolis developer and owner of First & First, which redeveloped the Van Buren building. “That brick and timber patina is something they respond to, because they want a creative, inspiring atmosphere.” \nIn 2010, COCO opened its first co-working location in downtown St. Paul. With 16,000 square feet in the former Minneapolis Grain Exchange building,COCO’s second location — which opened in2011 — is still its largest. A third opened in Uptown in 2013. \nCOCO opened an office in Fargo, North Dakota, in September 2014, but closed the office in June due to lack of membership. \nNortheast Minneapolis was a relatively obvious choice for COCO’s latest expansion, primarily because it was the new location most requested by existing COCO members. Co-founder Don Ball explains that COCO’s leadership also noticed where its own members were going when they “graduated” from COCO. \n“Before they were [acquired by] Buzzfeed, Hyper IQ was a member of ours, and they chose a Northeast location for their new office,” Ball says. \nBall hopes the added location will expand COCO’s base. Though many potential members would never have come to the downtown location, he says, opening an office in their neighborhood brings those potential members into the fold. \n“We’re also interested to see if there’s a network effect,” Ball says, noting that although Northeast members are likely to spend most of their time at that location, they may take advantage of their access to other locations too. \nBidding for the office’s startup suites has led to some surprises. The suites, which have six-month leases, have been in demand in other locations. In fact, they sold out in the downtown Minneapolis location before the locks were on the doors. But two companies that Ball had never even heard of have been bidding for the Northeast location’s largest suites. \n“I guess that shows there’s a lot of demand under the radar, and it shows up when you build [for] it,” he says. \nRemes believes that COCO’s arrival is in keeping with increasing interest in the area from entrepreneurs. “Part of the appeal is that there’s a social infrastructure in place there,” Remes says, citing the nearby breweries, restaurants, coffee shops and other social places to interact and converse. \nRemes also notes that those amenities are easy to get to without a car. “This generation of entrepreneurs find that very attractive,” he says. “They like having access to places they find interesting and engaging right outside their door.” \nBall said that it was too soon to estimate membership numbers for COCO Northeast. But he said signups were happening at a good clip, and estimated there was room in the space for about 200. “It’s coming along nicely,” he says. Among the amenities at COCO’s new Northeast location is a kitchen and eating area.
