K azakhstan has experienced sporadic protests and terrorist attacks , but what the government most wants to prevent is a repeat of the so-called Zhanaozen riots (also referred to as a massacre).\" \nConsequently, \" Kazakh government is launching a series of negotiations with oil unions in the country's western energy-producing regions amid the threat of protests,\" with the hope of contain the situation, according to the report. \n(FinViz) Notably, it's not just the Kazakh government that's worried about the country's stability. \nThe post-Soviet state sits between Russia and Asia , which makes it an important player in both Moscow's and Beijing's strategic plans . \nAon top of that, Kazakhstan \" is also one of the primary destinations for migrant Central Asian workers and thus contributes to other Central Asian states' economies,\" according to Stratfor. \nSo an unstable Kazakhstan could mean bad news for many of the countries around it. \n(University of Texas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T01:48:05.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
