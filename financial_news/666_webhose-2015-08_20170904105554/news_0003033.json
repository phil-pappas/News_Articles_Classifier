The young people at these rallies are showing up to see the Conservative leader, but some are really looking for the Harper children.\nAt the rally in Brampton, Ont., on Monday, the Harper children walked in and stood at the back of the room, just in front of the media cameras on a riser right behind them. A campaign staffer asked them if they wanted to take their assigned seats in the front row; the duo declined, noting they would head there when their parents made their grand entrance.\nThe crowd of Tory faithful seemingly missed them standing there.\nThey didn’t pose for any pictures.\nThey didn’t sign autographs.\nEveryone was looking at the stage.\nWhen their parents arrived, sister and brother went to their seats, not quite unnoticed.\n“I just saw him (Ben) standing there in the back,” said Dhruv Singla, 15. “He’s taller than I expected.”\nBut no one approached the pair to ask all the questions they had for the often seen, but rarely heard from, daughter and son of the prime minister.\nSuch as, do they enjoy political rallies every night of the week?\n“If you like politics, yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun,” said 14-year-old Mackenzie Sly after a rally in Edmonton on Wednesday, pondering what their life must be like.\nAnd if not?\n“Then that would so boring. That would be brutal,” she said.\nSo, do they like politics?\nThat’s among the many questions that teenagers at rallies had for Rachel and Ben that haven’t yet been answered.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlind Parapan athletes face more barriers than most\nChina orders evacuation of blast area over fears of toxic contamination", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T18:16:13.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
