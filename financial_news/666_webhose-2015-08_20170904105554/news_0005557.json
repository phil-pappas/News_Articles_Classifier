This is what we believe in and this informs everything we do. \n'We handle everybody entrusted to our care with the utmost respect, mindful of the fact that this body once housed the soul and spirit of a fellow human being. \n'Our goal is to provide bereaved families with the most comprehensive and complete funeral services that meet all acceptable international standards,' he emphasized. \nThe facilities of Lashibi Funeral Home, which has been in existence for 15 years, are unmatched in Ghana. \n'When our cemetery becomes operational later this year, we would be able to offer our clients all funeral-related services, including excellent facilities for custodial care, cremation, an inter-denominational chapel, burial and final rites all on our premises at Lashibi. We are confident about what we do and shall continue in our efforts to maintain the standards our clients have come to expect.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T03:51:39.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
