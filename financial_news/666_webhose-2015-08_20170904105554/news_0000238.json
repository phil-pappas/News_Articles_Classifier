That index remains in the trading range (2040-2135) that has contained it for most of this year. There is support at or near the lower end of the range (last tested in early July), and there is resistance near the top of the range (last tested in mid July). As long as SPX remains in this range, one is forced to have a neutral outlook on the market. \nThe equity-only put/call ratios are bullish. Both are dropping sharply now, after having rolled over (i.e., generating buy signals) at relatively high levels on their charts â€” especially the standard ratio, which exceeded its highs of last October. \nMoreover, the Total put/call ratio has given an official buy signal as well. We had declared the buy signal last week, and now it is official (actually, doubly official). The 21-day moving average of the Total put/call ratio has closed below 0.90, so that is an official buy signal. Moreover, it topped out at 0.938 on July 27, and that peak will surely be in place for 10 days (or more), so that is also an official confirmation of a buy signal. A Total put/call ratio buy signal has a target of a 100-point gain for SPX. To continue reading, please subscribe. Already a Subscriber?
