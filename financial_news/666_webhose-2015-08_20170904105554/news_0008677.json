Glenn Hunt by Trevor Hoey The release of a better than expected annual result came just in time for Medibank Private shareholders who had watched its share price slump from a high of $2.59 in mid-February to a recent low of $1.99.\nAs Australia's largest private health insurer with a market share of about 30 per cent and annual revenues in excess of $6 billion the group was seen as bullet-proof when it listed. However, the health insurance industry is changing rapidly and competition is heating up, factors that could potentially erode Medibank's market share and place pressure on margins and earnings.\nWhile Bell Potter conceded there were some negative aspects in relation to the fiscal 2015 results, it described the overall performance as overwhelmingly positive. The operating profit of $329 million was 7 per cent ahead of prospectus forecasts, and the broker upgraded earnings per share forecasts for 2016 and 2017 by 4.6 per cent and 14 per cent respectively in anticipation of robust margin improvement.\nBell Potter was also impressed with the net claims expense numbers, which came in at 4.3 per cent. The broker highlighted this was well below recent industry data estimates that showed claims inflation was more than 7 per cent.\nHowever, analysts at UBS aren't nearly as upbeat about the stock despite having increased their 12-month price target from $1.80 to $2. This compares with Bell Potter's price target of $2.63.\nUBS's James Coghill has a sell recommendation on the stock. While he conceded there were positive aspects in relation to margins and claim costs, it is more the industry and its changing landscape that is of concern.\nOn this note Coghill said, \"We can't ignore the multitude of seemingly unique industry challenges that Medibank Private faces and the upcoming renegotiation of its two largest hospital contracts.\"\nHe said the price-earnings multiple of circa 20 does not recognise some factors beyond the group's control, and also pointed to historical margin volatility that has historically been a feature of its main business.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:01:01.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
