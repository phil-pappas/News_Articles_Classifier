This week, the bank will need to take a stand on how long the effect of strong sterling will last. \nThe BoE's rate-setters must decide whether the effect of cheaper imports and reduced demand for British products abroad will last long enough to justify a cut to its forecast for inflation in two years' time. Private-sector economists would usually interpret this as a sign that the bank is unlikely to raise interest rates in the coming months. \nHowever, some policymakers might still want to tighten policy if other factors - such as the speed at which wages are rising, relative to a small recovery in productivity - point to underlying price pressures in the slightly longer term. \n\"At that point, the decision on what to do with interest rates becomes more complicated,\" said Robert Wood, a former BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) forecaster who is an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nWhile the BoE typically ignores factors with a brief impact on inflation such as swings in oil and food prices, big currency moves are on the borderline between a short-term and a long-term factor. \nBritish inflation is currently forecast to bounce back from zero to its target of 2 percent within two years. But if Thursday's forecasts show this may take rather longer, the chances of a rate rise before early next year will fade. \nSPLIT EMERGING? \nBoE policymakers have already disagreed on how much the strength in sterling is likely to offset the impact on inflation of rising wages, according to minutes of their meeting in early July, and some are expected to vote for a rate hike this week. \nGovernor Mark Carney struck a more cautious note on July 16, saying an 18 percent rise in sterling over the past two years could have a \"sizeable\" and \"potentially protracted\" effect. \nThe need for a rate hike should become clearer around the end of the year, he said. \nThis week, he is likely to be wary of driving sterling up by talking up the prospect of a British rate rise while the timing of a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve remains uncertain. \nThe last time Britain was hit by a similar-sized currency shock - when sterling weakened by more than a quarter at the start of the financial crisis - the impact on inflation lasted much longer than the BoE forecast at the time. \nThis time, import prices have fallen by less than the BoE expected. But policymakers might decide the impact of sterling strength is simply taking longer than usual to have an effect. \n\"Pass-through is one of those movable feasts,\" Wood said. \"It can be bigger or smaller depending on the state of the economy at the time. It's very hard to predict.\" (Editing by William Schomberg and Hugh Lawson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:22:57.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
