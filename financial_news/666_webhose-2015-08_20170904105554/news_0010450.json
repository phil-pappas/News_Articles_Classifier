The issue was linked to the income Tesco makes from deals with suppliers. \nThe company subsequently changed its auditor and placed nine senior staff on leave, with six stepping down. \nMr Clarke's replacement, Dave Lewis, took over just weeks before the black hole was found. He set about shaking up the company, including how it deals with suppliers. \nTesco has said it will try to recover Mr Clarke's £1.2m pay-off if evidence reveals that there was gross misconduct during his leadership of the supermarket. \nThe group also faces a multi-billion pound legal battle with shareholders over the black hole. \nTesco's shares rose 2.66pc to 191.55p on Thursday. They have fallen more than 6pc since the black hole was revealed. \nTesco declined to comment on the interviews, which were first reported by Bloomberg . The SFO did not return calls for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:30:54.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
