This policy has become its political strategy which is being executed with more power and commitment by Congress in the monsoon session,” it said.\nIt said Prime Minister Modi’s “increasing popularity” has become a “pain in the eye” of Congress.\n“This is unfortunate that a party with 130 years of history and which has ruled the country for over five decades has not been able to get over its shameful loss in 2014. It has not been able to digest the full majoirty given to Narendra Modi by people,” it said.\nOn the Congress demand for the resignation of Swaraj, Raje and Chouhan, it said there is no basis for it.\n“In the same way there is no ground for the resignation of Raje and Chouhan and the BJP Parliamentary Party is standing by them,” the resolution, proposed by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and passed at the meeting, said.\nIt also defended Speaker Sumitra Mahajan’s decision yesterday to suspend 25 Congress members, saying it was done under “dire” circumstances as they exhibited disrespect to the Chair and ignored her requests for not carrying placards.\nIt said the BJP Parliamentary Party was surprised that Sonia Gandhi had called it a black day for democracy.\n“This is unfortunate that the Congress party which trampled democracy in 1975 by imposing Emergency and snatched away the citizen’s liberty is making such unfounded claims,” it said, citing expulsion of 63 opposition members from the House on March 15, 1989 over their demand that Justice Thakkar commission report on Indira Gandhi’s assassination be tabled.\nThe parliamentary party passed another resolution hailing the “historic” Naga peace accord, and said it was long-awaited and would usher in an era of peace and security in the north-east region.\nIt also took note of the efforts of successive governments which “crystalised” under the present dispensation.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh spoke about the accord, signed yesterday, and his ministerial colleague Nirmala Sitharaman proposed it, Naqvi said.\nHe said Jaitley spoke about the key reform bills like GST while Parliamentary Affairs Minister M Venkaiah Naidu highlighted the “negative” Congress politics which has resulted in a washout of the Monsoon Session so far.\n“Congress is insulting the people’s mandate. The Modi government will be unaffected by it and continue to walk on its development path,” Naqvi said.\nFirst Published on August 04, 2015 2:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:06:23.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
