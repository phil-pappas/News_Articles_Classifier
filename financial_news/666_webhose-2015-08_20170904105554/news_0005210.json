Blue (OTC BB: BUES - news ) -chips in France, Germany and Italy were 0.1 percent to 0.3 percent lower. \nBritain's FTSE underperformed, down 0.4 percent as sterling strengthened. The foreign exchange move distorted the calculation of the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index to leave it up 0.2 percent at 1,535.46 points, even though benchmark national indexes fell. \nTraders said volumes were in Europe, with only 63.5 percent of the 90-day average volume traded. Surprisingly weak U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . data released on Monday also weighed on sentiment. \nPan-European equities are down some 7 percent since peaking in April. Greece's debt drama and jitters over China's allowing its currency to weaken have offset the European Central Bank's asset-purchase programme and one of the best earnings seasons in five years. \nA Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager poll showed that European stocks remain the favoured global trade among participants, although investors avoided stocks with exposure to China. \nChinese stocks fell on Tuesday, re-igniting fears that Beijing may intend to devalue its currency further. \nSwiss-listed luxury brands Swatch and Richemont , which have substantial exposure to China, fell 1.8 percent and 1 percent respectively. Energy and mining stocks were also hit by a dip in oil and metals prices. \n\"We do not consider this policy move to presage a substantial devaluation of the Chinese currency,\" said Michael Stanes, Investment Director at Heartwood Investment Management. \n\"We think the markets have overreacted to the move and developments might even afford opportunities in currency and financial markets most exposed to the renminbi's (yuan's) performance.\" \nOutperformers in Europe included Wirecard and Denmark's Jyske Bank, up 8.1 percent and 4.6 percent respectively after quarterly results. \nSwiss chocolate maker Lindt & Spruengli saw its shares hit record highs after better-than-expected earnings. \nGerman utility RWE fell 3.3 percent, with broker downgrades from SocGen (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) , RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) and Berenberg sending the stock to an all-time low. \n\"Weak power prices and adverse guidance at H1 results drive 20-30 percent cuts to longer-term EPS forecasts... (A) dividend cut also seems unavoidable,\" analysts at RBC said in a note. \nThe Athens stock market dipped into negative territory a day before a German parliamentary vote on Greece's new bailout plan. Germany looks certain to approve the plan, although a significant minority of Chancellor Angela Merkel's German conservatives are expected to oppose it. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T21:20:23.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
