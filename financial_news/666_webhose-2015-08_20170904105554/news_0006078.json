And governments have been less able to manage negative externalities,” he said. \nJean Pierre Elong-Mbassi, Secretary General of UCLGA, said the freshly updated ‘Agenda 2063’, discussed at the recent AU summit in June, sent a strong message of the Africa envisioned in the future.“It spurs all of Africa’s people to play an active role to ensure a positive socio- economic transformation of Africa within the 50 years ahead,” said Elong-Mbassi. \nAfricities will lead the way in establishing the African Union High Council of Local Authorities. \nThe statute to establish the council is currently in draft form, and Elong-Mbassi says there was a strong push from his organisation to make the council a reality by the end of 2016. More than a 1 000 mayors are expected to join the seventh Africities summit. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7693   Africa & World , Featured , Finance .
