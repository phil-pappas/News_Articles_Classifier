REUTERS/Mike … \nBy Keith Wallis \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell in Asia on Monday as traders took profits, snapping gains last week that saw the biggest two-day rally in six years. \nBrent crude futures for October delivery slipped nearly $1, or 2 percent, putting the benchmark on track for its fourth straight monthly decline, having risen in only two of the past 14 months. \n\"There is definitely a lot of profit taking going on,\" said Daniel Ang, an analyst at Singapore's Phillip Futures. \n\"There is some readjustment in the positions taken by traders,\" he said. \nThe fall came after Brent climbed 10 percent last week, while U.S. crude finished the week up 12 percent. \nBrent fell 98 cents to $49.07 per barrel as 0329 GMT after rising $2.49, or 5 percent, in the previous session. \nU.S. crude for October delivery fell 78 cents to $44.44 per barrel after settling up $2.66, or 6.3 percent, in the previous session. \nMixed signals by U.S. financial policymakers last week on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next month was weighing on sentiment, Ang said. \nSome Fed policymakers left the door open to a September interest rate hike at an annual central bankers meeting on Friday in comments that appeared to contradict those by the New York Fed president earlier in the week who said a rate increase seemed \"less compelling\". \nThe comment came after turmoil in global markets in recent weeks following China's currency devaluation and concerns over its slowing economy. \nInvestors are eyeing a slew of economic data, including key U.S. non-farm payroll data, later this week that could give direction on a possible U.S. rate hike when Fed policy makers meet on Sept. 16-17. \nA rate hike is expected to support the U.S. dollar, making commodities including oil more expensive for users of other currencies. \n\"We believe that bearishness is still in play,\" Phillip Futures said in a note on Monday. \nPrices could test technical support at $48.50 a barrel for Brent and $44 a barrel for U.S. crude. \n\"If prices hold above these levels, there is a chance that prices could move higher this week, which should hinge on optimistic nonfarm payrolls,\" Phillip Futures said. \nThe market is also watching the outcome of planned United Nations-brokered talks later this week between Libya's warring factions aimed at forming a unity government. \nLibya posted a budget deficit of 4.5 billion dinars ($3.3 billion) in the first seven months of 2015 as oil production fell and weak oil prices weighed, the Tripoli-based central bank said on Sunday. \n(Reporting by Keith Wallis; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T07:03:05.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
