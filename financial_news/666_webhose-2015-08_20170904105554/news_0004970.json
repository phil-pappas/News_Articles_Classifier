Melissa Adams Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan The race for the next Speaker is hotting up with Victorian MPs Tony Smith and Russell Broadbent as well as South Australia's Andrew Southcott tipped as the front runners.\nBut why is it such a coveted job?\nCash The Speaker is the sixth best paid person in Parliament with a salary is $341,477.50, up from the normal parliamentarian salary of $195,130, and more than some ministers.\nIn addition to the extra $146,347.50, and depending on your time in service, there is the comfort of a hefty pension when it all comes to an end.\nIt's capped at 75 per cent of the Speaker's salary, something now former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop can look forward to.\nHaving been in Parliament more than 18 years, Mrs Bishop is entitled to 75 per cent of normal parliamentarians' salary, plus more for holding the office of Speaker and Minister during her time on the hill.\nJunkets One former Senate President, a role on the same level as Speaker, Margaret Reid, famously flew 691,000 kilometre on the taxpayer purse - enough to send her to the moon and back - costing the public $345,000 in her six years.\nNot to be outdone, just last year, Mrs Bishop took six overseas trips, costing $308,961.14.\nSpeakers represent Australia at such democracy-promoting ventures as the World Conference of Speakers of Parliament and the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the latter of which Mrs Bishop had hoped to lead.\nConsidering her time served, Mrs Bishop will also qualify for the Lifetime Gold Pass scheme, giving her 10 free domestic return flights a year.\nWhile the trips cannot be for a \"commercial purpose\", their cost is not capped and can include holiday travel.\nCorner office Maddeningly for Parliament's office yoga fanatics or party animals, the Speaker also has one of the biggest offices in Parliament.\nDespite it being technically within the rules, Bronwyn Bishop came under fire from other former Speakers for hosting Liberal Party fundraisers in the Speaker's suite\nThe benefits do not end there.\nWithout a portfolio or a department to answer to and therefore no unpopular decisions to make, some see Speakers as having less responsibilities than Ministers, some of whom are paid less than them.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/ParlRemEntitlements#_Toc362601581", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bronwyn-bishop-would-retire-on-a-salary-of-225000-a-year-plus-free-flights-20150805-gis178.html", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/choper_update_hype/index.html", "http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1314/ParlRemEntitlements#_Toc362601593", "http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/library/prspub/UU1T6/upload_binary/UU1T6.pdf;fileType=application/pdf#search=%22retirement%20travel%22", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/speaker-bronwyn-bishop-under-fire-for-hosting-liberal-fundraisers-in-her-parliament-house-office-20140524-zrn5n.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T07:03:15.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
