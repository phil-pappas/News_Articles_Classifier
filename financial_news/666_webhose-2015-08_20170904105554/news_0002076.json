Bloomberg by Lisa Murray Angus Grigg The fallout from China's decision to further weaken its currency went global on Wednesday, pushing everything from Apple shares to the oil price sharply lower as markets adjusted to Beijing's abrupt change in foreign exchange policy.\nThe yuan's devaluation pushed the Australian dollar to a six-year low of US72.6c and the local share market was off 1.6 per cent , amid concerns Beijing's policy change was in response to a weaker Chinese economy.\nThese fears were partially realised on Wednesday afternoon when growth in industrial production and fixed asset investment were lower than expected. They followed a worrying trade report over the weekend, which showed exports in July fell more than 8 per cent compared with a year ago.\nThe Chinese yuan has lost 3.5 per cent of its value over the last two days, raising the spectre of a global currency war as rival economies scramble to maintain their competitive edge .\nOfficial figures show growth in industrial production has stalled, adding to worries in Beijing over the state of the economy. Bloomberg More to come The chief economist at ANZ, Warren Hogan, believes China will weaken its currency by as much as 10 per cent in a bid to stimulate growth.\n\"I think they [Beijing] are going to target at least a 7 per cent to 10 per cent drop in the real effective exchange rate over the next few months,\" Mr Hogan said via phone from Sydney.\nHis view is shared by Credit Suisse, which believes the yuan will fall between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.\n As the Yuan weakens China's imports will cost it more - putting downward pressure on demand for Australian iron ore, copper and coal. Carla Gottgens While there were reports that state-owned banks were buying the currency to slow its fall, the yuan dropped 1.4 per cent in onshore markets on Wednesday. If the central bank sticks to its policy of referring to the previous day's market close, that suggests the yuan will be weakened again on Thursday.\nThe surprise change in Beijing's exchange rate policy, which has caught markets off-guard, pushed the oil price to a six-year low of $US43.08 a barrel.\nTraders are betting a lower yuan will crimp demand for oil in China, the world's second largest consumer, as the economy slows.\nConsequences spread ANZ's Warren Hogan predicts the Central Bank will encourage the currency to fall by up to 10 per cent. Bloomberg Commodities from copper to corn were also weaker , while shares in Apple fell more than 5 per cent as investors worried the technology giant would suffer from iPhones becoming more expensive for buyers in China, its biggest growth market.\nOver the past year, China has kept its currency relatively stable to the US dollar compared to other countries in the region because it was worried about capital outflows. That reduced the competitiveness of its export sector, which is also struggling from sluggish demand.\nOn Tuesday, the PBOC effectively abandoned that policy , opting instead to bring the yuan closer to its market price and change the way it sets the currency's level in the future. Investors will still be limited to trading within a 2 per cent band either side of the mid-point set by the PBOC. However, the central bank will refer to the market close in setting its daily level, which will allow the currency to drift lower in coming months.\nThis change will complicate a pending decision by the US Federal Reserve on when to raise interest rates. It could also trigger retaliatory moves from other countries in the region.\nCurrency war? The first of these came on Wednesday, when Vietnam announced it would allow its currency to weaken, by widening the trading band to 2 per cent. This follows Hanoi devaluing the Dong by 1 per cent in January and May.\nThe Indonesian Rupiah touched a 17-year low on Wednesday, the Singapore dollar was at a five-year low and the Aussie dollar was at its lowest level since 2009.\nHowever, China insisted it wasn't opting into any currency war. Rather, it was implementing an important financial reform.\n\"China is not waging a currency war; merely fixing a discrepancy,\" the official state-owned news agency Xinhua said in a comment piece published on its website.\n\"The central parity rate revision was designed to make the yuan more market-driven and in line with market expectations. The lower exchange rate was just a byproduct, not the goal.\"\nThis appeared to be backed up by endorsements from both the International Monetary Fund and ratings agency Standard & Poor's. The IMF said it was \"a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate.\"\nIn a statement it said: \"China can, and should, aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate system within two to three years.\"\nS&P said it \"could help maintain the flexibility of the country's monetary policy as cross-border financial flows increase.\"\n\"We believe the increased exchange rate flexibility could also prevent the build-up of risks to the sovereign credit rating.\"\nMr Hogan from ANZ said China's central bank was forced to make what it called a \"one off adjustment\" as the Euro and Yen weakened this year.\n\"China's relative competitiveness has taken a hit,\" he said.\nThe chief economist at the PBOC, Ma Jun, told the official People's Daily that China's weakening of the yuan should not be seen as the beginning of a devaluation trend.\nHe said the move was designed to close the gap between the official rate set by the central bank each day and where the currency was trading in onshore markets.\nThe PBOC set the yuan reference rate 1.6 per cent lower on Wednesday at 6.3306 to the US dollar. That followed Tuesday's surprise record devaluation, when the so-called \"fix\" was set 1.9 per cent lower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:04:25.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
