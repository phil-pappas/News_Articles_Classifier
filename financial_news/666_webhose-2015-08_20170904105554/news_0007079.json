Koskei comes from Nandi and was nominated to the Cabinet by Ruto. \nThe opposition chiefs, led by Raila, are all set to storm Western Kenya to explain why the Uganda sugar deal is bad for this country. \nBungoma Senator Moses Wetang'ula, whose home county is at the heart of the sugar belt, launched a withering attack on President Uhuru Kenyatta, rubbishing the deal as a ploy to secure a market for Brookside Limited, a dairy corporation majority owned by the Kenyatta family. \n\"The agenda is very clear; secure a safe market for Brookside; a Kenyatta family dairy consortium, regardless of how much it harms the ordinary poor sugar farmer in the Western sugar belt,\" Wetang'ula stated.?? \n\"That is why the government is willing to consider bailing out Kenya Airways, which has a whopping Sh29 billion debt, but not to release Sh5 billion to Mumias. For Kenya Airways it's a bailout, for Mumias it's a loan repayable with interest.\" \nThe President has been dangling the carrot - including a Cabinet appointment and a number of plum parastatal jobs - to woo Western, a region that overwhelmingly voted for Raila, his 2013 presidential rival. \nHead of the Cord secretariat Norman Magaya said that the rallies are set for next weekend because of the ongoing ODM retreat at the Maanzoni Lodge that ends today.? ?\"We have to explain to residents why the sugar deal is sour,\" Magaya told the Star. \nThe rallies will be held in Bungoma, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Busia, Kisumu, Migori, Narok and Kwale. \nYesterday, Ruto concluded a three-day political fire-fighting mission in Western, where he tactically downplayed the impact of the sugar deal, instead turning the blame on the Cord team.?? \"Those who are screaming loudest are responsible for the collapse of the sugar industry and are hiding behind the name of poor farmers who are suffering,\" Ruto claimed. \nJubilee is determined to expand its territory to give it a convincing lead in 2017. However, the Cord brigade is clutching to the deal, which appears to be a public relations disaster for the ruling coalition, to gain some political mileage. \nSources told the Star that the trade agreement would make it to the ODM agenda in Maanzoni, with possible strategy discussions on how to use it to turn the tables on Jubilee. Kenya \nThe Ministry of Health has released a list of sweets, cakes and biscuits that it says are laced with bhang. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star. All rights reserved.
