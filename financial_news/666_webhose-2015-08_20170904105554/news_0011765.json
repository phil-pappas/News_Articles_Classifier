Reuters At least eight listed Chinese companies released statements to say their directors were buying shares and economists from HSBC and Capital put out reports suggesting the sell-off was overdone.\nHowever, all of this failed to lift sentiment as investors instead focused on the government's apparent policy shift to take a more hands-off approach to the market. After intervening heavily in early July to support the market by clamping down on short-selling and establishing special state funds to buy shares, the government has now wound back its support.\nIt said earlier this month it would only intervene when there was \"unusual volatility\" or \"systemic risk\".\nStill, some analysts believe that while the government has refrained from high-profile and dramatic intervention, it is working behind the scenes to support the market.\n \"Some blue-chips were up during the day and I think there may be state capital behind that,\" said Zhang Qi, an analyst with Haitong Securities. \"The government might take a different approach than in July but it will play a role in addressing the slump.\"\nThe Shanghai Composite is now down 42 per cent from its peak on June 12. At that time, an army of new traders and an expectation of ongoing interest rate cuts had driven the market to its highest level in seven years, up 152 per cent in just 12 months. The government appeared to be supporting the bull-run, publishing a series of positive articles in the state-run media.\nHowever, growing evidence of China's economic slow-down coupled with a crackdown on margin finance prompted investors to start pulling their money out of the market and that has accelerated in recent weeks as the government unwound its support.\nThere is ongoing debate about how big an impact falling equity markets will have on China's real economy.\nUBS economist Tao Wang said in a research note the weak market would probably shave off up to half a per cent from growth in the second half. Still, she expects the government will \"do whatever it takes to stabilise growth at 6.5 to 7 per cent.\"\nThis would be focused on \"mobilising resources for and implementing infrastructure investment,\" she said.\nThe People's Bank of China is also expected to lower interest rates or cut the banks' reserve requirement ratio.\n\"We see downward risk to our 6.8 per cent growth forecast for 2015, but believe that the recent recovery of property sales has reduced the risk of a sharp hard landing in the real economy this year,\" Ms Tao said.\nHSBC's co-head of Asian Economics Research Frederic Neumann said: \"it's difficult to see officials allowing the economy to slide further without some countervailing action.\"\n\"These [actions] might be less effective than in the past -- debt, after all, is already uncomfortably high,\" he said. \"But they will not pass without at least some positive impact on demand.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T13:06:43.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
