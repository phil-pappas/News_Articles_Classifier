The higher fixing came after the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) reassured financial markets by pledging to seek a stable currency after a shock devaluation of nearly two percent on Tuesday. \nThat cut, and two subsequent reductions. sent global financial markets into a tailspin as it raised questions over the health of the world's second-largest economy and sparked fears of a possible currency war. \nBy Friday on the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three months edged up to $5,165 a tonne from $5,162 a week earlier. \nThree-month aluminium dropped to $1,572.50 a tonne from $1,594.50. \nThree-month lead grew to $1,742 a tonne from $1,693 \nThree-month tin gained to $15,520 a tonne from $15,305. \nThree-month nickel decreased to $10,545 a tonne from $10,845. \nThree-month zinc slid to $1,839 a tonne from $1,853. \n- Sugar low - \nSUGAR: Prices fell to 10.37 US cents a pound in New York -- the lowest level for seven years before firming thanks to a stronger Brazilan real currency, traders said. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, London's futures exchange, a tonne of white sugar for delivery in October dropped to $349.20 from $358.50 one week earlier. \nOn the ICE Futures US exchange, unrefined sugar for October fell to 10.59 US cents a pound from 10.87 cents. \nCOCOA: Futures were mixed amid weakening demand. \n\"The high prices along with continuing economic worries around the world, but especially in the EU and China, keep demand ideas weaker,\" said Price Futures Group analyst Jack Scoville. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, cocoa for delivery in December slipped to £2,036 a tonne from £2,043 a week earlier. \nOn ICE Futures US, cocoa for December rose to $3,055 a tonne from $3,028. \nCOFFEE (NYBOT: KC-ZK15-c.NYB - news ) : Prices gained. \n\"The main support came from continued hot and dry weather in Brazil,\" said Scoville. \nBy Friday on LIFFE, Robusta for delivery in September climbed to $1,716 a tonne from $1,649 one week earlier. \nOn ICE Futures US, Arabica for December stood at 142.25 US cents a pound compared with 126.60 cents for the September contract one week earlier. \nRUBBER: Prices fell on a drop in demand from China and India. \nOn Friday, the Malaysian Rubber Board's benchmark SMR20 dropped to 133.65 US cents a kilo from 140.75 US cents a week earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T01:29:50.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
