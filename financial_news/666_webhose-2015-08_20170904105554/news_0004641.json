Tony Robbins sits atop an estimated net worth of $480 million according to Forbes, owns or is a partner in several companies, wrote several best-selling books, and provides life coaching to CEOs, political leaders and more. \nBut for all his advice on how to make lots of money, Robbins likes to spend money, too. Some of the things he buys are luxurious, some are not, and some are for other people. Here’s a list of some of Robbins’ favorite things to throw his money at. 1. A Resort in Fiji \nThe Namale Resort and Spa in Fiji is not just the life coach’s favorite spot in the world, he owns it too. It’s also living up to Robbins’ high success standards. The five-star, all-inclusive resort is award-winning and was featured as one of “Oprah’s Favorite Things” in 2012. 2. Mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. \nDespite reportedly being on the road 200 days a year, Robbins calls his $24.75 million waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., home. With a guesthouse, a 165,000-gallon infinity pool, and a master bedroom balcony overlooking the Atlantic, it’s a nice place to spend a third of the year. The life coach told Fortune magazine, “I’m a freak for the ocean. It energizes me.” 3. More Real Estate \nIn addition to his Florida mansion, Robbins owns a few other homes. He owns one in Palm Springs, Calf., one in Sun Valley, Idaho, and one in a small town outside of British Columbia, Canada. \nRead: What a Million-Dollar Home Looks Like Around the World 4. Cryotherapy \nRobbins might have a warm disposition, but he likes to get his body cold. Really cold. To reduce any chance at disease-inducing inflammation, Robbins exposes his body to -220 degrees Fahrenheit a few times a week for three minutes with a cryotherapy unit in his Florida home, reports Fortune. 5. Plunge Pools \nCryotherapy is not enough for the master of motivation. He also has a 57-degree plunge pool in every one of his homes and his Fiji resort. “I start [the day] with something to strengthen and jolt my nervous system every day,” he told author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss. 6. A Private Jet \nRobbins could probably afford a $65 million Gulfstream jet, but as he points out in his new book, “Money: Master the Game,” at $2,500 to $5,000 per hour, it’s fiscally smarter to charter one. Robbins has said that his move from flying commercial to flying private jet was the single best move he made for his productivity, reports Business Insider .

And apparently Robbins does too. In his book “Awaken the Giant Within,” he wrote that he has his own. At one time while living in California, he even commuted in it. 8. A Soccer Team and Stadium \nAlong with a slew of other investors, such as NBA legend Magic Johnson and entertainment mogul Peter Guber, Robbins agreed to spend a total of $250 million for the rights to start a Major League Soccer team in Los Angeles, including the construction of a new stadium in South L.A. The team is expected take the field in 2018, reports ESPN. 9. Salad and Fish \nRobbins takes his health as seriously as his speaking by avoiding alcohol, caffeine, red meat and chicken — he’s a salad, fish and grains guy. Although he and his wife might enjoy an occasional dessert, Robbins avoids sweets most of the time. 10. Feeding Hungry Families \nThe nonprofit Anthony Robbins Foundation gives assistance to inner-city youth, seniors and the homeless, and also feeds more than three million people globally with its Basket Brigade. As if that isn’t enough, Robbins made a 50 million meal-matching gift to Feeding America in 2014. At a dollar a meal, that’s $5 million he donated. 11. A Beach House for His Mom \nRobbins has been fairly outspoken about his tumultuous relationship with his mom, but apparently that’s well behind him: He bought her a beach house. “When people say money doesn’t matter, it sure as hell does when you’re able to show your mother a beach house and then hand her the keys to it,” he told Playboy magazine in 2013. “That was one of the happiest moments of my life.” \nKeep reading: Tony Robbins’ Best Advice for 30-Somethings 12. Scuba Diving & Snowboarding \nRobbins has said that his love of the ocean runs deep and apparently, he means that literally. Robbins and his wife enjoy scuba diving. And they should since Florida has great diving, and their resort in Fiji boasts diving adventures. Robbins and his wife also like to venture into the mountains for a little snowboarding. 13. Hot Fudge Sundaes \nThe master of motivation, cryotherapy, Fiji, and his diet does have an Achilles’ heel: the $10 hot fudge sundae at the Palm Beach Grill. He told Palm Beach Illustrated that the tasty dessert was his guilty pleasure. “It’s deadly,” he said. “It’s hard to go there and not have it.” Discipline, Tony, discipline…", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T13:59:03.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
