Photo: Cole Bennetts\nFor the most part investors are looking for a snapshot of how the company grew its all-important mobiles business, how much it managed to curb the fall in its traditional fixed line voice unit and whether the newer growth divisions had progressed towards making a meaningful contribution to the earnings of the very large mother ship.\nLastly, investors are always keen to feel some generosity in dividend payment and are on the lookout for any capital management initiatives.\nWhile the 3.5Â¢ dividend represented an increase over last year, the company failed to deliver any capital management treats and gave no indication that it was considering any more in the near term.\nThe mobiles business grew retail subscribers by 664,000 which was fairly impressive.\nHowever, it was noteworthy that the rate of growth slowed in the second half - in part because Apple's iPhone 6 was launched in the first half.\nBut Telstra is clearly disinclined to forecast whether the rate of new subscribers will increase.\nThe new mobile customers acquisition was clearly a major factor in the overall 10 per cent improvement in revenue over the year, which was also assisted by healthy improvement in average revenue per user and a reduced rate of churn.\nThe mobile result was pleasing given this is the division that has come in for more intense competition during the year.\nDespite that competition, Telstra has been able to hold its margin on sales at 40 per cent.\nWhether this margin can be preserved in future, in the face of additional competition and ongoing investment in the network, remains to be seen.\nTelstra said several times on Thursday that its focus was on growing revenue in this division and that subscriber numbers would become a less important measure as the trend to connect other devices, like tablets, continued.\nAlready Australia has one of the world's highest levels of smart phone penetration at about 80 per cent.\nSo gains in revenue will increasingly rely on customer's spending and increasing their usage.\nTelstra's fixed line voice business revenue fell by 7 per cent but this represented the smallest decline in five years. The decline was also partly offset by a similar percentage increase in fixed data revenue.\nThe up-and-coming Telstra business grew well with the international business (ex CSL) adding around 30 per cent in revenue, a more subdued growth outcome from its media division and the Network Application Services revenue kicking in another 23 per cent - albeit all the divisions are improving off relatively low bases.\nFuture focus As with all results, the focus will now be on what the Telstra management team can produce in the current and future years.\nIt is a pivotal time for Telstra. It is parading its new management team around, but the parade brings with it all the attendant uncertainties about how the vast cash flow will be invested or gifted to shareholders.\nNo one was really expecting any capital management initiatives to be announced on Thursday, so this is unlikely to be a source of investor disappointment.\nWhat investors are keen to get is a sense of how the hundreds of millions of dollars coming from the NBN deal are going to be spent.\nIn the 2015 year these various NBN contributions topped $800 million and they will only increase over time.\nPenn said Telstra's capex to sales ratio would move up from 13.9 per cent in 2015 to 15 per cent in 2016. Sales are forecast to grow from $26.6 billion by mid-single digits in 2016 - so let's assume 5 per cent.\nPenn made it clear that Telstra was particularly keen to invest in networks - especially the mobile network - in order to maintain its lead over rivals.\nThere was lots of discussion around investment in new business and acquisitions - an issue that can tend to spook investors.\nEighteen months ago when the previous chief executive David Thodey mentioned an aspiration that \"at least a third of our revenues and profits came from offshore by some period out to 2020 and beyond\" the market went into a tailspin and the company ultimately distanced itself from the remarks.\nDespite Thursday's solid result Telstra's share price fell by around 2 per cent by lunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:50:04.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
