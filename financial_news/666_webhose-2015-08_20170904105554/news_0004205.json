(VER), formerly American Realty Capital Properties, disclosed that the management team had fudged the books.\nSome saw the cracks forming early as the previous CEO (and founder) Nicholas Schorsch – the ringleader – began to transform the small-cap REIT into the “world’s largest net lease company”. By orchestrating high-level financial engineering, Schorsch set his sights on trophy transactions racking up a showcase of acquisitions including CapLease, Cole Capital, Inland (assets), and the latest prize, $1.5 billion of Red Lobster properties.\nWith very little focus on quality, Schorsch and his team grew into a massive net lease machine, adhering to a management style of always putting management first.\nForbes Real Estate Investor\nEarn safe, reliable income with the help of veteran real estate expert Brad Thomas in Forbes’ newest advisory Forbes Real Estate Investor . As a dedicated REIT analyst, I was on the ground examining all of the components of VER, trying to assess the durability of the enterprise. Admittedly, that was a difficult task, almost like trying to work on a racecar while sitting in the back seat when moving over 200 miles per hour.\nI was fortunate to stay focused on meaningful analytics and just six days before the accounting scandal broke, I hit the brakes as explained “enough already”. On October 23, 2014 I wrote, “I will not be suckered into a trap where my principal is not safe…Mr. Market has warned me by providing a signal that I should proceed with caution. I’m sitting on the sidelines for now”. I warned, “ I’m not investing another nickel in ARCP until I see more clarity”.\nThen on October 29 th (just 6 days after my harbinger article ), the music stopped as VER’s Audit Committee disclosed accounting irregularities. The company’s dividend payout ratio was already at an elevated level, but with the mis-stated earnings disclosed it was clear that the organization was cooking the books.\nWhat had taken around four quick years to create was suddenly shattered – shares in VER fell around 25 percent in one day and the finger pointing game commenced. Within a matter of weeks the CEO, CFO, and COO were released and the chairman and founder, Nicholas Schorsch, went absent without leave.\nAs a normal course of events most of the retail investors ran for the hills and the activist hedge fund investors began to circle the wagons. The shares became cheap and when the Board decided to suspend its monthly dividend payments the fear grew.\nWith no real leader steering the distressed vessel the Board attempted to guide the wreckage until a CEO was named.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://seekingalpha.com/article/2586625-is-american-realty-capital-properties-a-sucker-yield-bet"], "published": "2015-08-13T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T23:59:20.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
