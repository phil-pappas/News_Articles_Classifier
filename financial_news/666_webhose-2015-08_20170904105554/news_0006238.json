The Canadian Automobile Association's (CAA) driving cost calculator puts the average yearly cost to drive a compact car like a Honda Civic 20,000 km a year in Ontario at about $9,200 for fuel and insurance, licence, registration, depreciation and maintenance.\nMove up to a mid-size car like a Nissan Altima and the cost for the privilege of driving your own car accelerates up to $10,726. Moving up another notch to a full-size model like the Chrysler 300 will set you back $12,776 a year and an executive model like an Audi A6 comes with a yearly operating price tag of $19,235. An SUV like a Chevy Equinox will siphon $12,953 each year from your budget.\nIt doesn't always make sense to own a car. Not only are they expensive they also can be inconvenient, particularly in a city with limited parking and lots of choices for alternative transit.\nOne of those alternatives is car sharing which has been growing in popularity over the last few years.\nCar sharing originated in Europe where many larger cities are highly congested and came to Canada in the mid-1990s. It allows you to rent a car on a short-term, as needed basis paying for the time you have the vehicle and the mileage you drive. Drivers join a club that owns a large fleet of cars and then pay a usage fee whenever they want to drive those cars. Any single car in the fleet might be used by hundreds of people who pay a flat fee per hour or day but they never have to worry about maintenance, the price of gas or insurance.\nThere are one-way and two-way car sharing business models.\nIn the original two-way model club members pay a token annual membership fee and then pay an hourly or daily rate to collect a car from a designated parking space and then return it to the same place.\nThe newer one-way model allows pre-registered drivers to search for the nearest car on their smartphone, book it and pay for it by the minute, then leave it wherever they wish within a designated area when they're finished.\nThere are a number of advantages to car sharing including more careful consideration of the necessity, duration and distance of trips resulting in decreased use of the vehicle, greater consideration to alternative modes of transportation such as transit, biking and walking, cost and energy savings and air quality benefits.\nHow prevalent is car sharing? The Transportation Sustainability Research Centre (TSRC) in Berkeley, CA reports that as of October 2012 car sharing was operating in 27 countries and five continents accounting for an estimated 1,788,000 members sharing approximately 43,550 vehicles.\nAs of January 2014, 224,523 members shared 4,174 vehicles among 19 car sharing organizations in Canada and in the U.S. 24 car sharing programs claimed 1,228,573 members sharing 17,179 vehicles.\nBesides car sharing, the CAA suggests some other measures you can take to still enjoy driving without buying a car.\nIf you just want to drive offer yourself to a delivery service like Canada DriveAway or Cars to Florida. You have three days to deliver a vehicle to someone in the U.S. or take it home for them and you'll earn a few hundred dollars in the process to cover your expenses.\nGo around a dealership showroom and take a car or two out for a test drive. You need a licence and a sales person might come along with you for the ride.\nYou can always rent a car if you need one or simply borrow a friend's car, although if anything happens and you're in an accident you might lose a friend.\nTalbot Boggs is a Toronto-based business communications professional who has worked with national news organizations, magazines and corporations in the finance, retail, manufacturing and other industrial sectors.\nCopyright 2015 Talbot Boggs\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:00:34.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
