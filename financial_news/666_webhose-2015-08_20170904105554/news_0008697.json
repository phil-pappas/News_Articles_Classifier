Growth in imports should however be contained by the steady decline in international oil prices‚ which average $52bn in July compared to an average of $65bn in Q2.15.\n\"Relatively soft domestic consumption and investment demand should also keep import growth in check. Export growth is at risk of underperforming in line with the broad downturn in global trade‚\" Kaplan says.\nPrivate sector credit extension growth‚ she adds‚ may have moderated slightly to 8.0% year on year in July from 8.1% year on year in June.\n\"Credit extension to both households and corporates is at risk of having eased given depressed business and consumer confidence and a particularly weak economic growth backdrop in a rising interest rate environment.\"\nThe generally weak global trade dynamics‚ Kaplan says‚ are also likely to be reflected in the SA manufacturing PMI survey for August‚ which is due for release on Tuesday.\n\"Specifically‚ the July global PMI showed that the global economy started the third quarter on a softer footing with new export orders contracting. Compounding the effects of the challenging global economic backdrop are local electricity supply constraints‚ high operating costs‚ weakening momentum in domestic consumption expenditure and suppressed activity in the allied mining industry. The PMI for August is expected to have remained relatively unchanged at around the 51 mark‚\" Kaplan says.\nAlso due for release on Tuesday are the new vehicle sales figures for August. Kaplan notes that the decrease in the rate of credit granted for new vehicle purchases also continues to slow.\n\"Specifically‚ growth in household vehicle finance‚ eased to 3.4% year on year in June from double digit rates last seen in the first quarter of 2014. This has contributed to the contraction in the growth of new car sales in every consecutive month since March 2015.\n\"The outlook for the domestic new vehicle sales market is likely to remain weak as consumers delay purchases of big-ticket items at a time when employment prospects are uncertain‚ the cost of living has increased and debt servicing costs are rising‚\" Kaplan.\nThursday sees the release of the Standard Bank August PMI as well as the August SACCI Business Confidence Index and electricity consumption and production data for July.\nRDM Newswire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:10:45.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
