Meanwhile, a weak energy sector has been dragging down construction equipment sales.\nThe company's stock fell $4.05, or 4.5 percent, to $86.60 in premarket trading.\nThe Moline, Illinois-based company earned $511.6 million, a 37 percent drop from the same period a year earlier. Earnings of $1.53 per share surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1.47 per share.\nThe company reported an 18 percent drop in revenue to $6.84 billion in the period, which fell short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $7.11 billion.\nDeere reduced it's outlook for 2015 net income to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion.\nDeere said industry sales for agricultural equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to be down about 25 percent for 2015. Worldwide sales of construction and forestry equipment are forecast to be down about 5 percent for the year.\nDeere shares have risen 2.5 percent since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has decreased 1 percent. The stock has climbed nearly 6 percent in the last 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:54:25.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
