As part of Clearview’s Members Matter Celebration and Thanks a Million Initiative, Clearview member Shannon Taylor attended Training Camp on August 6, 2015 in Latrobe, Pa as a VIP guest. She and her family were able to experience special meet and greet opportunities with a variety of players and radio personalities throughout the day. In addition, Shannon and her family were able to observe various training camp activities, all at an up-close view from the sidelines of the practice field.\nShannon has personally raised nearly $20,000 to help find a cure for Multiple Sclerosis since her diagnosis in 2011, and as a way of thanking her for her membership and community involvement, Clearview made a donation to The National Multiple Sclerosis Society and gave her a much needed break with tickets to camp, followed by an upcoming Steelers football game.\nAnother longtime Clearview member, Ed Ames, celebrated his 63rd wedding anniversary with his wife Whaneta earlier this year, and Clearview surprised them with a little party at their Brentwood Branch. But the thanks and celebration didn’t end there. Since Ed spent his retirement as an usher for his beloved Pittsburgh sports teams, Clearview sent him to see a game in person once again and throw out the first pitch at the baseball game on August 3rd. After the first pitch, Ed and his family members met up with some of his old friends and coworkers while they enjoyed watching the remainder of the game from a suite within the ballpark.\n“It’s been such a thrill to see the looks of surprise and excitement on our members’ faces over the past few months, and we hope they know how much we appreciate them,” said Clearview President/CEO Mark Brennan. “They’ve been loyal for over 60 years, and it feels great to go above and beyond to show them how much they matter to us.”\nIn addition, the member surprises continue to happen at other locations as well. The Clearview Ca$h Crew was busy surprising members with $50 bills over the past week at Primanti Bros. Restaurant and Bar in Moon Township, Pa, as well as at various Clearview branches throughout the Pittsburgh area. Overall, the Ca$h Crew has given away over $31,500 to members this year. Since January, Clearview has given gifts and cash to over 15,000 members.\nFor additional information about the Members Matter Celebration and Thanks a Million Initiative, including photos, videos and more, visit Clearview Federal Credit Union on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nClearview Federal Credit Union has been in operation since 1953 and serves about 90,000 members, with reported assets valued over $965 million as of June 2015.
