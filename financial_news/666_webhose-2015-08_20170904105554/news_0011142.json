Then it acknowledged this could not be done and said it could be transferred to another beneficiary. As I am both the executor and beneficiary of the estate I was not prepared to have this done. Now I really am concerned what will happen when this bond matures next April. Also I am miffed that meanwhile the dividends and vouchers have not been paid and that I do not have a yearly transaction statement. Any help would be much appreciated. BB, WILTS Under the terms and conditions of the scheme for these John Lewis Partnership Bonds, only £10,000 can be held by a single individual. So your existing holding, of which Capita says it was initially unaware, precludes your late husband’s bond being transferred to you. Capita says that, because of the hold on the account, the statement you were looking for was not sent out automatically. Now, further to my involvement, a manual statement has been posted to you. Capita had said that any accrued interest payments and gift vouchers would only be released when the bond matured in 2016. As a special concession though John Lewis now agrees to release the £320 interest and the vouchers, worth £200, to you at once. You will still have to wait until the bond matures for the capital. • ' Registrar won’t update address for my BT shares' • 'I can't transfer my Santander shares' You say this has been dealt with badly. The versions of what happened differ somewhat. You state that you had already told Capita twice that you had a bond in your name. This doesn’t, though, seem to be reflected in Capita’s records of what was said. Capita does acknowledge, however, that its communications have not always been clear but would like to assure you that at no time did it intend to cause you any upset at this difficult time. John Lewis has now sent another £150 on a John Lewis gift card over and above the vouchers that were due. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:13:50.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
