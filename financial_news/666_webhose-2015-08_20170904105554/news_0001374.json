The short interest, or the amount of short positions held by investors that are uncovered, amounted to 10% of the outstanding shares of the average energy company on the index opposed to 4.5% for the overall index. \nIn the upcoming parts of this series, we’ll analyze the 2Q15 performance of oil majors BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A).
