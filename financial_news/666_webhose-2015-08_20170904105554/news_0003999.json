According to the bank, all offer applications and payments received prior to the injunction will however remain valid until otherwise determined. \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had, however, described the interim injunction place on the IPO of adb as normal development that only shows the country’s capital market is growing. \nAccording to the SEC, it is in the interest of the market for all parties to allow the court process to take its course. \nHead of the legal department at adb, Maxell Kofi Amoako after the rulings said, “They [UNICOF] came to court to stop us from proceeding with the IPO. The court says no, the bank stands to lose larger as against their level interest. So what it means is that ordinarily we should be able to proceed with the IPO.” Meanwhile, Counsel for UNICOF, Lawyer Charles Bawaduah has hinted that they “will appeal the case.”\nUNICOF had earlier secured a 10-day interim injunction order from an Accra High Court against the adb’s IPO. \nThe Director General, AduAnaneAntwi had explained, saying that; “We ourselves as SEC were sent to court over the HFC but we still waited for the court to make its decision, and then we went back to work. So in the same vein, let’s allow the court processes to go through and then we shall all be winners.” \n“I can tell you that cases in the U.S are many – about hundred times if not thousand times more than in Ghana because our market is small, you don’t have many of this cases. But as we are developing, and we are getting more companies and more investors coming in, there is a likelihood that some people will raise some issues about some of these developments but it’s all part of the process. \n“And it’s also positive because after we have gone through them, the people are happy that in Ghana when there are issues about investment and securities, they go through the court for resolution,” he concluded. \nThe SEC is the regulatory institution for the capital market that approved ADB’s Initial Public Offering after the due diligence. Mr. AduAnaneAntwi emphasized the SEC is officially unaware of the concerns of the workers because such internal issues are considered a part of the requirements for approval of an IPO. \n“If workers had a case pending in court, that’s when it would have been disclosed in the prospectus for investors to know and make informed decisions during the IPO. But this is not a court case and so whatever concerns may not be too relevant. I don’t even know exactly what the workers’ concerns are but our job is to ensure that adequate disclosure of information is made by the company to enable investors make a decision in buying the shares,” he said. \nWorkers of adb have been agitating and calling on the government for the removal of the managing director and the board of the bank accusing them of conflict of interest and financial impropriates. \nThey also wish the board and management decision to list on the stock exchange be abandoned, but their efforts seem flawed as more strategic and key stakeholders of the bank are not in support of the workers attempts to stop the listings. \nThe bank is expecting to raise GHc300million to recapitalise and improve its operations to keep the institution in tune with current banking trends. \nBut, in efforts to pursue their demands on the government, the staff union of the Bank adopted several approaches to frustrate the top management’s decision to go ahead with their planned listings; among them was a nationwide sit down strike by all workers and court actions. \nHowever, the management of the embattled Bank challenged the sit-down strike as illegal. \nThe staff union explained that, they have been compelled to take the decision due to government’s unwillingness to ask the MD and the board to step aside as the Bank of Ghana investigates allegations of financial malfeasance and conflict of interest leveled against them.
