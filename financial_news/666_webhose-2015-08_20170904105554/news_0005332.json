Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nChallenger's annuities will be available on two of wealth giant Colonial First State's platforms on Monday after nine months of development, as adviser demand for retirement income products gain traction.\nChallenger's products have been added to CFS's FirstChoice and FirstWrap platforms – marking the first time the listed annuities giant's offerings are opened up to advisers through an investment platform.\nNicolette Rubinsztein, general manager retirement at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said the increased focus on longevity risk was one of the key reasons behind the bank's wealth arm push to add annuities to its platforms.\nFinancial advisers are on the hunt for new areas to invest their clients' funds and generate income during retirement. Photo: Rob Homer\n\"We think we need to make it easier for advisers and investors to invest [in annuities],\" she said.\nAdvertisement \"It's really about … giving them longevity risk protection but also protection against other risks,\" Ms Rubinsztein said, pointing to volatile markets affecting investment returns.\nThe addition of annuities to CFS's platforms come as financial advisers hunt for new areas to park their clients' funds and generate income during retirement.\nAdvisers using annuities double since 2012 Research by Investment Trends found that almost 60 per cent of advisers are using or planning to use annuities this year, which is more than double the level recorded in 2012.\nData from Marketing Pulse found that 65 per cent of advisers believe annuity sales would increase if they were made available on major platforms.\nOut of that, 66 per cent believe recommendations would increase by 10 to 20 per cent if they were accessible on platforms.\n\"From the industry's point of view, particularly around the retirement phase, you've had all these recommendations made by [financial system inquiry chairman] David Murray about retirement. It's about retirement income – not lump sum balances,\" Paul Rogan, Challenger's chief executive of distribution, said.\n\"This is an important development, with the leading provider of retail investment platforms. It is part of a growing superannuation industry trend to make retirement income strategies more readily available,\" he said.\n'Significant IT build' ﻿ The Challenger rollout comes two months after CommInsure's annuities were added onto the same two platforms.\n\"There's a significant IT build,\" Ms Rubinsztein said of the nine-month technology rollout.\n\"What we've effectively done is the ability to apply for your annuity, then get reporting of your annuity on your platform.\"\nMr Rogan said Challenger was in \"significant discussions\" with other wealth groups, including other major banks, to have their annuities added to their platforms.\nThe annuities provider, which has a market valuation of $4 billion, is also wading into the industry fund sector. The company struck a deal earlier this year with VicSuper to white-label its products for the super fund's members.\nSuperannuation fund administrator AAS, which provides services to 10 million members, also partnered with Challenger this year to make annuities available on its platform.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T01:51:55.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
