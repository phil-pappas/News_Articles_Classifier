Turkish Broker Integral Menkul Degerler Signs With Fenerbahce One of “the big three” clubs in Istanbul has become the company’s official partner opening the door to the popular world of football Advertising Print This Post \nOne of the biggest forex brokers in Turkey, Integral Menkul Degerler has become the latest firm from the industry to venture into the vast world of football sponsorships. The company has signed a two-year deal with one of “the big three” rival football clubs in Turkey’s biggest city with a population of almost 14 million. \nAfter Integral Menkul Degerler was sponsoring rival basketball team of Besiktas for two years, the broker decided not only to change the sport but also the club it is supporting. Istanbul is notorious for the rivalry between “the big three” clubs in the city – Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce. \nIntegral Menkul Degerler is firmly committed to continue targeting the crowds in the biggest city in Turkey with sports sponsorship deals. The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but it will last for two seasons throughout the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 Turkish Super League tournament. \nBefore committing to this new sponsorship deal the brokerage has been supporting the basketball team of Besiktas for a duration of two years. \nThe new CEO of the company Kivanc Memişoğlu commented that the company wants to commit to a football sponsorships after a series of negotiations. Integral Menkul Degerler becomes the sponsor of the current runner-up in the Turkish Super League. \nBolstering the football club’s chances for championship win this season, the team attracted star striker from Manchester United, Robin van Persie and Portuguese national Luis Nani. \nAfter being banned from participation in European tournaments for two years, Fenerbahce is aiming to make a comeback into the UEFA Europe League. \nIn addition to Fenerbahce, Integral Menkul Degerler is also committed to sponsoring women’s basketball team BGD and an amputee footballers team. Both initiatives will remain unscathed by the deal with Fenerbahce. \nFootball sponsorships remain a particularly popular online and offline advertising method for forex brokers and the local market in Turkey is no exception. The only downside to such deals is that in a country, and in this case a city, which is characterized by passionate football supporters, fans of the other two clubs from Istanbul – Besiktas and Galatasaray may be turned away from working with the broker. \nThat said in the tight regulatory environment within which it is operating, Integral Menkul Degerler has proven to be a very successful company with solid reputation amongst traders and industry peers alike.
