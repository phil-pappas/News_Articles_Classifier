That is putting pressure on US companies, who complain that the US tax code is hurting their ability to compete globally.\nWill new rules curb all tax inversions? Nah Steve Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank said the Obama administration had been distracted by efforts on Capitol Hill — so far fruitless — to overhaul tax laws as part of an infrastructure bill.\n\"But who's to say Congress will do anything? We've been waiting for a decade. It behoves Treasury to write [more anti-inversion] regulations on their own to the extent they can,\" he said.\nThe White House would not comment on specific companies, but a spokeswoman said President Obama had made clear that Congress needed to act to close \"one of the most unfair tax loopholes that allows\" inversions.\n\"While [Treasury secretary] Jack Lew has announced steps that the Treasury department is taking to reduce the benefits of this loophole, only Congress can close this loophole entirely, and the president continues to call on Congress to act,\" she said.\nWhile Coca-Cola Enterprises has not operated in the US since 2010, the US-based company with the exclusive licence to bottle Coke products in several western European countries has built a large overseas cash pile.\nIt will be able to access its non-US profits at a much lower rate than if it were to repatriate the funds. Coca-Cola Enterprises will own 48 per cent of Coca-Cola European Partners, which will be formed from a combination with its Iberian and German counterparts.\nMeanwhile, CF Industries has the highest tax rate among its peers at 35 per cent. The deal for OCI will allow it to lower that rate to 20 per cent, the company said.", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/10fd9c9e-3c2a-11e5-bbd1-b37bc06f590c.html", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e1ba6eb0-ca5c-11e4-b8ff-00144feab7de.html", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c310e9d2-3c38-11e5-bbd1-b37bc06f590c.html"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T11:23:21.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
