Yet, the Committee has received allegations that the evidence illustrates that she claimed to be, and in fact was, on leave on numerous occasions. If true, then she should not have been entitled to the cash value of her ‘unused’ leave balance,” he alleged.\nGrassley sent similar letters to the Office of Inspector General for the Department of State (OIG) and Abedin asking for more detailed information.\nGrassley also alleged that Abedin went on a ten day trip to Italy and France with her husband during her time as a Department employee.\nHowever, her time and attendance sheets allegedly indicated that she worked full time, he alleged.\nIn his letter, Grassley alleged that Abedin while at the State Department simultaneously worked for two other companies.\nWhile she was serving at the State Department as a close associate of the then Secretary of State, Abedin during the same period was also employee of Teneo and Clinton Foundation.\n“This started as an inquiry about whether a federal personnel designation works as intended,” Grassley said.\n“Now, more details are coming in, and they warrant more questions. The bottom line is still whether the taxpayers are well-served by agency practices and spending. No one will know for sure until the State Department is more transparent about how it operates,” he said.\nFirst Published on August 04, 2015 11:50 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:10:08.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
