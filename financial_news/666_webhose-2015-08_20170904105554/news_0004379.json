Boost Oil Industry \nHowever, civil society groups working for the promotion of transparency and accountability in the country's extractive industries had, in a memo to the international EITI Chair, Clare Short, declared support for government on the issue. \nThe groups hailed the decision as the best for Nigerians, as the former Board consisted of persons with partisan leanings, who lacked the capacity to act independently and neutrally on transparency and accountability issues in the industry, with little or no interest on EITI/NEITI. \nCiting Section 7 of the NEITI Act 2007, which stipulates that a \"person appointed as a member of the NSWG shall hold office for 4 years, and no more\", the politicians in the Board had insisted on a reversal of the decision to sack them, alleging violation of the law on Board tenure. \nDespite that there is no specific provision in the law tying the government's hands from taking the decision it did, the politicians were still hopeful that the EITI would intervene to pressurise government to rescind the decision. \nBut the International EITI Board, in a circular to all EITI member countries, a copy of which was seen by PREMIUM TIMES on Saturday, urged all parties to see the dissolution of all Boards of government agencies and parastatals, including NEITI's as normal. \nThe circular issued by Ms. Short made it clear that \"there was nothing unusual for new governments to choose boards that would reflect the character and vision of the new administration\". \nThe EITI Chair said the sacking of the NEITI Board should be seen as part of the determination by President Buhari's administration towards reforms in the sector. \n\"The international Board does not see any immediate need to interfere in the on-going reforms embarked upon by the Muhammadu Buhari government in Nigeria,\" Mrs. Short said. \nShe said her interaction with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, during her recent meeting in Abuja in June, had reinforced the confidence of the global transparency group in Nigeria's commitment to the principles of the international EITI. \nWhile expressing optimism that the government's process for engaging a new NEITI board would allow civil society and other constituents to freely choose their representatives as required by the EITI guidelines, the International Chair said she would continue to monitor the development to ensure that NEITI did not continue for too long without a Board. \nA source close to the presidency, who would not want his name revealed, as he was not authorised to speak officially on the issue, told PREMIUM TIMES on Monday that the NEITI Secretariat has already written to the president on the need to ensure that the board was reconstituted as soon as possible. \nThe source said the NEITI letter signed by the Executive Secretary, Zainab Ahmed, drew the president's attention to important schedules in the transparency agency's calendar that require a functional Board to be in place. \nApart from the pending process to commission fresh audit exercise for both the oil and gas and the solid mineral sectors, Nigeria is expected to play host to all EITI members countries expected to converge on Abuja in January 2016 for the crucial global EITI compliant re-validation exercise. \nRevalidation is an independent evaluation process to assess the level of compliance by EITI-member countries with the implementation principles and standards to promote transparency and accountability in the management of extractive industries revenues. \nNigeria, which became an EITI-compliant country since March 2011, has since grown over the years to occupy a prominent position in the international transparency group, having produced about 13 EITI Reports among 39 countries that have published findings on government revenues from its natural resources. \nThe EITI has 48 Implementing countries, out of which 31 are currently compliant with the transparency group's requirements and principles.
