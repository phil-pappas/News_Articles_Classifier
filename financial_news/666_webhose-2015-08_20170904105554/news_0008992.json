It features revolutionary Thermal Flavor Extraction(TM) technology, which delivers a variety of sizes and styles while achieving the perfect brew richness level every time. Ninja has completely reinvented the traditional drip coffee maker by designing a machine that unlocks coffee grounds' full flavor potential and provides smooth, rich and well-balanced hot and cold coffee and specialty drinks. \nA native Colombian, Sofia is a passionate coffee lover. So, when SharkNinja CEO, Mark Rosenzweig, invited Sofia into the development process for the groundbreaking new Ninja Coffee Bar, she jumped at the opportunity to help develop a coffee machine that would enable her to enjoy the full flavor potential of coffee. \nWith its Auto-iQ(TM) One Touch Intelligence Technology, the Ninja Coffee Bar delivers customizable options for smooth, rich coffee in a cup, travel mug or carafe. \"When Mark told me about their plans to create the Ninja Coffee Bar, I knew I had to get involved from both a personal and business perspective,\" said Vergara. \"This is the best coffee I have ever made on my own and the best coffee machine I have ever used.\" \nAccording to Luis Balaguer, CEO of Latin World Entertainment, \"SharkNinja is a company known for innovation, market dominance, and customer satisfaction. They truly share Sofia's passion for both coffee and creating products that enhance the lives of their customers. A perfect partner for the Sofia Vergara lifestyle brand.\" \nThe Ninja Coffee Bar also makes refreshing iced coffee by allowing users to dial up the richness of their coffee to offset the dilution caused by melting ice. By dialing up the richness even further, the consumer can make both hot and cold specialty coffee drinks traditionally served only in coffeehouses. Vergara continued, \"I never even thought it was possible to make a great iced coffee at home! Why go out and spend a lot of money when you can make amazing coffee drinks in your own home? I'm thrilled to be collaborating with SharkNinja to bring delicious coffee and specialty drinks to kitchen countertops all over America.\" \n\"Offering Classic Brew, Rich Brew, Over Ice Brew and Specialty Brew, The Ninja Coffee Bar will not only transform the coffee industry, we believe the new technology we've developed together will truly change the way consumers make--and drink--their coffee,\" said Rosenzweig. \"The Ninja Coffee Bar will help coffee lovers create delicious, rich, smooth coffee, iced coffee and coffeehouse-style specialty drinks to enjoy at home and on the go.\" \nThe Ninja Coffee Bar is available at major retailers nationwide, starting at $139.99MSRP. \nFor more information about the Ninja Coffee Bar brewer and additional SharkNinja products, please visit http://www.ninjacoffeebar.com ; you can also learn more at Facebook.com/NinjaCoffeeBar and @NinjaCoffeeBar on Twitter. \nAbout SharkNinja \nSharkNinja is an innovative leader in the housewares industry and creator of the familiar household brands Shark(R) and Ninja(R).
