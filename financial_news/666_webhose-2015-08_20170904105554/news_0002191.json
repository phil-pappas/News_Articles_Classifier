That means they comply with ability-to-repay standards but are too large to be backed by state-sponsored mortgage firms.\nThe Fed survey covered the second quarter of 2015, and included the responses of 71 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.\nThe U.S. mortgage market bears some of the more enduring scars of the 2007-09 recession. According to the Fed survey, banks said standards for residential real estate loans, as well as for consumer loans for subprime borrowers, were \"at least somewhat tighter\" than has been normal over the long run.
