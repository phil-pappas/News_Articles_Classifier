Legislators spent part of the day squabbling over bills that died or that lawmakers are trying get passed on the last day. \nThe House on Monday voted down Senate-passed budget cuts by an overwhelming 92-2 vote. \nHouse Speaker Mike Hubbard says he is urging Gov. Robert Bentley to give lawmakers some time to work out an agreement before calling a second special session. \nRepublican Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh says he is baffled that some House members seemed angry at the Senate since House members did not approve any revenue bills. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:33:22.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
