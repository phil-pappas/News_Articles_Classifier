It only updates its holding once per year. \nSpokespeople for Daewoo International, Posco and Genting all declined to comment. IJM was not immediately available for comment. \nFollowing the latest announcements there were 64 companies on the exclusion list, which also includes mining company Rio Tinto and retailer Wal-Mart. The fund owns stakes in about 9,000 other firms globally.
