Twenty-First Century Fox got hammered with the rest of the media space yesterday, but bulls were still able to turn some fast money in the name.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker detected the purchase of about 6,000 August 31 calls mostly for $0.15 to $0.20 as the stock was down 12.55 percent near its lows of the day, under $28. This was clearly fresh buying, as open interest in the strike was just 138 contracts before the session began.The calls rose as the stock bounced above $30 a few hours later, swelling above 8,000 in volume by the end of the day and tripling in value from the initial trades that were cited on our InsideOptions Pro premium service. That percentage gain illustrates the leverage that options can provide, as shares rose only about 7 percent in the same time. Long calls lock in the price where traders can buy a stock, which lets them position for a rally with limited capital. That can be safer than purchasing shares directly because only the cost of the options can be lost on a pullback. The calls can be sold anytime before they expire but will lose value if the stock falls. (See our Education section)FOXA ended the session down 6.42 percent to $29.87 after beginning the week well above $34. The stock gapped lower two mornings in a row, first following the drop by industry bellwether Disney and then after the media company lowered its own guidance.Total option volume in the name topped 37,300 contracts, 8 times its daily average for the last month. Overall calls outpaced puts by more than 3 to 1.
