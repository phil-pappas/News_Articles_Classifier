The London-traded stock of KazMunaiGas Exploration Production rose 8.8 percent. \nCentral bank Governor Kairat Kelimbetov appeared unruffled by Thursday's sharp market-driven drop in the currency, saying he expected the market would set \"a fully balanced rate\" in five or seven days. \n\"This is not a devaluation, this is a transition to a freely floating rate when the market itself determines a balanced exchange rate,\" he told a news conference broadcast from the capital Astana. \nHe also said the central bank would no longer intervene massively to influence the tenge rate and the bank and government said the country's economic policy would henceforth be based on inflation targeting. \nThat brings Kazakhstan's policy more into line with Russia, whose central bank floated the rouble late last year and announced a shift to an inflation-targeting regime, but still periodically reacts to bouts of rouble weakness. \nThe government may trim its budget spending this year, Masimov said. He said next year the cabinet would not borrow on foreign capital markets to bridge the fiscal gap of the state budget, which would be based on a \"conservative scenario\" of $40 per barrel oil. \nBut the government also had no plans to open the \"rainy day\" National Fund, which collects windfall oil export cash and is now worth $69 billion. \n\"We think the worst times may yet come, and we will need the National Fund then,\" he said.
