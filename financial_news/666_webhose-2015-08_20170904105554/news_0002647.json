Wall Street stocks, which often move inversely to Treasuries, were mostly higher. \nAs investors shifted to riskier holdings, yields on German Bunds and other top-quality government bonds rose. German 10-year bond yields were 4 basis points higher at 0.64 percent . \nYields on the comparable 10-year U.S. Treasury were last up 6 basis points at 2.187 percent, reflecting a drop in price of 15/32. \nThe 30-year Treasury was off 25/32 in price and yielding 2.8573 percent after a government auction of $16 billion of 30-year bonds. \nThe five-year Treasury, a maturity especially sensitive to Federal Reserve interest rate policy shifts, was last down 10/32 in price and yielding 1.5691 percent as bets rose on a September rate increase. \nTreasury yields also got lift from a government report that retail sales rose 0.6 percent in July. The data depicted solid U.S economic momentum and bolstered expectations of a Fed rate hike as early as next month. \nIn the final leg of a $64 billion quarterly refunding, the U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday sold $16 billion in 30-year bonds to average demand, Treasury data showed. The Treasury paid a 2.88 percent yield, the lowest in four auctions and below the 3.084 percent yield realized in July. \nThe Treasury Department on Wednesday sold $24 billion in 10-year notes to weak demand, resulting in it paying a higher yield to investors than the market expected.
