Advertising Print This Post CLS, a provider of settlement services for the FX market, and LCH.Clearnet, a multi-asset clearing house, today announced that they are working with to develop a service to facilitate the settlement of cleared FX instruments via ForexClear . The new service is said to be consistent with goals set out by the G20 to promote clearing of standardized derivatives. It will be open to all central counterparties (CCPs) and will cover a range of cleared FX products, including OTC and exchange-traded FX options, FX futures and cross-currency swaps. The options settlement service is targeted to launch in 2016, subject to regulatory approval, with the intention to expand to cover other FX products in line with demand. It will also provide a specialized payment-versus-payment (PvP) settlement in all CLS-eligible currencies and will operate separately from CLS’s main PvP settlement service. According to the firms, the new service will also deliver a number of risk benefits to participants. In the event of a clearing member failure, payment netting will substantially reduce the size of the participating CCP’s potential liquidity shortfall, mitigating systemic liquidity disruption. The service is designed to work on an all-or-nothing settlement basis, which minimizes the risk arising from partial or incomplete settlement. David Puth, CEO of CLS, commented: “This is an important milestone in the continued development and safeguarding of the global foreign exchange market. We look forward to working in partnership with LCH.Clearnet, which is ideally placed to develop this service. We have been working with the CCP community and other industry stakeholders to design and model the most effective way to mitigate settlement risk for cleared FX products. Settlement risk is one of the most significant risks in FX. Our priority is to mitigate this risk, while increasing operational efficiency through our technology and connectivity.” Gavin Wells, Global Head of ForexClear, at LCH.Clearnet, added: “We are delighted to be working with CLS on this initiative. We continue to see increased demand from the market for FX clearing, as firms are keen to benefit from the associated capital efficiencies and improved risk management associated with clearing. The new CLS settlement service is integral to our plans to broaden our service offering by adding products involving physical FX settlement.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T14:10:47.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
