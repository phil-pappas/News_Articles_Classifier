Photo: Xinhua \nAs bad debt ripples inland from China's eastern manufacturing centres, provincial \"bad banks\" are not far behind. \nChina's banking regulator has handed out licences to governments in the autonomous regions of Ningxia in western China and Guangxi in the southwest to operate asset management companies. The so-called bad banks buy up and restructure bad debt in the hopes of paring down asset deterioration on the balance sheets of rural credit cooperatives and local banks. \nHubei in central China, northeastern Jilin and coastal Shandong were also recently licensed to operate asset management companies, state media reported, bringing the total count of licensed provincial handlers to 15 in about a year since licensing started. The inland provinces of Sichuan, Shanxi and Jiangxi were preparing to license, state-backed Securities Times reported. \nExperts said the latest deteriorations in the west and southwest showed the widening scope of the bad-debt burden that banks and local governments shoulder into the second half of this year. \n\"If you compare the first batch to the third batch, the first is focused on the coast but the third has moved inland,\" said Wilson Pang, a Shanghai-based partner in KPMG China's restructuring practice. \"It's a sign that asset deterioration has spread from the coast.\" \nThe first wave of licences for provincial asset managers was approved by the China Banking Regulatory Commission in July last year for China's crucibles of asset deterioration: Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Anhui provinces along with one in the Shanghai municipality. Another five were added last November to the municipal governments of Beijing, Tianjin and Chongqing as well as Fujian and Liaoning provinces, all growing centres for troubled loans. \nLocal-level asset managers existed before the licensing of the companies. \nLicences have allowed the firms to buy bad debt directly from banks in the same way that China's four central asset managers ran the shop for a decade and a half. Before provincial asset managers were licensed, they bought local-level distressed debt from centrally controlled companies such as China Cinda or China Huarong, particularly soured loans from rural credit cooperatives too troublesome for the big firms to unwind. \n\"Licences cut out the middleman,\" said Nicholas Zhu, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service. \"But this is generally the very local debt that [the central asset managers] don't have the resources to deal with.\" \nThe rollout of the provincial asset managers across China was closely connected to the ambitions of the provincial leaders, and whether they had the financial expertise to run such businesses, Zhu said. \nThe licences allow the firms to delve into not only the primary distressed debt market, but also into areas such as merger and acquisition and public-private partnership. China's official non-performing loan count for commercial banks hit 1.09 trillion yuan at the end of June, an increase of 11 per cent from March, the CBRC said on Monday. That puts the commercial banking sector's non-performing loan ratio at 1.5 per cent at the end of the first half of the year, up from 1.39 at the end of the first quarter. \nMuch of the deteriorated assets local asset managers clean up are not captured in those figures because rural credit cooperatives, where a large amount of local-level debt is concentrated, is not included in commercial bank data. Rural financial institutions comprised about 13 per cent of China's banking system at the end of June.
