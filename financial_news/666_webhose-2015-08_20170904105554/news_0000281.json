I’m certainly no exception.\nI have three boys. Between them running around and playing with each other, I try to teach them some lessons.\nWhy? Because I want to ensure I give my kids every chance possible at following in my footsteps to become millionaires.\nI’m not one of those parents who will demand that their children attend an Ivy League college or start a business because I think it’s the best thing for them to do.\nInstead, I’m going to try and model some best practices and habits that will hopefully influence them to strive for success in every area of their lives. And when they get knocked down, I’ll teach them to get back up.\nIf you have children, I’m sure you can identify with these reasonable ideals.\nSo, how exactly will I encourage my kids to follow in my footsteps? Here are some of the lessons I’ll teach them:\nLesson 1: Don’t Be Afraid to Fail\nEkaterina Walter, a contributor for Forbes, Quote: d Jack Canfield in an article that included some powerful Quote: s on failure:\nEverything you want is on the other side of fear.\nI remember there was a period of time when I was cold calling to acquire business. I literally got rejected 100 times per day. My biggest win? I was able to get one person out of 200 to accept my business card in the mail.\nI learned a valuable lesson during that difficult time: every “no” is one step closer to a “yes.” Keep on trying. Don’t give up. Find someone who will do business with you.\nThe fear of failure is one of the primary reasons why so many people don’t make it in business. They get rejected multiple times and then their fear gets bigger and bigger. Understandably so. Trust me, I understand rejection. But you know what you have to do when you get rejected? You have to shake it off and move on.\nIn fact, that’s my next point.\nLesson 2: Shake Off Rejection\nThere’s always going to be a hater. How do you silence the haters ? Just don’t listen to them.\nThat’s right. You need to ignore the haters. Here’s what I mean . . . .\nIt’s inevitable that my kids will encounter bullies in school. While it’s important that they don’t let bullies walk all over them, they need to ignore them in the sense that they need to focus on what matters: success. They can’t let bullies stop them from studying, from working hard, and from doing the right thing.\nThe same lesson applies to adults. I know that if I would have listened to some of the haters in my life, I would have not written my book “ Soldier of Finance “, started a business, or joined the National Guard.\nThe trouble is that it’s not always easy to identify who the haters are. Sometimes they are acquaintances, and other times they’re actually friends and family. Sometimes, people think they’re being helpful but they’re really not.\nSome people don’t want to see you succeed because it makes them feel bad about themselves.\nDon’t underestimate the power of this lesson. If you don’t shake off rejection, you won’t do anything in life because there will always be someone who disapproves of what you’re doing.\nLesson 3: Screw “The Man”\nWhen you work for someone else, you’re working for “The Man.” It’s not always easy to do this. After all, as an employee you can’t implement your own policies – you have to follow the policies of your boss. And sometimes, those policies are difficult to swallow.\nIf you’ve ever worked in a retail store or a restaurant, I’m sure you’ve encountered a situation where you desperately wanted to do the right thing for a customer but your hands were tied because of some sort of policy. Yeah, maybe your boss let you make an exception for the customer, but it still made you look bad. No fun.\nIf these points aren’t the most compelling reasons to convince my kids to consider venturing out on their own, there’s one reason that might grab their attention: money. As a business owner, you have the opportunity to make more money than you could ever make as an employee.\nI remember when I had gotten so fed up with compliance that I founded my wealth management firm, Alliance Wealth Management. Stepping out on my own was the best decision I could make: both financially and relationally with my clients.\nLesson 4: Take Some Daring Risks\nThere are so many ways in which I want to protect my children. But the thing I need to be careful of is not to discourage them from taking calculated risks. For example, climbing a tall tree for fun has very little reward and a whole lot of risk.\nHowever, being creative with a science project that the teacher may or may not not like: that has future potential. Who knows, it’s possible for kids to come up with breakthrough ideas – why not let them give it a shot?\nLife is full of risk. Risk is everywhere. In fact, it’s pretty scary to think about what lurks behind every bend. Some risk is in our control, and other kinds of risk really aren’t.\nIn order to get ahead in the business world, it’s important to take some daring risks. I don’t mean people should do anything illegal, I just mean people should venture out when unreasonable fears start to creep in.\nI remember when I started a professional blog I actually had no blogging experience. I thought blogging was doing something on MySpace. Seriously. Was starting a blog with no experience a risk? Absolutely! What is worth it? You bet it was!\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0814433286", "http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/gf%C2%A2-041-how-to-silence-your-haters-and-shake-it-off-shake-it-off/"], "published": "2015-08-05T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T01:04:43.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
