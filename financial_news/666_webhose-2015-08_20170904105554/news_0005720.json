Photo: Erin Jonasson\nThere's just one subtle difference between the Reserve Bank's full submission to the House of Representatives economics committee inquiry into housing ownership and the opening statement to the committee by the RBA's financial stability department head, Luci Ellis , but it's a telling one.\nMost of the headlines that greeted the submission last month focused on the RBA's acknowledgement that negative gearing played a role in boosting investor demand and that it should be considered in a broader taxation review. The sun also rises in the east.\nThe current moves to hose down some of investors' enthusiasm isn't about helping would-be first home buyers into ownership.\nWhat was often played down in the reports at the time is that the RBA fingered the concessional tax treatment of capital gains at least as much. It was the interaction of our CGT discount and negative gearing that needed examination.\nOn Thursday morning, Ms Ellis' prepared remarks for the committee did not mention negative gearing but did include CGT.\n\"Investor interest in property has been especially strong in recent years, no doubt partly encouraged by low interest rates and the prospect of [concessionally taxed] capital gains,\" she said.\nReserve bankers tend to use words more carefully than most. I suspect it's no accident that CGT was singled out and negative gearing was not.\nBut it also would be wrong to focus too much on CGT when looking for someone or thing to blame for housing being expensive. There was much, much more in the RBA's submission than the small mention of investors' tax incentives, more than could fit in any one story .\nThe calmer perspective the RBA brings to the heated housing forum stresses the multiplicity of factors at work on housing outcomes, including insights about many of the trends playing out before the current emphasis on record Sydney prices.\nMs Ellis also clarified what the RBA's interest is in the issue: primarily, financial stability â€“ not Gen Y's home ownership ambitions.\nThe current moves to hose down some of the investor enthusiasm isn't about helping would-be first home buyers into ownership. It's to maintain our strong and stable financial system by protecting banks and borrowers from themselves. No wonder that it was left to the head of the RBA's financial stability department to front the inquiry for the bank.\nAnd Ms Ellis also took the opportunity to remind the politicians of the much bigger picture:\n\"As also noted in the Reserve Bank's submission, Australia faces a number of longstanding challenges in meeting that strong demand. The population is highly urbanised and concentrated in a few large cities, and housing prices are typically higher in large cities. Australia's cities are unusually low density compared with those in other developed countries, so the urban fringe locations where first home buyers have typically located are therefore becoming further out and potentially inconvenient for access to jobs and some services.\"\nIn the Sydney context, that was neatly summarised by a memorable reader comment after a previous housing story Quote: : \"Sydney is a city of 4.5 million people, living like it's 2.5 million, and on its way to 8 million.\"\nMichael Pascoe is a BusinessDay contributing editor", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/foreign-students-set-to-power-housing-20150803-giq47c.html", "http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-so-2015-08-06.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/comment-and-analysis/what-the-rba-really-said-about-housing--much-much-more-than-negative-gearing-20150716-giea2p.html", "http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/inquiry-into-home-ownership/index.html"], "published": "2015-08-06T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:45:27.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
