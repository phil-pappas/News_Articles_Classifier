Food brought in for private consumption is still permitted. \nRussia has complained that some importers are circumventing the ban by illegally slapping on new labels that claim the food was produced in neighbouring ex-Soviet countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:29:45.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
