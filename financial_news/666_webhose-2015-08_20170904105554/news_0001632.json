They just don't get any respect, even though in these times of diminished rates of return on all but the lowest-rated junk bonds, failing to consider preferreds makes very little sense.One knock on preferreds is that they are mostly below investment grade or \"junk rated.\" This is correct, but it's also misleading. Citigroup's preferreds (CK, 27) are rated BB+ and yield about 6.3%, but its senior debt is rated A-- and yields 4.5%. The ratings mainly tell you the securities' ranking in a bankruptcy, an event whose likelihood is more telling from the A-- rating than the BB+. So, if you agree with me that Citigroup is a \"too big to fail\" bank, why not collect the extra 180 basis points of yield on the preferreds over the bond yield? Think of the yield premium for preferreds not as a default-risk premium but as an ignorance premium.Large institutions that manage billions in client assets avoid anything that is not investment grade despite knowing that the risk-reward ratio for such securities is in a client's favor over investment-grade issues. The institution, however, is more concerned with protecting itself against lawsuits should a junk issue fail. It also wants to protect itself against rogue employees taking undue risks with client capital.I once forced this issue with a brokerage firm that refused to execute preferred trades in below-investment-grade issues. It indicated it would relent if my client agreed to sign a letter saying they were sophisticated investors and knew they were buying a high-risk security. Talk about a good way to lose a client! This same firm had no problem allowing investment in a closed-end junk bond fund.You may also hear the argument that preferreds are not liquid and thus are hard to sell. This is true if you want to buy or sell a half-million dollars or more of a single issue, but not so much for small investors interested in lesser amounts. This low liquidity is actually a virtue in that institutions cannot participate in this market in a meaningful way, which keeps yields substantially higher than would otherwise be the case.When customers inquire about preferreds with their friendly broker, they are mostly discouraged from buying them. This is because brokerage firms provide no research on such securities, and the broker tries to discourage such purchases either because of in-house restrictions or because it really doesn't know these securities. Besides, clients tend to hold them for a long time, and that's not good for commissions. Brokers would rather sell you a mutual fund.Preferreds are complicated. There are seven different categories, and each category and each issue has customized terms and provisions. I don't use the term preferred stock because many preferreds are actually bonds in $25 denominations. Those that are stocks may or may not pay qualified dividend income that enjoys a lower tax rate. Some pros argue that the lack of a due date on most preferreds means that they have infinite duration, but this is not true. Most preferreds experience price changes that largely track the rise and fall of the yield on the ten-year Treasury note.Here are some preferreds that offer compelling yields for individual investors but get no love from institutions. Morgan Stanley Floating Rate (MS A, 21) is rated BB and yields 4.8%. Its yield is tied to Libor +4%, so it offers good protection from rate rises. Aspen Insurance Holdings (AHL A, 26) has a 7.4% issue that has been recommended by me for some time. It yields 7% thanks in part to its split ratings of BA1/BBB--. Hercules Technology Growth Capital (HTGY, 25) has a 7% preferred yielding 6.9% that is unrated. This lender to high-tech development companies has a common stock that pays out a 10.5% dividend, which demonstrates more depth in payment ability than just ratings could convey.While equities are today's market darlings, the rewards from preferreds can be substantial, even when the stock market suffers a setback.--- Richard Lehmann is editor of Forbes/Lehmann Income Securities Investor and president of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors .", "external_links": ["http://www.llfadvisors.com/"], "published": "2015-08-19T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:42:47.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
