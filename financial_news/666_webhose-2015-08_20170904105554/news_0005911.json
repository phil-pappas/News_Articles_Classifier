There are 59,474 in the U.S. and 13,950 in Canada. \nGM say Thursday improper routing of a sensor wire in the driver's side front door could prevent the air bag from deploying. \nThe Detroit company is aware of one crash with an injury that may be related to the issue. \nGM will notify owners. Dealers will inspect the wiring and replace faulty wiring for free. \nThe recall is unrelated to last year's recall of millions of Cobalts for defective ignition switches, which could stall the vehicle and turn off the air bags. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the recall is in the U.S. and Canada, not globally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:39:43.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
