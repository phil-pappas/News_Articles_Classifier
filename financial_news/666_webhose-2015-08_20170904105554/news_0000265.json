Now, Yelp says, it is adding health care statistics and consumer opinion survey data into the Yelp business pages of more than 25,000 medical treatment facilities. \nAs a result, consumers will be able to use Yelp to find a hospital emergency room's average wait time, see the number of serious deficiencies in a nursing home or learn about patient survival rates at a dialysis center, the company announced Wednesday. \n\"For example, West Kendall Baptist Hospital has better than average doctor communication and an average 33-minute emergency room wait time, Beachside Nursing Center currently has no deficiencies and San Mateo Dialysis Center has a better than average patient survival rate,\" Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman announced in a blog post on Wednesday. \nYelp is partnering with ProPublica, a New York-based nonprofit news organization that compiled the information from its own research , and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The data include 4,600 hospitals, 15,000 nursing homes and 6,300 dialysis clinics in the U.S. The information is already available on government sites but can be hard to find and analyze. It will be updated quarterly. \nYelp plans more health-related information, Stoppelman says. \n\"We're aiming to add more restaurant health scores for cities and counties across the U.S. on Yelp. We're working with cities to provide a feed of Yelp restaurant reviews to aid planning decisions for inspections and faster discovery of outbreaks,\" he said. \nBusinesses in the health category already comprise 6% of reviewed businesses on Yelp, which hopes that its health reviews will increase now that richer data are available. \n\"We're taking data that otherwise might live in some government PDF that's hard to find, and we're putting it in a context where it makes sense for people who may be in the middle of making critical decisions,\" Luther Lowe, Yelp's vice president for public policy, was quoted as saying in a Wednesday story in the Washington Post. \nOther tech firms that have launched health-related offerings include U.S. search king Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), which is investing in a range of medical startups and has formed a joint venture with drugmaker Novartis (NYSE: NVS ). \nAnd China search leader Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU ) recently launched an online service to help people with health concerns find doctors. \nYelp stock tanked 25% last week to a more than two-year low after the company reported earnings and gave guidance that missed Wall Street expectations amid rising competition for local online ads. \nFollow Michele Chandler on Twitter: @IBD_MChandler .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T22:49:00.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
