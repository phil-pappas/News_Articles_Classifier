U.S. stocks ended their session down. \n10:32 pm | Yuan's Weakening Signals Investor Pessimism | by Fiona Law \nThe yuan is under selling pressure after China’s fifth interest rate cut since late last year erases any hopes of the currency’s strength. \nThe yuan in the onshore market stands at 6.4212 a dollar, a tad weaker than its Tuesday close at 6.4124 a dollar. That follows a softer yuan fixing by the PBOC early Wednesday. Each day, the central bank sets a midpoint, and lets the currency trade 2% above or below it. \nThe yuan has depreciated 3.5% against the dollar since the central bank devalued the currency on August 11. \nIn the offshore market, where the currency trades freely, the yuan is hovering at 6.4930 a dollar, a clear sign of foreign investors’ pessimism. That is weaker than 6.4660 a dollar where it was trading in late Asian session Tuesday, but stronger after losses overnight in New York trading. The offshore yuan has weakened 4.6% against the dollar since Beijing's devaluation. \n10:32 pm | Strategists See Value in Australia Declines | by Robb M. Stewart \nEven as Australian stocks tick lower again, equity strategists are pointing to what they see as diamonds in the rough. Monday's 4.1% dive by the S&P/ASX 200 was the sixth-largest pullback since the index was created in the early 1990s. That means stocks are now at below-average levels. That, says Credit Suisse's Hassan Tevfik and colleagues, has left some companies looking vulnerable to debt-financed buyers as free cash-flow yields rise and the cost of debt continues to fall. UBS strategists agree that signs of value are emerging as the ASX 200 shapes up for its worst month since 2008. The index has fallen 16% from its April 27 peak and is down 12% year-to-date, yet they say relative value appears as attractive as ever with a dividend yield of 5.3% across the market against a cash rate of 2%. UBS suggests that resources and bank stocks, which have led the recent selloff, are likely to be part of any market bounce. \"Today will be one of those trading days when large moves in either direction are a real possibility,\" Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says, adding that the sharp swings in U.S. stocks overnight apparently unsettled local traders. \n10:26 pm | Volatility Not Limited to China | by Gregor Stuart Hunter \nLess than an hour of trading has elapsed in China and it’s looking like a rocky day for traders on the mainland. \nBut the volatility isn’t confined to China: Japan’s Nikkei 225 has been up as much as 1.3% and down as much as 0.5%. Korea’s Kospi has seen the biggest swings outside of China, reversing a decline of 0.6% to rise as much as 1.3%, while the Australian S&P/ASX 200 clawed back losses of 1.7%; It last traded flat. \nIt may be a long day for investors in the rest of Asia-Pacific as well. \n10:21 pm \nChinese equities don't exactly represent underlying macro-conditions. pic.twitter.com/dqITTNHBDF \n— Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) August 26, 2015 \n10:20 pm \nUp or down, markets don't move in a straight line: they are not seamless, strong-efficient, rational, personal, discrete, circumscribable. \n— Andrew Kassen (@andrewunknown) August 26, 2015 \n10:17 pm | Chinese Investors Responding to Economic Data? Now That's New | by Chao Deng \nChina’s stock market is notorious for rarely responding to economic data—the bull market that started last year came as the world's No. 2 economy was growing at its slowest pace in decades. \nBut IG’s Evan Lucas says that global investors are nevertheless using the Shanghai market to read what Chinese think of their own economy. \n“If Chinese markets are irrational, then that says the Chinese are panicking about the output of their own economy.” \n\n10:17 pm \nChart: China's overnight repo rates continue to rise as capital outflows offset PBoC liquidity injections - pic.twitter.com/PssCvDnI0f \n— SoberLook.com (@SoberLook) August 26, 2015 \n10:14 pm | How Can China Best Hold Up Its Market? By Being the Buyer | by Dominique Fong \nThe only way that China can hold up its stock market is by direct intervention, which it has been scaling back recently, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists say. \n“From [a] real economy’s perspective, we doubt monetary loosening is the solution to China’s main problem--overcapacity, a lack of consumption, and leverage. All it does [is maybe] encourage property speculation, likely using more leverage,” they say in a note. \nAnd a recent cut to the reserve-requirement ratio, the amount of deposits that China must hold on reserve, is expected to flood 700 billion yuan ($109 billion) into the banking system. A side effect of the release of new money is that the yuan could weaken further, the strategists say. \n10:09 pm \nChina - a big reason why world trade growth is so weak.

It didn’t work out last time. A-shares fell 3.3% on the day after the People’s Bank of China cut both interest rates and the RRR in June and fell a total of 10.4% in the week following. Yet Goldman Sachs believes things could be different this time. “The signaling effect could be stronger than in previous rate-cut episodes as this is the first explicit policy response since the Rmb devaluation, which is commonly cited as a key trigger for the global market declines,” it says. Goldman also thinks the current A-share market is technically oversold and the double-barreled cuts may spark foreign interest in the market. Goldman, however, thinks the cuts on their own are unlikely to kick off another rally. \n10:03 pm | China Sets Yuan Weaker | by Ewen Chew \nAfter the People's Bank of China set a weaker yuan benchmark rate Wednesday, as expected, the currency fell even further in the spot market. Today's dollar/yuan parity rate of 6.4043 represented a 0.1% depreciation of the yuan versus the dollar as compared with its last fixing of 6.3987, but the yuan fell as much as 0.3% versus its Tuesday close in the spot market. The spot dollar/yuan pair is allowed to fluctuate up to 2.0% from the daily benchmark rate. The weakness of the yuan follows expectations that the PBOC’s rate move would diminish the currency's value. The yuan's bigger fall in the spot market illustrates concern that the government's latest round of policy-easing measures means China's economic problems are indeed serious. \n10:01 pm | China's Market Volatile in Early Trade--Surprise, Surprise | by Chao Deng \nLess than half an hour into trading in Shanghai and stocks have already traded as high as 1.2% and as low as 2.3%. The benchmark is last about flat. \nSome analysts and investors are saying that Tuesday’s moves by China’s central bank weren’t enough. \n“They probably were not hard enough and strong enough to give the market a sign that they will support it in the next two three weeks, when things are going to get really volatile,” says Evan Lucas, market strategist at brokerage Singapore-based IG. \n“They [also] haven’t outlined any specific measures to support the mainland market,” Mr. Lucas says. \n\n9:59 pm \nOffshore yuan now sees 3.8% devaluation in the next year, widened from 3% before after the China rate cut. \n— Wei Gu (@weigu) August 26, 2015 \n9:56 pm | Time for Some Cheery Data: China's Shoppers Are Feeling Good | by Gregor Stuart Hunter \nAnd now, some good news about China: Consumers are feeling better about spending. Despite the market rout, the Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator improved in August to 116.5 from 114.5 in July, reaching its highest level since May 2014. The survey period doesn’t reflect the effects of the yuan devaluation or the Tianjin explosion. \n“The unambiguously positive result in this month’s survey reaffirms our view that consumer conditions are well and truly on the mend following some weakness earlier in the year,” said MNI Indicators chief economist Philip Uglow. “The cumulative increase in recent months is confirmation that the majority of Chinese consumers have been left unscathed by the volatility in stock prices.” \nJust in time for the Shanghai Composite to start rising again. The benchmark is last up 0.9% at 2991.71. \n\n\n9:54 pm | Malaysia Ringgit Hits New 17-Year Low | by Ewen Chew \nMalaysia's ringgit falls to a fourth consecutive 17-year low against the U.S. dollar Wednesday, despite hopes that China's rate cut would lift investor sentiment and help emerging market currencies. The dollar/ringgit rose as high as 4.3030 from its last close of 4.2100, according to a spot market trader. \n9:49 pm \nI wont be trading for the rest of this week. This is the kind of market that chews up new traders and spits them out in BULK. \n— Assad Tannous (@AsennaWealth) August 26, 2015 \n9:44 pm \nYou could say investors are concerned about China... pic.twitter.com/NuH7LAwBvB \n— Callum Thomas (@Callum_Thomas) August 25, 2015 \n9:40 pm | China Turns Down After Open; Nikkei Falls | by Gregor Stuart Hunter \nSuddenly things are getting very ugly. If the People’s Bank of China had hoped to engineer a stock market revival, early signs are not good. The Shanghai Composite turns negative after just six minutes, last down 1.6% at 2,915.58. \nThe Shenzhen market is off 3.2% and the ChiNext has sunk 4.3%. \nMeanwhile Japan’s Nikkei 225 has joined in, last down 0.1%. The Hang Seng Index sinks 1.3% after earlier gains. \n9:33 pm \nJust to be clear: PBOC rate/RRR cut may spark temporary rally, but will not \"save\" China stock market from further correction. \n— Patrick Chovanec (@prchovanec) August 25, 2015 \n9:30 pm | Shanghai Opens Slightly Up After PBOC Move \nShanghai opens up 0.5% at 2980.79 while Shenzhen and the ChiNext open down 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. \n9:27 pm \nWonder if he'll regret this today. pic.twitter.com/6FW9quKEBT \n— Josh Noble (@JoshTANoble) August 26, 2015 \n9:26 pm | Hong Kong Mostly Up in Premarket | by Gregor Stuart Hunter \nAfter the People’s Bank of China cut interest rates, Hong Kong’s premarket is mostly up. The Hang Seng Index gains 0.1% while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of mainland companies with Hong Kong listings, rises 0.8%.
