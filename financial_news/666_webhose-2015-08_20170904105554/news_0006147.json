We have the ideal position for a smart, junior-mid-level corporate associate who wants to be in on the deals and work with the companies that make the news. Helping meet the needs of Fortune 100 and 500 companies will be a regular part of your workday in this position. One of the finest Delaware firms is offering an exciting and challenging chance for an attorney who wants more than most mega-firms are offering 3-5 year transactional associates. You will do the kind of work done by the biggest firms in NYC or Philadelphia, but with the opportunity to do much more interesting work much earlier in your career. And, the partnership chances are much better! While DE bar membership is required, the firm will give you five paid weeks to prepare for it. You have already passed one or more bars, so what's one more? You are smart; you can do this! Remember, DE is still the big incorporation state, so you will work on and work much directly with many of the nation's best-known companies. Candidates must have stellar academic and employment credentials, but will reap both the professional and personal benefits of a DE practice. With no sales tax, lower housing costs, excellent public and independent schools, good cultural opportunities, great beaches and easy access to Philadelphia, you should find this position meets all your wants and needs. Candidates with a very strong real estate background may also be considered, but all candidates must have substantial drafting experience, preparing tight and effective documents. You will work with many of DE's finest corporate attorneys, and the key word is \"with,\" rather than \"for.\" You will provide opinion letters and agreements to comply with DE law that will cover some of the truly significant national and international legal issues of the day. We are happy to identify to you some of the client companies and out-of-state firms with whom you will work. Highly competitive compensation, with a moving allowance and signing bonus in state where your buying power will increase by 30%. More senior associates willing to take some \"step down\" in years may also be considered. This is one of the nicest firm positions we have seen in a long time, so contact us today because it will fill quickly.
