Michael Dukakis (right) debates George H.W. Bush in 1988. To meet Michael Dukakis, try visiting a trashy part of Boston. As in, litter-strewn.\nOn Monday, Boston resident Sarah Godfrey befriended the ex-Massachusetts governor and Democratic presidential hopeful, whom she described as a “nice old man who was picking up garbage at the train station on his way to work.”\nBut she didn’t know who the 81-year-old was until he told her.\nIn a letter to the Boston Globe published on Friday , Godfrey — who was nine years old when Dukakis ran for president in 1988 — said she cringed when she saw her new acquaintance bend down to pick up a food wrapper and what appeared to be a used napkin. She told him to wash his hands when he got to work. “That’s what my wife says,” Dukakis replied.\nHe then said, according to Godfrey: “How many ex-governors do you think go around picking up trash at train stations?”\nHe then filled her in on his former job after she asked if he’d actually been governor.\nThis isn’t the first time Dukakis has been spotted picking up litter , as Boston.com reports. And here’s one resident’s tweet in which he can be seen with garbage bag in hand.\nSPOTTED!
