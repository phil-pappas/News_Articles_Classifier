Slave boats tracked to PNG AAP – 1 hour 42 minutes ago Recommend Print \nFrom space, the fishing boats are just little white specks floating in a vast stretch of blue water off Papua New Guinea. But zoom in and there's the critical evidence: Two trawlers loading slave-caught seafood onto a massive refrigerated cargo ship. \nThe trawlers fled a slave island in Indonesia with captives of a brutal Southeast Asian trafficking ring whose catch reaches the United States. Hundreds of men were freed after they were discovered there earlier this year, but 34 boats loaded with workers left for new fishing grounds before help arrived - they remain missing. \nAt least some of them ended up in a narrow, dangerous strait nearly 1,600 kilometres away. The proof comes from accounts from recently returned slaves, satellite beacon tracking, government records, interviews with business insiders and fishing licences. The location is also confirmed in images from space taken by one of the world's highest resolution satellite cameras. \nThe skippers have changed their ships' names and flags to evade authorities, but hiding is easy in the world's broad oceans. Traffickers operate with impunity across boundaries as fluid as the waters. Laws are few and hardly enforced. And depleted fish stocks have pushed boats farther out into seas that are seldom even glimpsed, let alone governed. \nThis lack of regulation means that even with the men located, bringing them to safety may prove elusive. \nPapua New Guinea officials working with the International Organisation for Migration said they were unaware of human trafficking cases in the area but were investigating. Numerous other agencies - including Interpol, the United Nations and the US State and Defence departments - said they didn't have the authority to get involved. \nA handful of former slaves who recently made it home to Myanmar said hundreds of men remain unaccounted for. \n\"Papua New Guinea can be a lawless place,\" said Lin Lin, one of the returnees, describing fishing in the poor island nation. \"Fishermen could die anytime, but the captains would not care. If they die, they will just be thrown away.\" \nAs the appetite for cheap fish worldwide grows, so does the demand for men who are paid little or nothing to catch it. Thailand's $US7 billion ($A9.63 billion) annual seafood export industry is built on the backs of poor people from its own country and migrants from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos who are sold, kidnapped and tricked onto trawlers. \nIn November, the AP found hundreds of such forced labourers on the remote island village of Benjina in eastern Indonesia - some in a cage, others on boats and more than 60 buried in a graveyard. To date, more than 800 men, many of whom said they were abused or witnessed others being beaten, or in some cases even killed - have been prompted the rescue and repatriation of . \nReporters followed the slave-caught fish back to Thailand and linked it to the supply chains of major US food sellers. The businesses all said they strongly condemn labour abuse and vowed to take steps to prevent it. \nIn April, the Indonesian government launched a criminal inquiry. It was already clamping down on illegal fishing nationwide with a moratorium on all foreign boats. Officials rescued hundreds on the spot but they discovered that a third of the company's 90 trawlers had already left - each with 15 to 20 migrants on board. The Indonesian government wants to bring the boats back for prosecution. \n\"They have to be responsible for what's happened,\" said Fisheries Minister Susi Pudjiastuti. \nKaung Htet Wai, 25, said his crewmates nailed a new name and number over the old one - Antasena 331 - and hoisted a different country's flag: the red, black and yellow of Papua New Guinea. Wai said his trawler did not dock for several months, and loaded many types of seafood onto refrigerated cargo ships. Captains also repainted and renumbered other boats, and some kept flags from as many as four different countries in their hulls, according to former slaves and investigators. \nThe flag change protects rogue boats because typically the flagged states, not the host country, set their rules, said Mark Lagon, president of the Freedom House in Washington DC and former US ambassador at large to combat human trafficking. Laws in general are weaker for fishing trawlers than other vessels, as is overall monitoring, he noted, creating a \"black hole of governance\". \nAs the boats hid, Indonesian investigators discovered that the company listed as their operator, Pusaka Benjina Resources, was really a venture between seafood industry tycoons and businessmen from Thailand and Indonesia. \nFinancial records going back seven years reveal Pusaka Benjina's lucrative business with a shipping company, Silver Sea Fishery Co. The trawlers crewed by slaves brought fish to Benjina, where it was loaded onto Silver Sea cargo ships heading for Thailand. \nIn a typical month, Silver Sea was invoiced about $US500,000 ($A687,994) for loads of seafood. One month the firm was billed $US1.6 million, with a third of that charged to the Silver Sea 2 - the same transport ship identified in July in the satellite photo off Papua New Guinea. \nPusaka Benjina manager Hermanwir Martino, among seven people arrested on human trafficking charges, has said his company did nothing wrong. Silver Sea Fishery did not answer calls. \nGisa Komangin, from Papua New Guinea's National Fisheries Authority, said that until now their focus had been on illegal fishing in the dogleg, and that a moratorium on all foreign fishing there is planned to crack down on poaching. \n\"When you are talking about illegal fishing,\" he said, \"you are also talking about human smuggling\". @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Virgin cuts Bali routes on path to profit AAP \nVirgin Australia will axe flights to Bali and Phuket in an effort to turn around its loss-making international …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:45:19.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
