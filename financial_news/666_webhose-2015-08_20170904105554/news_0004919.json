Those problems left Boeing little margin for error in meeting an August 2017 deadline for delivering the first 18 tankers to the U.S. Air Force.\nIn July, Boeing took a $536 million after-tax accounting charge to cover design and development costs caused by other fuel system problems.\nBoeing later assigned Scott Fancher, a Boeing senior vice president and general manager of aircraft development, to oversee the tanker program. Fancher is credited with getting the 787 commercial jetliner program back on schedule after it fell more than three years behind its delivery target.\nUnder the fixed-price tanker contract, U.S. government costs are capped at $4.9 billion and Boeing is responsible for development costs above that cap.
