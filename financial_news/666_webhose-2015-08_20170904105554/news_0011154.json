Photo: Supplied\nA near halving in global dairy prices has wiped 26 per cent off Bega Cheese's underlying profit.\nBut the company is expecting better financial results in the coming year, despite predicting the volatility on global dairy markets will continue.\nExecutive chairman Barry Irvin said he expected improvement from the dairy producer's increased focus on consumer packaged goods, such as supermarket packed cheeses and infant formula rather than bulk commercial dairy ingredients.\nBega Cheese director Barry Irvin.

This excluded last year's sale of its shares in Warrnambool Cheese and Butter, which reaped a $62 million pre-tax profit in FY14, and a $25 million investment in growing a sustainable milk supply.\nThe company generated earnings per share of 14.4 cents, down 27 per cent from 2014.\nIt will pay a final dividend of 4.5 cents a share, which is unchanged from 2014's payout, on September 18.\nMore to come...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T05:37:20.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
