These companies are investing in entertainment systems, ceiling fans and refrigerator/freezers to ease the strain on employees who are on the road for three or four weeks at a time. \n“You have just about everything you need, so you can actually stay out longer between trips home,” said Dornbusch, 52, of Wilmington, Ohio. “We call it professional camping.” \nThey work for a company that’s updating its 20 trucks with more amenities as a recruiting and retention tool. “It’s all about a better experience to keep the drivers,” said Kenneth Lemley, who manages the fleet at Maumee, Ohio-based Try Hours. \nClosely held Western Express recently agreed to outfit 1,600 of its 2,400 trucks with satellite television from technology provider EpicVue, and plans to extend that equipment eventually to all its vehicles.

The industry will need to make almost 1 million new hires in the next decade to keep pace with growing cargo demand and a graying workforce, the American Trucking Associations estimated in 2014. Drivers in many fleets average more than 50 years old.

The cab of their custom-built Freightliner boasts a sink, microwave, refrigerator/freezer, ceiling fan and a bed that folds into a dining table.

Driver Shortage \nCompanies including U.S. Xpress Enterprises Inc., Con-way Inc. and Celadon Group Inc. raised pay last year to help woo new drivers. But truck owners can’t always afford higher labor expenses, according to the ATA. A heavy and tractor-trailer truck driver, on average, made $41,930 in 2014, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n“Truck fleets need to give their drivers nicer amenities to attract and retain those drivers,” said President Brian Callan of specialized sleeper-cab maker Bolt Custom Trucks & Manufacturing. “That leads to what we do for a living.” \nA custom cab typically costs about US$45,000 — a price that can double when a shower and toilet are included, Callan said. \nThe rub for truckers: Showers and satellite TV can only go so far in ensuring that their tractors stay on the highway. \n“If companies want more drivers they need to pay more,” said Pete Swan, a professor of logistics and operations management at Penn State Harrisburg, an arm of Pennsylvania State University. “But firms are reluctant to do this.” \nTry Hours has customized sleeper cabs on most of its trucks — extras that can boost the cost of a new truck by about US$50,000 to US$185,000, said Lemley, the fleet manager. He is now adding entertainment systems, because it’s more costly for Try Hours to have to idle a truck for a month for lack of a driver. \n“It’s a very good investment to keep a driver happy,” Lemley said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:14:29.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
