It is indicative of a new playbook for how parties nominate, and pay for, their candidates.\n“These new numbers show how Jeb Bush has outsourced his campaign to a Super PAC raising potentially corrupting and unlimited sums of money from special interests and wealthy donors,” said Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel with the Campaign Legal Center, which has filed complaints with both the Federal Election Commission and the Department of Justice.\nAs Reuters has written, the FEC, by the admission of its own Democratic commissioners, has been rendered ineffectual by partisan gridlock. And the DOJ is unlikely to take up the issue during a campaign season, department sources have said.\nRight to Rise, in a statement, said it “takes a conservative approach to FEC rules and we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Our expenditures for six months of … fundraising costs and fundraising events are minimal given the scale of our support from donors who have been drawn to Governor Bush’s conservative record of reform.”\nBush campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said, in an emailed statement: “Governor Bush has taken a conservative approach to all of his political activities and has and will continue to comply with all campaign finance laws and requirements.”\nTHE “NON” CANDIDATE CANDIDATE\nStarting in January, and right up until he announced his official candidacy June 15, Bush crisscrossed the country at a frenetic pace in what aides described as a “shock-and-awe” fundraising push to raise a record war chest from lobbyists, billionaires and old Bush family friends.\nBut all the while, Bush insisted he wasn’t a candidate, a distinction that enabled him to operate outside the fray of federal campaign finance regulations, which limit individual campaign donations to $2,700.\nSuper PACs, by contrast, can accept any amount from anyone and are widely criticized by campaign finance reform advocates as tilting American democracy in favor of plutocrats with the biggest checks.\n“There are now literally 100 people financing the bulk of our presidential elections,” said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist with Public Citizen, which advocates for consumers before Congress , the executive branch and the courts.\nThe report also shows the Bush camp’s taste for the luxe and exclusive, with payments to the likes of the Four Seasons Palo Alto, the St. Regis in Atlanta and Houston, the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles, the Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco and the Union League of Philadelphia.\nThe Super PAC, now that Bush is an official candidate, is barred from coordinating with the campaign, but Bush’s favorite longtime strategist and top political adviser, Mike Murphy, is working for the Super PAC, not the campaign.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 7:30 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T10:04:31.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
