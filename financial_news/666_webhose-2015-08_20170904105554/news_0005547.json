Free-floating market capitalisation, not total market value, is the size criterion for index membership.\nThe defence group is set to be joined in the index by wines and spirits company MBWS, maker of Marie Brizard liquor, and by immunotherapy biotech DBV Technologies.\nThe trio are likely to replace aluminium car parts maker Montupet and two commodities companies suffering from a price slump - miner Eramet and oil producer Maurel & Prom.\nThe blue chip CAC40 index of the 40 biggest SBF120 members is unlikely to change this time around, predictions from Exane BNP Paribas and Societe Generale said, but the same trends are recognisable.\nOil industry services group Technip is under pressure for demotion, along with Alstom, which is in the process of offloading its main business, power turbine making, to U.S. rival General Electric.\nPushing for CAC40 inclusion are shopping malls operator Klepierre, and luxury goods firm Hermes, two other tightly held groups.\nLike Dassault Aviation, Hermes saw some stock move into the hands of institutional investors when fellow luxury group LVMH distributed part of its stake last year. Its share price has nevertheless suffered in recent days from fears about Chinese luxury spending after the devaluation of the yuan.
