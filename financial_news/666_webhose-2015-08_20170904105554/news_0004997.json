Genworth dropped 9.7 percent to $6.34 at 9:32 a.m. in New York, extending its decline for the year to about 25 percent.\nThe decision to hold the unit complicates McInerney’s goal of reducing debt by $1 billion to $2 billion. The CEO is seeking to expand profits from mortgage insurance and stem losses from long-term care coverage. He has acknowledged that life sales have been slumping.\n“There were lots of positives for doing the deal, including our ability to reduce debt,” McInerney said. “In the end, our view was they were outweighed by potential adverse effects on the ratings, and the loss of earnings and diversification.”\nGenworth reported a second-quarter net loss of $193 million Tuesday on costs at a European lifestyle protection insurance business that McInerney is planning to sell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:59:04.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
