The Australian dollar has fallen approximately 20 per cent in relation to the US dollar. Our purchasers or clients in China are better off so a 2 per cent devaluation in currency is not going to have an impact at all. It barely registered in our offices that it happened.”\nChina’s central bank, the People’s Bank fo China, devalued its yuan currency by 1.9 per cent yesterday in what was the biggest move of its kind in over a decade. But the fallout in the real estate market was negligible given the move was said to be motivated by a need to bolster export earnings.\nMr Zaja said the sorts of actions that did register with buyers were double digit moves - like the stock exchange falling 20 per cent or the AUD becoming 20 per cent more affordable.\n”A 2 per cent devaluation is almost irrelevant for our industry,” he said. “They just accept that. Our overseas clients haven’t even brought it up as an issue.”\nSunnybank-based real estate agent Tom Zhang of Yong Real Estate said the demand was so strong that it would take much more than a 2 per cent devaluation to put a dent in it.\n“The demand is strong enough to withstand such devaluation because the Australian dollar is still cheap compared to a few years ago. Even today it is still cheap.”\nMr Zhang said there were always individuals working towards taking funds out of China, especially with recent fluctuations in the stock market.\n“Stock market issues and China’s investment environment are more of a factor. Australia is seen as more stable and the real estate market here is always growing.”\nOriginally published as China devaluation barely registers ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=China+devaluation+barely+registers&c=A+MOVE+by+China+to+devalue+its+currency+by+2+per+cent+to+prop+up+exports+has+barely+registered+with+individual+Chinese+real+estate+buyers+looking+to+invest+here.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572&title=China+devaluation+barely+registers", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572&h=China+devaluation+barely+registers", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fnihpu6h-1227480648128", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/china-devaluation-barely-registers-in-booming-real-estate-market/story-fndbalka-1227480648128?sv=db217081927bf401021c98c8b7dec572&title=China+devaluation+barely+registers"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:37:34.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
