Vance Jr., the New York Police Department and the city’s Department of Investigation announced the charges in the April death of Carlos Moncayo, 22, an employee with Sky Materials Corp. Moncayo was in an unsecured trench at a site in Manhattan’s trendy Meatpacking district when it caved in. The building was once home to the trendy restaurant Pastis and is now being developed into a Restoration Hardware retail store. \nVance said the worker’s death was “tragic, but it was also foreseeable and avoidable.” He said repeated warning were issued about safety hazards at the Ninth Avenue site in the months, weeks and even minutes before Moncayo’s death. But company supervisors Wilmer Cueva and Alfonso Prestia allowed workers to continue, he said. \nSky was a subcontractor hired to excavate the area, and Harco Construction LLC is the general contractor on the site, officials said. \nAny excavations deeper than 5 feet must be fortified before workers are allowed inside and the area was that deep or deeper, officials said. Inspectors first noticed in February the site was unsafe and despite meetings with the defendants, safety practices did not improve and persisted for months, officials said. \nThen on April 6, an inspector went to the site and told Cueva and Prestia the area was unsafe and to get the workers out immediately. Both ignored the warnings, according to prosecutors. Nearly two hours later, Prestia instructed the crew in English to get out, but many didn’t and understood Spanish only, officials said. Just moments after Cueva finally called out to the workers in Spanish to get out, it collapsed. Moncayo was killed.
