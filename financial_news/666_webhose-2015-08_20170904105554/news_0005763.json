Since then, however, the Aim-listed company has published drastic restatements of its 2013 results and, within hours of Quindell revising its numbers, the SFO announced its own investigation into “business and accounting practices” at the firm. \nOn Tuesday, the FCA said that “in the light” of the SFO probe, and after consulting with the fraud investigator, it had decided to scrap its Quindell inquiry with immediate effect. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in the Aim company rose as much as 3.9pc on the news in early morning trade. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is not unusual for the FCA to stop an investigation if it overlaps significantly with an SFO probe and there had been speculation that the City regulator might drop its probe into Quindell. It emerged earlier this month that the Financial Reporting Council had also launched its own review of the firm last year and is now examining the work of Quindell’s current and previous accountants, KPMG and RSM Tenon. \nThe Aim company, which provides telematics technologies used by insurer to track drivers' habits, shocked investors a fortnight ago when it overhauled its new management team and revised its 2013 figures, revealing the business had suffered a £64m pre-tax loss instead of the £107m profit its former bosses had reported. \nUsing more conservative accounting policies than had been adopted by its old management team, chairman Richard Rose also announced that Quindell had slumped to a £375m loss in 2014. \nMr Rose replaced Quindell’s controversial founder Rob Terry as chairman of the business and has brought about sweeping changes at the company in an effort to restore investor confidence. On Monday, he announced that Indro Mukerjee had been appointed as the company’s new chief executive and that Cenkos Securities (LSE: CNKS.L - news ) had been replaced as its nominated adviser by Peel Hunt. \nSince leaving Quindell in November, Mr Terry has pursued a fund management venture called Quob Park Estate. The vehicle has built a stake in listed stockbroker Daniel Stewart and had been hoping to gain FCA clearance to lift its shareholding above 9.99pc. However, Quob Park has said that it \"would not plan to gain FCA approval\" for further shares purchases until all investigations in Quindell are finished, including the SFO and FRC probes (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T13:24:50.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
