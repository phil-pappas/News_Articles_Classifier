Pamela Patsley, the only female CEO on the Dallas Business Journal’s ranking of the region’s 100 largest public companies, will relinquish her role as chief executive and chairman of MoneyGram International (Nasdaq: MGI) to CFO Alex Holmes . Holmes and Patsley have held their roles since 2009. “Alex has been a tremendous asset to MoneyGram since he first joined us … and I am excited that he will be the next leader to drive the company’s growth and profitability while increasing our market share around the world,” Patsley said. “Alex’s exceptional record of success across multiple areas of our company, along with the central role he played in our recent transformation efforts, gives me great confidence in his ability to lead MoneyGram.” Patsley will take over as executive chairman of the company on Jan. 1, a position she will serve in through the end of 2017. In the role, she will work with Holmes to oversee MoneyGram’s strategic planning efforts and help represent the company to customers, the financial community, regulators and government officials. She will also continue to spearhead governance for the company’s board of directors; be active in the company’s charitable arm, the MoneyGram Foundation; and speak on issues surrounding the money transfer industry. “We are grateful to Pam for her service and accomplishments as CEO and are really pleased that she will be assuming the responsibilities of executive chairman through the end of 2017, ensuring a seamless leadership transition,” J. Coley Clark , chair of human resources and the nominating committee for MoneyGram’s board, said in a news release. On Friday, MoneyGram reported a second quarter 2015 net loss of $12.4 million or 20 cents per share, compared to last year’s profit of $25.6 million, or 40 cents per share. Revenue was logged at $358.8 million, a 3.7 percent drop from last year. But those numbers beat forecasts by analysts, who had predicted 15 cents per share and $347 million in revenue. On the heels of the leadership change and earnings release, MGI shares were up nearly 24.5 percent for the day, trading at $9.81. \nWant Dallas Banking & Financial Services news in your inbox?
