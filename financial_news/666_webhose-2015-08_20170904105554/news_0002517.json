Photo: DON CAMPBELL/The Herald-Palladium/Associated Press By 66 COMMENTS \nPALO ALTO, Calif.—Auto makers have been laying the groundwork to seek relief from U.S. regulators on lofty fuel-economy targets. But Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA -0.24 % is rowing in the opposite direction, saying it wants to make the rules even tougher. \nThe Silicon Valley electric-car maker is preparing to make a public case this week for leaving mileage and emissions regulations intact, or making them even more stringent, a Tesla executive said. The company also will fight to keep other auto makers from loosening regulations in California, which has more ambitious targets than the federal government. \nU.S. fuel-economy targets call for manufacturers to sell vehicles averaging 54.5 miles a gallon by 2025. Recent Coverage Tesla Owners Gripe Over Recharge Waits (June 30) \nTougher regulations could benefit Tesla, while challenging other auto makers that make bigger profits on higher-margin trucks and sport-utility vehicles. \nTesla’s vice president of development, Dairmuid O’Connell, plans to argue to auto executives and other industry experts attending a conferenceon the northern tip of Michigan that car companies can meet regulations as currently written. \n“We are about to hear a lot of rhetoric that Americans don’t want to buy electric vehicles,” Mr. O’Connell said in an interview ahead of a Tuesday presentation in Traverse City, Mich. “From an empirical standpoint, the [regulations] are very weak, eminently achievable and the only thing missing is the will to put compelling products on the road.” \nThe presentation likely will further Tesla’s reputation as industry agitator, a role often taken on by founder Elon Musk , who rankles rivals with proclamations about their apparent lack of progress in building viable electric vehicles. It also will mark a significant departure from other auto makers that historically have tried to soften fuel-economy regulations. \nThe industry typically has agreed to tougher standards under political pressure and only after thorough negotiations. In Detroit earlier this year, Mr. Musk urged auto makers to continue advancing electric vehicles amid falling oil prices, even while disclosing his company likely won’t be profitable until 2020. \nGeneral Motors Co. GM -1.25 % and Toyota Motor Corp. TM 0.90 % are increasingly selling less-efficient pickup trucks and SUVs amid a sustained run of lower gasoline prices and are readying arguments for less-strict rules when federal regulators review mileage targets in 2017 and California reviews its regulations that require a minimum percentage of electric cars in 2016. \nOne route for relief would be getting progress points for autonomous features such as automatic braking that they argue both improve safety and save fuel to offset vehicles that are less fuel efficient than the target. \n“Auto makers are offering consumers more choice than ever in energy-efficient vehicles, but that’s not enough,” said a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry lobbying group representing a dozen auto makers including GM, Toyota and Ford Motor Co. F -1.79 % “We need consumers to buy them in high volumes to meet the steep climb in fuel-economy standards ahead.” \nThe 15 fully electric vehicles on sale last year registered 0.4% of overall auto purchases in the U.S., the spokeswoman said. The share of sales doesn’t brighten much when adding other more-efficient vehicles with so-called alternative powertrains into the mix. \nHybrids, plug-in hybrids, electric vehicles and clean-diesel vehicles represented about 5.6% of sales in 2014, according to the Alliance. Trucks and SUVs, meanwhile, made up more than half of sales. Electric vehicles, while fuel-efficient, are tougher sells amid low gas prices because of their heftier price tags, even with offsetting tax credits. \nStill, Tesla has established itself by selling electric cars starting around $70,000 and able to travel more than twice as far on a single battery charge than competing vehicles. Founded in 2003, it boasts a market capitalization exceeding $33 billion, more than half that of GM. \nTraditional auto makers aren’t sitting still. GM is readying the Chevrolet Bolt, a 200-mile range electric car due out in 2017. Germany’s Audi and Nissan Motor Co. of Japan also have promised electric vehicles with ranges similar to Tesla’s models. \nTesla can make extra money by trading regulatory credits it earns for selling cars that make zero pollution in states like California. Tesla reaped $216.3 million from selling credits in 2014. It banked $194.4 million and $40.5 million selling credits in 2013 and 2012, respectively. \nTesla contends that other auto makers have earned enough of their own credits and made such strides in improving fuel economy that they should be able to meet California regulatory mileage targets through 2022, according to an analysis the company plans to unveil Tuesday. Auto makers can meet current standards even without adding additional so-called zero-emission vehicles to the roads, Tesla says.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne earlier this year suggested the U.S. government give auto makers more time to meet higher targets. \nRegulators so far have been cool to relaxing standards. The Environmental Protection Agency will conduct an evaluation to “decide whether the standards for model years 2022-2025, established in 2012, are still appropriate given the latest available data and information,” an agency official said. The “EPA’s decision could go one of three ways: the standards remain appropriate, the standards should be less stringent, or the standards should be more stringent.” \nOther auto executives often argue that electric vehicles will need to make up a far larger share of sales to meet loftier fuel-economy targets, a tough mandate when gasoline prices are low. \nIn addition to federal fuel-economy targets, California and a group of 11 other states require auto makers to sell a certain percentage of their fleets with zero emissionsusually electric cars running on batteries or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles. Mr. Marchionne, among the industry’s more outspoken executives, has bemoaned losing money on cars manufactured to meet those regulations. \nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com 67", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T06:42:15.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
