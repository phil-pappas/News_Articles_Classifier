The combined jump of 87,500 came as the unemployment rate climbed from 6 to 6.3 per cent.\nThe discrepancy is explained by a jump in the number of unemployed Australians from 771,000 to 801,000.\nThe results come at a time of unusual volatility in the figures following changes in the way the Bureau of Statistics collects the data.\nAdvertisement On the face of it they show they show a big increase in the number of Australians prepared to look for work as an extra 30,000 described themselves as unemployed and an extra 87,500 found jobs.\nIt is highly likely that both growth rates will be revised down next month when the Bureau recalibrates its estimates to take account of lower than expected population growth.\nIn the face of such volatility, analysts are more likely to rely on the rate, which the figures show climbing to 6.3 per cent.\nIt's the first time the rate has been that high since January. However the Bureau warns that figure should be treated with caution. Sampling error means it can only be confident the true rate is somewhere between 6 and 6.8 per cent.\nIn a measure of the confusion the results engendered the Australian dollar initially jumped on the news from US73.52¢ to US73.93¢ before falling to US73.35¢.\nANZ economist Justin Fabo quipped that there was \"something for everyone\" in the news. He said he was inclined to disbelieve both the jump in the unemployment rate and the strong jump in employment.\nThe Bureau said the NSW unemployment rate climbed from 5.8 to 6 per cent, Victoria's rate surged from 6 to 6.4 per cent, Queensland's rate jumped from 6.1 to 6.5 per cent, South Australia's rate fell from 8.1 to 7.9 per cent, Western Australia's rate jumped from 5.9 to 6.4 per cent, and Tasmania's rate inched up from 6.5 to 6.6 per cent.\nThe trend unemployment rates for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are 4.4 per cent and 4.2 per cent.\nWestern Australia's unemployment rates is the highest it has been since May 2002. The number of Australians unemployed is the highest since November 1994.\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660"], "published": "2015-08-06T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:47:46.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
