Point the camera at someone or something and start shooting instantly seems to be the in-thing nowadays. The point to be noted is that as smartphones become ubiquitous, they are quickly replacing traditional point-and-shoot cameras as the go-to devices for taking quick photos. These devices also make it easy to share those images with others.\nIn order to woo this fast-growing mobile phone-cum-camera wielding audience, the Taiwanese device maker Asus has debuted its latest device, the ZenFone 2 Laser, which promises to have the best smartphone action camera.\nZenFone 2 Laser models all benefit from a powerful 13 megapixel PixelMaster camera with an f/2.0 wide-aperture lens to capture crisp and high-resolution photos with zero shutter lag—augmented by laser auto-focus technology that empowers users to capture perfect clarity in just 0.3 seconds. Available in 5-inch (ZE500KL), 5.5-inch (ZE550KL) and 6.0-inch (ZE601KL) versions with upto 1920 x 1080-pixel Full HD resolution, ZenFone 2 Laser also incorporates the latest and toughest Corning Gorilla Glass 4. It boasts an upto octa-core 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with upto 3 GB of fast memory for robust performance.\nThe good folks at Asus India were kind enough to send us a review unit of the 5.5-inch Asus ZenFone 2 Laser, which retails for R13,399. Here are some of our impressions on the latest Asus phone’s hardware design, build and performance.\nOut of the box, the ZenFone 2 Laser is pretty comfortable to hold in the hand. And, it has an incredibly slim profile.\nThe phone features a 5.5-inch HD IPS display. The screen has the latest Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection, which is adequate to protect the device from any accidental bumps and scratches.\nUnder the hood, the ZenFone 2 Laser packs a 13 megapixel PixelMaster camera with Dual LED Real Tone flash, laser auto-focus f/2.0 aperture lens, which helps to capture high-resolution pictures with zero shutter lag. On the front, it sports a 5 megapixels with f/2.0 aperture and Auto-focus. The camera also comes with Low Light mode that works on pixel-merging technology to capture upto 400% brighter images at night or in low-light condition.\nFurther probing the innards, the latest Asus device comes packed with a 1.5 GHz Qualcomm 64-bit octa-core processor Snapdragon 615 (MSM8939) CPU coupled with 3 GB LPDDR3 RAM and a Qualcomm Adreno 306 GPU. The handset runs on brand-new ASUS ZenUI 2.0 with Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. It offers 16 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 128 GB via a microSD card. The handset is powered by\na 3,000 mAh Li-Polymer removable battery.\nThe ZenFone 2 Laser comes with dual microphone support with noise cancellation. In terms of connectivity, the device comes with 4G LTE support, 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP, GPS, A-GPS/GLONASS, Micro USB 2.0 (OTG support), and a 3.5 mm audio jack port.\nFor many people, a phone’s cameras are one of the biggest priorities when choosing a new phone. For the simple reason that since you carry your phone everywhere, you are more likely to use it as a camera more than a DSLR or separate compact camera. The latest Asus ZenFone 2 Laser puts a lot of emphasis on its camera performance. The phone’s 13 megapixel PixelMaster camera with its f/2.0-aperture lens captures stunning, high-resolution photos with zero shutter lag. The brand-new laser-autofocus feature greatly reduces blurring and enhances image stabilisation, and the Low Light mode employs pixel-merging technology to capture upto 400% brighter photos at night or in low-light scenes—all without the need for a flash. Backlight (Super HDR) mode lets you see clearly through daytime shadow and Super Resolution mode helps you to capture detailed images at resolutions of upto 52 megapixel.\nAt my end, I took a couple of photos and the phone’s 13-MP rear camera took vivid, sharp images in all of my test scenarios. I was impressed with how much detail the phone’s camera captured; I zoomed in on a flower shot and even the tiniest insects were captured in sharp detail. The front-facing, 5-MP camera took sharp, colourful images of my face, even under the weak lighting. When I held the phone in landscape mode, it captured plenty of the background behind my head. Overall, I had a satisfying experience with the phone’s camera capabilities.\nWith its 1.5 GHz Qualcomm 64-bit octa-core processor Snapdragon 615 (MSM8939) CPU coupled with 3 GB RAM, the Asus ZenFone 2 Laser was fast enough to handle any task I threw at it with aplomb, whether I was surfing the Web or watching videos. If you want a phone that looks great and takes superb photos, give the ZenFone 2 Laser your highest consideration. Highly recommended.\nSPECIFICATIONS\n* Dimensions: 152.5 x 77.2 x 3.9 ~ 10.8 mm (W x D x H)\n* Display: 5.5-inch HD resolution, IPS display\n* CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 410\n* Operating system: Asus ZenUI with Android 5.0 Lollipop\n* Memory & storage: 2 GB LPDDR3 RAM; 16 GB eMMC Flash\n* Connectivity: WLAN 802.11 b/g/n, USB, Bluetooth V4.0\n* Camera: 5 MP (front); 13 MP rear camera\n* Battery: 3000 mAh Li-Polymer removable battery\n** Estimated street price: Rs 13,399\n 27, 2015 12:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:14:29.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
