Its lithium-ion Powerwall product is also a battery unit designed for home use and has been so successful that its 2016 production run has almost sold out.\nAdvertisement Mr Hackett is known to be a big fan of Tesla and its cars. But he said RedFlow could earn a niche in the market thanks to its superior technology.\n\"We're just at the point where Redflow is making a pretty good battery,\" he said. \"The market for energy storage and use of batteries is just on the cusp of exploding: it's the start of a new growth industry.\n\"The market is ... far more enormous than even Tesla can address on its own.\"\nHe said Tesla's lithium-ion batteries were better suited to cars rather than set locations like mobile tower base stations or home garages.\nRedFlow's home batteries are not for the faint-hearted, with a price tag of around $10,000 to $15,000. However, the company aims to reduce the cost over time as production becomes cheaper.\n\"Tesla has managed to make the pretty boring-sounding topic of batteries in buildings something that is actually sexy,\" he said. \"[We] never saw ourselves as a residential battery company, but now I think we've got a good chance of being one.\"\nRedFlow has previously pledged to reach a cash-flow-positive status by December 2015, but was this week forced to tell the market it would miss the target.\n\"I'm pretty optimistic that the next 12 months is the point where we turn that corner somewhere,\" he said. \"We're on the cusp of turning this organisation from an R&D organisation to one selling batteries in volume.\n\"But whether the cusp is next week or six months away is the difficult thing, because we're selling something new ... and you never want to be the first one to buy it.\"\nMr Hackett also said the federal government's reduction in support for the solar panel industry would not hurt RedFlow because other states were looking to trial and buy battery systems.\n\"What Australia is doing to itself through lack of vision in this regard is not at all an impediment for selling into the rest of the world market we are set up to sell into,\" he said. \"While our batteries are designed in Brisbane, they're made in North America â€“ and that's deliberate.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.teslamotors.com/en_AU/powerwall"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:43:24.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
