Some actors in the palm oil value chain are calling for the introduction of Import Adjustment Tax (IAT) on imported Crude Palm Oil (CPO). Will that be in the best interest of the entire industry and the economy in the near term and long term? This is a nagging issue that cannot be decided on unadvisedly,' he said. \nTouching on the position of the Association, Mr. Avaala said, 'In the interest of the industry as a whole, the tax regime for imported palm oil in the immediate term should remain same. \nKey Issues Commenting on issues affecting the sector, the president of the association said the refiners and Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) manufacturers have more than enough capacity to produce for domestic consumption and for export to the sub-region. \nHe added that they do not get enough crude palm oil from local sources to produce and therefore unavoidably import the commodity. \n'If they could source 100 percent of the raw material locally to lower production cost and prices of the product, it would be favorable for the ordinary Ghanaian consumer and the export market,' Mr. Avaala said. \nOil Palm Industry Oil Palm industry constituted two percent of total agricultural production value in Ghana in 2010. \nAccording to recent MOFA statistics, there is a little over 300,000 hectares of palm oil plantation in the country. \nThere is a corresponding palm oil production of about 240,000 metric tones, with an unmet demand of between 35,000 and 50,000 metric tones, making the country a net importer of the commodity. \nSamuel Awonnea Avaala", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:08:01.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
