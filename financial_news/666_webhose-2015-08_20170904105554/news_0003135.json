ASF shares up after casino site secured AAP – 1 hour 8 minutes ago Recommend \nShares in Sino-Australian investment firm ASF Group have jumped 15 per cent after the Queensland government announced a new site for an integrated resort and casino on the Gold Coast. \nASF shares were 4.5 cents, or 15 per cent, higher at 34.5 cents at 1438 AEST. \nEarlier this year the Queensland government rejected ASF's proposal to develop a casino resort and cruise ship terminal on Wavebreak Island. \nBut State Development Minister Anthony Lynham on Tuesday announced that the state government and ASF had agreed to a new site at Main Beach: a five-hectare block between Sea World and the Gold Coast Fisherman's Co-operative. \nDr Lynham said the site was part of the original land parcel released for the development of an integrated resort in 2013. \nIn the next step of the development process, the Queensland government will request a detailed proposal. \nASF is expected to respond with a detailed proposal in the first quarter of 2016. \nASF Group chairman Min Yang said the announcement by the Queensland government was an important milestone in the integrated resort process. \nShe said the ASF Consortium, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASF Group, would work closely with the Queensland government to deliver an internationally recognised tourism destination, with thousands of jobs, for the Gold Coast. \nThe Gold Coast already has a casino, Jupiters, which is operated by Echo Entertainment Group. \nEcho is spending $345 million to expand and refurbish Jupiters Gold Coast to restore the property's competitiveness within the region. \nMorningstar gaming analyst Brian Han said that on the face of it, the presence of another casino on the Gold Coast would be negative for Echo, but it was too early in the process to determine what the impact might be. \nShares in Echo were one cent lower at $5.11 at 1438 AEST. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Trade balance in deficit in June AAP \nAustralia's trade balance has stayed in the red with a deficit of $2.933 billion in June, following a deficit in …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T09:01:02.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
