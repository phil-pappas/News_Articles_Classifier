Our nation as a whole has always used this time of the year as the launching of road trips, beach house weekends and of course, family gatherings. This week was no exception, so my wife and I were off to the airport to connect with my siblings. \nAs usual, I was busy with work winding down and packing was pretty low on my list of priorities. When I did get around to it, I found myself rushing. My wife sent me a list of things to “Not Forget” via text message. You would think I was good after the assistance, but that wasn’t the case. Even after a quick check before getting the taxi to the airport, I still managed to forget my cell phone charger. Maybe 10 years ago that wouldn’t be the end of the world. However in a time when we are more connected and dependent on connectivity, it spells certain disaster. \nAccording to an independent study done recently by the University of Michigan, Americans consume more than 76% of an average day somehow connected online. Between work, personal life, school work and independent studying, we are plugged in. The Association of Psychiatric Medicine has been working over the past few years to solidify a diagnosis to better identify addictions to cell phones and being online. For some, it is a very real struggle to engage in “real life” activities when a life online is easier to manipulate. \nWe arrived safely in town and found ourselves hanging out for a day of fun in the city. My family and I were busy catching up, looking at how big all of the nieces and nephews are getting and reminiscing. By mid-morning I figured out that my wife’s nagging hadn’t stopped me from leaving my charger at home. By early afternoon my phone was completely dead! That hadn’t happened to me very often because I am never far from a plug. To make matters worse, I was the only one in the group with an Android phone. Everyone else were loyalist to the Apple brand. I would be forced to walk the earth without cell phone capabilities. How would I capture the sites? How would I get all the fun we were having documented and posted online? I was feeling lost. \nWhat happened next was beyond explanation. For the first time in ages, I tucked my phone away and just looked around. For the next few hours I felt liberated. In fact, here are a couple of lessons I think may make life a little easier for us all. \n• Without a phone I was forced to be present in the moment: We are a society who’s gotten used to having conversations with the tops of our companion’s heads. We don’t communicate any more. We grunt and groan between selfies and IG posts. We live a lifestyle of snapping pics, not just to savor the memory, but as some twisted proof of existence. \n• Without a phone I found out more about myself: Somehow we believe we “are” what is on our social media. And the truth is, we aren’t. In the grand scheme of life, our social presence is a mere fraction of the life we truly live. Don’t believe me? Go through the last four weeks of posts and ask yourself; Is this the best representation of who I really am? Chances are, you will find a few loop holes in what you see. \n• Without a phone I learned about my family: I had to compete with their cell phone activity, but in between, we had some in depth conversations. I learned about what was happening at school. I got to hear about who they were dating. I was able to share the joys of their lives, not through reading a post, but hearing it from them. More than anything I saw online, I participated in what I call “life level interaction”. No filters, no selfies, just humans speaking to one another. \nI’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a difficult day nonetheless. When we got back to the house I was rushing to purchase a spare charger and get the almighty “juice” back. When my phone finally came on, I found something incredible. Outside of a few too many work related emails, the world kept going. My head didn’t explode and I didn’t die a sudden death! It prompted a question I posed to my wife; If something great happens but you don’t have a phone to capture it, does it count? And without hesitation I can say, yes it does!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T18:17:22.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
