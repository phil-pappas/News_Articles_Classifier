But in the end, no funds were assigned for the Lagos-Ibadan rail project by the China-EXIMBank,\" the statement said. \nThe projects listed for funding with the China-EXIMBank loan, she explained, were at various stages of progress the expansion of four International Airport Terminals in Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Port Harcourt ($500million); Abuja Light Rail ($500million); Zungeru Hydro-electric power project ($984million) and Galaxy Backbone project ($100million). \nEven if the alleged project was listed among China-EXIMBank funded projects, Mrs. Okonjo-Iweala said diversion of any Chinese funds would have been extremely difficult, since the contract terms and the processes would not have permitted any such action. \n\"The procedure is that funds for approved loans remain in the China-EXIMBank and are released directly to the Chinese firm executing the contract only after the presentation of duly certified proof of work by the responsible Ministry, in this case it would have been the Federal Ministry of Transport, based on the agreed milestones,\" he statement said. \n\"For the sake of emphasis, the China-EXIMBank does not disburse money directly to government and therefore the issue of diversion does not arise.\" \nThe statement said the attempt to link the former minister to the allegation was \"another example of the kind of whispering campaign of calumny, innuendo, misinformation, and outright distortions being perpetrated by certain political elements against Dr. Okonjo-Iweala in a bid to try to damage her reputation\".
