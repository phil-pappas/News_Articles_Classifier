Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Coalition MPs are considering ways to fight back against a union-led advertising campaign against components of the China free trade deal allowing the import of foreign workers, such as new TV and social media ads, or a national day of action.\nFearing the attack is cutting through, four Coalition MPs told a party room meeting there was a need to find new ways to rebut claims in the national union-led campaign that the deal with \"destroy Aussie jobs\".\nAs ads and statements authorised by the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) flood living rooms, the Coalition party room even discussed rallying support via Chinese-language media and social media in Australia.\nAs much as $24.6 million was set aside in the budget for China, Japan and Korean FTA advocacy and promotional activities, expected to be put towards the TV ads, an online information portal and seminars for Australian businesses.\nOn Tuesday, one MP suggested a National Day of Action or national movement in support of the benefits of the agreement could be necssicary to knock down the union claims, a government spokesman said.\nLegislation authorising the deal is currently before two parliamentary committees, and is expected to hit parliament later this year.\nImported labour provisions a concern\nUnions and Labor have loudly raised concerns about Investment Facilitation Arrangements, allowing the importation of workforces for investment projects worth at least $150 million and changes in skills assessment for visas.\n They have also said it \"lacks critical safeguards\" and opposed the inclusion of an Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism , giving the Chinese the right to legally challenge decisions by the Australian government.\nTrade Minister Andrew Robb has argued however there are no provisions to do with industrial relations changes in the legislation and 457 visa requirements would not be changed.\nAnother MP told Tuesday's meeting that macro and micro level benefits needed to be laid out plainly to the electorate, accusing Labor of running an \"extremely dishonest campaign\".\nBusiness groups have warned delays in the agreement would cost Australia's export trade and local jobs.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has reassured Beijing that his government will not touch a word of the China-Australia agreement and has accused Labor of playing xenophobic short-term politics for demanding changes.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-18T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:55:33.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
