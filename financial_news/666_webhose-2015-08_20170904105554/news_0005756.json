More than 10,000 evacuees and nearby residents have brought at least 20 lawsuits against the utility and the government over the handling of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant 220 km (130 miles) north of Tokyo.\nThe biggest class action, with 4,000 plaintiffs, seeks to dramatically increase Tepco's liability by proving negligence under Japan's civil law, rather than simply proving harm and seeking compensation, said lead attorney Gentaro Managi.\nJapan recently approved increasing the amount of compensation payments through a government-run fund to 7 trillion yen ($56 billion).\nProsecutors twice declined to charge former Tepco bosses over their handling of the disaster, citing a lack of evidence, but a citizens' panel overruled them last month. It's unlikely the three former executives, who will be summoned to give evidence in court, will be convicted as it is hard to prove criminal acts in this type of case, said Nicholes Benes of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan.\nThe legal actions against Tepco are \"serious for the industry\" as it seeks to gradually bring some of Japan's 43 idled nuclear reactors back online, said Tom O'Sullivan, an independent energy consultant and former investment banker.\n\"With potentially up to 25 reactors coming online, board members of other electric power companies must be quite nervous about what could happen if something goes wrong,\" he said. \"Most reactors have been switched off for four years so switching them back on is going to be potentially problematic, not to mention the risk of natural disasters.\"\n\"UNAVOIDABLE\"\nIt's unclear what bearing the various lawsuits against Tepco might have on one another, but a common thread is that it should have anticipated the possibility of a devastating quake and tsunami and taken steps to reduce the impact.\nThe company maintains that the severity of the 9.0 magnitude quake and 13-meter wave could not have been predicted.\nBut the document introduced as evidence in the shareholders' suit after a judge forced Tepco to produce it, appears to challenge that. The \"Tsunami Measures Unavoidable\" report, dated September 2008, was filed with the Tokyo District Court in June, but has not been widely reported.\nThe unnamed authors prepared the report for a meeting attended by the head of the power station and marked the document \"to be collected after discussion.\" It's not clear whether senior executives in Tokyo saw the report at the time.\nThe report called for Tepco to prepare for a worse tsunami than it previously assumed, based on experts' views.\n\"Considering that it is difficult to completely reject the opinions given thus far of academic experts on earthquakes and tsunami, as well as the expertise of the (government's) Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion, it is unavoidable to have tsunami countermeasures that assume a higher tsunami than at present,\" says the report.\n\"This is prime evidence that Tepco recognised the need for tsunami measures,\" said Hiroyuki Kawai, lead attorney in the shareholders' suit. \"This will have an important impact on the lawsuit.\"\nTepco, in a court filing, counters that the document \"does not mean there was a risk that a tsunami would strike and did not assume any specific tsunami countermeasures.\"\nAsked to comment further on the internal report and the range of legal problems facing the company, Tepco spokesman Kohji Sakakibara told Reuters, \"We cannot answer these questions because they pertain to lawsuits and because they suppose a hypothetical determination of negligence. However, the company is making appropriate assertions in the lawsuits and expects that in the end the courts will render fair judgements.\"\nThe shareholder lawsuit, filed in March 2012, seeks to establish responsibility for the disaster and demands 5.5 trillion yen ($44 billion) in damages from current and former executives. A verdict is not expected for at least a year.\n\"This is likely to become a long battle where lawsuits go on for several decades or half a century,\" said Shunichi Teranishi, a professor emeritus of law at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, comparing it to the Minamata mercury poisoning disaster in the 1950s, where lawsuits continue to be filed to this day.\n($1 = 124.8500 yen) (Reporting by Kentaro Hamada, with additional reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Writing by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by William Mallard and Ian Geoghegan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:09:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
