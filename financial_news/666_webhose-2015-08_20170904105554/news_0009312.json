Simone De Peak by Tim Dodd It's not a normal at day St Phillip's Christian College in Newcastle because Australia's chief scientist, Ian Chubb, has turned up to see year 9 and 10 students in their science and technology class.\nBut these students are not sitting in rows staring at a whiteboard. In this class they don't sit down – they are on their feet tinkering with gadgets they have designed and built.\nThere are racing cars powered by tiny high-pressure gas cylinders designed with wind tunnel testing and then built on a 3-D printer. An automated manufacturing simulation where conveyor belts and robot arms move cups around. Remote-controlled, solar-powered cars.\n\"The whole rationale of the course is explore before explain. It if fails you've got to figure out why it fails. Don't come to me,\" says teacher Dave Bonzo.\nProfessor Chubb is impressed. He says it's one of the great examples of STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) education he's seen and exactly captures the practical nature of science and engineering.\nWhat he is is seeing is a new high school subject, invented in the Newcastle area, called iSTEM – which stands for integrated science, technology, engineering and maths. It has been approved by NSW education authorities, is now taught in 14 schools in the local Hunter region, and has contributed to a surge of students choosing science, maths and engineering in senior high school.\nUnexpected results What is unusual is the way the iSTEM subject - now taught in 42 schools across the state - came about. It wasn't through the regular education system.\n In 2009 the Department of Defence offered the Newcastle region a $2.9 million grant to prepare young people to work in the local defence industry by improving STEM education in schools. The money was picked up by the local economic promotion body, Regional Development Australia (RDA) Hunter, which initially used it to build links between local employers and high schools.\nUnder the ME program – which initially stood for manufacturing education – employers mentored schools, sending people to talk to students, letting teachers know what skills they wanted to see in young recruits, and offered work experience to students.\nBut the scheme soon evolved into something much bigger. RDA Hunter joined with Scott Sleap, a teacher at Maitland Grossman High School, to develop the iSTEM subject. St Philip's starting teaching it last year.\nSt Philip's students love it's hands-on approach. They still have to turn in written work but they do that later to analyse what they did and why it succeeded or failed.\nTheir teacher loves it too. \"I've been teaching for 20 years. I've never felt better as a teacher than when I'm getting out of the way,\" says Mr Bonzo.\nFrom 11pc in physics to 17pc Professor Chubb believes the iSTEM class will have a permanent impact on the students. \"Some of them will end up lawyers, some of them will end up accountants. But I bet you it influences the way they think,\" he says.\nRDA Hunter CEO Todd Williams says organisations like his need to be more involved in education to ensure a skilled workforce is available for economic development. RDA Hunter's ME program is now operating in 26 of the 52 high schools in the Hunter region and the results are persuasive.\nIn 2011, Hunter region schools in the ME program had 11 per cent of students choosing physics in year 11, below the state average of 15 per cent. But by 2014 the Hunter figure in ME schools was up to 17 per cent, while the state average had fallen to 14 per cent. The change was even more spectacular in engineering studies where, in 2011, Hunter ME schools had 5 per cent of year 11 students choosing engineering compared to a state average of 4 per cent. But by 2014 this rose to 12 per cent compared to a state average still at 4 per cent.\nIf the students surging into STEM courses continue into a career, they will have a chance of finding a job locally. BAE Systems, an aerospace company which is one of the employers supporting the ME program, says it will need 200 more STEM-trained recruits in Newcastle when the RAAF's new F-35 Lightning II, the Joint Strike Fighter, comes to the local air base later this decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:58:15.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
