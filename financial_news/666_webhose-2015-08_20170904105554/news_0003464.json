I would favour the Euro STOXX over the FTSE,\" said Andreas Clenow, hedge fund manager and principal at ACIES Asset Management. \nOil stocks made little progress after economic data over the weekend from China, which is a major energy and metals consumer, showed another sharp drop in factory-gate prices and a surprise slump in exports. \nHowever, some financial stocks fared better to lend support to European equity markets. \nGerman insurer Allianz rose 2.6 percent after price target upgrades from JP Morgan, Berenberg and Exane BNP Paribas. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Italy's Banco Popolare also climbed 3.6 percent after the company reported a rise in profits late on Friday. \nThe Euro STOXX 50 is up around 17 percent since the start of 2015, while the FTSEurofirst is also up by a similar amount. \nGermany's DAX is up around 18 percent since the start of the year, although it is some 7 percent below a record high reached in April. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Liisa Tuhkanen; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T22:50:41.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
