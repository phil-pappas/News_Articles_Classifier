I look forward to working closely with him.\" \nMr Packer said he would work on driving Crown's joint businesses in Asia and its planned resort in Las Vegas, as well as developing its online operations. \nHe said he was deeply committed to Crown's planned six-star resort at Barangaroo in Sydney. \n\"No project is more important to me,\" he said. \nThe announcement came as Crown reported a slide in annual profits. \nNet profit fell 41.3 per cent to $385.047 million in the year to June 30 while revenues rose 12.6 per cent to $3.5 billion. \nOn a normalised basis, which strips out the effects of VIP high rollers, the pre-opening costs from Melco Crown and asset impairments, net profit fell 17.9 per cent to $525.5 million. \nCrown's bottom line was also impacted by $61.3 million worth of significant items relating primarily to its investment in Cannery. \nChief executive Rowen Craigie said Crown's businesses had a mixed performance during 2014/15. \nNormalised earnings from Crown's Australian casinos rose 14.1 per cent to $916.5 million, with solid growth at Crown Melbourne offsetting subdued growth at Crown Perth. \nHowever contributions from Melco Crown Entertainment, the Macau-based business in which Crown owns a 34.3 per cent stake, fell. \nCrown's share of MCE's normalised net profit dropped 44.6 per cent to $161.3 million. \nOverall gross gaming revenue across the Macau market declined 26.8 per cent during the year. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Crown shares drop as Packer quits chair AAP \nShares in Crown Resorts have dropped in early trade after James Packer announced he was standing down as chairman …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T03:52:28.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
