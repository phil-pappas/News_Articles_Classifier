The bank warned at the time it would probably remain unprofitable for the next three years.\nThe bank is still in the process of bolstering its capital, increasing it to 14.9 per cent by the end of June, up from 13 per cent at the end of last year.\nIt recently completed a £1.5 billion securitisation of part of a residential mortgage portfolio and has raised £250 million of tier two capital. The bank issued £250 million of subordinated debt in July in another move to strengthen its position.\nTotal operating costs fell to £259.6 million in the first half compared with £297 million in the same period last year. Project costs increased to £101.9 million, up from £68.8 million in the same period last year, as the bank revamped systems and processes.\nMr Booker said earlier this year that Co-op Bank is likely to merge with another bank after suffering its third consecutive year of heavy losses. It reported a pre-tax loss of £264 million last year, shrinking by nearly a half from the £633 milliion loss posted in 2013.\nFollow us on Twitter: @CNBCWorld", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/501a6d0a-3ff7-11e5-9abe-5b335da3a90e.html#axzz3jAkNAWr2", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/75bdee8a-d457-11e4-9bfe-00144feab7de.html#axzz3jAkNAWr2", "https://twitter.com/cnbcworld", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aa1ba604-f4c8-11e4-9a58-00144feab7de.html#axzz3jAkNAWr2"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T14:42:11.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
