It seems like investors are reacting to a poor showing in Q2 earnings from Millennial Media and YuMe. \nYuMe's co-founder and CEO Jayant Kadambi described his company's quarter as \"disappointing.\" Revenue was flat, missing expectations, while EPS of $0.17 missed by $0.08. \nThe earnings call was brutal. Kadambi said: \"Given the loss of a couple of customers I think it will take some time to get the customers back and once you lose somebody, it takes some time. But we’ve shown in the past that we are able to do it. Fundamentally on the sale side, it’s just enthusiasm in programmatic, and a little bit taking the eye off the ball.\" \nStockholders reacted in after-hours trading. Ouch.

Usually investors get spooked enough if growth declines, but not the actual revenue figures themselves. The company is guding for full-year revenue of $267-280 million, way below prior guidance of $311-342 million. \n$MM stock got hammered in after-hours trading. View gallery . (Google Finance) \nTubeMogul also reported on Monday evening. It actually had a fairly positive quarter. Revenue was up 58% year-on-year to $45.4 million. But the company swung to a net loss of $1.3 million versus a profit of $2.1 million in the year-ago quarter as it invested substantially in R&D, sales, and marketing. \nTUBE stock had already dropped a huge 14.6% ahead of its earnings release on Monday after BMO Capital analyst Daniel Salmon downgraded the stock to \"market perform\" from \"outperform.\" Salmon said he was concerned about pre-IPO ad tech company AppNexus entering the video buying market, which will put considerable pressure on TubeMogul. Another recent concern regarding TubeMogul, is Google's recent decision to shut off third-parties from selling YouTube ads via DoubleClick Ad Exchange. \nFortunately for TubeMogul, its positive quarter seems to have outweighed these longer-term concerns, and its shares rebounded 26.4% in after-hours trading.
