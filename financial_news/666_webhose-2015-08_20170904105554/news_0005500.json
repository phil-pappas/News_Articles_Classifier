Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth The difference between the two sides of the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance could not be sharper: Labor and the Greens want more transparency on how much big tax companies pay, while the government members of the committee want less.\nThe final version of the committee's interim report appears to have had some revisions from earlier media reports of its draft recommendations.\nThat's not unusual in any report. And it's much easier for an Opposition to rail against Australia's biggest taxpayers than for the government that actually has to set policy.\nBut the divergence in views highlights how much farther apart the two sides are likely to be later this year when it comes to writing the final report.\nThe 17 recommendations in the majority report presented by chairman Sam Dastyari are all about transparency, requiring both companies and the Tax Office to disclose a range of measures. Daniel Munoz In the interim report the committee has tackled what (at least by comparison) are the easy issues.\nThe 17 recommendations in the majority report presented by chairman Sam Dastyari are all about transparency, requiring both companies and the Australian Taxation Office to disclose a range of measures.\nBut any consideration of material changes – for example the proposal aimed at multinationals, to restrict the gearing of Australian subsidiaries to the global gearing level of their offshore parent companies – has been kicked down the road.\n'Voluntary' disclosure The Rio Tinto report is a model of disclosure, which nevertheless failed to detail, for example, the $US3 billion in profits reported in Singapore on which it paid 5 per cent tax. Louie Douvis The emphasis on transparency – even titling the report, You Cannot Tax What You Cannot See – is the path the OECD's base erosion profit shifting project has preferred. The first step in tax reform is to increase visibility, the OECD argues.\nThe two government members of the committee, deputy chairman Sean Edwards and Matthew Canavan, in their dissenting report conclude the government already has it just about right, and dismiss the proposal for a mandatory reporting code.\nThey say a voluntary disclosure code \"will strike a better balance between the need for transparency and the privacy and competitiveness concerns of business\".\nThis conflict of views is sharpest over the law introduced by Labor that will force the ATO to publish the total income, taxable income and tax payable of companies with total income of $100 million or more.\nThe report proposes to abolish a loophole that some of Australia's richest families, such as James Packer, use to avoid having to file accounts with ASIC for their family companies. Pat Scala The government is likely to be thwarted by the Senate in its attempts to overturn this legislation, but at least Edwards and Canavan did not repeat the government's argument that it could lead to kidnapping of wealthy Australians .\nThe committee was able to establish neither Treasury nor the Australian Federal Police had made any such finding.\nEdwards and Canavan argue instead that this forced disclosure violates individuals' rights to privacy and taxpayer confidentiality.\nThe public \"will not be assisted in understanding the legitimacy of deductions or costs incurred by a company,\" they conclude.\nThe voluntary disclosure code which Treasurer Joe Hockey has asked the Board of Taxation to develop, appears to be inspired by the report Rio Tinto publishes each year, detailing how much tax it pays in each country around the world (indeed, a Rio executive was appointed to the Board of Taxation to assist with the new code).\nThe Rio Tinto report is a model of disclosure, which nevertheless failed to detail, for example, the $US3 billion ($4.1 billion) in profits reported in Singapore on which it paid 5 per cent tax.\nRich loophole But while foreign multinationals have taken most of the attention in the committee hearings, it is the proposals to abolish the \"grandfathered\" loophole that some of Australia's richest families use to avoid having to file accounts with ASIC for their family companies, and to force these same family companies to reveal related-party transactions, that are likely to be the most contentious.\nThat would hit James Packer and Frank Lowy , but that's just the beginning.\nYou could look through the BRW Rich List and see family after family that would be picked up by these moves.\nThe inquiry was initiated by the former Greens leader, Senator Christine Milne. It fell to her successor, Senator Richard Di Natale, to file an extended response appended to the report.\nThe Greens are seeking even more details – for example, a list of the top 10 companies that transfer wealth offshore each year, which would probably pick up the big oil and gas exporters neatly, with more details on related-party deals.\nAnd Di Natale had a minor dig at Rupert Murdoch's newspapers, with a reference to the difficulties reporting on tax matters when News Corporation is rated the highest risk taxpayer by the ATO.\nBut really that's just an exchange of pleasantries.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth"], "published": "2015-08-19T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:54:46.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
