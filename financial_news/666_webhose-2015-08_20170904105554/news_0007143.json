Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro Quindell, the United Kingdom listed law firm that sold its professional services division to Slater & Gordon earlier this year , has revealed hundreds of millions of dollars of losses after publishing its restated financial accounts accounts.\nThe company told investors it had revised its revenues down by £289 million to report a £137 million pound loss rather than a £175 million profit\nOf most relevance to Australian investors were the notes to the financial statements that restated the earnings of the 'discontinued' businesses sold to Slater & Gordon. They showed a £60.1 million loss in 2013 and a £133.2 million loss in 2014.\nThe cash flow statement showed negative cash flow in 2014 of 3.75 million and a positive cash flow of 26 million. But those figures include funds raised. Operating cash flow showed a negative 60 million balance in 2013 and a negative £83 million balance in 2014.\nThe results appear to confirm the fears of some Slater & Gordon shareholders that Quindell's restated accounts would cast doubt over the £637 million ($1.3 billion) price tag forked out by Slater & Gordon in March this year in a deal described by chief executive Andrew Grech as \"transformational\".\nQuindell delayed the publishing of its accounts shortly after it confirmed the UK's corporate watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority would investigate the company.\nSlater & Gordon management assured investors that the issues surrounding Quindell were well known and that it had adjusted the company's earnings in considering the purchase price. The company restated revenues for 2014 from £645 million to £368 million. The Quindell accounts suggest the revenue was £220 million and on earnings of £86 million, Slaters paid 6.9 times.\nThe sharp reversal in revenues is largely due to changing accounting policies as the company changed from accrual to cash accounting which weights revenue recognition towards a period when payment is received. If Slater & Gordon were forced to adopt similar revenue recognition policies it would likely have adverse impact on the appearance of its accounts.\n Much of the negative cash flow in 2014 is likely to have resulted from Quindell's PSD taking on almost 62,000 noise induced hearing loss cases which the company said was \"working capital intensive, absorbing approximately £71.0m of cash during 2014.\"\n\"This rapid growth was not matched by sufficient additional claims processing capacity and the overall progression of cases was slower than expected.\"\nSubject of FCA investigation Quindell booked a £363 million profit on the sale of the PSD to Slater & Gordon based on a total consideration paid of £683 million less the value of the assets and related costs.\nQuindell said the new revenue recognition polices were adopted because of changes to the board, an increase in hearing loss cases which have a longer recovery period, a worsening trend in time to settle for legal cases and an 'increasing challenge' as to whether its current treatments were appropriate.\nQuindell also acknowledged that it was the subject of a Financial Conduct Authority investigation, given the company' chequered past under controversial businessman and founder Rob Terry.\n\"Given the intense public speculation on this subject, the launch of this investigation was not a surprise and we will, of course, co-operate fully with the FCA,\" Quindell's chairman told investors.\n\"We intend to set up internal structures to separate the FCA investigation from our operating businesses to ensure we can deliver shareholder value without the distraction of reviews of the past.\nAnalysts and short sellers raised questioned about Quindell's accounting its aggressive acquisitions and its enthusiastic pursuit of hearing loss cases of which only 8,000 out of the 63,000 the company has taken on are no longer active.\nThe hefty losses are certain to weigh on the shares of Slater & Gordon and require further justification from investors of management about its ambitious UK acquisition, and an explanation for the losses reported by Quindell.\nShares in Slater & Gordon traded sharply lower on Wednesday down 3.25 per cent to $3.27, its lowest level since September 2013, seemingly in anticipation of the UK release of the accounts.\nThe company has been plagued with doubts about its own accounting amid a probe by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission into its accounting policies and an admission of accounting errors that misstated cash receipts and payments by more than $90 million over a three year period.\nThat has sparked a near 50 per cent plunge in the share price, and a sharp rise in short interest with those betting against the company now borrowing more than 11 per cent of the free float.\nSlater & Gordon is set to report its own full year results later this month but will be hoping for clarification from the corporate watchdog well before that.\nBaker Tilley, which audits Slaters accounts in the UK because its an affiliate of Pitcher, is being investigated.\nIn related news, the Financial Reporting Council which regulates accounting firms in the UK said it was investigating two firms in relation to auditing Quindell's accounts. The FT reports that the firms in question are KPMG and RSM Tenon, which was later rebranded as Baker Tilley.\nBaker Tilley is an affiliate of Pitcher Partners, Slater & Gordon's auditors, which are themselves part of ASIC's probe.", "external_links": ["http://on.ft.com/1MO9KGv", "https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-08-05T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:07:26.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
