They also need one that can support the dozens of currencies used across Africa. \n“Many companies in Africa are still running their businesses on home-grown legacy systems or even using manual processes,” said Fenner. \n“In many cases, they don’t have the appetite for the time, risk, and cost attached to rolling out a complex, high-end platform. For that reason, we’re seeing a lot of demand in the market for systems that can be rapidly deployed to address the growing pains of a company on a global expansion drive.” \nHe said today’s enterprise applications must be flexible and modular to cater for the complexities of a global business. \n“The automatic quest for on-premises, single instance, single mega-vendor ERP capabilities is dead,” said Fenner. \n– CAJ News \nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7260   6 2015.
