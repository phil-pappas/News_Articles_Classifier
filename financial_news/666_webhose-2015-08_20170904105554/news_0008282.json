If Asda is cheaper on a basket of at least 10 items Sainsbury's customers receive a money-off coupon for the difference that can be redeemed against their next shop. \nThe sales and profits of Britain's so called Big Four grocers, which also include Morrisons, have been dented by a fierce price war as the success of discounters Aldi and Lidl has prompted them to slash prices and improve service. They have also been hurt by record commodity-led deflation. \nWhen Sainsbury's launched Brand Match it compared its prices against both Asda and market leader Tesco. However, it stopped comparisons with Tesco last October, arguing that Asda was seen as the benchmark on price. \nNews (Other OTC: NWSAL - news ) of the move came before Asda published second-quarter results on Tuesday. \nIn June Sainsbury's posted a sixth straight quarter of falling underlying sales but said it believed that its strategy was working. \nSainsbury's share price has fallen by 19 percent over the past year.
