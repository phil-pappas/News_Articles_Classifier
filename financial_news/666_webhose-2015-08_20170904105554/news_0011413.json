Nic Walker Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Steadfast Group is signalling an increase in its earnings per share this new financial year, after delivering a 38 per cent rise in underlying net profits to $56.7 million for the year ended June.\nSteadfast, one of Australia's biggest broker networks, posted a 72 per cent jump in consolidated revenue to $298.7 million for the year, and an 8 per cent rise in revenue or gross written premium from brokers to $4.4 billion.\nAcquisition hungry Steadfast also increased its final dividend to 3 cents per share, bringing the full-year payout to 5 cents per share, or 11 per cent higher than 2014.\nThe company made several acquisitions during the year, including snapping up QBE's Australian and New Zealand agency businesses in a $290 million deal.\nIt also bought eight agencies owned by Calliden Group in December.\n\"Each acquisition met our criteria for cultural and strategic fit as well as being cash EPS accretive,\" Steadfast boss Robert Kelly said.\n\"While we have taken advantage of acquisition opportunities during the year, we remain focused on delivering synergies, in particular back office cost savings, to our brokers and underwriting agencies. These savings should materialise in a more meaningful way when the market hardens.\"\nSteadfast's results come amid tough operating conditions in the commercial insurance market. Brokers have been battling increasing competition, while insurers have been hit by lower premiums as companies jostle for business.\n Steadfast is predicting earnings per share growth of 10 to 14 per cent this new financial year based on flat market conditions and no material acquisitions.\nThis will translate to a net profit of between $80 million to $83 million for the year - or an increase of between 41 and 46 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-08-26T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:04:10.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
