I learned there are different types of companies,\" he said. \nAsked about future partnerships with Volkswagen, he said \"you will not remarry someone you have divorced with,\" adding the company will focus on \"surviving independently.\" \nSuzuki planned to seek support from Volkswagen in hybrid technologies and other eco-friendly areas, while the German firm hoped to jointly develop small cars for emerging markets by taking advantage of Suzuki's know-how. \nBut they made little progress and halted their joint projects. \nThe Japanese automaker in 2011 said it wanted to end the alliance, citing a deep disagreement over collaboration and complained that its partner failed to provide promised access to technologies. \nSuzuki demanded Volkswagen sell back its stake in the Japanese carmaker by November 2012. \nAhead of Suzuki's move towards ending the tie-up, relations had become frayed as Volkswagen served notice of an alleged infringement relating to the supply of diesel engines to Suzuki from Italian carmaker Fiat (Hanover: FIA1.HA - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:43:33.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
