Some 242 went on to die from their cancer.\nResearchers found no statistically significant association between post-diagnosis current use of statins or duration of statin use and lethal prostate cancer.\nWriting in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention , they concluded that, in contrast to early suggestions of a beneficial relationship, their results provide little support for the hypothesis that statin use after diagnosis offers benefits against progression to lethal disease.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110990585086401178539/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jillmargo1"], "published": "2015-08-04T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:44:30.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
