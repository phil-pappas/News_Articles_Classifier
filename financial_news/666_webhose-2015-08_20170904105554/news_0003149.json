However, prices are still too low to ensure the survival of the fruit. \n\"It would solve the problem overnight if we could double the price,\" said Mr Taylor. \"At £2 for a 400g punnet, we can't afford to invest in the fruit.\" \nThe gooseberry fool is a traditional English recipe \nSupermarkets are reluctant to take a risk on a fruit with such a short shelf-life, Mr Taylor claimed. \"You're trying to get buyers to put something on shelves for just four weeks and they need to make a certain amount of money per square foot.\" \nIn order to sell gooseberries to the supermarkets, farmers must ensure they have all the correct paperwork in place regarding provenance and farming practices. \"All that for a few tonnes of gooseberries, it's not worth it for many,\" said Mr Taylor. \nThe gooseberry is one of the first fruits ever cultivated commercially in this country. The first farms began growing the fruit in the 1600s when there were 2,000 different varieties in the UK. \nThere are now just 20 varieties of gooseberry grown in this country, and only seven are cultivated by commercial farms. \nMany varieties of British gooseberry were destroyed by a disease known as American Gooseberry Mildew, which was spread when infected American gooseberries were imported at the beginning of the 20th century. \nMr Taylor has been growing gooseberries on Winterwood, his family farm near Maindenhead, Kent, since 1978. \n\"We started out as a small grower so we decided to do all the minor fruits as a point of difference,\" he explained. \"Today, we grow about 150 tonnes of gooseberries a year.\" \nWinterwood farm also specialises in other rare minor fruits, such as whitecurrants, redcurrants, blackcurrants. Blueberries are the mainstay of the £28m-turnover farm. \"We send blueberries all over the country but the irony is that the blueberries pay for us to transport the minor fruits, otherwise we couldn't afford to move them around the country.\" \nThe loganberry is a relative of the raspberry (PhotoLibrary) \nThere are fears that the gooseberry might follow other heritage berries into the history books. \n\"We were the last commercial farm to grow loganberries for the supermarkets,\" claimed Mr Taylor. \"They haven't been sold for 10 years now. \n\"The gooseberry might go the same way. The odds of us growing them in 20 years time is about 50/50 right now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:26:56.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
