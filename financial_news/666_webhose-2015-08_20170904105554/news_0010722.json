In 2014, it posted a loss of $124.4 million, from $108.8 million in 2013. \nAccording to the International Air Transport Industry Association, African airlines are expected to see the slowest growth among developing markets with a capacity and demand expansion of 3.3 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively this year.
