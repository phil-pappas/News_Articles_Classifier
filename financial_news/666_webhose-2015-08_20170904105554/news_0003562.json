And recent acquisitions like MashUp are their ticket. Supplied by Agnes King Professional services giants PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, Ernst&Young and KPMG have become some of the most active collectors of small and medium businesses that I've seen in recent times.\nBetween them they've snapped up at least 19 businesses in the past 18 months. And their appetite is not abating.\nAll the Big Four firm CEOs have flagged further acquisitions in the year ahead.\nKPMG will launched a US$200 million-300 million venture capital fund later this year to acquire \"disruptive\" digital assets. This new fund is three times the size it was when first seeded in 2013 at US$85 million. That money is now almost fully deployed.\nAll the Big Four firm CEOs have flagged further acquisitions in the year ahead. Peter Riches Even medium-sized accounting firms are tacking on complimentary services. Look at Grant Thornton's purchase of digital consultancy Consult Point in May, or Prosperity Advisors' merger with immigration firm Fountainguard. And Findex, Australia's fifth largest accounting firm based on revenue, hasn't let its $200 million purchase of Crowe Horwath dent its appetite for further acquisitions.\nSo what's the criteria these firms are looking for? And how can sellers make themselves attractive to them?\n1. Work on the same clients as them, but do something they don't Deloitte's most recent acquisition, brand and spatial design agency MashUp, bumped into Deloitte's digital team on a financial services engagement. They worked side-by-side for 18 months before deciding their culture, services and ambitions were so complimentary they should merge.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Be an absolute expert in a niche that is critical to their clients The Big Four want to solve the biggest, gnarliest problems facing c-suite executives and boards. That's what keeps them relevant in the marketplace. KPMG's purchase of human rights and social impact consultancy, Banarra, is a good example of this. KPMG cares about human rights because its Blue Chip clients are pushing heavily into fraught geographies like Asia which introduces explosive risks that are blind-siding management and boards.\nâ€Ž3. Have global ambitions but a shortage or manpower and money to realise them Accountants, as a general rule, are not short on manpower, in fact, with the automation of highly procedural work a lot of their workforce are sitting around twiddling their thumbs or getting fired. But they want highly repeatable solutions that can be lifted and shifted to other markets. Most ASX-listed companies are looking for growth offshore.\n4. Be digital Forget pizza, Dominos is a technology company . Enough said.\n5. Don't expect top dollar Accountants are notoriously frugal. It maybe a wild generalisation but while the lawyers are piling into Zegna, the accountants are on a tax deductible business trip having their wardrobe made in Asia. In the context of acquisitions, there is a simple reason accountants are bargain hunters: partnerships are more sensitive to the impact on earnings than a corporation. Accounting firms don't have a balance sheet so they are very focussed on whether a takeover target is earnings accretive.\n6. Be patient Professional services firms can take longer to get a deal across the line compared to a corporate. An bunch of accountants doing due diligence on a transaction is like putting a pig in mud. Partnerships rule by consensus which slows things down too. But, to their credit, accountants have made massive strides to improve this in recent years and should only get better.\n7. Fit culturally Big accounting firms are obsessed with maintaining their culture and won't risk buying an asset that dominates their own unique flavour.\n8. Accept there will be more administration With their breadth of services, large accounting firms need rigorous governance systems to manage conflicts of interest. This is getting worse the more globally connected the world becomes, and as they expand into alternative service offerings.
