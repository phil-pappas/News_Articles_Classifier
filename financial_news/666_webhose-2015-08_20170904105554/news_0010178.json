The teen clothing retailer's changes include no longer having shirtless models at its stores, getting rid of \"sexualized\" ads, shrinking the logo on its clothing and trying to stock trendier merchandise to keep up with \"fast fashion\" chains that change their styles more often.\nQuarterly revenue for the chain fell to $817.8 million from $890.6 million, but still beat Wall Street forecasts. Ten analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research predicted $811.3 million in revenue.\nWhile sales at stores open at least a year dropped 4 percent, it was better than the 8 percent decline reported in the first quarter.\nThis figure is a key gauge of a retailer's health because it excludes results from stores recently opened or closed.\nFor the Hollister brand, such sales edged down 1 percent. This compares with a 6 percent drop in the first quarter. The Abercrombie brand reported a 7 percent decline, compared with a 9 percent fall in the previous quarter.\nAbercrombie & Fitch said that it expects same-store sales to continue to improve going forward.\nFor the period ended Aug. 1, the chain lost $810,000, or a penny per share. That compares with a profit of $12.9 million, or 17 cents per share, a year ago. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs, came to 12 cents per share.\nThe results topped analysts' expectations. The average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Zacks was for a loss of 8 cents per share.\nShares of Abercrombie & Fitch Co. added $2.63, or 15.2 percent, to $19.90 about 30 minutes before the market open.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T16:27:32.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
