Nic Walker Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith There's nothing a professional investor likes more than a sell-off. While some individuals watch markets anxiously when share prices are plummeting, possibly with one finger hovering over the \"sell\" button, portfolio managers watch their screens willing share prices in their favourite stocks to go down further.\nThey know that whatever they lose in the share price declines, they can make back by investing in the names they've done the hard work trying to understand and buying more at a lower price.\nThe sell-off, which saw the S&P/ASX200 index lose around 14 per cent of its value at the start of the week compared with the end of July, might have blind-sided some who were strapped in for earnings season. But the investment community had mostly been expecting it for some time.\nCash levels within managed funds have been high for some time relative to their historic levels. (Holding cash is an expression of a fund manager's nervousness with company valuations.) To the extent allowed by their mandates, says research house Morningstar, investment firms have been gradually increasing their cash holdings this year.\nBut there is a sense this Monday's slide in the S&P/ASX200 index from 5700 to around 5000 (before rebounding later in the week) was the buying opportunity many funds managers had been waiting for.\n\"We're taking the opportunity to buy quality companies. The sell down was overdue, it's a good opportunity to get some [more equities] exposure,\" says David Paradice, founder of specialist small caps investment firm, Paradice Investments.\nRobert Penaloza, Aberdeen Asset Management's head of equities, says he has been buying \"high quality names\" this week. \"We're topping up some positions in healthcare, domestic building materials and some select opportunities we've been keeping a close eye on,\" he adds.\nGeoff Lloyd, Perpetual CEO, says the specialist Australian equities investment firm has been buying heavily in recent weeks and in the last week in particular. Perpetual's Australian equities funds have invested a \"significant amount\" of the up to 9 per cent of cash held.\n He highlights the buying within Perpetual Equity Investment Company, the listed investment company the company floated last year after raising $250 million. The fund has been holding 60 per cent cash waiting for the market to throw up decent buying opportunities and, as of the end of this week. much of that dry powder had been deployed.\nMost professional investors will explain the sell off in recent weeks as a bloodletting that needed to happen to \"reset\" valuation levels with historical averages.\n\"Usually it goes down faster than it goes up. I was expecting a 15 per cent sell off but not the beginning of a bear market,\" says Donald Williams, Platypus Asset Management chief investment officer.\n\"We used to measure market corrections in increments of 20 per cent so this is no great surprise. And remember the US hasn't had a correction in more than four-years.\"\nInvestors with medium- and long-term time horizons are likely finding some comfort in the broader \"macro\" economic story to support valuations. While global growth remains flat and the effect of China's decelerating GDP growth continues to buffet companies in the resources segment, Paradice says there are some conditions that favour stocks coming off these levels.\n\"We think the US is in reasonable shape, it probably just got ahead of itself. But I'd say the down draft [sell off in US stocks and subsequently the ASX] was a little bit over done,\" he says.\nParadice points to the low interest rate environment and the expected continuing decline of the Australian dollar in comparison to the US as factors that will likely provide reasonably favourable conditions for the local stock market to generate returns from current levels.\n\"There's a huge focus on the trouble in resources but that's an area where margins were never really sustainable. A lower $A for longer could mean better businesses and stronger returns in other areas such as tourism, education, financial services and health care,\" Paradice says.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Matt_JS", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:26:31.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
