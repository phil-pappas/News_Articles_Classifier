Rob Homer by Shaun Drummond The corporate cop must have more money independent of the government because it is busiest when governments are cutting back, financial system inquiry head David Murray says.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission should also be exempt from the Public Service Act so it can pay its people more.\nMr Murray also reiterated his call for ASIC to have the power to stop financial products before they get people into trouble, which he said had received a lot of criticism.\n\"Government budgets go through a cycle to do with the state of the economy and the cycle in Australia can be larger than in other countries,\" he told a Governance Institute conference in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\"By the time the cycle is going bad and ASIC needs more resources, there is an asymmetry between ASIC and the government in the funding process.\"\nIn July the government appointed a \"capability review\" of ASIC, which is considering its funding and powers.\nMr Murray said ASIC should not be subject to the Public Service Act because it limited pay and the ability to attract the best people and it did not work on the same basis as businesses it is regulating.\n\"They have got to be separated from the Public Service Act,\" he said, because ASIC faced the same difficulty he did when he led the Future Fund â€“ it couldn't pay as well as the corporate sector.\n Relying on pages and pages of disclosure to protect consumers had not worked and \"product intervention\" powers for ASIC were necessary, he said.\n\"There is information asymmetry between companies and individuals.\"\nIf it did have such a power, it might be able to spend less on financial literacy education, he said.\nMr Murray criticised ASIC's requests for details on company \"culture framework\", saying it was an onerous task and it was not clear what this achieved.\n\"Culture is important, but we risk it becoming the issue, not prosecuting the criminal conduct,\" he said.\nASIC deputy commissioner Peter Kell defended its approach. He said culture was often very practical, including the inventives given to staff, which might lead people to sell products that were not right for the customer.\n\"We're in furious agreement,\" he said. \"Culture is not some abstract concept, it is shorthand for capturing the incentives that drive an industry. It is reflected in remuneration, it is driven by the amount of resources you put into a compliance area.\n\"What do you do when someone reports a breach? What happens in terms of your processes and policies for reporting breaches? Is that set up to game the system so every breach fails the test, or do you act promptly?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:05:12.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
