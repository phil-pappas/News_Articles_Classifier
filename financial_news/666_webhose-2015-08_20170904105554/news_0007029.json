And in the city's retail market, that isn't an anomaly. The center, nestled in the southwest corner of Wurzbach Parkway and Blanco Road on a former Wal-Mart outparcel, point to three significant trends in the city: retail development is picking up, the project size is getting smaller and demand among tenants continues to climb. \"No question — smaller retail centers lease up quickly,\" said Michael Schoenbrun , Cencor's city partner. \"There has been very little development in the past five years, and with the economy doing well and businesses doing well, people want to expand. There's a lot of demand from users.\" Schoenbrun went on to say that multi-unit operators are looking for their second, third, fourth, even fifth locations that, in prior years, weren't available. And Parkway Oaks is a perfect example of that trend. The center has signed Bahama Buck's, Sport Clips, AT&T and Texan Urgent Care, leaving 4,000 square feet for two or three more service-oriented users. The Weitzman Group , Cencor's realty arm, bought the 1.46-acre site from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). Schoenbrun said that having the retail giant as its neighbor will be a \"major anchor and draw a lot of traffic.\" At the same time, a majority of new retail development in the city will be floating without an anchor. According to REOC San Antonio's second-quarter retail report, the market closed with a healthy 10 percent citywide vacancy rate. That stability has prompted a wave of construction, but that new supply will be small and targeted toward food and service tenants. Brian Harris , REOC San Antonio's senior vice president and partner, said: \"Speculative development will remain user-driven and limited to smaller projects, but retailers and restaurants will continue to expand to serve San Antonio's growing population.\" \nWant San Antonio Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
