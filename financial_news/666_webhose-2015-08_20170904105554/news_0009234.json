Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. \nDue to the spin-off on May 30, 2014 of our accommodations business into a stand-alone, publicly traded corporation (Civeo Corporation, or Civeo) through a tax-free distribution of the accommodations business to the Company's shareholders (the Spin-Off), and the sale of our tubular services business on September 6, 2013, both of which are reported as discontinued operations, our management believes that income from continuing operations is more representative of the Company's current business environment and focus. The terms \"earnings\" and \"loss\" as used in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" refer to income (loss) from continuing operations. \nMacroeconomic Environment \nWith the completion of the Spin-Off, we are now a technology-focused, pure-play energy services company. We provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry through our offshore products and well site services business segments. Demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry, particularly our customers' willingness to invest capital in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas. Our customers' capital spending programs are generally based on their outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices, economic growth, commodity demand and estimates of resource production. As a result, demand for our products and services is largely sensitive to expected commodity prices, principally related to crude oil and natural gas. \nIn the past few years, crude oil prices have been volatile due to global economic uncertainties as well as inadequate regional well site transportation infrastructure. Significant downward crude oil price volatility began early in the fourth quarter of 2014 and prices continued to drop precipitously throughout the remainder of 2014 and into the first quarter of 2015, with a partial recovery during the second quarter of 2015 offset by a decline in prices in July. The material decrease in crude oil prices can primarily be attributed to significant production growth in the U.S. shale plays, strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) increase of its production and indication not to cut production, offset somewhat by relatively modestly increasing global oil demand. The average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil decreased from an average price of $73 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 to an average of $58 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. These data points compare to an average price of $101 per barrel in the first half of 2014. The average price of Intercontinental Exchange Brent (Brent) crude decreased from an average price of $76 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2014 to an average of $62 per barrel in the second quarter of 2015. These data points compare to an average price of $109 per barrel in the first half of 2014. As of July 28, 2015, WTI crude prices had decreased relative to their levels at the end of the first half of 2015 to approximately $48 per barrel, while Brent crude prices decreased relative to their levels at the end of the first half of 2015 to approximately $53 per barrel. Crude oil prices decreased early in the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to the slower than expected decline in domestic crude oil production, concerns regarding the growth outlook in China, the economic uncertainties surrounding the financial crisis in Greece and their potential exit from the Eurozone, and the anticipation of potential supply increases related to the proposed lifting of sanctions against Iran. These events have created market concern that crude oil prices will stall, weaken and remain in a relatively low-priced range for the foreseeable future, with the current twelve-month forward strip price for WTI and Brent crude averaging $51 per barrel and $56 per barrel, respectively. The price for WTI crude will continue to influence our customers' spending in U.S. shale play developments, such as the Bakken, Niobrara, Permian and Eagle Ford basins. Spending in these regions will influence the overall drilling and completion activity in the area and, therefore, the activity of our well site services segment. The price for Brent crude will influence our customers' spending related to offshore drilling and development and, thus, the activity of our offshore products segment. \nGiven the historical volatility of crude prices, there remains a risk that prices could deteriorate further due to high levels of domestic and OPEC crude oil production, slowing growth rates in various global regions and/or the potential for ongoing supply/demand imbalances. Conversely, if the global supply of oil and global inventory levels were to decrease due to reduced capital investment by our customers or government instability in a major oil-producing nation and energy demand continues to increase in the U.S. and countries such as China and India, a recovery in WTI and Brent crude prices could occur. In any event, crude oil price improvements will depend upon a rebalancing of global supply and demand, the timing of which is difficult to predict. If commodity prices do not improve or if they decline further, demand for our products and services could further decline. \nPrices for natural gas in the U.S. averaged $2.82 per mmBtu in the first half of 2015 compared to $3.78 per mmBtu in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $4.89 per mmBtu in the first half of 2014. Natural gas prices declined during the first half of 2015 largely due to increased natural gas inventories. Natural gas prices traded at approximately $2.82 per mmBtu as of July 28, 2015. Strong production and a milder winter this year compared to last year resulted in significant increases in natural gas inventories in the U.S. during the first half of 2015, from 29% below the 5-year average as of the end of the first half of 2014 to 1% above the 5-year average as of the end of the first half of 2015. Customer spending in the natural gas shale plays has been limited due to associated gas being produced from unconventional oil wells in North America, specifically onshore shale production resulting from the broad application of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques which continued during the first half of the year. As a result of natural gas production growth outpacing demand in the U.S., natural gas prices continue to be weak relative to prices experienced from 2006 through 2008 and are expected to remain below levels considered economical for new investments in numerous natural gas fields, with the current twelve-month forward strip price for natural gas averaging $3.09 per mmBtu. If natural gas production growth continues to surpass demand in the U.S. and/or the supply of natural gas were to increase, whether the supply comes from conventional or unconventional production or associated natural gas production from oil wells, prices for natural gas could remain depressed for an extended period and result in fewer rigs drilling for natural gas. \nRecent WTI crude, Brent crude and natural gas pricing trends are as follows: \nAverage Price (1) WTI Brent Henry Hub Quarter Crude Crude Natural Gas Ended (per bbl) (per bbl) (per mmBtu) 6/30/2015 $ 57.85 $ 61.65 $ 2.75 3/31/2015 48.49 53.98 2.90 12/31/2014 73.21 76.43 3.78 9/30/2014 97.87 101.90 3.96 6/30/2014 103.35 109.69 4.61 3/31/2014 98.68 108.14 5.18 12/31/2013 97.50 109.23 3.85 9/30/2013 105.83 110.23 3.55 6/30/2013 94.05 102.56 4.02 3/31/2013 94.33 112.47 3.49 12/31/2012 88.01 110.15 3.40 \n(1) Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). As of July 28, 2015, WTI crude, Brent crude and natural gas traded at approximately $48 per barrel, $53 per barrel and $2.82 per mmBtu. \nOverview \nDemand for our offshore products segment is tied primarily to the long-term outlook for commodity prices. Demand for our well site services segment responds to shorter-term movements in oil and natural gas prices and, specifically, changes in North American drilling and completion activity. Other factors that can affect our business and financial results include the general global economic environment and regulatory changes in the U.S. and international markets. \nOur offshore products segment provides highly engineered products and services for offshore oil and natural gas production systems and facilities, as well as certain products and services to the offshore drilling market. Sales of our offshore products and services depend primarily upon capital spending for offshore production systems and subsea pipelines, repairs and upgrades of existing offshore drilling rigs and construction of new offshore drilling rigs and vessels. In this segment, we are particularly influenced by global deepwater drilling and production spending, which are driven largely by our customers' longer-term outlook for crude oil and natural gas prices. We believe some of these deepwater projects are less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the price of crude oil and natural gas although recent declines in crude oil prices have caused exploration and production companies to reevaluate their future capital expenditures in regards to these deepwater projects. In addition, shorter-cycle product sales (such as elastomer products) and services for this segment have declined in the first half of 2015. \nBidding and quoting activity for our offshore products segment continued during the first half of 2015, albeit at a slower pace. Accordingly, backlog in our offshore products segment decreased approximately 16% to $409 million at June 30, 2015 from $490 million at December 31, 2014 due to project deferrals and delays in award timing resulting from the continued low commodity price environment. Backlog totaled $599 million at June 30, 2014. \nOur well site services business segment is primarily affected by drilling and completion activity primarily in the U.S., including the Gulf of Mexico, and, to a lesser extent, Canada and the rest of the world. In the past few years, our industry has experienced a shift in spending from natural gas exploration and development to crude oil and liquids-rich exploration and development in the North American shale plays utilizing horizontal drilling and completion techniques. According to the most current rig count data published by Baker Hughes Incorporated, the U.S. oil rig count peaked in October 2014 at 1,609 rigs but has declined materially in recent months due to much lower crude oil prices, totaling 659 rigs as of July 24, 2015. The July 24, 2015 oil rig count comprised approximately 75% of total U.S. drilling activity. The remaining 25% of drilling activity is largely natural gas related. The U.S. natural gas-related working rig count has declined from more than 810 rigs at the beginning of 2012 to 216 rigs as of July 24, 2015, a more than 28 year low. \nIn our well site services business segment, we predominantly provide completion services and, to a lesser extent, land drilling services. Our completion services business provides equipment and service personnel utilized in the completion and initial production of new and recompleted wells. Activity for the completion services business is dependent primarily upon the level and complexity of drilling, completion and workover activity throughout North America. Well complexity has increased with the continuing transition to multi-well pads and the drilling of longer laterals along with the increased number of frac stages completed in horizontal wells. Demand for our drilling services is driven by land drilling activity in our primary drilling markets of the Permian Basin in West Texas, where we primarily drill oil wells, and the Rocky Mountain area in the U.S., where we drill both liquids-rich and natural gas wells. \nDemand for our land drilling and completion services businesses is correlated to changes in the drilling rig count in North America, as well as changes in the total number of wells expected to be drilled, total footage expected to be drilled and the number of drilled wells that are completed. The table below sets forth a summary of North American rig activity, as measured by Baker Hughes Incorporated, for the periods indicated. \nAverage Drilling Rig Count for Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 U.S. Land - Oil 661 1,488 857 1,441 U.S. Land - Natural gas and other 217 308 248 319 U.S. Offshore 31 56 40 56 Total U.S. 909 1,852 1,145 1,816 Canada 100 202 204 364 Total North America 1,009 2,054 1,349 2,180 \nThe average North American rig count for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased 831 rigs, or 38%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014 in response to much lower crude oil prices from the levels experienced in the first half of 2014. Further, the average rig count decreased 41% in the first half of 2015 compared with the second half of 2014. \nExacerbating the steep declines in drilling activity, several of our exploration and production customers have been and are continuing to defer well completions. These deferred completions are referred to in the industry as drilled but uncompleted wells (or \"DUC's\"). Motivation on the part of our customers to defer completions is generally driven by the need to preserve cash flow in a weak commodity price environment and/or the desire to produce reserves at a later date with expectations that commodity prices will improve and/or completion costs will decline. Given our wellsite services segment's exposure to completion activity, DUC's have an added negative impact on our results of operations. \nWe continue to monitor the global economy, the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the resultant impact on the capital spending plans and operations of our customers in order to plan our business. We currently expect to spend a total of approximately $150 million to $160 million for capital expenditures during 2015 to upgrade and maintain our completion services and drilling services equipment, to expand and upgrade our offshore products facilities, and to fund various other capital spending initiatives. Whether planned expenditures will actually be spent in 2015 depends on industry conditions, project approvals and schedules, vendor delivery timing and free cash flow generation. We plan to fund the capital expenditures with available cash, internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. In our well site services segment, the majority of our capital expenditures in the first half of 2015 were carryover from 2014. In this segment, we continue to monitor industry capacity additions and will make future capital expenditure decisions based on an evaluation of both the market outlook and industry fundamentals. \nConsolidated Results of Operations \nWe manage and measure our business performance in two distinct operating segments: well site services and offshore products.
