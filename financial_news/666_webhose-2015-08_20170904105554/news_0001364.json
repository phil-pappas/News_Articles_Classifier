In addition, the company's stalwart 911 should see some cosmetic changes in the next couple of years as well. \nAs a result, some buyers may be holding out for the next-generation cars rather than sinking cash into a current model at the end of its product cycle. \nThe Macan is the right car at the right time for the current US market, which surged past an annual sales pace for new vehicles of 17 million in July. Trucks and SUVs are driving the market to levels not seen since before the Great Recession, as consumers benefit from cheaper gas and favorable credit terms. If you're selling SUVs in the USA, you're happy. And Porsche has in the Macan rolled out a very successful crossover SUV, replicating the success of the Cayenne. \nPorsche is also well on its way to beating its 2018 global sales goal of 200,000 cars — a few years early. \nBy the end of June, Porsche had already sold more than 113,000 cars worldwide. \nThe VW Group brand sold 189,000 cars worldwide in 2014. \nIn spite of the company's recent growth, Porsche won't be leaving the realm of niche luxury performance brand anytime soon. As nice as 200,000 cars sold a year may sound, General Motors sold more than 272,000 vehicles in the US in the month of July alone. \nThen again, I don't think Porsche has any designs of becoming the next GM.
