After the new norms for traditional products kicked in from January 1, 2014, life insurance companies had to stop selling existing products and introduce new ones.\n\nLIC, too, had to withdraw its products from the market and introduce new guidelines-compliant variants of the products, which included money-back plans.\n\nHowever, there was no Ulip launch in 2014. Ulips constitute less than 10 per cent of the total product mix of LIC and the rest comprises traditional life insurance products.\n\nIn a recent interview to Business Standard, S K Roy, LIC chairman had said that they have all the necessary approvals for the Ulip and we will be launching it during the second quarter (July-September). He had also said that historically, their Ulip products have done quite well and that they are optimistic on the new product.\n\nSpeaking at an insurance conference held by Dun & Bradstreet and LIC today, Sharma explained that the confidence of customers has started growing in the insurance sector and the companies. However, he added that distribution and costs were still an issue with the industry and it is the tied-channel which has been the backbone of the industry.\n\n\"We need to have strategies to take insurance penetration to the world average by atleast 2020,\" said Sharma. Sharma said that LIC has collected Rs 7000 crore under Varishta Pension Yojana. In the Union Budget 2014-2015, the finance minister announced the revival of Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana.\n\nDuring the lifetime of Pensioner, a pension in the form of immediate annuity as per mode chosen by the Pensioner shall be payable. On death of the Pensioner the Purchase Price shall be refunded. LIC of India has been given the sole privilege to operate this scheme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T17:02:24.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
