Volumes were relatively thin as the UK market was closed for a public holiday. \nThe Federal Reserve left open on Friday the possibility of a September rate rise, although several of its officials said the prolonged turmoil in financial markets might delay the first policy tightening in nearly a decade. \nWeaker Asian markets, coupled with more volatility in Chinese stock markets which have fallen sharply this month amid signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, also weighed on European equities. \n\"The market turmoil will continue in the near future. China is the catalyst, but the real reason for the sell-off is the nervousness about the first U.S. rate hike,\" KBC senior economist, Koen De Leus, said. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in French telecoms group Iliad (Paris: FR0004035913 - news ) fell 4 percent, with some traders citing disappointment over the free cash flow levels, even though the company posted a rise in first-half profits. \nOn the upside, shares in Eni rose 2.5 percent after the Italian energy company announced the discovery off Egypt of the largest known gas field in the Mediterranean. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Louise Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:11:59.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
