With the transfer, we’ve now become Bangladeshi citizens and can now access all citizenship benefits,” said Khandaker.\n“We’ve finally seen the light,” he told AFP.\nMaidul Islam, 18, added: “We’re now human being with full human rights.”\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 9:27 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:17:34.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
