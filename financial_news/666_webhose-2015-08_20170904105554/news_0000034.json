The Dow declined further ending the week down -1.79 percent and the S&P 500 moved towards the bottom of its range ending down -1.25 percent. In other news: the probability of a Fed rate hike in September is increasing with the latest July employment report; Dow 7-day losing streak worst since 2011; and, a further drop in Apple could crush the market . Below is a recap of the markets for each day of the week. \nThe markets were down on Monday on a weak factory report out of China, and the reopening of the Greek stock market which dropped -16 percent. Oil dropped $2 to $45.50. The Dow dropped -0.5 percent to 17,598; the S&P 500 dropped -0.28 percent to 2,098. \nOn Tuesday, the markets again dropped on hawkish talk from Atlanta Fed's Lockhart. Oil rose slightly to $45.75. The Dow fell -0.3 percent to 17,550; the S&P 500 dropped -0.22 percent to 2,093. \nOn Wednesday the markets ended mixed on mixed economic data: the ADP report indicated a weak jobs report on Friday; the ISM non-manufacturing report indicated a strong jobs report; and, trade data proved soft after another flat reading for exports. Oil sank $0.50 to $45.00. The Dow dropped fractionally to 17,540; the S&P 500 rose 0.31 percent to 2,100. \nThe markets dropped sharply on Thursday due to a drop in media stocks and the questionable longevity of cable companies. Oil dropped fractionally to $44.75. The Dow was pulled down by Viacom and Disney -0.7 percent to 17,419; the S&P 500 dropped -0.78 percent at 2,084. \nOn Friday, the markets were again down on a solid jobs report which increased the likelihood of a tax rate hike in September. Oil dropped $1 to $43.75. The Dow dropped -0.3 percent to 17,373; the S&P 500 dropped -0.29 percent to 2,078. \nThe markets slumped this week on disappointing earnings reports, mixed economic reports, and the growing probability of a rate hike in September. Year-to-date the Dow is in negative territory, down -2.52 percent, while the S&P 500 remains in positive territory at 0.91 percent. Roughly 87 percent of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with around 75 percent beating estimates, and 50 percent topping sales projections. Currently, Wall Street projects earnings to drop -1.0 percent for the second quarter. \nThe July jobs report sets the stage for a rate hike in September . Slightly below expectations, the economy created 215,000 non-farm jobs, bringing the monthly average since May to 235,000 jobs (up from an average 195,000 jobs in the first quarter). This latest jobs report shows the economy and labor market to be performing well enough for the FOMC to consider raising rates in September. The probability of a rate hike has now increased to 75 percent (up from 50 percent earlier), as implied by the federal funds futures. Economists on Wall Street said that the job numbers satisfy the criteria laid out in the last FOMC minutes announcement. \nThe Dow's losing streak is the worst since the debt-ceiling crisis in 2011. The Dow has been down 7 consecutive days and is close to breaking the 8 consecutive days set back in July/August of 2011. The 50-day moving average is just 23 points away from crossing below the Dow's 200-day moving average; the last time this occurred was on August 24, 2011. Every piece of data from this point forward will play an important role in the Fed's decision in September. The energy sector is proving to be the biggest drag on the Dow, as oil prices continue to fall. \nThe world's largest company by market value, Apple, has tumbled after releasing its earnings report . While the report showed Apple beat earnings and sales estimates (33% and 38% respectively), it lowered sales outlook for the next fiscal quarter and refused to provide detailed sales figures for the Apple Watch. Couple this with a slowdown in China, and investors feel that the fast pace of growth for Apple will come to a halt. If Apple doesn't recover soon, it could lead the market into a correction . Apple has dropped more than 10 percent from its peak and has closed under its 200-day moving average for the first time since September 2013. \nThe bottom line: the economy is looking solid after the release of the employment situation last Friday, in which jobs increased by 215,000 and the unemployment rate remained at a low 5.3 percent. The factory sector has shown weakness while vehicle sales showed the consumer strengthening. \nThe focus next week in the U.S. will be on manufacturing (industrial production), housing (housing starts), and the consumer (retail sales). Globally the focus will be on GDP flash reports out of Europe. In addition, the focus will be on the following: UK (labor market report); eurozone (ECB publishes its minutes, industrial production, GDP, harmonized index of consumer prices); Germany (GDP, ZEW survey); China (merchandise trade, CPI, PPI, industrial production, retail sales); and Japan (private machinery orders). \nYear-to-date the markets are mixed: Dow -2.5%; S&P500 +0.9%; Nasdaq +6.5%. \nThe Markets for the past week were: DJIA down -1.8%; S&P500 down -1.3%; Nasdaq COMP down -1.7%. \nCommodities (ETFs) for the past week were: Gold (GLD) down -0.27%; Silver (SLV) up 0.21%; Oil (OIH) down -1.63%; Dollar (UUP) up 0.35%; 30-year Bonds (TYX) dropped 10 basis points to 2.83%. \nThe VIX this past week (a measure of market sentiment and volatility) rose to 13.39% due to the increased probability of a rate hike in September. \nTo see what's on the calendar for next week, go to the Econoday calendar. \nThe economic calendar for next week is light: o Monday – nothing o Tuesday – Productivity and Costs o Wednesday – EIA Petroleum Status Report, JOLTS, Treasury Budget o Thursday – Weekly Jobless Claims, Retail Sales, Import and Export Prices, Business Inventories o Friday – PPI-FD, Industrial Production, Consumer Sentiment \nIf you're trading options, it is suggested trading Put Credit spreads for next week at 2.0 standard deviations or greater. Expect the price of the SPX to fall within 2007 and 2150 (2 standard deviations). \nFor more information about options, see the 'Suggested Links' below.
