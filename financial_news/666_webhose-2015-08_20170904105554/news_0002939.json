If a free-floating currency moves that much, the reaction would have been different.\"\nChina guided the yuan lower for a third day on Thursday, and it started the day 0.2 percent below Wednesday's local close.\nThe yuan has fallen 3.5 percent so far this week.\nThe unexpected yuan changes \"raised concerns that profits in China could fall when converted to the yen and also fear the Chinese economy might be in such a shape as to need a currency devaluation,\" said Kenji Abe, chief equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\"But the impact of the fall in the yuan on the Japanese economy should not be that big. So I expect the Tokyo stocks to stabilise soon.\"\nConcerns about the Chinese economy helped to drive the Nikkei down to two-week lows on Wednesday.\nBut it managed to recover on Thursday, helped by a 1.8 percent gain in its heavyweight Fast Retailing, which rebounded after a two-week downtrend.\nA few other Nikkei heavyweights provided a boost, including Trend Micro, which rose 4.8 percent after earnings.\nBut the broader market remained listless, with big cap shares hit the hardest.\nThe Topix core 30 fell 0.8 percent as bank share fell sharply. SMFG fell 2.6 percent while Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 1.7 percent.\nInvestors also took profits in telecom shares, which had become a bit of safe haven.\nNTT, which hit a 15-year high earlier this month, fell 0.9 percent while KDDI, at a record high on Tuesday, fell 1.2 percent.\nSoftbank fell 3.0 percent due to disappointing earnings from Alibaba, in which it has a large stake.
