The identity of the candidate, who has already been identified, is not known, but is thought to be someone Mr McFarlane has previously worked alongside. \nThe new senior hire who is unlikely to join the bank’s board but will sit on its executive committee will mastermind the bank’s strategy and its transformation agenda to create value. \nGiven Mr McFarlane is initially adopting the majority of Mr Jenkins’ plans for the bank, the new strategy’s chief initial focus will be on cutting costs. \nMr McFarlane is known to have told friends that he believes the bank is inefficient, and that waiting for a new chief executive to solve that problem is not an option. \nHeadhunter Spencer Stuart is in the process of drawing up a longlist of possible candidates, expected to be complete by early September, with the hope of naming a new chief executive by the turn of the year. \nBarclays' chief executive Antony Jenkins lost his job in July, after less than three years in the role (Credit: Bloomberg) \nMr McFarlane is said to favour the need for an external candidate, meaning chief financial officer Tushar Morzaria is unlikely to make any shortlist, despite his interest in the role. \nThe creation of a new strategy and transformation chief also raises questions over the role of Jonathan Moulds, the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch executive , who was hired by Mr Jenkins in February as chief operating officer. He was brought in to restructure the bank and lead cost-cutting, with a particular focus on the separation required ahead of the UK bank ring fence coming into law in 2019. \nMr McFarlane is launching a drive to create a better customer service ethos at the bank. Although he believes staff are no longer breaking rules in areas such as Libor or PPI, he said last week that there was room for improvement. \n“As far as we can discover, we’re not creating any new issues the cultural change in terms of conduct has improved considerably. I believe we’ve broken the back of this,” he said. “On the other hand, the one word we want to see more of is 'the customer’. It is not a word I hear very often here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T03:37:57.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
