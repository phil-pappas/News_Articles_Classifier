It lifts our spirits and energizes us.\" \nBut Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who has been a vocal opponent of the project and is among those suing to halt it, promised his administration will \"continue to fight for the best interests and public safety\" of residents in Charlestown, the historic city neighborhood located near the proposed casino. \nThe intrigue over Wynn's bid for the relatively obscure state certificate had ramped up in recent weeks as Friday's decision deadline approached. \nMayor Walsh, state Attorney General Maura Healey and city leaders in nearby Revere and Somerville had called on Beaton to deny the certificate until a long-term plan to address traffic in the heavily traveled Sullivan Square near the proposed casino was in place. \nBoston, Revere and Somerville are suing the state Gaming Commission over its 2014 decision to award Wynn the license, saying the process was severely compromised. Healey is opposed to casinos and lives in Charlestown. \nBut Wynn and state Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack argued the casino company should not be held responsible for traffic problems that stretch back decades. \nBeaton on Friday sided with Wynn and Pollack in that respect. \nHe required that the complex, longer-term traffic issues around Sullivan Square be addressed through a regional working group led by Pollack's agency and involving Wynn, Boston and other area cities and other stakeholders. \nBeaton also lauded Wynn's commitment to invest over $7 million over 15 years into subway operations, a step he said was unprecedented by a private developer in Massachusetts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T07:01:23.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
