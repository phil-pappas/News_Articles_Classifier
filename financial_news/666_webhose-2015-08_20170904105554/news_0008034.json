That was its lowest closing level since Jan. 15, and more than 10 percent below a record high of 7,122.74 points hit in April. \nChina's stock markets were highly volatile on Wednesday despite government efforts to stabilise them, ending higher after the central bank injected more funds into the financial system for the second day in a row. \nFears over the state of China's economy, the world's second-largest, have eclipsed worries about Greece's debt problems, with the devaluation of the yuan on Aug. 11 adding to concerns. \n\"General sentiment is fairly skittish at the moment, and the outlook for China certainly hasn't helped,\" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) . \n\"The FTSE 100 is in negative territory for the year ...and it's quite difficult to see from here what sort of short-term positive impetus the market might take.\" \nLeading the few blue-chip gainers, British insurer Admiral jumped 3.8 percent after posting a forecast-beating 1 percent rise in first-half pre-tax profits. \nPharmaceutical firm Hikma rose 2.5 percent after maintaining guidance for full-year revenue growth. \n(Additional reporting by Liisa Tuhkanen; Editing by Andrew Roche)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:54:17.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
