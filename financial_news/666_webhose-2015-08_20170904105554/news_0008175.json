Violent and sexual programs and ads did not increase advertising effectiveness, in fact they decreased it, it further emphasises. Researchers studied the reactions of 8500 participants in around 50 studies to determine the effect of sex and violence on brand memory, brand attitudes and buying intentions. Sexual content also adversely affected viewers' brand memory while the attitude towards the brand is more negative in ads with violence than those that are neutral. Buying intention also decreased when brands were embedded in programs that contained sex or violence.
