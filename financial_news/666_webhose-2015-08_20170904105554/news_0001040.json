David Mariuz by Matthew Stevens \"We are in a special time,\" chairman Peter Coates told senior Santos staff on Thursday as they worked through preparations to tell the world that chief executive David Knox had been sacked and his company could be fundamentally redesigned.\nIn this case, of course, \"special\" means unique rather than good and \"sacked\" means imminent retirement bought humiliatingly forward so that the Coates can run a \"strategic review\" while finding the right person to put the results of his reassessment in place.\nSantos sits just weeks from first production at the $US18.5 billion ($25.3 billion) liquid natural gas project it has built at the Queensland industrial port of Gladstone. The project, and the broader LNG expansion strategy that orbits around it, has been Knox's capital-gobbling baby for all of the seven years he had run Santos. And Knox had always planned to leave towards the end of next year after the LNG started flowing north to Asia's electricity generators.\nAt this very time last year all was tickety-boo for Knox and Santos with the oil price surfing its Saudi-protected highs and shares in South Australia's gas company changing hands at $15.20. Today the oil price is bumping along at $UDS46 a barrel and you can buy Santos shares at $5.60 a pop.\nExecutive life at Santos was redefined in early October last year when Saudi Arabia announced that it preferred to protect its share of the global oil market rather than defend oil prices. The oil kingdom's ambition was to introduce high cost US shale oil producers to the harsher realities of commodity market economics.\nBut the timing of the Saudi's unexpected but utterly rational change of heart could not have been worse for Santos and the proponents of Gladstone's other two LNG projects. BG Group was in the early stages of ramp-up of its two train project while Origin and Santos were closing on completion of construction with plans for first cargoes through the back end of 2015.\nWhile everyone's production schedules remain largely in place, the halving of the oil price has obliterated the original investment cases for Gladstone's $US70 billion worth of LNG projects. For all that though, their owners have no choice but to switch these machines on. Indeed, as both Knox and Origin's Grant King made all too clear this week, their is every incentive now to push the boundaries of nameplate capacity of their new machines.\nThe proposition there is that every extra shipment above the contracted volumes enhances project economics no matter what the spot price might be. And if that concept sounds familiar, well it should. It is the same story in iron ore, of course. These are bulk commodities businesses that require massive upfront capital investment to produce and each benefits from every incremental tonne of production because it lowers overall cost and reduces pay-back timeframes. So each will risk the potential price impact of over-supplied markets.\n Gladstone's machines would be money spinners at $UDS100 a barrel oil. But at current prices, the best that anyone can hope for is positive cash flow. Knox, for example, told investors on Friday that his project would sustain healthy free cash flow at oil prices of between $US45-$US55 a barrel and at exchange rates of between 72-75 cents.\nBut the fact is that you don't invest $UDS18.5 billion just to generate free cash. The point here is to generate distributions to owners that translates into dividends for shareholders.\nIt remains a fact inescapable that shipping LNG out of Gladstone will not generate an acceptable return on capital deployed without some sort of sustained recovery in oil prices. But it is fact equally inescapable that commodities marketing orthodoxy says that oil prices simply have to recover over the medium term. Demand is rising faster than expected and there is every reason to believe that US output will drift materially over the next 12 months as aging conventional and unconventional wells with declining production are driven permanently from the system.\nIn the interim though there will be carnage and Gladstone's operators simply have to adapt. BG Group, for example, has responded to oil's crisis by selling itself to Royal Dutch Shell for $US70 billion. More recently, Origin Energy eased its own balance sheet pressures by selling its controlling share of New Zealand's Contact Energy for $1.6 billion.\nAnd Santos? Well, until Friday's brutally definitive action, the best it had offered a market excessively concerned about its $8 billion debt load and the withering business case for its LNG project was the emergency cost and productivity drive that was announced in November and that aimed initially to reduce spending by 25 per cent.\nFrom then until Friday morning Knox, with the apparently firm support of his board, determinedly resisted any and all advice that Santos should deal with its debt load through a rights issue.\nAs recently as Monday, in the wake of another share price pounding, Santos said it \"had no current intention to undertake an equity raising\".\nEvidently, as it is in politics, a week is a long time is oil. Because by Friday morning Coates had been confirmed an executive director to enable a full strategic review of Santos that will assess every option to reduce the company's debt load.\n\"From equity raising to assets sales to demerger, everything is on the table,\" Coates told The Australian Financial Review as he worked his way toward explanation of the change of boardroom approach that will see Knox replaced at some point early next year as new blood is invited to steer the strategic course set by the executive chairman's redraft.\nTo be sure, Coates can make a massive and thoroughly belated back-flip look like a beautiful and very simple thing. The Santos share price has fallen to a point where it does not reflect anything like the value of the business. That is the result of carrying too much debt and there being too much doubt that GLNG will drive cash flows enough to generate anything like an adequate return while oil prices sit under $US60 a barrel.\nSo, while Coates remains utterly convinced that the Santos balance sheet is strong enough to ride out the financial complexities of GLNG's transition from construction site to LNG producer, there will be a strategic review that might better be called an asset auction. Because Coates says, no one should be in any doubt that, by the end of a review that will take but months, Santos will emerge with a materially lower debt burden. And, all things being equal, that should rebase GLNG's economics and recover confidence in Santos' share price.\nJust days before Coates' confirmed his strategic review, Woodside's canny, cautious and cashed-up chief executive, Peter Coleman, suggested that another quarter of low oil prices would see some heavily geared oil companies finally get serious about selling some crown jewels.\nColeman recommended too that those first to market with assets priced to reflect current oil prices would weather the storm that could endure for years yet. But those that dither could die, he warned.\nIt is no surprise then that Santos has received approaches from the bargain hunters interested in some of its choicer assets. These will now be followed up and news that Coates will ring-fence nothing from discussions will doubtless see the executive chairman fielding more enquiries yet.\nIt is hard to believe, for example, that Coleman himself hasn't been on the phone to discuss Santos' 10 per cent of the now fully functional PNG-LNG project. Certainly it is the sort of gem that Coleman is talking about. Some have valued the Santos stake at $US4.5 billion based on long-run oil prices of $US80 a barrel. And while oil prices sit no where near that right now, this is an asset that would likely generate a lively, value-protecting auction if it were taken to market.\nMeanwhile Coates rejects any idea that the underlying economics of GLNG were always vulnerable and declines any invitation to review past responses that focus on cash flows rather the debt elephant in the room.\n\"The project is still a good project,\" he insisted. It will be delivered in the next few weeks and I still think we made the right decision. Would we have made that decision if we had a crystal ball that saw the oil price where it is.? No we wouldn't have. But we don't have crystal balls.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:49:17.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
