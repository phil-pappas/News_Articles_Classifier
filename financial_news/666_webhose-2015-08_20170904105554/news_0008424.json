What went wrong?\nFollowing the Great Inflation of the 1970s — notice the penchant for superlatives — central bankers thought they had found the holy grail with inflation targeting. Even for the Federal Reserve, with a dual mandate of stable prices and full employment, price stability was the sine qua non of central banking.\nNot merely as an end in itself but a “means by which it can achieve its other objectives” of maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, said former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in a 2006 speech on “The Benefits of Price Stability.”\nAs it turns out, price stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for financial stability. Back-to-back asset bubbles in the late 1990s (technology stocks) and early to mid-2000s (residential real estate) drove the point home. The burst housing bubble left devastation in its wake, largely due to the excessive leverage that poisoned the financial system. (No, the subprime crisis was not contained.) Central bankers were left to re-think their cherished goal.\nEveryone agrees that monetary policy is a blunt instrument, that a single short-term interest rate is unlikely to achieve the simultaneous goals of low inflation, full employment, moderate long-term interest rates and financial stability. (If it did, no doubt it would be called the “Great Nirvana.”) Something is clearly needed, not to pop asset bubbles but to prevent them from inflating to a point that creates systemic risk.\nFor its part, the Fed has opted for macroprudential regulation, or rules to reduce instability in the financial system: measures such as raising capital adequacy requirements during periods of excess credit growth. I’m a skeptic when it comes to regulating the next financial crisis, namely because it requires regulators to do what they are paid to do. ( See regulatory capture. )\nAre there other means that would contain asset prices within a monetary framework? One of the more persuasive analyses I’ve seen is from David Beckworth, associate professor of economics at Western Kentucky University. In a 2014 paper on “Inflation Targeting” for the Mercatus Center, Beckworth encapsulates his view in the subtitle: “A Monetary Policy Regime Whose Time Has Come and Gone.”\nIt turns out that monetary policy is ill-suited to deal with supply shocks, which cause output and prices to move in opposite directions. A supply shock is an event that increases (or decreases) the output of a good or service, causing its price to fall (or rise.) Technological innovation is an example of a positive supply shock. The OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s was a negative shock.\nIn the mid-1990s, productivity growth emerged from its two-decade slump, averaging 3% from 1995 through 2003. Producing more with less raises real gross domestic product and lowers prices. An inflation-targeting central bank, seeing the rate of inflation decline, would tend to lower interest rates. That’s exactly what the Fed did in 2003 when by all rights faster productivity growth argued for a higher real interest rate.\n“Large and frequent supply shocks can be a real challenge for inflation-targeting central banks,” Beckworth writes.\nWhat’s more, it is hard to determine in real time whether a decline in prices is a result of a positive supply shock or a negative demand shock, with different implications for monetary policy.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Beckworth-Inflation-Targeting.pdf", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20060224a.htm", "http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4yLxXJDweDE"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:06:00.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
