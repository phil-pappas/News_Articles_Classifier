The remaining 200,000 tonnes is imported duty-free from Comesa states by dealers licensed by the sugar directorate. \nUnder the deal struck in Kampala on Sunday, Kenya will reserve a quota of 97,000 tonnes to Ugandan traders every year. UMA claims that Uganda's millers have a capacity of 373,000 tonnes annually against domestic consumption of 70,000 tonnes. \nThe millers are Kakira Sugar Works, Kinyara Sugar Works, Sugar & Allied Industries, Sugar Corporation of Uganda, Sango Bay Estates and Mayuge Sugar Industries. \nKenya's Foreign Affairs ministry officials said licences would only be issued to suppliers who have been in the cross-border business.
