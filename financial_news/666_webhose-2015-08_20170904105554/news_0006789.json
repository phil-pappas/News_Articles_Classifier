Andrew Meares Earlier, counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar accused unions of ''grandstanding''.\nMr Heydon had earlier refused an ACTU request to be given 24 hours to decide on whether it would pursue the application to have him removed over his decision to speak at a Liberal Party event .\nWhen the ACTU refused to make further submissions on Monday, Mr Stoljar said the proceedings were ''degenerating into a shambles''. ''It smacks of grandstanding,'' he said.\nBut the ACTU's barrister, Robert Newlinds, rejected the claims. He said it would be a ''denial of natural justice'' and unfair for him to be forced to make a submission when he had not had adequate time.\n Before Mr Heydon made his orders, ACTU secretary Dave Oliver told the media the union needed more time because new information arose from the documents that were made public on Monday morning.\nHe said the documents, which included email correspondence between Mr Heydon and the event organisers, showed he knew it was a Liberal Party event, was aware he had a conflict of interest when he was invited and was concerned that he had agreed to speak at future Liberal Party events.\n\"We'll need time to consider it. We'll need time to consult,\" Mr Oliver said. \"We have a genuine concern that he appears to be bias and we would expect Commissioner Heydon to give the unions time to consider the evidence and time to determine what our next course of action should be.\"\nLiberal connection 'overlooked' When releasing the correspondence with the organisers of the Sir Garfield Barwick address, Mr Heydon admitted he ''overlooked'' the connection between the organisers of the address and the Liberal Party when he was contacted by the event co-ordinator in March this year.\nBut he denied that he had known it was a Liberal Party fundraiser.\n\"My understanding at all times has been that the dinner was not to be a fundraiser,'' he said\nHe said in March this year: \"I was contacted again by the co-ordinator of the Sir Garfield Barwick address. At the time I was carrying out the duties of an academic post at Oxford Law School. I receive many invitations to speak at public functions.\n\"When I received the contact by email from the co-ordinator I remembered that I had agreed to give the Garfield Barwick address in August 2015.\n\"However, in March 2015, I overlooked the connection between the person or persons organising the event and the Liberal Party which had been stated in the email of 10 April ,2014.\n\"I also overlooked the fact my agreement to speak at that time had been conditional on the work of the commission being completed before that time.''\nJustice Heydon said he had been in talks with the event organisers \"several years ago\" about the possibility of delivering the address at \"some time\".\n'Dinner was not to be a fundraiser' He said he told the organisers he would be able to deliver the speech in August 2015 if the commission had completed its work.\nJustice Heydon said that when he was contacted in April this year over email it did not state that the address was \"in any sense a fundraiser for the Liberal Party\".\nHe said he looked at the event details of when and where it was at but did not open email attachments that detailed the fundraiser as he was \"engaged\" in the commission's hearings.\nJustice Heydon said he was contacted in March this year, by the chairman of one of the lawyer branches of the Liberal Party NSW division.\nHe said the group had some member-only branch meetings but a number of events were open to the \"large non-member database\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:54:00.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
