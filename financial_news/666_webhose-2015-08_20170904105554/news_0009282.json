Remarks by Fed officials that liftoff could come in September were blamed by some for that volatility.\nBut for Agustin Carstens, the top central banker in Mexico, a rate hike by his neighbor sends an encouraging sign of economic health, even if it does force growth-challenged Mexico to also raise rates within days.\n“If the Fed tightens, it will be due to the fact that they have a perception that inflation is drifting up, but more important that unemployment is falling and the economy is recovering,” Carstens told Reuters in an interview.\n“For us, that is very good news,” he added.\nWhile Yao Yudong, head of the People’s Bank of China Research Institute of Finance and Banking, last week blamed the Fed for the market turmoil and said a US hike should be delayed, most central bankers from emerging markets contacted by Reuters at Jackson Hole and over the past month shared Carstens’ view.\nAn end to more than six years of rock bottom US rates will touch off a wave of potentially painful adjustments as countries deal with the likelihood of an even stronger dollar as well as capital outflows from some emerging markets and changes in the relative prices of traded goods. An end to uncertainty for policymakers, however, could outweigh those difficulties.\nEffects of the Fed’s easy money have been felt in countries as diverse as Chile and Switzerland. Annual inflation in Chile has consistently come in above the bank’s target range of 2 per cent to 4 per cent.\nIn Switzerland, the central bank has been forced to keep rates negative since it removed its cap on the franc at 1.20 to the euro, sending the currency soaring and putting a major strain on the export-dependent Swiss economy.\n“Latin America has seen a surge of inflation” as countries “internalize” the evolution of Fed policy, Central Bank of Chile Governor Rodrigo Vergara told the conference.\nTWO YEARS OF PREPARATION\nThose sorts of trends have been under way for some two years, when then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke set off a global “taper tantrum” when he suggested the central bank was preparing to scale back its bond-buying program.\nTwo years after the taper tantrum, Fed officials say some volatility is unavoidable when the shift in policy occurs.\n“For emerging markets, the smaller economies, they’re often looking for a weaker currency. So from their perspective a tightening move by the Fed might be helpful to weaken their currency and help them do what they want to do,” St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said in an interview.\nThere are opponents to a hike – most notably the People’s Bank of China and the International Monetary Fund, which has urged the Fed to delay until the world economy is on a stronger footing.\nBut even frequent Fed critics said at Jackson Hole that the time was coming to hike.\n“It’s a long anticipated event,” Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said on a conference panel, sitting alongside Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer. “It has to happen some time – everybody knows it has to happen – but pick your time.”\nThose comments were supported by central bankers from Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. When asked earlier this month whether he thought the Fed should hike in September, Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor Mirza Adityaswara told Reuters in Jakarta: “The more certainty there is, the better.”\nA senior South Korean policymaker echoed that sentiment.\n“A lift at an already expected timing would be better in a sense that it clears up one of the big uncertainties over the issue and it would mean the US economic recovery is deemed sustainable,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to comment publicly by the Bank of Korea.\n 31, 2015 11:01 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:38:16.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
