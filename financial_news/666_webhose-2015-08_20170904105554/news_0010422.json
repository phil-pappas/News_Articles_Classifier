She says she's \"relatively optimistic\" of finding a solution that satisfies the International Monetary Fund's demand for debt relief.\nGreece is holding elections Sept. 20 after Alexis Tsipras stepped down as prime minister, seeking a stronger mandate to implement austerity measures creditors demanded in return for a new bailout.\nMerkel said in Berlin: \"I assume that Greece will comply with its commitments.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
