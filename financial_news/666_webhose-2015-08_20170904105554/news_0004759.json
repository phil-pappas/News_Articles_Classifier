Federal Reserve officials last month said they were looking for further improvement in the labor market before making such a move.\nThe Fed has signaled that its eventual increases in rates would be gradual. Still, uncertainty remains over how the market will adjust to slightly higher rates, since the central bank’s low-rate policy has helped fuel stocks’ six-year bull market that has lasted since the financial crisis.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the seventh session in a row—its longest losing streak since August 2011—declining 46.37 points, or 0.3%, to 17373.38. That marks the lowest close for the blue chips since early February. The Dow is now down 2.5% for the year.\nInvestors “are definitely going, ‘OK, this is happening,’” said Tom Carter, managing director at brokerage firm JonesTrading. “People are positioning” for a rise in interest rates.\nJuly Jobs Report Hilsenrath: Job Numbers Keep Fed on Track for Rate Move U.S. Creates 215,000 Jobs in July Recap: Analysis of July Jobs Report Report by the Numbers Report in 12 Charts The S&P 500 fell 5.99, or 0.3%, to 2077.57, and the Nasdaq Composite declined 12.90, or 0.3%, to 5043.54. Both remain in positive territory for the year.\nThe energy sector recorded the day’s biggest losses, losing ground as oil prices fell. Energy stocks in the S&P 500 shed 1.9%.\nLight, sweet crude for September delivery closed down 79 cents, or 1.8%, to $43.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since March 17, when prices hit a six-year low of $43.46 a barrel. Oil fell 6.9% for the week.\nThe decline came as oil-field-services firm Baker Hughes on Friday said the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose for a third consecutive week. Oil prices have sold off in recent months amid a global supply glut.\nU.S. employers added 215,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate, in a separate survey, was steady at 5.3%. Both figures were in line with expectations.\nIn the Markets Short-Term Treasury Yields Highest Since 2010 Dollar Gives Back Gains on Profit-Taking Oil Falls on New Drilling Gold Ends Higher European Stocks Lower China Shares Gain Bank Stocks Drag Down Australian Shares Malaysia’s Ringgit Plumbs New Lows The odds of a rate increase—based on trading in federal-fund futures—at the September meeting were 54% Friday, compared with 46% before the jobs report and 48% Thursday, according to traders. Fed-funds futures are used by investors and traders to place bets on central-bank policy.\nDJIA Leaders and Laggards - 1 Day The odds of a rate boost at the December meeting were 77%, compared with 72% before the report and 73% on Thursday.\nDJIA Leaders - 1 Day\nThe July jobs report “without a doubt” shows the further improvement that the Fed was looking for in the labor market, said Jim Dunigan, chief investment officer at PNC Wealth Management, paving the way for a September rate increase.\nBut until the Fed actually makes a move, stocks are likely to remain in a narrow range, Mr. Dunigan said. He added that a rate increase would be positive for stocks, because it would reaffirm economic growth in the U.S. that should lead to higher corporate earnings.\nFriday’s decline closed out a downbeat week for U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 lost 1.2% in the week following a tumble Thursday that battered major media companies. Shares of Viacom lost 19% for the week after a disappointing earnings report Thursday. Walt Disney shares fell 8.9% on the week.\nSPX Laggards - 1 Week\nENLARGE Disney shares fell 8.9% for the week. Here, Mickey and Minnie Mouse in a Tokyo Disneyland parade in June.

Major indexes have had trouble sustaining gains in 2015 in the face of an uneven U.S. economy, financial tumult in Europe, a slowdown in once-booming China and the prospect of rate increases.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.173%, from 2.236% Thursday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.\nStocks fell in Europe. Germany’s DAX lost 0.8%, France’s CAC-40 sank 0.7% and the Stoxx Europe 600 index shed 0.9%.\nIn commodity markets, gold futures added 0.4% to $1,094.10 an ounce.\nWrite to Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AK224_PANMKT_P_20150807184835.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AK224_PANMKT_M_20150807184835.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-17T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:40:38.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
