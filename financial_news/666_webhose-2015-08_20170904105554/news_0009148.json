Metropolitan Museum of Art New York by Holland Cotter\nDespite a career as a society portraitist, John Singer Sargent was, by many accounts, a shy man, given to halting speech or silence except among people he knew well and liked.\nShowing a \"a relaxed recklessness\", \"Dr Pozzi at Home\", 1881, portrays Samuel-Jean Pozzi, glamour-boy gynaecologist to the stars, wrapped in a papal-red robe. Metropolitan Museum of Art He was not ever, though, a shy painter.\nFew artists in any era have had as extroverted a hand as his, and as keen an instinct for visual theatre. And when his sitters were people he cared for, something extra came into the work, a relaxed recklessness of a kind that scintillates and sluices through the 90 paintings and drawings in Sargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends at the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York.\nThe show, which comes from the National Portrait Gallery in London, includes a few of the Beautiful People portraits that kept Sargent supplied in cigars, opera seats and trans-Atlantic homes over a long career.\nHis fantastic portrait of Isabella Stewart Gardner as a pearl-girted bodhisattva is here. So is his likeness of Samuel-Jean Pozzi, glamour-boy gynaecologist to the stars, wrapped in a papal-red robe. And there's the portrait of Madame X, the young Paris socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, whose \"new woman\" image – plunging black dress, lavender-powdered skin and air of aloof disdain – threatened to send Sargent's reputation off the tracks.\n \"The Fountain, Villa Torlonia, Frascati, Italy\", 1907 is typical of Sargent's \"out of the salon, out of the studio, into nature\" period. Metropolitan Museum of Art These paintings are monuments, and were meant to be, as commissioned formal portraits usually are. But many of the pictures in the show – organised by British curator Richard Ormond, and by Elizabeth Kornhauser and Stephanie L Herdrich of the Met – were what might be termed self-commissions: freebies, for giveaway, or exchange, or for Sargent to keep. Some earned him social or professional points, but most reflected his attraction to, or affection for, a sitter.\nThe earliest were done in Europe, where he was born in 1856, the child of American parents who had taken to a life of Continental wandering measured in social seasons.\nNetwork widely, pile on paint They were living in Florence when he arrived, but moved on to Rome, and later to Dresden, then Paris, where he studied art with the painter Charles-Émile-Auguste Durand, known as Carolus-Duran.\n\"Spooky\" portrait of \"Robert Louis Stevenson and His Wife\", 1885, feels relatively modern partly due to its \"odd balances and anxious air\". The Metropolitan Museum of Art Prestige portraitist, bon vivant, and friend of Édouard Manet, Carolus-Duran taught his students to network widely and pile on paint. He made much of Sargent, his finest pupil, and Sargent made much of him in a bravura 1879 portrait, which depicts the master dressed in vie de bohème duds, but with the Légion d'Honneur in his lapel.\nThis portrait was a high-polish job, as were others Sargent did of celebrities he met and admired: August Rodin, Claude Monet, Gabriel Fauré.\nHis likenesses of friends and peers were more experimental. In a mash-up of a double portrait, the young French painter François Flameng, blond moustache like corn silk, stares appraisingly out at us, while his fellow artist Paul Helleu – Sargent lovingly called him Leuleu – appears, illogically large and in profile, behind.\nParticularly captivating is an 1881 picture of Sargent's childhood friend Violet Paget, an Italian Renaissance scholar and writer of paranormal fiction who identified as a lesbian feminist and changed her name to Vernon Lee. Sargent referred to her as his \"illustrious twin\", though she was in some ways his temperamental opposite: outgoing, volatile, politically audacious; a spark. And in his swiftly brushed painting of her wide-eyed face – he doesn't bother to cover the whole canvas – he gets all that.\nThe 1912 piece \"In the Generalife\" shows the human subjects almost literally blending in with the backgound. Metropolitan Museum of Art After Madame X was excoriated by critics at the 1884 Salon, Sargent needed a break from Paris. He headed to rural England and to a different social circle, this one largely American and based in the pristine Cotswold village of Broadway.\nThere, removed from immediate pressures of the market, he tried out new formats and styles. That's what we see him doing, in a Pre-Raphaelite moment, in a study for painting of children and flowers called Carnation, Lily, Lily Rose , and again in a spooky little portrait of the novelist Robert Louis Stevenson.\nScene looks more fiction than fact It's set in the sparsely furnished parlour of Stevenson's Dorset home. Off to the left the writer, who seems to be pacing the floor, looks up as if caught by surprise. Far to the right, his wife, Fanny, dressed in a sari, is snoozing.\nBetween them is a bare wall with a door opening onto darkness. The whole scene looks more fiction than fact. And with its odd balances and anxious air it feels modern in a way that more traditional portraits do not.\nAlong with tranquility, Broadway offered train access to London, which would be Sargent's new home. When he arrived he didn't entirely fit in. He was ahead of the curve. He had already absorbed impressionism and other advanced styles that most British painters were just beginning to consider. But he was nothing if not a diplomat aiming to please and he adjusted his work to its context.\nA commissioned 70th-birthday portrait of Henry James is as sombre and conservative as a business suit. But his take on the irrepressible London salonnière Mary Hunter, a close friend and confidante, is just the opposite. She's a great grinning tropical orchid, a tangle of bright paint knotted together with light.\nSargent became the toast of the town. Then in the late 1880s he undertook a reconnaissance mission to his parents' homeland. Although he spent most of his life abroad, he always thought of himself as American. And judging by what's in the show, he was comfortable working there.\nThe American portraits – of Gardner, of the actor Edwin Booth, of Sargent's Boston hostess, Mary Louisa Boit (she's like a John Singleton Copley matron, in polka dots) – are imaginatively varied, as if he were trying out ideas.\nOne idea he was playing with was the possibility of leaving portraiture behind. And two lucrative, long-term Boston commissions, for mural projects at the Museum of Fine Arts and the public library, helped him do this.\nHuman presence half-visible Ever restless, he returned to Europe and there began his art in a different direction, out of the salon, out of the studio, into nature. This development is documented in the show's last gallery, where the walls are lined with small landscape paintings. The human presence is still there, but half-visible.\nIn a picture called The Master and His Pupils , done during a mountain hike in Austria, Sargent sets a cluster of figures in the deep background and fills the foreground with a tumble of rocks in a dry stream bed. In another picture, Group With Parasols (Siesta) , from around 1904, people are very much present – four of Sargent's young friends napping in an Alpine meadow – but so thoroughly do they blend into the vegetation that you might mistake them for ground cover, mulch.\nSometimes, late, he comes close to portraiture but does something else. In An Artist in His Studio (circa 1904) , he shows a painter sitting in a dishevelled room with a landscape-in-progress propped on his unmade bed. We know who he is: Ambrogio Raffele, an older Italian painter with whom Sargent bonded and travelled and felt deeply comfortable.\nRaffele's back is half to us; we can't see his full face; he could be anyone. Yet the painting – innovative, complex, a miracle of mini-abstractions (that froth of tossed-aside sheets!) – is a tribute to him, and a product of the creative ease that Sargent felt in his company.\nA lot of Sargent's portraiture, though fluent, is hard to warm to, maybe in part because he couldn't pick his subjects. He was the hireling of plutocrats, yesterday's version of our own, who bought his time, his name and his flattering hand to make themselves look fine.\nUnder such conditions, it's no surprise that an artist might fall back on mere brilliance, that a shy man might shut down. But when he did have his choice of sitter, as he did in many of the paintings in this show, fluency can grow into something more: Exuberance and brilliance plus love can equal joy.\nThe New York Times\nDistributed by the New York Times Syndication service.\nSargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends , Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, New York, until October 4. metmuseum.org.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T16:04:12.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
