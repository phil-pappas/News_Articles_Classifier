Oppenheimer seems to think so. \n\"The uptick in volatility has stressed the need to be tactical, in our view, and traders should therefore be eyeing mean-reverting opportunities, like selling the current oversold bounce in the S&P 500,\" an Aug. 31 note to clients said. \"At the stock level, we recommend selling laggard positions on strength and buying leadership on weakness. \" \n\"Our 'Buy on Weakness' list consists of stocks 1) coming off a new high, 2) with a bullish relative trend, that 3) screen positively based on trends in earnings revisions,\" the Oppenheimer note said.

The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nDecline from 52-week High: -9.5% TheStreet Rating: Buy, B TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates ALLERGAN PLC as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate ALLERGAN PLC (AGN) a BUY. This is driven by several positive factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, solid stock price performance, good cash flow from operations, expanding profit margins and largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had sub par growth in net income.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: AGN's very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the industry average of 6.8%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 115.8%. This growth in revenue does not appear to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, displayed by a decline in earnings per share. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, AGN's share price has jumped by 37.86%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Turning to the future, naturally, any stock can fall in a major bear market. However, in almost any other environment, the stock should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed nice gains in the past year. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 157.87% to $1,401.30 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, ALLERGAN PLC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -10.20%. The gross profit margin for ALLERGAN PLC is currently very high, coming in at 73.58%. It has increased significantly from the same period last year. Regardless of the strong results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of -4.22% is in-line with the industry average. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.59, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Although the company had a strong debt-to-equity ratio, its quick ratio of 0.78 is somewhat weak and could be cause for future problems.
