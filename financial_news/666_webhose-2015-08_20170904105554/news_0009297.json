AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe China bashing has exploded in the Republican presidential campaign. Not since Bill Clinton condemned the \"butchers of Beijing\" in the 1992 presidential race – a reference to the Tiananmen Square massacre – has anti-Beijing sentiment been so zealous and deep-seated in American election politics.\nFor an Australia dancing between long-held loyalties to Washington and increasing economic integration with Beijing, the constant pot shots at China cannot be easily ignored.\nLeading conservative candidates Donald Trump, senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker have queued up to blast China over its currency devaluation and the recent global stock market plunge. Walker urged President Barack Obama to cancel President Xi Jinping's state visit to the White House due in September, fuelling tensions before the meeting.\nThese would-be presidents have blamed the Communist Party of China's economic mismanagement for the 10 per cent stock market correction on Wall Street. Never mind the US subprime housing crisis that dragged the world economy to its worst recession in 80 years, or that China's insatiable appetite for commodities saved countries like Australia from recession in 2008.\nPopulism plays well For the uninitiated, this is the midst of US presidential primary season. The more populist and outlandish you are on China, it presumably plays well in voter heartland.\nHalf of Americans have an unfavourable opinion of China and 44 per cent a favourable view, according to the latest Gallup annual World Affairs poll. Forty per cent of Americans regard the economic power of China as a critical threat to the vital interests of the US.\nAustralians tend to take a more glass-half-full view of China, if nothing else because our economic future is so dependent on Asia's largest economy. The Republican bluster makes Labor's foolish equivocating on the Australia-China free trade deal seem almost mild-mannered.\n The feeling among many US conservatives and some Democrats in Washington is that President Obama has been too quick to engage China on issues like climate change, rather than confront its unruly behaviour. Senator Rubio used a speech on Friday to accuse China of rigging global trade via its currency \"manipulation\" and of being a \"rising threat to our economic interests\" and \"a growing danger to our national security\".\n\"We can no longer succumb to the illusion that more dialogue with China's current rulers will narrow the gap in values and interests that separates us,\" Rubio said.\nRubio, an unabashed foreign policy hawk who has regularly accused Obama of being weak on national security, wants to boost defence spending to offset the military rise of China, especially in disputed waters in the South China Sea.\nTrump, fresh from his warning a couple of weeks ago that the 4 per cent yuan devaluation will \"suck the blood out of the United States\" , suggested last week that Obama should serve President Xi a McDonald's Big Mac at the state dinner to dissent over China's currency devaluation.\nWalker, who has been sounding more desperate as his poll numbers sink, ridiculed the Obama-Hillary Clinton pivot to Asia as \"hollow\".\n\"This is the result: the Chinese are aggressively expanding their territory, building islands for military bases in the South China Sea,\" Walker said in a speech on Friday. Walker's \"hollow\" warning is premature, though if the US cannot land the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade and investment pact in the next few months, sadly his rhetoric may then ring true.\nUS business has long complained about China artificially holding down its currency to benefit exporters at the expense of US firms at home and multinationals trying to break into the huge Asia market. But a senior US business representative in Washington privately admits the heated anti-China sentiment on display in the primary race is now becoming worrying and may be counter-productive.\nBrazen cyber espionage US business and government have legitimate grievances to pursue about China's brazen cyber espionage and intellectual property theft. Protectionist measures seeking to restrict Silicon Valley technology giants from supplying Chinese banks are also unwelcome.\nUS officials blame China for hacking into the Office of Personnel Management and stealing records of 22.1 million Americans.\nAnti-Chinese sentiment is nothing new in US presidential campaign politics. Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have all dabbled in it. It plays well with voters. Most candidates quickly tone down their rhetoric if they are elected to the White House and actually have to deal with Beijing.\nThe lead in to the 2016 election could be written off as just another anti-China moment in a populist campaign. Yet given the breadth and depth of the criticism, there is no certainty the sentiment won't carry through to the next administration.\nA foreign policy expert close to the Hillary Clinton campaign notes that she is no shrinking violet on China. When China first declared South China Sea was a core area of Chinese interest about five years ago, Secretary of State Clinton immediately disputed it.\n\"China view her with deep respect and deep anxiety,\" says a senior foreign policy expert who has dealt with Clinton and China.\nSo whoever succeeds Obama as the next commander-in-chief, they will almost certainly take a assertive stand on China.\nAustralia does not have to choose between Washington and Beijing. But a more forceful US posturing to our north will be a more complicated dynamic for Canberra to navigate.\nJohn Kehoe is The Australian Financial Review's US correspondent in Washington.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-08-31T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:03:49.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
