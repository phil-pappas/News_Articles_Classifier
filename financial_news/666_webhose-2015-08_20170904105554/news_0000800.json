Not only was growth lackluster through the second quarter, salaries have largely been flat since the late 1970s, according to data pulled from Pew Research . \nDespite the disappointing trends indicated in the chart below, Goldman Sachs says wages will eventually start to increase.

The rate of wage gains can can be an indicator of underlying economic challenges, including what the Fed terms \"slack,\" or the gap between current performance level and potential. \nA large number of underemployed workers or discouraged workers who have stopped seeking work would indicate a large amount of slack in the economy which could push wages down. As underemployed and discouraged workers don't figure into the headline unemployment number, it's possible for an unemployment rate to make the economy look stronger than it is. \n\"The relationship between wage and price inflation is tenuous at best in the short term,\" Dawsey wrote. \"However, we think that Fed officials view wage growth as a useful cross-check on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market, which is difficult to observe directly. In the past, we demonstrated that focusing on wage growth could help the Fed better meet its objectives in terms of inflation and unemployment over time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:22:24.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
