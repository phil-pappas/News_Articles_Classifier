Bloomberg Share on twitter by Ruth Liew Wealth giant AMP has appointed former National Australia Bank chief financial officer of business and personal banking, Sally Bruce, as the new head of AMP Bank.\nMs Bruce, who will report to AMP group executive advice and banking, Rob Caprioli, will take over from Michael Lawrence, who signalled his departure from the company earlier this year.\nMs Bruce will start on August 31.\n\"AMP Bank is an important part of AMP's overall offer and a key contributor to our customer-focused strategy. Sally's experience and track record in consumer finance will be invaluable in continuing this momentum,\" Mr Caprioli said.\nThe appointment comes a week after AMP unveiled a 12 per cent rise in first-half underlying profit to $570 million.\nAMP Bank delivered $50 million in operating earnings to the overall group, translating to a 19 per cent improvement on 2014. The results followed an increase in residential mortgage lending and improved net interest margin.\nAMP, which suffered two profit downgrades previously due to problems in its life insurance division, posted a 33 per cent rise in statutory net profits to $507 million from $382 million.\nThe company will pay a 14¢ partially franked interim dividend on October 9, an improvement on the 11.9¢ payout in the year-earlier period.\n AMP, which has a market valuation of $17.5 billion, said it had reduced costs and cashflows during the half. The group said it was on track to deliver $200 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2016.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/amp-firsthalf-net-profit-climbs-to-507m-20150819-gj39e4.html", "https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-08-27T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:03:18.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
