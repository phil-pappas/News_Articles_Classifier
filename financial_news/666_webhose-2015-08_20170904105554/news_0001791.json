Separately in Melbourne, a group of architects is developing projects funded by small individual investors.\nEstate Baron is starting with baby steps. The first two projects to be funded by the tech platform are a two-townhouse development in Melbourne's Caulfield and a nine-studio-apartment building in Frankston, south east of the city.\nIt wasn't even trying to raise the full cost. The Caulfield development has a $2.4 million price tag, but they only sought to raise $1m, with Equity Baron's investors providing the balance, co-founder Moresh Kokane told The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.\n\"We could have raised $2.4 million but we weren't sure what sort of response we would get,\" Mr Kokane said. \"That project was filled up within three days.\"\nIt took longer to raise the $500,000 – half of the total needed – for the Frankston project, in part because would-be investors were cautious about putting money into the area, he said.\nRougher neighbourhood \"People are still emotionally involved,\" he said. \"Frankston is a rougher neighbourhood.\"\nThe two projects are structured in different ways. Caulfield drew in 35 investors and offers them a guaranteed 10 per cent return. Construction by Victorian builder Watersun is due to start in September.\nThe $500,000 raised for the Frankston project by 22 investors is matched by a further $500,000 in debt guaranteed by Ricard Securities principal Michael Van Cuylenburg.\nMr van Cuylenburg is trustee of funds in the managed investment scheme investors have bought into. He is overseeing the project and financial governance.\nEstate Baron now hopes to get the licences that will allow it to draw more investors and expand the size of its projects.\n\"By the end of the year we are looking at a major tower,\" Mr Kokane said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-08-12T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:10:27.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
