But the inference to be drawn from two ministerial initiatives at the start of this week suggests the nightly scenes have triggered something closer to official panic.\nMinisters are suddenly falling over themselves to be seen making life harder for migrants of all kinds, not just those besieging the Channel ports. On Sunday a Home Office minister said he was looking at removing financial support from more than 10,000 failed asylum seekers in family groups. On Monday ministers gave details of how they also intend to force landlords to evict immigrants who are in the UK illegally. Both measures are dubious in principle and unworkable in practice. They confirm that the Cameron government is anything but confident about its ability to keep political control of the issue, especially as the EU referendum begins to loom.\nThe moves against landlords are obviously a hasty headline response to the scenes from Calais. For one thing, the powers the government is seeking are not new. The idea that landlords should be obliged not to rent to tenants without the correct immigration status was first mooted in 2013 . The Liberal Democrats managed to blunt the proposal back then, so the policy has been piloted in five West Midlands areas for the past year. Landlords there are required to conduct checks to establish that new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face a penalty of up to £3,000.\nYet now, in a textbook piece of bad ministerial practice, the communities secretary, Greg Clark , has simply swept the pilot aside because it suits him at a politically awkward time. Mr Clark will now make the scheme compulsory – including it in the latest immigration bill, with criminal penalties attached – even while the pilot is going on and before it has been evaluated. Ministers had originally set up evaluation machinery that gave a proper role to other stakeholders to help draw up a reasoned joint verdict. A phased rollout was anticipated even if the considered verdict had been to go ahead. Now that has all been junked in the cause of saving face over Calais.\nThe difficulties of making the scheme work are too great to just ignore. The core issues are whether landlords have enough knowledge of the necessary papers and visas, which is doubtful in the view of landlords’ bodies , and whether that system will encourage racial profiling that discriminates against ethnic minority tenants irrespective of nationality, which the landlords fear. Beyond that, there is the question of what happens to those who are evicted, since eviction places a responsibility on local authorities, upheld by the courts, to provide appropriate national assistance support. That obligation seems diametrically at odds with the new plans.\nThe reason for that is not hard to find. Ministers feel pressure to make gestures to the press and the public to show they have migration under control. Mr Clark has fast-tracked the housing plan because there are riots at Calais, not because it is a good plan. In fact, the West Midlands pilot has underlined many of the problems that need to be properly assessed and judged before such a scheme is launched. But considerations of that kind come second when ministers fear they are losing their grip across the Channel.", "external_links": ["http://news.rla.org.uk/news-rla-org-ukgovernment-up-gration-checks/", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/immigration-bill-part-3-access-to-services"], "published": "2015-08-04T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T21:47:30.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
