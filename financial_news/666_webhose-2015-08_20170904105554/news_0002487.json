[ID;nL5N10O0QV] \nAmong other individual gainers, chipmaker Arm Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) edged slightly higher. \n\"ARM's equity story will continue to be one based on strong top-line growth contributing to sector-leading earnings and cash flow growth,\" Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) wrote in a note. \n\"We see both near- and long-term prospects being as strong as ever, although recent concerns around end market growth have caused a material underperformance for ARM shares.\" \nThe FTSE 100 rose to a record 7,122.74 points in late April but has since given up most of the gains it made in 2015.
