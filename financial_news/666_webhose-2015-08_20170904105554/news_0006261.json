The results were published by Staffing Industry Analysts (SIA) in their \"2015 VMS & MSP Competitive Landscape,\" an annual survey that tracks the evolution of contingent workforce management and identifies suppliers' strengths and weaknesses relative to their peers to help VMS program owners and stakeholders evaluate providers. \nSIA reported that Beeline's spend under management has grown 39% since the previous survey in 2014. While SIA's VMS survey respondents reported an average growth rate of 22%, SIA estimated the VMS market's actual overall growth rate in 2015 at between 10 and 15%, reasoning that the US market's maturing has led to a number of former participants no longer responding to their survey. \nBased on data from current and previous years, SIA estimated that Beeline currently leads all VMS providers in spend under management outside the US and has moved into second place, from third in 2014, in US market share. \n\"We are pleased that SIA has noted our remarkable growth in the US and global market,\" said Ron Litton, Beeline's senior vice president of sales. \"But growth isn't so much a result of our accomplishments as it is organizations recognizing what they can accomplish using our solutions. Our success is really just the result of achieving successful outcomes for a growing number of clients.\" \nAbout SIA Staffing Industry Analysts is the global advisor on contingent work.
