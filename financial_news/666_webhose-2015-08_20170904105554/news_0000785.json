The construction of the new lane began a year ago, on the orders of Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. \nThe original canal, opened in 1869, currently handles seven per cent of global sea-borne trade. \nThe waterway connects the Mediterranean to the Red Sea, providing the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. \nIts nationalisation led to a brief war in 1956, pitting Egypt against the United Kingdom, France and Israel. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:05:38.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
