Although many of us leave the workplace in good health, as we are living longer with the average retirement now 17 years long, the likelihood of us needing residential or domiciliary care is increasing. In addition, we are also seeing a rise in the length of time being spent in care. This highlights a very real need for many to consider a more flexible retirement income solution such as a fixed term annuity. \n“Low interest rates, coupled with social care budgets being cut, create a worrying financial backdrop for many, especially those already in retirement as they are currently faced with an open ended bill which makes it difficult to plan effectively to fund these costs. We would encourage those individuals in and approaching retirement, to seek financial advice as to how they can make the most of their pension pots and potentially meet these costs.” \nThe Government has promised to cap fees at £72,000 from 2020, as part of efforts to reduce the number of pensioners forced to sell their homes to pay for care. \nBut the cap will only covers their care costs, while the fees individuals pay to care homes include money for their bed and board. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) when the £72,000 cap is reached, residents of care homes will still have to pay up to £12,000 a year for “bed and board”. \nThe Department of Health has previously said that other changes to the system will mean that more people receive financial assistance, whether or not they reach the £72,000 cap. \nCurrently, those with assets of more than £23,250 get no help from the state towards fees. Changes to rules on means-testing under the new system will mean that anyone with assets of up to £118,000 will get some financial help towards their care, before they reach they cap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T05:23:48.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
