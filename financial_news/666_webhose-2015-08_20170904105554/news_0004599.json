WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — One day, a Federal Reserve official says a September rate hike is all but in the books. The next day, another official says not so fast.\nWho to believe? Rob Martin of Barclays Capital says the market should put more attention to the comments on CNBC from Fed. Gov. Jerome Powell.\nPowell said it would be appropriate to wait and see data before the central bank decides to whether to make the first rate hike since the financial crisis. That contrasts with the comments made in an interview with The Wall Street Journal by Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart that it would take a signification deterioration for him not to favor a hike in September. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also said this week he favors a September rate hike.\n“Officially, Governor Powell was speaking for himself and giving his own views. Nonetheless, we view this interview as a purposeful response to the interviews given by Regional Federal Reserve Presidents Bullard and Lockhart,” Martin said in a note to clients.\n“That Powell is a member of the Board combined with his unusual appearance on television in a live interview format indicates that the Chair likely wants to maintain control of the messaging approaching the September meeting. She likely wants neither the committee nor markets to become too certain in either direction over a September rate hike.”\nYellen wants markets to be pricing in roughly a 50% chance of a September hike, he said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T23:16:29.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
