We believe continued efforts to settle legacy legal issues will make the journey smooth for banks in the long run.As organic growth has remained muted for long, banks are making efforts to ramp up profitability through acquisitions and expansion into lucrative areas like auto and healthcare lending. Also, in order to curb costs, banks are increasingly spending on technological development so as to substitute labor and manage higher volumes.However, in order to avoid a considerable expansion in their cost base, global banks have started collaborating. These efforts are likely to improve efficiency amid rising operational and compliance expenses.While these initiatives should have cheered investors, the banking stocks witnessed a downtrend. The primary reasons behind this were global issues including sluggish Chinese economy, continued weakness in Europe and Brazil, and fall in oil prices. These issues more than offset the positive economic indicators in the domestic market.Taking into account the abovementioned negatives, analysts now see a dim possibility of rate hike by the Federal Reserve in the next few weeks.(Read the last Bank Stock Roundup for Aug 14, 2015) Recap of the Week’s Most Important Developments: 1. BB&T Corporation BBT is on an acquisition drive. By announcing its third transaction within a year, the company has shown that its appetite for inorganic growth is still strong.BB&T signed a definitive agreement to acquire Allentown, PA-based National Penn Bancshares, Inc. in a stock-and-cash deal worth $1.8 billion. National Penn, with $9.6 billion in assets and $6.7 billion in deposits, has 124 banking offices in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland (read more: BB&T on Buying Spree: National Penn Next).2. The booming automobile industry has attracted attention from Wall Street biggie Wells Fargo & Company WFC, which is reportedly opening new branches for offering auto dealer financing as well as car loans, according to a Reuters report. However, the company seeks to expand its auto lending portfolio without compromising on credit quality.Per the report, Wells Fargo recently opened a new branch in Cherry Hill, NJ, dedicated to auto financing. This takes the total number of such branches to 56. Moreover, the bank is set to open more branches, including one in the Southwest region by the end of 2015.

Apart for news related to divestiture of non-core operations, Citigroup was in headlines for legal issues and probes pertaining to business misconducts. The first news concerned the U.S. Justice Department’s (“DOJ”) probe into the company’s dealings with firms related to Mexican billionaire Carlos Hank Rhon. First reported by Bloomberg, the news also stated that the DOJ’s probe comes as part of an expanding investigation into the bank’s money-laundering controls.The second news pertained to Citigroup’s agreement to settle charges for defrauding fund investors in two hedge funds – the ASTA/MAT fund and the Falcon fund – by paying $180 million. According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), investors accused the bank of issuing misleading statements with misrepresented documents that concealedthe risks associated with these hedge funds.The third and final news about Citigroup in the last five days again pertained to a settlement with the SEC. The company’s unit, Citigroup Global Markets, agreed to pay $15 million as penalty to settle allegations of compliance and surveillance failures in executing securities transactions during 2002–2012.
