In many cases they are likely to see a year of seismic surveying and analysis before any applications are made for drilling or fracking. \n• Fracking in the UK: could it happen near you? \n• One third of UK 'suitable for a nuclear burial site' \n• Britain's shale fracking revolution comes with big risks \nIndustry experts pointed to just two unfamiliar names on the list of companies who had been awarded access rights: Osprey and ADM. \nOil majors such as BP and Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) have previously indicated they have little interest in UK shale and the announcement appeared to confirm that. \nHowever, a further 132 licence areas are still subject to environmental consultation and could yet reveal new entrants when they are announced later this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T13:37:55.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
