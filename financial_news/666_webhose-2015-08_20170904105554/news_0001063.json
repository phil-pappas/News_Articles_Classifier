We must first understand where railway was and in that context we must compare today’s railway with any other railway,” Prabhu said earlier at a Bharat Chamber of Commerce session.\nEmphasising that the government needs time to make up for the past, he said, “We are starting to run from zero point and still want to win the race” adding that in the next five years the government was investing 120 billion USD in the railways.\n“Many of the problems that we face today is because of the lack of investment in the past and also because modernisation has not been initiated in the railways,” Prabhu said.\nHe said that Indian Railway is always compared with that of China but to reach that stage India must make investments.\nPrabhu during the day also inaugurated a mobile-based application system introduced by Eastern Railway, R-Mitra, to ensure women’s safety and said that it is an “extremely useful app” that could be used by regional railways nation-wide. “Around 2.7 crore to 3 crore people travel in the Indian Railways system on a day-to-day basis. Different types of crimes are committed by anti-social elements,” Prabhu said at the Eastern Railway headquarter here.\n“It is a big challenge to deal with crime in railway properties,” he said adding tracking and preventing crime was very important.\nPrabhu said that lack of capacity in trains was visible during festivals like Durga Puja or Chatt when the demands increase.\nThe minister said that the Railways was working on a new coach design and noted that cleanliness has increased significantly.\n“But I am not happy, there is a long way to go,” he said.\n“However, in short time we have shown some results,” he said adding “we have a different vision.”\nThe minister said that 17 states have signed agreements with Railways for joint venture projects.\n“I hope West Bengal will also join after considering the benefits,” Prabhu said.\nDuring the programme at the Bharat Chamber of Commerce, the minister said that the railway was not getting enough cargo, though it has a capacity to handle 1.2 billion tonnes annually.\n“We are very geared up to handle cargo of up to 1.20 billion tonnes this year. We are ready. We told the CM ( Mamata Banerjee ) also that we can handle more coal but we are not getting enough cargo,” Prabhu said at a Bharat Chamber of Commerce session.\nPrabhu described Railways as the most eco-friendly form of transport which is a key component of the ‘ Make In India ’ programme.\n 21, 2015 8:16 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:26:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
