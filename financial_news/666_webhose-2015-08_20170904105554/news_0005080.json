Photo: Andrew Meares\nJust because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean you're not being followed. That's the way industry superannuation funds seem to be feeling about the government's attack on their governance.\nAt first glance, the government campaign to demand one-third of industry fund boards be independent of unions and employers seems reasonable enough – a bit of standard good governance.\nAnd if that was all that Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg was proposing, there's a reasonable chance it would sail through with only a modicum of resistance.\nIllustration: John Spooner.\nBut the industry funds fear the Liberal Party has an agenda that goes well beyond the headline governance issue. The fears – up to and including a longer-term goal of demutualising the industry players – are not without basis, as the fine print of Frydenberg's proposals do indeed go further.\nWhat's more, they don't deal with a more obvious area of possible concern – the scale of some small funds.\nThere's paranoia on both sides of the fight, as well as massive vested interests in carving up the management of trillions of dollars in superannuation. Yes, the residents of the big end of town are very active lobbyists on this front, with perceptions not helped by having one of their own appointed as Frydenberg's chief of staff.\nThere are those in the Liberal Party who believe at least some industry funds are funding the Labor Party. Thus, in the total war of Australian federal politics, there's \"nobble the industry funds, nobble Labor\" thinking.\nOn the other side, there are industry fund types who believe the hand of their for-profit rivals can be perceived, looking for any means of stifling the success of the mutual union/employer models that routinely outperform the bank-dominated for-profit outfits.\nAnd just as industry funds are accused of funding Labor, the perception is that the big end funds the Liberals.\nThere's also the possibility that it's just the Law of Unintended Consequences at work.\nThe industry funds' defence starts with the question: why us?\nIf they were under-performing instead of outperforming, it would make more sense. It's the banks that have been suffering the financial planning and governance scandals, not the industry funds.\n(If the government was really interested in tackling serious structural corruption, it would be moving to unwind the vertical integration of the for-profit funds' management industry – but there's zero chance of that.)\nFurthermore, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority already has pretty much all the power you can imagine to intervene if it thinks a board is not performing or, for that matter, if any director is not fit and proper.\nThe second line of defence is that the industry funds' diverse boards simply work and that there is no evidence independent directors – who would tend to be finance industry insiders – improve performance.\nThen, in the fine print of the proposed reform, governance of the for-profit funds is actually downgraded. The for-profits' club, the Financial Services Council, presently requires members to have a majority of \"independent\" directors. The proposed changes would reduce that to the same third.\nSome industry funds already have independent directors and chairs, but increasing the number would mean greater demand for appropriate non-executive directors, with market forces likely to have the obvious result of making boards more expensive.\nFor every Kathy Jackson, there are plenty of employer and union-appointed directors who don't pocket their relatively modest fees.\nMore contentiously, there's the suggestion of removing the equal representation requirement, of matching union and employer representatives, and of scrapping the requirement for board decisions to be carried by a two-thirds majority vote.\nThe industry funds' club, Industry Super Australia, argues that the two-thirds voting requirement underpins the successful equal representation model, ensuring consensus in the best interests of members.\n\"When paired with the one-third independent requirement, this measure could have profound implications on decision-making dynamics in the best performing funds,\" ISA says.\nWhat's more, the tone of the proposed reform doesn't stop at one-third independents. It also introduces a public \"if not, why not\" disclosure requirement if the majority of the board is not \"independent\".\nAnd ISA reckons the breadth of APRA's definition of \"independent\" could have the perverse effect of narrowing the pool of potential directors for not-for-profit funds.\nAs for what the Frydenberg proposals don't do, it's tightening up on the for-profits, where the scandals have been.\n\"Independent\" directors are allowed to serve on multiple boards in one banking group. Parent banks have a right to veto the appointment of directors to bank super funds. \"Independent\" super fund directors may be remunerated by the parent bank.\nAt the paranoid end of the fight, there's the scenario of a finance-industry-minded independent chairman and directors down the track getting up a simple majority of board votes to pursue demutualisation, with all the windfall profits that entails for those holding the baby at the time, not to mention management and board remuneration soaring.\nMichael Pascoe is a BusinessDay contributing editor", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/politics/frydenberg-rejects-dastyaris-conflict-of-interest-claim-20150113-12njks"], "published": "2015-08-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:50:58.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
