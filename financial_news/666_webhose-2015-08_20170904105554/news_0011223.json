The Fund is offering units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Closing is scheduled to occur on or about September 24, 2015. \nThe initial distribution target for the Fund is $0.05 per unit per month representing an initial yield on the unit subscription price of 6.0% per annum. \nThe Fund has been created to provide investors with exposure to an equal-weight portfolio of equity securities of large capitalization global healthcare companies. To be considered for inclusion in the portfolio, at the time of investment and at the time of each periodic reconstitution and rebalancing, each healthcare company comprising the portfolio must (i) have a market capitalization of at least U.S.$5 billion, and (ii) have options in respect of their equity securities listed on a recognized options exchange. After applying the above mentioned criteria, the Manager will select global healthcare companies which represent attractive investment opportunities for the portfolio, giving consideration to the following metrics (among others, as applicable): (i) valuation; (ii) growth prospects; (iii) profitability; (iv) liquidity; (v) balance sheet strength; and (vi) dividend yield. \nThe Manager expects that between 20 and 30, but no less than 20, healthcare companies will comprise the portfolio. The initial indicative portfolio includes Abbott Laboratories, AbbVie Inc., Allergan plc, Amgen Inc., Anthem Inc., Bayer AG, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Cardinal Health Inc., Celgene Corporation, Gilead Sciences Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Johnson & Johnson, McKesson Corporation, Merck & Co., Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Quest Diagnostics Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi S.A., United Therapeutics Corporation, and UnitedHealth Group Inc. \nThe portfolio will be rebalanced and reconstituted at least semi-annually. The Manager will write covered call options from time to time on up to, but not more than, 33% of the portfolio, in order to seek to earn attractive income from call option premiums and lower the overall volatility of returns associated with owning a portfolio of equity securities. The Manager will seek to hedge substantially all of the portfolio's foreign currency exposure back to the Canadian dollar. \nThe syndicate of agents is being led by RBC Capital Markets, CIBC and Scotiabank and includes BMO Capital Markets, National Bank Financial Inc., TD Securities Inc., GMP Securities L.P., Raymond James Ltd., Canaccord Genuity Corp., Desjardins Securities Inc., Dundee Securities Ltd., Haywood Securities Inc., Industrial Alliance Securities Inc. and Mackie Research Capital Corporation. \nAbout Brompton Funds \nBrompton Funds is a member of the Brompton Group, a provider of investment management and portfolio advisory services to TSX-listed investment funds since 2002 with total assets under management of approximately $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2015.
