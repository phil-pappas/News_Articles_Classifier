China's overseas shipments of semi-finished aluminium rose 30 percent in the first half.\nAluminium giants Alcoa Inc and Rusal say China's exports have been a factor behind plunging primary prices this year. Benchmark aluminium prices hit six-year lows on Monday.\nU.S.-based industry body, the Aluminum Extruders Council, called on the governments of China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Mexico, and the United States to investigate the claims in the Dupre report.\n\"If these allegations are found to be true, these governments must take all necessary steps to end these schemes,\" the council said.\nDupre did not respond to a request for comment. The company's website appeared to have been set up this year, while an analysis of the IP address suggested the company was based in the United States.\nZhongwang, which listed in Hong Kong in 2009, faced allegations that year from local media that some customers referred to in its prospectus had not bought from the company in the previous year.\nIt later asked an international accounting firm to conduct an independent review of its sales transactions during January 2008 through June 2009 period. The company later said it had concluded there were no deficiencies in its sales transactions.\nThe firm was one of a number of companies named in a U.S. investigation into dumping of Chinese extruded aluminium products in a Departement of International Trade Administration report in 2011.\n($1 = 7.7517 Hong Kong dollars) (Reporting by Melanie Burton and Polly Yam in Hong Kong; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:43:15.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
