City Trader Guilty Of Fixing Libor Rate By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 7 minutes ago View Photo \n\nA city trader has been found guilty of fixing the rate of interest at which banks lend to each other - the so-called Libor rate. \nTom Hayes had been accused of eight counts of conspiracy to defraud between 2006 and 2010 for setting the rate on which trillions of dollars of financial deals are based. \nThe Briton worked in Japan for a Swiss and an American bank (Other OTC: ABKH - news ) where he was accused of manipulating the British financial markets. \nThe Serious Fraud Office said that Hayes bribed traders across 10 lenders into fixing the Libor rate so he could make a profit in a bid to boost his own salary and bonus of up to seven figures. \nAfter a nine-week trial at London's Southwark Crown Court, his conviction means he is the first person to be convicted by a British jury of rigging Libor rates. \nThe 35-year-old former banker with UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) was found guilty of all eight charges. \nHayes, of Fleet, Hampshire, stared straight ahead emotionless as the verdicts were read out. \nHis wife, who has accompanied him to court on several occasions, and his parents sat with their heads bowed while verdicts were delivered. \nThe judge Mr Justice Cooke described Hayes as \"by nature a gambler\" who was driven by a thirst for money. \nProsecuting QC Mukul Chawla said Hayes built up a network of contacts in a bid to find bankers who could help him manipulate the Libor rate to his advantage. \nHe would \"cajole\", \"beg\" and \"bribe\" brokers through \"corrupt\", the jury was told. \nMr Chawla said: \"On an almost daily basis he set out to dishonestly manipulate or rig Libor at his bank and other banks.\" \nHayes, described as \"extremely intelligent\", was paid £1.3m before tax in salary and bonuses by UBS between September 2006 to December 2009. \nBefore joining UBS in 2006, he worked for Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Royal Bank of Canada (Other OTC: RBCDF - news ) . \nIn 2009, he joined Citi after feeling \"that UBS were not paying him enough\", and went on to receive £3.5m before tax for just nine months' work. \nHe made money for his paymasters by betting against the future value of the Libor rate offered by banks lending Japanese yen but was sacked after his methods were formally reported to senior management. \nHis arrested took place in the UK in December 2012 after his return from Tokyo. \nHayes admitted what he did but claimed it was not dishonest as his bosses knew what he was doing. \nHe is to be sentenced shortly. The US is also seeking his extradition for offences connected to the American financial (NYSE: AFA - news ) system. \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:37:17.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
