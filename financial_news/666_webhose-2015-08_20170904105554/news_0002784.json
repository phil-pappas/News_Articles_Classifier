Fairfax. by Simon Evans and Amanda Saunders BHP Billiton is running its third and deepest round of job cuts in eight months at its massive South Australia copper mine Olympic Dam, with another 380 positions to go as the metal's prices languish near six-year lows and the miner continues its productivity and cost-cutting drive.\nThe latest round of cuts come on top of 140 redundancies at the BHP corporate office in Adelaide in June, and 220 roles scrapped in January this year, including contractors and Olympic Dam staff. It is understood this will be the last big round of job cuts at Olympic Dam at least for this year.\nIt comes six weeks after BHP flagged impairments and non-cash charges totalling $US350 million to $US650 million, mainly on its copper business. It included a charge of up to $US200 million for redundancies, mainly at its giant Escondida project in Chile.\nThe latest round of redundancies at Olympic Dam, set to take effect by mid-September, were not included in that redundancy charge. Almost all the positions to go in this round are on-site operator positions, with some managerial and supervisor positions also cut. The redundancies will reduce the Olympic Dam workforce to about 3500, including contractors, from 4000 in January.\nThe job cuts are part of BHP's doubling down on cost cutting as it tries to guard its margins from a collapse in the prices of its key commodities.\nLast month, the miner flagged that iron ore is the only one of its four key \"pillars\", which also include copper, petroleum and metallurgical coal, set to grow this year.\nCopper production will fall 12 per cent in the current year but that would be a one-off for the division, caused mainly by lower grades of ore. The copper business is expected to return to growth in financial 2017.\nThe job cuts at Olympic Dam, 560 kilometres north of Adelaide, comes in stark contrast to the optimism around the project as a potential engine room of the South Australian economy up until mid-2012. But in August 2012, BHP announced plans to shelve a $30 billion expansion of the mine.\n BHP is looking at a much cheaper way to expand the mine, testing a new technology called \"heap leaching\" to try to extract Olympic Dam's wealth. But the miner has not put a timeframe on the testing, or when it could make an investment decision.\nThe new chemical processing technique for extracting copper must run at least another two years before the company can decide on the viability of expanding the mega-mine.\nBHP Olympic Dam asset president Jacqui McGill said on Sunday the job losses were not a reflection of the government \"policy settings\" in South Australia, but a response to lower prices in a tough operating environment.\n\"Instead, it is driven by the global challenges in the resources sector, and the need to transform Olympic Dam into a sustainable operation that can contribute to the South Australian economy for many years to come,\" she said.\nThe job losses are a further blow for the South Australian economy at a time when the state has the highest unemployment rate in the nation. The cuts come as private-equity-owned power company Alinta prepares to shut down two power stations near Port Augusta in the state's mid-north and close the nearby Leigh Creek coal mine. The Alinta job losses amount to 440.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:04:17.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
