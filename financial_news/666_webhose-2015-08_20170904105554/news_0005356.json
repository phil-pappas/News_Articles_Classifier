Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nShares in Slater and Gordon have slumped by nearly 20 per cent in early trade amid more worries about its UK business.\nThe law firm on Thursday tried to reassure investors that it won't face future liabilities in relation to a business it bought from UK insurance firm Quindell, which is now being investigated for fraud.\nBut Slater and Gordon's shares plunged by 18.9 per cent to $2.65 at the open of trade.\nThe stock was down 34 cents, or 10 per cent, at $2.93 in midmorning trade.\nThe law firm has defended the due diligence it did on Quindell, an insurance claims processor, before splashing out $1.2 billion buying its professional services arm in March.\nBritain's Serious Fraud Office and Financial Reporting Council has launched investigations into Quindell, just weeks after the Financial Conduct Authority launched a probe.\nQuindell, meanwhile, stunned investors by reporting a full year loss of Â£375 million ($795.42 million) and released details about major revisions it had made to its previous financial results.\nBut Slater and Gordon insists that it won't find itself in hot water as a result of buying Quindell's professional services division (PSD).\n\"Given the acquisition was structured as an acquisition of the [division's] entities rather than an acquisition of the common stock of Quindell, Slater and Gordon is confident that it has no liability in relation to those ongoing investigations into Quindell by various authorities,\" it said.\nQuindell revised its accounts after PwC found that some of the firm's accounting policies were \"aggressive\" while others were \"not appropriate\".\nSlater and Gordon said some of the changes made by Quindell included significant revenue and expense adjustments, mainly linked to legal cases around noise-induced hearing loss that were lost.\nBut Slater and Gordon said it was critical to separate issues associated with Quindell's historical statutory accounts from the law firm's assessment of the professional services division's value and likely future performance.\nIt said it didn't rely on Quindell's accounting policies when it examined the division's books with the help of accountancy firm Ernst & Young.\n\"The publication of these statutory accounts does not alter Slater and Gordon's view of the [division], nor the economic benefits Slater and Gordon expects the business to generate,\" it said.\nSlater and Gordon's acquisition was designed to turn the Australian law firm in the UK's top personal injury lawyer.\naap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T22:20:13.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
