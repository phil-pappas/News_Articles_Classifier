Boston Consulting Group (BCG) forecasts private wealth in the Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, will grow on average by 9.7 percent a year through to 2019, more than double the rate in Western Europe. \nAccording to the latest Asia Pacific Wealth Report published in October by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management, the region's population of high net worth individuals -- defined as those with investable assets of $1 million or more, excluding primary residence, collectibles, consumables, and consumer durables -- grew 17 percent to 4.3 million in 2013, while their wealth grew 18 percent to $14.2 trillion. \nThat compared with growth rates of 13 percent and 12 percent respectively in the rest of the world. \nBut turning Asian riches into profitable business is no easy task for wealth managers. \nAsia's growing ranks of self-made millionaires and billionaires are proving more active in managing their wealth than Europeans living off inheritances, regularly playing banks against each other to get the best deal. \n\"It's their own money, not the money of the father or grandfather,\" noted ZKB's Brun. \nAsia's super-rich also tend to spread their money out over six banks or so. \n\"Asia is a highly banked market,\" said Claude Haberer, head of Swiss bank Pictet's wealth management business in Asia. \"Asians are willing to try out a bank but you have to explain what you bring to the table.\" \nAnd wealth managers are increasingly having to offer inflated pay packets to poach bankers in a region where demand for talent exceeds supply. \n\"Those who make it in the Asian market are those who are willing to invest significantly,\" Haberer said. \"There is definitely an issue of minimum size, below which you just cannot pay the entry ticket.\" \nPrivate banks in the Asia Pacific typically need assets under management of more than $20 billion to be profitable, according to consultancy EY. \nTo bulk up quickly, banks could look to acquisitions. \nIn recent years, Julius Baer has bought Merrill Lynch's wealth management business outside of the United States, while Union Bancaire Privee has snapped up Coutts International. Both purchases helped the banks beef up their presence in Asia. \n\nCOURTING CLIENTS \nLeading the pack in size at the moment is UBS, the biggest wealth manager by assets globally and in the Asia Pacific, which BCG estimates will overtake North America in 2016 as the world's wealthiest region. \nIn 2014, UBS managed $272 billion in the Asia Pacific region, according to a study from magazine Asian Private Banker. Citi's (C.N) private bank and Credit Suisse rounded out the top three with assets of $255 billion and $154 billion respectively. \nBut competition is heating up, with Credit Suisse's Asia Pacific CEO Helman Sitohang saying the bank was targeting the region's growing population of entrepreneurs. \nJudging by its giant Hong Kong banner, unveiled earlier this year as part of the bank's largest outdoor advertisement in the world, UBS is determined to defend its lead. \nEdmund Koh, the head of UBS's wealth management business in southeast Asia and Asia Pacific hub, said Credit Suisse faced a challenge to catch up. \n\"They say Asia is an important market going forward,\" he said. \"For us, it has and will always be an important market.\" \nKoh hopes the Asia Pacific will contribute at least one third of UBS's private bank profits by 2017, compared with just under 30 percent now. \nWith almost 1,200 relationship managers, according to Asian Private Banker, UBS has more than twice as many bankers in Asia than any other wealth manger. \nCredit Suisse's Sitohang told Reuters the bank would consider raising headcount in the region, though retaining bankers can be just as important as hiring new ones. \nIn the past, poaching advisers in the hope clients would move with them has been one way for banks to grow in Asia. This is less the case after the financial crisis spooked investors from moving their money around too much, according to Andrew Hendry, asset manager M&G Investments's Asia managing director. \n\"One CEO of a private bank said in his experience of losing bankers, only about 30 percent of clients go with them,\" he said. \"Pre-2008, you're looking at anything around 70-80 percent.\" \n(Additional reporting by Sinead Cruise in London; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:25:45.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
