We haven’t seen this type of action in a while, but it will mean little if there isn’t any follow-through to the upside. Given that the other indicators were generally more bullish the last time that SPX tried to break out on the upside, it doesn’t seem like there will be much success for an upside breakout this time either. \nThe chart of the SPX remains neutral, in that the SPX remains in the 2040-2135 trading range that has been in force since February. Over the past two weeks, downward probes had been halted in the 2065 area — making that support. \nHowever, today’s early selling ran right through that support, eventually bottoming near 2050. So that is near-term support now. In fact the entire 2040-2050 area can be considered to be support. A violation of that area would be very negative, leading to a quick test of the 1980-1990 support area from last December-January. To continue reading, please subscribe. Already a Subscriber?
