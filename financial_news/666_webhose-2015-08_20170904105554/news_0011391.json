This enables E- zwich cardholders to perform banking and retail transactions at the outlets of other E- zwich financial institutions, and E- zwich point of sales terminals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:01:35.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
