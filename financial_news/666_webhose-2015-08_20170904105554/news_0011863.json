Those, however, are debates and tasks for others.\" \nPatrick Coughlin, a lawyer representing several pension fund plaintiffs, said: \"We're disappointed that the judge thought the exchanges deserved immunity as to complex order types. The way they were implemented disadvantaged our clients. We will review the opinion and determine whether to appeal.\" \nBarclays said it is pleased with the \"thorough and well-reasoned\" decision. The exchanges declined to comment. \nFurman said one plaintiff, Great Pacific Securities may amend its lawsuit against Barclays, calling it premature to say doing so would be futile. A lawyer for the Costa Mesa, California-based firm was not immediately available for comment. \nThe case is In re: Barclays Liquidity Cross and High Frequency Trading Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-md-02589. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chris Reese and Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:57:03.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
