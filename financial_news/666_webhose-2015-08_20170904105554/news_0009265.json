The retailer was also bolstered by E L James’ fourth instalment of the Fifty Shades of Grey erotic thriller series, Grey, which is told from the character Christian Grey’s perspective. \nColouring books for adults, such as the Johanna Basford's Enchanted Forest or Milie Marotta's Animal Kingdom, have soared in popularity after it was proven that colouring in can help alleviate stress and tension. \nWH Smith refused to answer questions about the impact on its travel business of the recent VAT scandal at airports. \nThousands of airport passengers revolted last week after retailers admitted that shoppers are not required to show their boarding passes at the till and those that do are merely helping them to claim millions of pounds back in VAT refunds. \nAirport retailers including WH Smiths and chemist Boots were accused of misleading customers who had been under the impression that producing their boarding passes was for security reasons. \nBoots has said that it would stop requesting boarding passes while WH Smiths said that it has reminded staff that there is no obligation on customers to show their boarding passes. \nThe stationer, which is often the last stop for travel passengers to stock up on books, magazines and sweets for their flight, said that around half of its products do not attract VAT. For the products that are charged VAT, WH Smith said that the refunds are passed on to customers in promotional offers. \n“WH Smith feels that only 50pc of its airport mix is VATable and its customer base includes predominantly intra EU travellers and international non-UK ones not exposed to the British Press”, said Tony Shiret, analyst at Espirito Santo. \n“So far it appears to have seen minimal impact. That is not to say that this will not become more of an issue, but we feel that it is likely to be a very low single digit millions type of issue at worst”, he added. \nWH Smith said in its trading update that its travel business continued to deliver a “strong performance” reflecting an increase in the number of people passing through airports and train stations. \nAs a result the retailer said that it expects its full year results, to be disclosed 15 October, will be “slightly ahead” of market expectations (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T21:15:47.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
