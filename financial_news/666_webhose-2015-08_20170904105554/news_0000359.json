As Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former director of communications , is now rightly warning, Labour could be finished if Jeremy Corbyn, the far left MP, were to win his party’s leadership election. Tragically, I doubt whether too many of those voting will be listening to Mr Campbell’s unusually wise words. \nThey have fallen madly, head over heels in love with Mr Corbyn’s ridiculous, economically illiterate worldview. \nHis latest nonsensical pronouncements include a call for the state to take a majority stake in the utility companies - in other words, the mass nationalisation of gas and electricity firms. He also wants to reopen coal mines. \nIt may be, of course, that Mr Corbyn wants to change the law and remove the requirement that stipulates that once an investor’s holding in a listed firm hits 30pc they must launch a bid for all of the equity. If not, his nationalisation plan would require him to buy all of the shares in the global or UK operations of Centrica’s British Gas, SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) , RWE (Xetra: 703712 - news ) npower, Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, E.ON, and EDF (Paris: FR0010242511 - news ) , as well as the National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) . \n• Are you a voter? Think that you know best? Labour doesn’t \nJefferies, the City firm, believes that this would cost at least £185bn -- and quite possibly a lot more. Given that so many of these firms are foreign-owned, Mr Corbyn’s assault would trigger a major international row - but that is almost the least of the reasons why nationalisation would be such a disaster. \nSpending such a large amount to buy up a chunk of UK Plc, for no particular reason, would be an absurd misallocation of resources. It would require a major increase in the debt to GDP ratio (unless, of course, Mr Corbyn tried to print money to buy his shares, but that is so ridiculous that I doubt even he would actually do this). \nThe state has already increased its influence over energy in recent years, primarily in the name of environmentalism: it now controls the make-up and composition of investment and plays a key role in determining which energy sources should be used, developments which have reduced competition and pushed up prices. \nBut despite this, the industry is more efficient than ever and better-managed. Service levels, while still not good enough, are improving, as is innovation. All of this would end under nationalisation and the recreation of a monopoly. Customers would once again be treated like supplicants; consumers would no longer have any meaningful rights and would not be allowed to move their custom elsewhere. \nFar from falling, prices would rise as the new nationalised monopoly would become bloated and lazy; the end of competition, combined with the absence of a profit motive, would mean that energy firms would be run for the benefit of their staff, rather than in the public interest. All decisions would be taken by politicians or political appointees; inevitably, the well-connected would be granted a better service than the rest of us. Innovation would end, as would research and development. \nCapital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) expenditure would be consolidated within the government accounts; public spending would shoot up. Instead of getting the private sector to pay for our power lines and stations, the taxpayer would foot the bill and bear all of the risk - and in return, would get less reliable, more expensive energy. Expenditure on the energy infrastructure would become contingent on the health of the public finances: it wouldn’t take long for the lights to go out. \nRenationalising the energy industry would be a horrendously regressive act. Energy policy was a catastrophe under nationalisation; it is flawed today, but the culprit is excessive political intervention, not privatisation. We need more competition, not less; more markets, not fewer. \nOne reason why Ed Miliband’s Labour party was defeated so heavily in May is that the party struck fear into too many English voters. They were terrified, even if they didn’t necessarily admit it, of being taxed much more heavily, especially if they worked hard and got on in life and owned property; and they were aghast at the prospect of the government becoming dependent on a bunch of left-wing Scottish nationalists. \nThey didn’t like Mr Miliband very much either but it was those two factors, more than any other, that destroyed Labour’s chances. \nTony Blair’s genius was that he understood the need to neutralise the middle class’s fear of Labour. That is why he pledged not to increase what was then the top, 40pc rate of income tax; and why he ditched Clause IV of the Labour Party’s constitution, its Marxist commitment to mass nationalisation. \nBoth of these changes were intended to show that Labour was a modern, social-democratic party that embraced markets and competition and was supportive of aspiration. The phrasing of the old Clause IV was archaic, especially given the collapse of the Soviet Union. \nIt is worth quoting from it at length: “To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of the common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, and the best obtainable system of popular administration and control of each industry or service.” \nThe argument was predicated on the labour theory of value and the idea that capital exploits labour; it also suggested the total nationalisation not just of manufacturers but even of retailers. \nMr Corbyn doesn’t actually want to bring back the original Clause IV. But he remains a fervent socialist, an approach which is going down brilliantly with the party faithful but which will terrify the public and the aspirational middle classes. Mr Campbell is right: Labour needs to choose Anyone But Corbyn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T00:41:26.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
