Spending on areas like public sector salaries wouldn’t be affected, according to the sources. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that the Saudi government would run a fiscal deficit of around 20 percent of GDP in 2015 - much larger than the 14.2 percent gap that it had forecast in May, and the biggest deficit since at least 1999, IMF records show. \nOil accounts for 90 percent of the country’s revenue, and with the price dropping from $110 a barrel last April to the current price of $45, Saudi’s finances are coming under increasing pressure, with the current budget deficit covered by drawing down financial reserves. \nSaudi Arabia sold $5.33 billion (20 billion riyals) of debt on earlier this month and said it would issue further sovereign bonds, as it tries to close a budget deficit caused by the collapse in oil prices. \nThe Ministry of Finance declined to comment to Bloomberg on the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:09:10.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
