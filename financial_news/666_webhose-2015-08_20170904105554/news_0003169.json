Share on twitter by Kate Cowling When you've just turned 18 or snagged your first paying job, managing money is probably the last thing on your mind. After all, you probably still have some parental backing and you've got the rest of your life to top up your personal wealth, right?\nWell it's not that simple according to financial advisers, who say the choices – and mistakes – you make at the start of adulthood can define your future financial prowess.\nIt won't be as exciting as your first (legal) sip of beer or wine, but here are a few considerations that will set you off on the right track.\nDevelop a cautious relationship with credit: Although our credit rating chases us around for most of our lives, many of us are oblivious to it. But if it's put it in jeopardy early, it can become hard to prove to banks that you're a worthy borrower, says Patrick Canion, an adviser at ipac. \"With my kids, rather than saying, 'Credit cards are evil,' I said, 'Let's get a credit card for you and let's pay it back as quickly as we can,'\" he says. \"Then the bank's got a record that they can trust you.\"\nGet health insurance: Check whether you are still on your parents' policy – some cover you while you are a student, others end when you are in your early 20s. Consider what would happen if you broke your leg skiing, needed a knee reconstruction and weren't covered. You could spend months on a waiting list or quickly build up debt. Instead, investigate your health insurance options and find one suitable for your age.\nTurn your super to growth: A common mistake people make after they start their first or second job is leaving their superannuation savings in a balanced option, Canion says. \"Have a look at your super and make sure it's in the most aggressive [equities-heavy] portfolio they've got, then forget about it,\" he advises.\nWork out a savings plan: Believe it or not, these are your prime years to develop good money habits and that starts with how you approach saving when you get your first job. \"One of the first lessons is not spending everything you earn,\" says Suzanne Haddan, founder of BFG Financial Services. \"That may mean just putting aside $50 a week and attaching it to a goal, like a trip to Fiji.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:40:10.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
