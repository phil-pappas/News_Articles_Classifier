Chief executive Ashley Highfield said at the time that the publishing house had suffered particularly around the general election when there was “a high degree of uncertainty in the wider market”. \nIn July, Johnston Press said it expected first-half profits to be “marginally” below last year, when the group reported an underlying profit of £6.1m and a statutory loss of £6.3m, on a turnover of £135.8m. \nMr Highfield reiterated on Tuesday that trading conditions had been challenging, but said local publishing was “not as volatile as national publishing”. He added that the group would continue to target cost savings. \nThe outlook was better in the digital side of the business, where audience grew by more than 20pc to 19.9 million. Digital revenue grew 17.5pc, albeit from a low base of £14.1m. \nJohnston Press said it was entering the second half from a lower base than expected, but decline had slowed in July. \n“We believe in our strategy and are confident that our transformation projects will position the group well for the future,” the company said. \nFollow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
