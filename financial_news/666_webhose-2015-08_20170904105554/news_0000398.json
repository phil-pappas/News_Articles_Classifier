One of his campaign promises in the run-up to the 2012 governorship election, which he won on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), was that his administration would not obtain loans to develop the state. He noted at the time that particular that his predecessor, Timipre Sylva, plunged the state into indebtedness through loans and bond issuance running into about N345 billion. \nStakeholders are not relenting in knocking the government's action. A group of Bayelsa elders under the aegis of Bayelsa Elders Consultative Forum alleged that Governor Seriake Dickson only intends to use the loan to prosecute his re-election bid. \nThe governorship election has been scheduled for December 5, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). \nSpokesman of the elders' forum, Alex Ekiotenne, claimed that Dickson had vindicated allegations of mismanagement of resources levelled against him in some quarters, saying the timing for the collection of the money was wrong. \nHowever, the pioneer chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Charles Dorgu, faulted Dickson's critics. \nHe told reporters in Yenagoa that those opposed to it did not understand the meaning of good governance and infrastructure development, describing the allegations of using the loan for the December 5 election as baseless, since Dickson consulted widely before the decision. \nBenue \nIn Benue state, Governor Samuel Ortom, borrowed about N15 billion barely two months after assuming office, a situation that has set the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against him. The governor, who is of the All Progressives Congress (APC), borrowed N10 billion in the first instance to pay workers' salaries and service the executive and legislative arms. Another N5 billion is counterpart funding. \nBut, out of the N10 billion, the governor said he used N7.5 billion for the payment of salaries and N2.5 billion to purchase cars. \nSpeaking to Daily Independent, a public affairs analyst in the state, Bemgba Iortyom, expressed shock that the Benue State House of Assembly approved N3 billon for Ortom \"for no just reason\". \nThese include N1 billion each for extra-ordinary items and service wide capital as well as N500 million each for general miscellaneous expenses and welfare package/service wide votes. \nDeclaring it as outrageous, Iortyom said, \"Contained in the budget are certain provisions which tend to raise some unavoidable questions as to how prudent and realistic the Ortom administration intends to be with the finances of the state against the backdrop of scarce and dwindling revenues.\" \nDelta \nThe Delta State Assembly also in June approved Governor Ifeanyi Okowa's request for N10 billion loan. \nIn a letter dated June 22 to the Speaker of the Delta state House of Assembly, Okowa wrote: \"On its inauguration on May 29, 2015, the new administration in Delta State met a huge bank/capital market debt burden of about N96.62 billion with a scheduled monthly repayment of N4.6 billion, in addition to the monthly repayment of Delta State Infrastructure Development Bond of N50 billion obtained in 2011. \n\"The state has, therefore, reached an unsustainable level of indebtedness exacerbated by declining oil prices and consequent low FAAC receipts,\" he told the Assembly. \nEdo \nEdo State's case is different from the others. The state is taking the second tranche of a $225 million World Bank loan. \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari last week wrote to Senate to seek approval for a $75 million (N14.7 billion) loan from the World Bank for the development policy operation (DPO) of Edo State. The President reminded the Senators that the N14.7 billion was from the N44.1 billion ($225 million) World Bank loan granted Edo State Government in three tranches of $75 million per annum, which was first approved by the 7th Senate in 2012. \nThe state government had collected N14.7 billion ($75 million) in 2012 as the first tranche offer and now seeking for release of another N14.7 billion as second tranche offer. \nThe State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Louis Odion, told Daily Independent: \"I don't think there is any controversy other than the act of mischief by the Edo State PDP chairman (Chief Dan Orbih) two days ago when he took liberty to address a press conference in Abuja to dabble into matters in which he has little knowledge. \n\"The truth of the matter is that Edo State had entered into some understanding with the World Bank about four years ago. We applied for support which is legitimate. \n\"They sent their officials to the state to come and verify if the claims we made were genuine. Their officials came here and conducted their own independent investigation and they found that here is a state government that is exemplary unlike its predecessor. \n\"Here is a state governor who is ready to work. In their judgment they decided to approve $225million facility in terms of support to the state government. \n\"It should interest you that it was only Edo and Lagos States they gave that to. That is during the administration of Governor Babatunde Fashola. By their own assessment they believed that the two governors are serious and could be trusted. So, they decided to advance that facility but the arrangement is that you don't collect the money at a go.\" \nLagos \nLagos State Government's loan is similar to that of Edo. The state Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, obtained a N39.4 billion World Bank loan, which his Chief Press Secretary, Habib Haruna, said was initiated and finalised by the previous Babatunde Fashola government. \nHaruna said it was not that Ambode approached the World Bank for a fresh loan. \nNiger \nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, wrote to the State Assembly, seeking approval for a N1.85 billion loan to pay workers salaries in the state, owing to the inability of the local government councils to mobilise enough money to pay their workers salaries arrears. \nOndo \nOndo State House of Assembly also approved a loan of N7 billion to enable Governor Olusegun Mimiko fund some major infrastructure projects in the state. \nThe opposition APC in the state however challenged the approval for the loan from Access Bank by the Assembly, urging Governor Olusegun Mimiko to account of all allocations that have accrued to the state since the inception of his administration more than six years ago. \nState APC Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Adesanya, wants the administration to \"explain why he should be granted N7 billion loan from Access Bank when he's yet to fully offset the over N70 billion debt formerly incurred\". \nHe further explained that projects executed under Mimiko's watch cannot justify the N44 billion his administration inherited and the huge allocations he has received since 2009 when he became governor. \nRivers \nAlthough Special Adviser to Governor Nyosme Wike of Rivers State, Simeon Nwakaude, said the N30 billion loan \"would be judiciously spent for the benefit of the Rivers people because it has been tied to projects that are visible and will rub off positively on the common man on the streets,\" but the opposition APC in the state does not believe the explanation. \nThe party foresees the possibility of the governor collecting up to N100 billion loan before the year ends. \nChris Finebone, spokesman of the party, argued that \"Rivers people have entered one chance (difficult situation) as PDP is planning to mortgage the state by planning to collect N100billion from various banks\". \nReactions \nExpectedly, the borrowing spree by the state governors has attracted mixed reactions. For example, Chukwuma Duru, managing director, Blunest Consulting, noted that borrowing is worthwhile only when the project for which the loan is obtained would benefit the borrower and when completed, is able to rake in enough revenue for repayment and meet running costs. \nIn fact, he said the states may have to struggle with a bigger burden of servicing the debts. \nSuch burden, according to him, may become so heavy and unbearable that it imposes intolerable constraints on the economy and development in the states that are affected. \nManaging Director of Savewell Microfinance Bank, Chinonso Osadebe, told Daily Independent: \"Of more serious concern, in particular, is the indiscriminate manner in which state governments acquired external loans to finance all projects without seeking Federal Government guarantee. \n\"This has the implication of eroding the country's credit worthiness in the event of default on the part of the state governments. Where the Federal Government takes up such liabilities; its own debt burden increases correspondingly,\" he added. \nAlso commenting, public policy analyst, Chiwuike Uba, raised concerns about how the loans would be utilised, expressing disappointment that most of the government borrowings end up in individual pockets, a point, he argued, is evident in the number of past government officials being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for graft. \nUba emphasised that often, even corporations that receive Federal Government guarantees for loans from multilateral agencies end up diverting the funds for personal uses outside the purposes for which they were obtained. \nHe said the problem subsists because the government does not have an adequate monitoring and evaluation plan on ground to checkmate such abuses, noting that even when such monitoring and evaluation mechanism are in place, most times, the responsible personnel are compromised. \nTherefore, instead of creating employment, such debt increases unemployment, he lamented. \nNigeria's total public debt stock, according to the Debt Management Office in its Annual Report as of December 2014, stood at about $67.73 billion and N11.2 trillion, which is about N1.2 trillion higher than the 2013 figure of N10.04 trillion. \nA breakdown of the figures showed that external debt, including those of the states, was $9.71 billion and N1.63 trillion. \nThe Federal Government's domestic debt was $47.05 billion and N7.9 trillion, while those of the states stood at $10.97 billion and N1.708 trillion. \nThe Presidency Reacts \nOn its part, the Presidency said it was amenable to more bailout for states, declaring its willingness to offer more financial relief packages or bailout to enable embattled state governments meet their obligations. \nPresidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, told Daily Independent that subsequent relief packages would however be through the National Economic Council (NEC), chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, as was done recently. \nBy Sola Alabadan, Lagos, Chibuzor Emejor, Abuja, Yemi Akintomide (Akure), Igoniko Oduma (Yenagoa), Isaac Olamikan (Benin), Laide Reheem (Abeokuta) Nigeria \nPresident Barack Obama's widely-publicised remarks in Addis Ababa on African presidents who refuse to step down when … see more » Copyright © 2015 Daily Independent.
