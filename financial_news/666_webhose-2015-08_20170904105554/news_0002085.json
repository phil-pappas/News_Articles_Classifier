The Hangzhou-based company hasn't pleased investors, despite a year-over-year 45% increase in 2015 fourth- quarter revenue. Â¿The online retailer reports its fiscal, first-quarter results for 2016 on Wednesday before the opening bell. \nBut things are about to change, largely on the strength of an ambitious cloud initiative. That combined with continued growth among consumers should send the stock higher. Alibaba has never shied away from comparisons to Amazon.com ( AMZN - Get Report ) or what has often been perceived as copying Amazon's playbook . Alibaba recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next three years to build its cloud capabilities. A similar strategy has made Amazon a premier technology power. \nIn its second-quarter earnings , Seattle-based Amazon reported an 81% year-over-year surge in its dominant Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, reaching almost $2 billion. Profits from its cloud division skyrocketed more than fivefold, sending Amazon stock surging nearly 10% a day after the report. Alibaba, whose share price has stagnated, believes it's cloud bet will pay off in similar fashion. \nMust Read: 5 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Selling \nWorking in its favor, the company already has significant cloud resources in place. Alibaba is already the leading cloud-computing vendor in China, with its Aliyun cloud segment taking up more than 20% of the country's market share. This is a small business for Alibaba since its cloud computing segments accounts for less than 2% of its sales, but it took Amazon more than decade to grow its AWS service. \nTo accelerate the growth of its cloud market, Alibaba is looking to expand overseas, having earlier this year built its first data center in Silicon Valley. The move will support Silicon Valley-based clients. With its headstart in infrastructure, Alibaba is primed for long-term success in the cloud space.At least one analyst, Bob Peck of SunTrust , believes Alibaba can grow its cloud business to become a $1 billion franchise within three years. \nExpect first-quarter revenue to come in higher-than-expected. But also expect that even if earnings beat expectations, investors won't be happy. Alibaba's strength is in future -- remember that Amazon was not too-long ago just a blip on a radar screen but recently passed Wal-Mart ( WMT - Get Report ) in market capitalization. Buy shares of Alibaba and hold for the long term. This article is commentary by an independent contributor. At the time of publication, the author held no positions in the stocks mentioned.
