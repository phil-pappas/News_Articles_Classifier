I look forward to helping the company to develop and grow.” \nThe idea to connect the best service providers (Ustas) in categories such as plumbers, repairmen, landscapers, or personal trainers, and the UAE residents was developed by Dunia Othman and Ibrahim Colak in late 2013. \nRecently, mrUsta joined the Hamdan University H(in)3 business incubation centre. \nThe site, launched in early 2014, has quickly become popular among Dubai residents who experience difficulties in finding reliable and professional service providers. \n“We are making a significant effort to ensure that key categories are well populated with strong Ustas who can deliver great work to clients. We also want to expand our reach to clients and ensure that their user experience is positive and effective on any device they choose. \n“And we aim to ensure the best Ustas are on our platform and that they have a strong online presence through our site,” said Othman. \nAccording to Dubai SME, less than 15 percent of SMEs are online while almost every client searches for service providers online first. \n“mrUsta is ready for the next phase of growth given the strong resources we added with this funding round,” adds Othman. \n“We are one step closer to achieving our vision to make finding a service provider a great experience while simultaneously improving the service quality in the UAE.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T15:10:16.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
