It did not give a figure for the potential loss. \n\"Hanergy's recent announcements about its contract and profits are akin to rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,\" said Soren Aandahl, director at shortseller Glaucus Research. \n\"Hanergy has shown little ability to attract customers who were not also named Hanergy,\" he told Reuters. \"I would be surprised if it ever traded again.\" \nHTF did not respond to Reuters requests for comment about its decision to suspend ties with its parent, or to questions about its business outlook. \nHTF is controlled by Li Hejun, who at one point this year dethroned Alibaba Group Holding's Jack Ma as China's richest man. It manufactures solar panel making machines and its main customers have so far been unlisted China-based parent Hanergy Holding and its four affiliates. \nHanergy Holding accounted for 62% of HTF's sales in 2014, public filings show. Last week, however, HTF said it was cancelling or suspending these contracts to address concerns by the Securities and Futures Commission about its dependence on its parent, but gave no details. \nReuters had previously reported that HTF was resisting an SFC request to disclose the parent company accounts to the regulator as a condition to resume trading. \nAnalysts say thin film solar panels are inefficient by industry standards, and that makes it difficult for HTF to find external clients. Thin film panels have an 8-9% conversion rate, which measures the efficiency of turning solar energy into power, while the industry average is 11-15%. \n\"Uncertainties related to its thin film technology and market responses to the solar applications are still very high,\" BNP Paribas, which has a \"reduce\" recommendation on the stock, said in a report. \nSome of the contracts HTF has struck with external clients include a 660mn deal in February with Shandong Macrolink New Resources Technology, an unlisted company which produces thin-film solar collectors. It also agreed to sell a 3.6% stake to a core investor of Shandong Macrolink for 700mn, company filings show. \nShandong Macrolink, however, told Reuters last week it had closed that deal, adding that it did not expect future co-operation with HTF due to its uncertain future. \n\"HTF sold almost all its production to the parent company and if those contracts were cancelled, there is no real market for their equipment,\" said Hong-Kong based CLSA analyst Charles Yonts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:47:09.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
