(are) continuing to weigh heavily on commodities.\" \nHe added in a client note: \"This view has been reinforced by China's surprise move overnight to weaken the yuan's daily reference rate.\" \nChina's central bank on Tuesday devalued the yuan by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the world's second-largest economy. \nA cheaper yuan will make Chinese exports less expensive, which could potentially boost their overseas sales. \n\"Clearly, the market has interpreted the move as a sign that the health of the Chinese economy is probably worse than even what the official data suggests,\" added Razaqzada. \nDespite concerns over China, OPEC on Tuesday revised upward its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2015 and maintained projected record levels of world consumption next year. \nIn its August monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it was expecting world oil demand to grow by 1.38 million barrels per day -- some 90,000 more than announced in its July estimates. \nOil prices collapsed 60 percent between last June and January, hitting a low of $45 largely owing to a supply glut caused by the boom in US shale oil. \nAnd despite showing signs of a recovery earlier this year, they have started to once more slip back. \nOn Monday meanwhile, the World Bank warned that the lifting of sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme would have a \"significant impact\" on the world oil market in 2016. \nOPEC member Iran?s return to the global market would eventually add about a million barrels of oil a day, lowering prices by $10 per barrel, the bank said. \nElsewhere on commodity markets Tuesday, aluminium hit a six-year low point at $1,573.50 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange. \nCopper moved closer to a six-year low as it reached $5,166.50 a tonne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:50:58.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
