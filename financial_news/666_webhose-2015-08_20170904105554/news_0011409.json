Louie Douvis by Phillip Coorey Primrose Riordan Treasurer Joe Hockey has played down his new role of helping spearhead a republic after his colleagues, including the Prime Minister, cautioned him to stick to his day job.\nMany of the Treasurer's colleagues were mystified as to why he would take on the role of co-chairing a parliamentary friendship group on the republic , at the request of his good friend and new Australian Republican Movement chairman Peter Fitzsimons, when the government was desperately trying to steer the conversation back to jobs and the economy.\nThe announcement on Wednesday came as a surprise to Mr Hockey's office and his colleagues, including Tony Abbott, who said on Thursday it had not been discussed with him.\n\"No, we didn't talk about this because we've got, I suppose, bigger things on our minds most of the time,\" Mr Abbott said.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and Social Services Minister Scott Morrison assist in the community hall upgrade in the Injinoo community during his visit to Cape York on Thursday. Alex Ellinghausen \"Joe is leading a push to make Australia a stronger and more competitive economy,\" he said.\nMr Abbott said there were lots of friendship groups in Parliament and \"it's no big deal there should be another one\".\nMr Hockey, who continues a tradition of republican treasurers including Paul Keating, Peter Costello and Wayne Swan, said the role would not distract from his core duties.\n\"It's basically drinks in an MP's office with other people who think it's a good idea to support a republic,\" he said.\n \"This is an example of where people overreact. There are 77 parliamentary friendship groups â€“ this is one of them.\"\nUnderlying tensions The reaction from Mr Hockey's colleagues has again exposed the underlying tensions in the Coalition, which are driven, in part, by an anxiety with Mr Hockey's performance in the key economic portfolio and is leading for growing calls for him to be moved aside in any pre-election reshuffle.\n\"It's not as though he's universally seen as doing a fabulous job as Treasurer,\" one senior Liberal said.\nThose anxieties are being further stoked by the September 19 Canning byelection. Mr Abbott is keeping a low profile during the campaign and leaving the heavy lifting to his more popular ministers, including Julie Bishop, Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison and Bruce Billson.\n\"We can hide [Mr Abbott] in Canning but you can't hide him in a general election,\" one Liberal said.\n\"There's a real gloom settled over the government. It's hard to be optimistic.\"\nMr Turnbull and Mr Pyne, both noted republicans, supported Mr Hockey taking on the role in the belief it was no big deal, whereas Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce was mildly critical.\n\"I believe everyone should have friends. I think they are great ... but I'm going to be focusing on other things,\" he said.\nWestern Australian Liberal senator and constitutional monarchist Dean Smith criticised Mr Hockey's involvement as a distraction.\n\"The priority for every parliamentarian is to focus on the national economy and on jobs creation. Nothing is more important than strengthening the economy and creating jobs at this time,\" Senator Smith said.\nMr Abbott repeated his belief Australia did not need its own head of state to show it had matured as a nation.\n\"I don't think there is anything small about us now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:49:41.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
