(Copper) premiums in China have surged. Couple that with imports, with copper products output, none of it is looking like we should be panicking,\" Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain.\nThree-month LME copper was down 2.5 percent at $4,937 a tonne by 1007 GMT. The industrial metal hit a six-year low of $4,855 on Monday.\nIn more bullish news, Freeport-McMoran said that copper exports from its giant Indonesian mine have slowed to a trickle over the past month as it contends with new rules on how buyers pay for metal.\nMeanwhile, expectations that a weaker yuan would increase the cost of Chinese imports of refined copper have supported domestic prices in the world's biggest metals consumer, pushing premiums to their highest this year.\nThe investor focus, however, remains firmly on China's macroeconomic woes.\n\"China will find that this will be a diminishing-return game, akin to pushing on a string. The economy does not need more credit or easier money - it is suffering from excess capacity and sub-par consumer demand, with the only driver in terms of spending being the government,\" INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said.\nLME zinc was down 2.6 percent at $1,693, having having fallen to its lowest since 2010 at $1,686.50. Data showed LME stocks MZN-STOCKS at their highest since March, having risen for most of August.\nAluminium slipped 1.2 percent to $1,538, having also clocked a six-year low on Monday.\nCentury Aluminum Co said on Tuesday that it will idle its smelter in Hawesville, Kentucky. It will be the first aluminum plant to shut in years, with producers feeling the effects of sinking prices and increased Chinese exports.\nTin was down 2.8 percent at $13,850 after touching $13,835, its lowest since early August.\nPRICES\nThree month LME copper\nMost active ShFE copper\nThree month LME aluminium\nMost active ShFE aluminium\nThree month LME zinc\nMost active ShFE zinc\nThree month LME lead\nMost active ShFE lead\nThree month LME nickel\nMost active ShFE nickel\nThree month LME tin\nMost active ShFE tin ($1 = 6.4152 Chinese yuan) (Additional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by David Goodman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:59:15.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
