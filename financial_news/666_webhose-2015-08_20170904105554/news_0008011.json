Photo: Pat Scala\nOne year after Viva Energy came into being, chief executive Scott Wyatt is leading a $1 billion investment program and considering a major restructuring of the former Shell Australia refining and marketing business that would help the new owner satisfy its keen appetite for expansion.\nMr Wyatt says the potential spin-off of a real estate trust from Viva, first revealed by Fairfax Media in April , was still under review but would have the advantage of providing funds for growth.\n\"Such a vehicle would provide a platform for us to further grow our retail network. It's providing capital for that expansion,\" he said, speaking publicly for the first time about the potential float.\n\"To run a retail business you don't have to own your own properties. We don't have to own real estate, so a real estate trust is one way of looking at how you would operate your retail business in a different way.\"\nAdvertisement The trust would comprise about 420 freehold properties owned by Viva of the total 860 in its network, which include both Coles Express sites and independently owned service stations. As reported by Street Talk, Viva hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deustche Bank as joint lead managers on the circa $1 billion-plus transaction, which would target real estate investors.\nMr Scott, who headed Shell's \"downstream\" business in Australia before the $2.9 billion sale, said Viva was \"not in a hurry\" to decide whether to proceed. \"We'll continue to consider whether it's the right step for us or not,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Viva, owned by Dutch-based commodities trader Vitol and Abu Dhabi Investment Council, has followed through on its pledge to invest to support the Geelong refinery, which at one stage looked doomed for closure.\nOne third earmarked Mr Wyatt said about a third of the $1 billion earmarked for investment over Viva's first 4-5 years would go on the refinery, securing its future at least until the next round of major maintenance is due in five years. Another third is going on the supply chain and the rest on the marketing business, including acquisitions of existing sites and new openings.\nSome $150 million will go on the refinery in the next 12 months, including two major maintenance \"turnarounds\" at key production units. That comes after other refiners have closed plants, including a BP plant in Brisbane this year and refineries owned by Shell and Caltex in Sydney.\n\"The fact that we are prepared to do that says very clearly that were very optimistic about the future,\" Mr Wyatt said from Melbourne.\n\"My intention is to run for the long term and to do what's necessary beyond the turnaround to also set ourselves up to be confident about doing the next turnaround as well.\"\nViva's acquisition has been well timed, with global refining margins being relatively strong this year. At the same time, the 20 per cent weakening in the Australian dollar has provided a good tailwind, Mr Wyatt said.\nBut Viva has also gone down the self-help path. Savings have been made by stopping shipments from Geelong to other states, with all the fuels produced by the plant now sold within Victoria, and Viva relying on imports and third party purchases for supplies elsewhere. The growth within Victoria is requiring a $25 million upgrade of a pipeline to Melbourne, while a proposed $40 million to $50 million investment would almost double oil storage capacity to improve efficiency of crude sourcing.\nViva is also looking to expand in specialty products such as bitumen and chemicals where its sales fall short of production capacity.\nIn retailing, Viva has opened 11 new sites this year, and expects to add as many again before the year-end, while small acquisitions have also featured. The retail network has kept the famous Shell logo under a licensing deal for which commercial terms remain undisclosed.\nViva is also keeping an eye on alternative fuels, with the focus on ethanol and biodiesel but Mr Wyatt doesn't rule out investments to support LNG fuelling or electric vehicles longer term.\nViva has been caught up in the parliamentary inquiry into corporate tax avoidance along with other energy companies with offshore parents or operations. But Mr Wyatt said last year's 4&frac12; months-worth of accounts, where little tax was paid because of restructuring costs and write-downs, wouldn't be typical.\n\"Our focus is very much on building a profitable business here in Australia and my objective is to ensure we are an active taxpayer in this country,\" he said.\n\"Unless we are making money we can't support that investment program, and if we're making money here then we're paying taxes here.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/street-talk/merrill-lynch-deutsche-appointed-on-viva-energy-20150413-1mk0tc"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:36:16.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
