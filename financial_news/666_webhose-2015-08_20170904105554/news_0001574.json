Two of his colleagues, Sarah Henderson and Sharman Stone are likely to vote for Mr Broadbent.\nIn SA, where there are six Lower House Liberals, Dr Southcott starts with all six votes.\nAs candidates are knocked out, votes will be redirected towards the remaining candidates, Dr Southcott's backers believe he can win from behind as others are knocked out.\nThe contest for the job is willing but generally good-natured.\nSources said MPs are unlikely to be influenced on how to vote by the Prime Minster, the Treasurer or anyone else.\n After Mr Abbott's so-called captain's pick of putting Mrs Bishop into the Speaker's chair backfired, the backbench has made it clear he must stay out of the process of selecting her replacement and let the party room decide.\nOthers to have nominated are Queensland's Ross Vasta while veteran Philip Ruddock would be prepared to do the job but lacks any support.\nMrs Bishop quit on Sunday this week after Mr Abbott, who had been standing by her for almost three weeks, rang her and asked her to resign.\nWhile the saga diminished Mr Abbott's leadership, there is significant anger towards Mrs Bishop for stubbornly refusing to quit even when it became apparent her position was untenable.\n\"A lot of the criticism of Abbott is unfair,\" one MP said.\n\"She made him ring her and ask her to resign.\"\nMrs Bishop was accused of gross bias while in the chair and it is expected her successor will sit outside the party room as an act if goodwill. Mr Broadbent has reportedly said he will continue to attend party meetings if he is made Speaker.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-07T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:32:38.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
