Kissi Collins Osei at a press briefing in Accra on Tuesday wondered why the Minerals Commission which is the main agency for issuing mining leases and digging permits have kept its processing and consideration fees at a lower rate Ghc250.00 and Ghc550.00 respectively with the aim of attracting small scale miners operating without the requisite permits into the mainstream but the EPA is charging as high as $2400.00 convertible at the going exchange rate. \nHe told the press, with heavy heart, several attempts to get the authorities to sit down with them to dialogue and find a lasting solution to the problem has failed necessitating the call for the press conference. \n\"We've wrote a letter to the Ministry of finance, Sector Minister, the parliament select committee and other stakeholders to sit down and dialogue with us for the way forward yet no response.Those in authorities are not prepared to talk to us if not we won't have called for this press conference\" he indicated. \n\"The marginalization is too much; this is not a sector which should be looked down upon\" he added. \nMr. Emmanuel Yirenkyi Antwi, Executive Director of the Association said: \"In fact we have been disappointed to note that despite formal petition to the appropriate quarters and calls by organized ASM valued-chain operators and CSOs for a consultative dialogue with the operators on the subject matter details have emerged that regulatory agencies are failing to respond to the plight of the marginalized miners\" \nAccording to the Executive Director, the group has observed with contempt the arbitrary increase in the fees for the small scale mining environmental permit, warning if not check could resort to discouraging people from acquiring the right permits and licenses to carry out mining operation legally. \nThe Ghana National Association of Small Scale Miners has therefore called on Government to quickly intervene to streamline the fees and charges by resorting to the following actions: \n1. Suspend for review the imposed fees and charges and inform parliament and the Public, since you have the power under Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2009 Act 793 to do so. \n2. Stop dollarisation of the fees and charges. \n3. Encourage stakeholders engagements before, during and after the passage of the (Amendment) instrument to serve as a check on the institution and the operation of the fees and charges under miscellaneous Provisions Act, 2009 Act 793 to avert rapid increases and blanket approval for high increases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:24:44.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
