But unlike a decade ago, sentiment has improved without dramatic increases in mortgage debt. Any reading above 50 indicates more builders view sales conditions as good, rather than poor. Builders' view of current sales conditions and buyer traffic improved in August, while sales prospects over the next six months were stable. Through the first half of 2015, the government reports that new-home purchases shot up 21.2 per cent to 274,000.
