On this note he said operating cash cost improvements for the 12 months to December 31, 2015, are expected to be $1 billion, up from previous projections of $750 million.\nCapital expenditure is expected to decline to about $5.5 billion in 2015 and less than $6 billion in 2016. Production guidance remains unchanged.\nIn response to the result, Paul Young from Deutsche Bank said: \"We continue to think Rio is the standout big miner on valuation, free cash flow, growth and buybacks. With regards to the latter, management is continuing its share buyback program with $1 billion of Rio Tinto plc shares expected to be purchased in the second half of 2015.\"\nThree times in the past three years Rio's shares have bottomed at about the $50.00 mark before rebounding strongly. This recent rally, just after hitting a 12-month low of $49.13 in July, may be the forerunner to a material re-rating.\nDeutsche Bank has a buy recommendation on the stock, with a 12-month price target of $71.00. Citi has also attributed a buy recommendation but is more conservative regarding the group's outlook, with its 12-month target price standing at $58.00.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:10:10.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
