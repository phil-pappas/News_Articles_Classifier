More Colombia to ease raids on Farc rebels \n“The protests were not an avalanche . . . but that does not mean total relief for the government,” said Valdo Cruz, a columnist for the newspaper Folha de São Paulo newspaper. “Everything is still very uncertain. She [Ms Rousseff] is feeling a false stability that could explode at any moment.” \nOver 600,000 people, according to police estimates, protested in major Brazilian cities on Sunday, compared to 540,000 in an April 12 protest, and 1.7m on March 15, to channel widespread public disgust over a corruption scandal at state energy company Petrobras that has led to the investigation of more than 30 lawmakers, mostly from Ms Rousseff’s governing Workers’ Party. \n“I’m against the impunity of politicians . . . I can’t accept the lies, the corruption scandals, everything that is happening in Brazil,” said Tatiana Lima, an engineer who attended Sunday’s protests in São Paulo. \nMs Rousseff has not been charged with corruption, although she chaired Petrobras when much of the corruption took place. But her government still faces separate probes that it cooked the budget and broke campaign finance rules; both are possible grounds for impeachment . According to polls, two-thirds of Brazilians want Ms Rousseff impeached. \nOne possible reprieve for Ms Rousseff, though, lies in the possibility of increased support from Congress as business leaders pressure politicians to prevent the crisis from worsening. \nLast week, Renan Calheiros, the head of the Senate, said he opposed impeaching Ms Rousseff, and tabled measures to restore business confidence, such as new rules for labour outsourcing. Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former president and leader of centrist opposition party the PSDB, has also called Ms Rousseff “an honest person” — a rare endorsement. I’m against the impunity of politicians . . . I can’t accept the lies, the corruption scandals, everything that is happening in Brazil \n- Tatiana Lima, protester \nYet analysts warned that any newfound political support for Ms Rousseff remained fragile, and could dissolve as the corruption probe continues to feed an everyone-for-themselves attitude among lawmakers. \nNot helping Ms Rousseff is that Brazil is facing two years of recession for the first time since the Great Depression. Latin America’s biggest economy will contract 2 per cent this year and 0.15 per cent in 2016, according to a central bank survey of analysts published on Monday. \nThat is far worse than other commodity-dependent South American economies, such as Colombia, Chile and Peru. Although they face similar pressures from China’s slowing economy, the devaluation of the renminbi, the drop in commodity prices, and higher US interest rates, they are forecast by the International Monetary Fund to grow on average 3.3 per cent this year and 4 per cent in 2016. \nNor does austerity fully explain Brazil’s performance. Its recession started last year, before the government proposed cutting public spending by 0.4 percentage points to bring the fiscal deficit under control. \nThe growing disaffection in Brazil with Dilma Rousseff \nIt is sometimes said that Brazil tries every approach to economics until it finally chooses the right one. Over the past 60 years, the country has been just as creative in the way it removes presidents too. \nContinue reading \nRather, the blame lies mostly in the corruption probe, which has stalled work at Petrobras and the construction sector. Each accounts for around 10 per cent of national investment, with important ripple effects. \nStill, some analysts point to glimmerings of hope, despite falling retail sales, rising unemployment, and the collapse in business confidence. \n“Pessimism has overshot reality,” said James Bosworth, a Latin America security and economics consultant. Brazil’s “democratic institutions appear to be successfully investigating and prosecuting multiple giant corruption scandals . . .[which] should improve the country’s investment environment over the long term.” Ms Rousseff has supported the probe. \nIn addition, exporters are starting to respond to this year’s 31 per cent drop in the currency, with rising overseas sales helping to start closing a current account deficit equivalent to 4.5 per cent of GDP. \n“It is going to be a very slow recovery, with very little growth. That is not good for such a socially unequal country,” said a senior Brazilian banker. “Still, the discrediting of the Workers’ Party means I don’t see any radical populists in the wings; that’s good. On the other hand, Dilma does not have the mandate to implement the liberalising reforms that Brazil so desperately needs.” \nAdditional reporting by Aline Rocha Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
