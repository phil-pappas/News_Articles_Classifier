But we do not want to speculate. We will wait for verification from the French authorities,” he said.\nDiscovery of the debris may finally confirm the plane crashed into the sea after veering off course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, helping to end 16 months of lingering uncertainty for relatives.\nInvestigators believe someone deliberately switched off MH370’s transponder before diverting it thousands of miles off course. Most of the passengers were Chinese.\nThe debris will be analysed at a lab staffed by 600 experts that is operated by the defence ministry near Toulouse.\nIf the serial number on the flaperon confirms that it is from Flight 370 then the laboratory can use sophisticated tools to try to glean more information about the causes of the crash, such as whether its shape corresponds more to a mid-air explosion or a crash into the ocean.\nThe defence ministry also contributed to the investigation of Air France flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris that killed 228 people in June 2009.\nA fragment of luggage that was also found in the area is being flown into France with the aircraft debris and will be sent to a unit outside Paris that specialises in DNA tests.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 12:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:29:22.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
