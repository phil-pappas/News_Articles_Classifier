Supplied by Ewin Hannan Patrick Durkin The labour movement's attempt to portray a review of industrial relations commissioned by the Abbott government as a return to the Coalition's unpopular Work Choices policy is a mistake and is unlikely to resonate with large numbers of young workers, former senior ACTU official Tim Lyons says.\nIn an analysis likely to be seized on by the government to undermine the Labor opposition's attack, Mr Lyons, who quit as an ACTU assistant secretary in 2015, said while some of its recommendations \"share a pedigree with and might bear a resemblance to it, they aren't Work Choices\".\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said this week that the commission's report was \"another trip back to WorkChoices\" by Tony Abbott, while ACTU secretary Dave Oliver said some of its recommendations were \"worse than Work Choices\". Opposition workplace relations spokesman Brendan O'Connor dubbed Mr Abbott the \"Prime Minister for Work Choices 2.0\" on Thursday.\nMr Lyons, in a online article for The Monthly , said: \"It's tempting to simply reach for the cheap 'Work Choices is back' line. Many in the union movement and the ALP have already started doing so. That's almost certainly a mistake.\n\"For one, [a] large number of the young workers who would be most immediately affected by the PC's plan were in primary school when Your Rights At Work kicked off. You may as well talk about Kim Beazley's rollback when fighting the current GST push.\"\nIn an expanded analysis for think tank Per Capita, Mr Lyons, who left the ACTU after failing to unseat Mr Oliver, said \"progressive forces\" should exercise caution when seeking to activate public opposition to the commission's recommendations.\nWaning public memory \"Opinion research from as long ago as the 2010 election period indicates a waning unprompted public memory of what Work Choices was and/or why they had disliked it.\" he said.\nRelated \"This was even more the case by 2013. It is unsurprising that it and, indeed, IR (industrial relations) as an issue of importance to voters dimmed in the public mind, given the election of Labor in late 2007, the repeal of the law, and the Coalition's repeated repudiation of the policy.\n\"It should not be presumed that workers or voters generally understand what is meant by the term. Use of the term Work Choices may result in an insider political conversation, not an organising conversation, or even a campaigning conversation, with the community at large.\"\nThe success of the Your Rights At Work campaign message was framed around promoting public opposition to precise features of Work Choices, such as \"unfair individual contracts, lack of unfair dismissal protections, and attacks on the independent umpire\", Mr Lyons said.\nFormer Business Council of Australia president Tony Shepherd said the commission's report proposed long overdue \"reform\", including cutting Sunday penalties and an overhaul of the Fair Work Commission.\n\"I think it is a good, balanced report, which keeps the system fair but deals with the more important flaws in the current system,\" he told The Australian Financial Review .\n\"Reform of [the commission], greenfields, penalty rates, individual bargaining, rights of access and unmeritorious claims are all long overdue.\nMinimum wage too high \"I still believe the minimum wage is too high and a contributor to high youth unemployment. It should be re-indexed to bring it in line with OECD norms over time.\"\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott reiterated on Thursday the government's position that any changes to penalty rates should be determined by the Fair Work Commission.\nMr Abbott, speaking to 3AW's Neil Mitchell, said many industries were struggling because of Sunday penalties and \"there are parts of our country where it's very hard to find anything open on a Sunday now\".\n\"I think there is a case for looking again at these issues but I stress this: as far as this government is concerned, these are matters for the Fair Work Commission,\" he said.\nMr Oliver accused Mr Abbott of backing employer attempts to cut penalty rates, calling on Employment Minister Eric Abetz to make a submission to the Fair Work Commission in support of the current levels of penalties.\nA spokesman for Senator Abetz said this week that the minister did not intend to make a submission on behalf of the federal government to the current penalty rates review by the commission.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey told Sky News on Thursday that the government \"would encourage business to be more pro-active in their engagement with the Fair Work Commission\" on the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:54:17.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
