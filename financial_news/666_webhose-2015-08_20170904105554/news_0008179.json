We'll need larger equipment and bigger teams of operators,\" said Ehrlich Crain, business development and diversity leader for Roncelli Inc., a Sterling Heights, Mich.-based general contractor that built all four phases of GM's advanced battery lab at its Technical Center in Warren. \nTwenty 30-yard capacity dumpsters will be moved into position each day to hold heavy debris before board-up and beautification teams can work effectively. \n\"It is easier to see the results on something like this because the areas are so far gone,\" said Art Derrick, general manager of Backer Landscaping Inc., which along with AIS and Davey Tree will cut away and pulverize overgrowth from lots and yards in Osborn. \nBacker was recruited by Aramark, a food, facilities and uniform supplier contracted to prepare hundreds of boxes lunches for distribution to the GM volunteers next week. Lowes home improvement is supplying unlimited free water and Weingartz Supply Inc. discounted equipment GM purchased for volunteers to use. \nGeneral Motors Co.
