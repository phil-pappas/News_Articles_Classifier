This was while he was aware of a finding of maladministration regarding the magazine. \nAccording to Maimane the DA will propose that Madonsela's report be tabled before Parliament, \"so that its recommendations can be properly monitored and enforced by the Portfolio Committee on Transport\". \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:31:06.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
