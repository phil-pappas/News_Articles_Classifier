Miners fell 2 percent, and analysts said falling metals prices may mean the BoE holds off from raising interest rates for longer. \n\"While strong growth and a tighter labour market have ... (prompted) speculation on the beginning of rate normalisation still this year, the renewed commodity price fall as well as persistent sterling strength are the wild cards for the BoE to hold policy until next year,\" said David Meier, senior economist at Julius Baer (Other OTC: JBARF - news ) . \nAmong top fallers, RSA fell 1.7 percent. Although RSA's own pretax profit beat expectations, Swiss rival Zurich Insurance, which is interested in bidding for RSA, said it would not overpay for the British insurer. \n\"In the short term, we expect RSA to trade based on the probability of a takeover bid, rather than fundamental valuation,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. \n\"Hence, on balance we expect the stock to trade down in the very short term.\" \nOther insurers rose, with Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) up 3 percent after strong results. \nAviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) also benefited from well-received earnings, adding 0.9 percent after posting forecast-beating half-year operating profit. \nBP and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) contributed to Thursday's falls as they traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts, down 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.
