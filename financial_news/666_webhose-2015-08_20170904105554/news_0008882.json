But how about only modeling a specific body part—a special feature of yours? The demand is highest for attractive hands, feet and legs, but there are also openings for unique ears, beards and even perfectly shaped bald heads. \nLinda Teglovic, president of Body Parts Models, Inc., says she looks at features such as skin tone and shape to assess potential models. Although many parts models find success because of their slender, manicured and unblemished parts, there is also a need for less classically striking parts. \nParts models can find work in all aspects of entertainment. Teglovic’s models have appeared in TV shows, movies, commercials and fashion magazines. A job can take the form of anything from a hand swiping a cell phone to a shot of feet in a foot powder commercial. “The concept is inserting a perfect part wherever it’s needed,” Teglovic says. Parts models themselves are as varied as their assignments. Gymnasts, dancers, attorneys and a jet propulsion engineer who works with NASA are all involved in the industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T22:43:17.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
