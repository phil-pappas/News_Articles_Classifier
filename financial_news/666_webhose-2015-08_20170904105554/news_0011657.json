It's the 1980s economic reform story all over again.\nWhich brings us back nicely to level 15 of national managing partner John Somerville 's KMPG tower where too much reform was never enough.\nCrazy little thing called reform We arrived minutes too late to hear the address by the best hair in journalism, the editor-in-chief of The Australian Chris \"The Tussock\" Mitchell . But all of his staff who were there agreed, it was a triumph.\n . @phillipcoorey and @apatrickafr on this morning's #reform2015 . No one killed yet in ideological battle for reform\n https://t.co/E24QJS35tT\n— Misa Han (@misahan) August 26, 2015 As was our boss's opening address.\n\"This is a summit we would rather not have to have,\" The Australian Financial Review 's editor-in-chief Michael Stutchbury told the assembled.\nBut from time to time, someone has to roll up their sleeves, sit in a professional services firm's sweaty offices and listen to the equivalent of seven back-to-back episodes of Q & A (with the exciting terrorist interludes cut out). Reader, it's called reform.\nIt began at lunch No, you can't just spend your life poncing about at lunch, we thought to ourselves as summit convenor, former Labor cabinet minister and now Financial Review columnist Craig Emerson made his opening remarks.\n\"Sometimes there's an idea whose time has come,\" Emerson said. \"And that idea of an actual reform summit came with lunch in a restaurant with Chris Mitchell.\"\nScrap the previous bit.\nThe genesis, said Emerson, occurred in a Surry Hills restaurant (an easy stroll from News Corps's NSW HQ) called \"Tabou\".\nActually, Emo embellished a bit. That French bistro went into voluntary administration in 2011 .\nIn its place on Crown Street is a modern Australian joint called \" Bishop Sessa \" – that's where the seminal reforming lunch occurred in March.\nBut to boil down another set of opening comments by fellow summit convenor ( and Menzies man ) Nick Cater : enough with the trivia.\nMischievous Glenn Stevens Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a remote Indigenous community in Far North Queensland for the week ( all jokes aside, that is very impressive ). And so the PM had to send his remarks over video.\nCleverly, the organisers did not run a scrolling Twitter banner thread underneath, saving the summit from any of Mark Scott 's recent headaches. Good call.\nNext up, Treasurer Joe Hockey , who revealed he has begun reading a book called No Ordinary Disruption . [ Tim \"Freedom\" Wilson , perhaps an idea for the next Aussies gathering of the George Brandis Book Club ?]\nAfter Hockey, one of the half dozen people in the running for the PM's job spoke – opposition leader, Bill Shorten .\n\"I believe in reform,\" Shorten said. \"But reform with purpose.\"\nAs the ALP leader made those remarks, we swear we saw mischief dance in the eyes of Glenn Stevens , the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nOur governor is nothing if not a stirrer.\n\"In your discussions I want to emphasise, that it's about growth. The word reform is a word that excites intellectual elites,\" said governor Stevens. \"But I don't know whether the word reform excites the general public quite so much.\"\nHats off to you, guv. But is it a coincidence that the Twitter hashtag #reform2015 has been trending on all seven continents over the last 24 hours? Just an observation.\nPower trio Next up, three of the most powerful voices in the room: Business Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone (who is also the chair of Telstra), Australian Council of Social Services CEO Cassandra Goldie (an increasingly influential voice in the national policy debate) and former ACT chief minister Kate Carnell , who is now the CEO of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\nCarnell also joined the subversive Stevens semantic bandwagon for \"growth\" and \"jobs\" over \"reform\". Canny.\nThe break through How the break through on reform came about depends on who you ask.\nSome lay the credit with CBA boss Ian Narev . At morning tea, the McKinsey consultant was certainly impressed by the Power Point presentation by Victoria University's Janine Dixon on capital dependency – as were we, once Narev explained it to us.\nOthers say the key moment was a back-and-forth by Orica director (and former Treasury Secretary) Martin Parkinson with ACTU President Ged Kearney in the tax session.\nOr maybe it was the inspirational speech given by Tasmania's Warwick Smith , or that joke John Brogden made in the fiscal session, or Jennifer Westacott 's closing comments, or when a newspaper editor (our lips are sealed as to whom) put a union leader in a headlock, or when that chap from the resources sector almost got into fisticuffs with that think tank guy.\nWe cannot say.\nSworn to secrecy That's partly because we have been sworn to secrecy.\nAnd also we may have slipped off to the pub over the road for some of the retirement income policy session and, if we're getting confessional, a touch of the one on workforce participation.\nBut what we do know is this: an important reform break through occurred on Wednesday.\nAnd, happily, it happened all before our print deadlines – even the Fairfax ones. So bloody well done to all involved.\nNow over to you, politicians.", "external_links": ["http://bishopsessa.com.au/", "https://twitter.com/apatrickafr", "https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-plans-to-go-where-no-prime-minister-has-been-before-20150823-gj5qiz.html", "https://t.co/E24QJS35tT", "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/qa-recap-lewd-tony-abbott-twitter-handle-could-put-the-show-back-in-hot-water-20150825-gj6sdt.html", "https://twitter.com/misahan/status/636355174798266368", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/reform2015?src=hash", "http://www.wehaveclosed.com.au/tabou-restaurant/", "http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/no_ordinary_disruption"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:05:58.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
