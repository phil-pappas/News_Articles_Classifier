What we were seeing then was the lack of understanding around financial planning on BEE shares,” Gradidge said during his presentation on BEE shares and financial planning.\nHow times have changed given that most multinational companies now offer BEE investments to historically disadvantaged individuals.\nToday, Gradidge-Mahura Investments manages BEE investments worth R500 million.\nGradidge said when embarking on any investments, one should factor in the ability of an asset class to generate an income; consider the tax implications of any investment; the ability of an investment to generate cash (liquidity); the size of the investment; costs of maintaining the investment; flexibility of investment; risk for the potential capital loss; and geared returns.\nGradidge said some BEE shares do have liquidity and others don’t. “Some BEE shares give returns and others not so much. Some of the shares are tax efficient if they give out big dividends.”\nWhen compared with other asset classes such as rental property, Gradidge said with BEE shares, there are possibilities of geared returns and transaction costs are low. He warns: “But they are very risky because of how they are structured.”\nWhen most BEE shares start they initially have debt locked into the scheme and with the potential of interest rates rising, the debt can run into billions, which can destroy a lot of value in the schemes.\n“BEE deals have debt to them and that allows you to see that if the company should dissolve then how much value will come to you as an investor,” Gradidge said.\nSome schemes have lock-in periods as to when investors into a BEE share scheme can sell their shares to other black investors.\nComparing share schemes, Gradidge said the move by MTN’s empowerment share scheme MTN Zakhele to the JSE’s BEE board will give it more liquidity. It currently trades on an Over The Counter (OTC) platform.\nThis is after the Financial Services Board issued a directive, which plans to put a stop to unlicensed exchanges – extending to OTC platforms. While Sasol Inzalo, Gradidge suggests, is sensitive to the share price of its holding company, petrochemical group Sasol Limited.\nThe big picture when it comes to investing in BEE shares, Gradidge recommends is don’t guess which will be the best opportunity, but investors should empower themselves with information. “Try to understand what asset you are buying. You can get decent returns over the long term.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T15:53:17.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
