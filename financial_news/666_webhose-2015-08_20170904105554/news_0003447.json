Managing director Brian Hodges said the restructure of manufacturing was close to completion and had positioned the company to gain volume when the market improves. \"The company's short-term strategy is to focus on growing high margin revenue through market share for consumable products and product development in preparation for an eventual uplift in global mining demand,\" Mr Hodges said. He said the foundry in India would contribute to further cost reductions in fiscal 2017, and it would recover any lost capacity as a result of the prior plant closures. Bradken, which made a net profit of $21.5 million for the previous corresponding period, said sales revenue dropped 15 per cent to $965.9 million and that it won't pay a dividend. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation met company guidance at $136.1 million, down 21 per cent on 2013/14. Bradken revealed in June that it was reviewing a merger proposal from the Magotteaux Group, a supplier of grinding equipment as well as construction and mining services. Capital expenditure for the year was $56.1 million, down from $57.6 million and net debt has been reduced from $US235 million at June 2014 to $US54 million. Bradken shares were 1.5 cents, or 1.35 per cent, lower at $1.09 at 1148 AEST.
