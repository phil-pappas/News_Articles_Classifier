Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nAustralia Post is seeking an almost 43 per cent increase in the price of postage stamps, while seeking a longer delivery period.\nCustomers could soon be paying $1 for a basic postage stamp, up from 70 cents, as well as higher charges for large letters, up to $3, depending on weight.\nAustralia Post has asked the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to approve the 30 cent price increase for standard letters and allow it two business days for delivery.\nIn its submission, released on Friday, the company also seeks to increase the cost of sending large letters over 125g and up to 250g, from $2.10 to $3.\nAdvertisement The charges equate to a 42.86 per cent increase, however, it's not proposing to increase the price of concession stamps (60 cents) or for Christmas cards (65 cents) and insists the \"basic postage rate remains affordable\".\nAustralia Post argues the volume of letters peaked in 2008 and has been falling steeply ever since.\n\"The advance of digital communications technology and mobile devices have led to the rapid substitution of letters as a form of communication,\" it told the commission.\nIn March, the federal government approved Australia Post's request to introduce a two-speed letter delivery service.\nThe regular service will be delivered two days slower than the existing timetable from January 4, 2016 with a separate priority service.\nThe company hopes to implement its new prices at the same time.\nThe commission will now assess the proposal, taking into account the level of increase, how efficient Australia Post is at managing its costs and whether its forecasts of falls in mail volumes are reasonable.\nThe watchdog is seeking submissions from stakeholders and members of the public, with a preliminary view to be released in November and a final decision due in December.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:47:41.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
