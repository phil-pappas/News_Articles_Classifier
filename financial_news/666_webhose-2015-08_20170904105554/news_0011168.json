Photo: Pat Scala\nPacific Brands says it has turned the corner and is on track to start paying dividends thanks to strength in its 100-year-old jocks and socks brand Bonds.\nInvestors embraced news that sales of bonds had Bonds had jumped 13 per cent in the past year and that dividends may be on the agenda for 2016. The company's shares posted a 12 per cent gain on Tuesday morning, briefly becoming the best performing stock on the ASX 200.\nChief executive officer David Bortolussi​, who sold of brands including Volleys, Dunlop and King Gee after taking charge last year, said earning had stabilised in 2015.\n\"Post all the divestment, the company really is in good shape now,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"It's a smaller, higher-quality, simplified business with much better growth prospects and a much stronger balance sheet.\n\"Absent of any major shocks, this will hopefully mark a turning point in our earning trajectory. After years of declining earnings, to now be in a position to deliver growth is very exciting.\"\nThe company reported its underlying net profit was up 5.1 per cent to $37.5 million, but still had a bottom line loss of $97.7 million due to non-cash impairment charges.\nSales of Bonds brand socks and jocks hit $357 million last financial year, a $41 million increase on the year before, with strong sales in baby wear, socks and its recently launched range of tights.\nIn-store sales rose by 25 per cent and online sales by 8 per cent in the 2015 financial year, while opening 18 new stores and seeing same-store sales jump by 20 per cent.\nThe company hopes to open 15 more Bonds stores in the coming year.\nMr Bortolussi​ said as well as being the source of strong sales, expanding its own stores gave Pacific Brands a platform to trial new products before introducing them to other retailers.\n\"It's getting increasingly difficult to wholesale brands, so that is important to our proposition,\" Mr Bortolussi​ said.\n\"It also allows us to design and develop products to bring to market with our wholesale customers in a fast and engaging way.\"\nWholesale sales of Bonds were flat, and its presence in low cost retailers challenging, Mr Bortolussi​ said, with customers often having trouble finding the product they wanted.\nDespite challenges there and success dealing directly with customers, Mr Bortolussi​ said he was determined to improve Bond's position.\n\"We have terrific relationship with Target, Big W, Best and Less and others that are very important to our business and are important to our customers,\" he said.\nSale of sheets brand Sheridan were up 15 per cent, but it wasn't all good new for the company, with sales slumping in other brands.\nRio brand underwear was down 22 per cent, hosiery down by 29 per cent, bra label Berlei down 2.7 per cent and Jockey down by 0.2 per cent.\nSales of Explorer brand socks was up by 2.8 per cent. Across the board, Pacific Brands' sales were up 5.4 per cent to $789 million.\nPacific Brands plans to hike up prices by about 10 per cent across its products in 2016.\nOne analyst, who asked not to be named, was surprised by Pacific's forecast for growth, because it was paying more for its overseas-made products due to Australia's weakened currency.\nMr Bortolussi​ said currency volatility did present challenges, but that Pacific Brands was well positioned to navigate it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T12:12:54.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
