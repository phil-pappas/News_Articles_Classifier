Ltd. Thursday, August 6, 2015 5:47PM IST (12:17PM GMT) Aliens Group Leaves Customers Pleased with its Project Aliens Space Station Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India \nAliens Group is rapidly progressing with the deliveries of its flagship project Aliens Space Station in Hyderabad. The customers are quickly occupying their homes in Tower 14 which has approximately 200 apartments and are more than delighted to move into their designer abodes. The apartments have been designed in collaboration with world renowned architects & designers and are on par with any international project in Dubai or Singapore. On talking to the home owners who have taken possession of their apartment , most of them appreciated the futuristic approach that had been incorporated by Aliens Group. One of the owners said, “I had been living in Australia from past ten years and recently came to Hyderabad for my job. I was accustomed to Sydney’s high standard of living and thus was very particular about the house I would choose to live in. My Penthouse in Aliens Space Station is exactly what I was looking for. With an indoor swimming pool and three floors of luxury, the house not for once lets me think of my apartment in Sydney. Space Station has all the avant-garde specifications and amenities. The apartment is airy and boasts of luxury in every nook and corner. The price at which I bought it seems like a bargain.” Another consumer, a scientist by profession, was more than surprised by the detailing of the flat finishes and the quality of construction. He said, “The structure is extremely strong and secure and has been built with the latest technologies. My work makes me travel often, but the biometric security systems and sensors installed in every apartment leaves me relaxed. Each apartment is designed with an abundance of glass that gives it a very clean and contemporary look. The builder has used high-tech glass manufactured with cutting-edge German technology that reduces heat by over 45%. This allows usage of glass and abundant natural light without having to worry about excessive heat and energy consumption in the summer.” The project has created a perfect blend of convenience and luxury with a special focus on incorporating technological advances in construction and creating smart automated homes. Aliens Space Station has evolved from a beautifully designed award-winning project into a vibrant community of aspiring young families, affluent professionals and NRI investors who all seem to be pleased to move into their dream home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:08:08.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
