Aggreko sees challenging 2016, warns on lower returns Reuters â€“ 7 minutes ago Price Change \nLONDON (Reuters) - Aggreko (AGGK.L), the world's largest power provider, said it expected trading in 2016 to remain difficult, with margins and returns set to be lower as it restructures under new management following a profit warning last month. \nThe British firm, whose kit powers major events and covers electricity shortfalls, said it had implemented a new organisational structure designed to improve its operational efficiency. \n\"2016 will be a year of change in the business with markets remaining difficult; margins and returns are likely to be lower in the short term,\" it said. \nAggreko said it had reorganised the business into two units - Power Solutions and Rental Solutions - which took effect at the beginning of this month. It has also identified cost savings of 80 million pounds to be made by 2017, which will be reinvested to support growth and help margins and returns. \nAggreko warned in July that pretax profit for the full year would be between 8 to 15 percent lower than market forecasts due to a slowdown in oil and gas and less favourable contract terms in Bangladesh and Yemen. \nThat put full-year profit before tax forecasts at between 250 million pounds to 270 million pounds (172 million pounds) at current exchange rates, compared with 289 million pounds a year earlier. Analysts have been expecting pre-tax profit of 294 million pounds for the full-year 2016, according to Reuters data. \n(Reporting by Li-mei Hoang; editing by Kate Holton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:59:33.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
