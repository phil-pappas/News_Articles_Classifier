However sales rose by just 5.1 percent to $13.1 billion, missing analyst forecasts for $13.2 billion. \nBMO Capital Markets described the results as \"slightly negative\" and said it was put off by the company's \"cautious tone\" on key issues. \nDisney trimmed its forecast for both domestic cable revenues and cable operating income over the 2013-2016 period, citing lower subscribers in the US and the impact of the strong dollar on overseas revenues. \nDisney chief executive Bob Iger said he was a \"realist\" in recognizing that viewing through smartphones and other emerging technologies is challenging the conventional cable business. However, he said Disney believes conventional cable will remain dominant for at least a few more years. \n\"We don't really see dramatic declines over say the next five years or so,\" Iger said. \"And therefore we aren't taking what I will call radical steps to move our product into over-the-top businesses to disrupt that business because we don't think right now it's necessarily the greatest opportunity.\" \nIger said he continues to have \"enormous confidence\" in sports-focused ESPN, which remains a \"must-have\" component of conventional cable packages and will also be in demand as consumers shift to other viewing systems. \nAnalysts also cited Disney executives' reticence to discuss financial expectations for the eagerly anticipated launch of the next \"Star Wars\" movie on December 18, which is expected to be a box-office blockbuster and a boon in sales of toys, games and other related merchandise. \nExecutives said they did not expect the Shanghai Disney theme park to be profitable until after 2016, adding that about half pre-opening expenses for the project will be booked in 2016. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) said the earnings report is \"likely to be perceived as a disappointment\" as Disney \"reduced guidance for fiscal 2016, seemed to talk down Star Wars expectations, and guided to the new park in Shanghai not contributing anything to (the) bottom line next year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T20:58:30.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
