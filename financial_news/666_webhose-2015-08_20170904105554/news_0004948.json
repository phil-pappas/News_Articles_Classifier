NYT Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett The political focus on the latest unemployment rate is inevitable. The policy focus should always be on the jobs of the future. Yet that is just where there's such an attention gap in Australia.\nSo even though words such as innovation and technology and disruption are being constantly translated into daily economic realities for businesses and the workforce, they still don't register much in the feverish national debate about what will drive economic growth. Even the Productivity Commission's recent report into the industrial relations hardly registered the revolutionary impact digital technology is already having – and will have, more and more, on the jobs market.\nAlex Scandurra is one of an increasing number of frustrated people in business who are determined to change that national conversation. That's partly to do with his role as chief executive of Australia's new not-for-profit fintech hub, Stone & Chalk, which officially opens in the Sydney central business district on August 25. Fintech is one of those terms with which everyone one will become increasingly familiar. It refers to the fast-changing technology around the delivery of financial services. The impact on consumers is already visible – and still only just beginning. From mobile payments to crowd funding to big (and small) data and the targeting of individual preferences.\nThe Committee for Sydney and the NSW government and a large number of corporates, have recognised that helping to build a vibrant fintech start-up community has significance well beyond the 200 or so start-ups that will become part of Stone &Chalk. The ideas is for physical proximity in one building to encourage the cross fertilisation and collaboration of ideas, experience, financing and technology, and access to expertise in managing the regulatory intricacies of establishing a business.\nBut Scandurra says there is far too little recognition that federal government support is also needed to encourage the type of new businesses and the entrepreneurialism able to fuel the development of new jobs and new industries. That's pretty significant when estimates suggest 40 to 60 per cent of current jobs will not exist within a few decades.\nShadow Treasurer Chris Bowen told the Financial Service Council's annual conference that this constantly accelerating change is why he backs the recommendation of the Murray inquiry for a permanent public and private sector collaborative committee looking at innovation in financial services.\nPath unclear So far, and despite the nearly $10 billion a year of federal government funding for research and development in Australia, how to take any national route to future growth and constant innovation remains very unclear.\n Some of this is due to the nature of economic and technological change. Who can predict what's coming? But it should still be possible for governments to understand some of the global trends and to manage what Scandurra calls \"leading from behind.\" That includes making sure businesses can easily apply, adapt and develop technology and new opportunities.\nScandurra holds up as the model, the conservative British government. Like Australia, Britain had a strong financial services sector – but no real fintech culture, at least until a few years ago. Yet through clever policy, David Cameron and George Osborne have quickly helped build London into one of the world's most important fintech centres – already employing about 45,000 people which is expected soon to increase to 100,000. This didn't come for free or develop by chance. It required key tax breaks on capital gains for investments meeting the criteria and tax credits for losses.\nBritain's corporate tax rate is already much lower than Australia's at 20 per cent and headed towards 18 per cent by 2022. But specific assistance for fintech came despite the emphasis on cutting spending and improving the budget bottom line. A re-elected Cameron is continuing them because of their obvious success. Britain also uses tax and other incentives to entice entrepreneurs from all around the world to relocate to Britain.\nBut more than just tax breaks, says Scandurra, London's emergence as a leader in the start-up culture has been defined by the deliberate political celebration of innovators and entrepreneurs, part of a huge British marketing campaign to \"make technology sexy\". He can't understand why the Australian government doesn't adopt a similar model of championing a new growth industry, particularly when it can leverage existing national strengths in financial services.\n'Not a level field' \"This is not a level playing field globally,' he says. \"Governments around the world are using smart policies to attract the sort of start-ups and new businesses and industries that they think can grow and innovate. Australia is not in a national bubble. It's in a global race. Hong Kong and Singapore are already following the UK example.\"\nNor is it just a potential triumph of fintech. As Scandurra says, achieving success in one area usually brings in other technology start-ups in its wake. It becomes part of a whole entrepreneurial culture. Think of terms such as edtech, healthtech, foodtech. A small but increasingly vibrant Australian start-up community is developing organically. Ian Pollari, head of banking at KPMG which is involved in Stone & Chalk, says this is coming from the bottom up but maintains Australia still needs a national champion to sell its success and potential.\nYet what remains most elusive is the idea of the national government, industry, entrepreneurs and regulators all working together to step up the pace here. If that doesn't occur, it doesn't mean change won't happen. It just means more of it will be created elsewhere and delivered digitally. No borders.\nJennifer Hewett attended the conference as a guest of the Financial Service Council", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-08-06T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:12:51.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
