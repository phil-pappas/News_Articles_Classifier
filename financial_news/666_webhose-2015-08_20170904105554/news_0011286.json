Gallagher launched High Court action against Towergate in March, claiming that the exodus had jeopardised attempts to take over its struggling rival. \nThe executives denied the claim, with Mr Ross claiming that he was put under surveillance after announcing his resignation . \n“As part of the settlement, Gallagher has agreed to the early release of David Ross, effective 1 November 2015, and Adrian Brown and Sarah Dalgarno, effective 2 September 2015. The parties will not be providing further details on these matters,” said Gallagher in a statement. \nChief financial officer Mark Mugge and retail broking director Janice Deakin have already joined the firm. \nTowergate has agreed to pay £4m this month and £4m in April 2016 to end all litigation. Highbridge, which led the group of unsecured creditors that took over the firm, will foot the rest of the £20m bill. \nTowergate’s interim chief executive, Scott Egan, is leaving next month to become finance director at RSA. His move was announced before RSA became the subject of takeover interest from Zurich. \nMeanwhile, the firm reported a pre-tax loss of £58m for the first six months of the year, as the new team works to stabilise the business following the rescue. Income fell 10pc to £184m, while expenses rose from 68pc to 79pc of income. \nThe company said the second quarter of the year had brought slower customer losses and improved new business sales. Towergate, built into a multi-billion pound business by acquiring hundreds of smaller insurance brokers, has been selling off some of its assets as part of the restructuring. \n“I am encouraged by the more recent small improvements in some of our key performance measures and look forward to working with the leadership team in tackling the challenges and opportunities which lie ahead,” said chairman John Tiner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:36:00.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
