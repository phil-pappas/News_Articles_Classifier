Szasz, who will join in September, served as design director for denim at PVH's Karl Lagerfeld and Tommy Hilfiger brands in Europe.\nThe appointments, first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, come after nine quarters of falling sales for Abercrombie as young customers lose interest in its logo-centric apparel.\nThe retailer is yet to find a permanent replacement for Michael Jeffries, who stepped down as CEO in December.\nThe company also hired Kurt Hoffman from Club Monaco, Monica Margerum from Kohl's Corp and Amy Sveda from Carter's Inc. Abercrombie appointed Stacie Beaver, who has been with the company for over 15 years in various senior roles, to the newly-created position of general manager for A&F womens.\nThe company's shares were down slightly at $19.10 in early trading on Tuesday. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen 33 percent this year.
