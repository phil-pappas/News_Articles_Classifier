Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson There's nothing like rubbing shoulders with winners to spread the aura of success just where it is sorely needed.\nIn the last question time of a torrid fortnight for the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott appeared entirely unbothered by Labor's probing of the Coalition's sore spots like submarines, Cabinet leaks about it \"functioning exceptionally well\" , unemployment rates, the path to indigenous recognition and GST on womens' sanitary products.\nIn fact, the government turned in its best parliamentary performance since returning from the winter break.\nAnd the reason is obvious. Abbott has remade himself into the \"Netball Prime Minister\".\n\"In the Abbott household, netball is a family passion. My girls played, my wife coached and I cheered, have long been a netball dad but today, I am very proud to be a netball PM,\" Abbott said on Thursday.\nPrevious positions Previously, he has called himself the Infrastructure Prime Minister, the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the Prime Minister for Women. They are all catchy titles but success is a long and difficult path.\nNetball is a different story and Australia's world champion women's netballers, the Diamonds, were in Parliament House to sprinkle a little of the magic dust and share their story of overcoming early defeat to beat the rest of the world.\n The Coalition's energised question time performance must have come as a surprise to Labor which had planned to cover off all the Coalition stumbles of the past couple of weeks.\nAlthough such a scattergun approach is rarely successful beyond, recording the Opposition questions in Hansard for posterity.\nThis time the Coalition had a much better plan. And it that bore so little resemblance to the second incidence of leaked ministers' talking points focused on a cabinet \"still functioning exceptionally well\", that it raises suspicions of an intentional leak to catch a mole.\nOn the defensive Abbott and his ministers went on the defensive – pivoting netball style – arguing that a CFMEU campaign protesting against the China Free Trade Agreement was nothing but barely concealed racism.\nWith little effect, Labor interjected and attempted to turn the focus to Abbott's poor record on captain's picks including union corruption royal commissioner Dyson Heydon and Michael Lawler, industrial relations umpire vice-president and partner of now disgraced union whistleblower Kathy Jackson.\n\"The CFMEU is running ads and making robot calls claiming that the free trade agreement is giving Australian jobs to Chinese workers. This is a racist lie,\" Abbott thundered.\n\"We know that the Labor Party takes the CFMEU's money but they should never take the CFMEU's dictation and, if they do take the CFMEU's dictation, the ghost of the white Australia policy will come back to haunt the Labor Party.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-20T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:44:28.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
