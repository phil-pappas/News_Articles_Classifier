Let Ugandans buy it.\" \nRaila who has been accused of the woes surrounding Mumias threatened to sue Majority leader Aden Duale for alleging he owes the company over Sh40 million. \nRaila said Duale should make a settlement within seven days for implying he was responsible for the collapse of the company and that \"he lacks integrity as a politician and is undeserving of his role as a leader\". \nHe said Duale portrayed him as a \"debt defaulter who unlawfully withheld from the people of Western province money which is rightfully due\". \n\"The words are also understood to mean that our client pursues a deliberate political strategy to impoverish the people of Kenya,\" Raila's lawyer Paul Mwangi said in a letter. \nMwangi said Duale's \"derogating language was malicious, insulting and meant to accentuate the harm and injury inflicted to Raila\". \nThis comes after Duale poked Raila over the Kenya - Uganda sugar deal, saying \"after being cagey and evasive, Raila has confessed that he owes the poor sugar cane farmers what he casually and callously terms a commercial loan\" Kenya \nAmerican singer August Alsina has denied ever collaborating on a song with Kenyan rapper Octopizzo. see more » Copyright © 2015 The Star.
