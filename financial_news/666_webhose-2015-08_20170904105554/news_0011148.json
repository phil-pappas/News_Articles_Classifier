ALY SONG \"The Australian market is still relatively cheap. The sell off is not reflective of our economy, it is investors concerned about China and its impact.\"\nHe said that the quality of his SMSF client portfolios had not changed.\n\"If the strategy was right, it's still right,\" he said.\n\"But if you are not in the market, perhaps it's time to get in.\"\n The big stock price movements have been triggered by concerns over the state of the Chinese economy and its sharemarket. The Shanghai market crashed 8.5 per cent on Monday, followed by further falls on Tuesday, but Beijing did not issue a new economic statement, causing concern to already startled investors.\nThe fallout is being felt in global markets.\nGraeme Colley, the director of technical services with the SMSF Professionals' Association of Australia, said most SMSF operators would have a diversified portfolio of investments comprised of about a third shares, one third cash and one third property-type investments.\n\"Those who are taking pensions out of their superannuation funds should have enough cash there to maybe last two or three years without drawing down on their equity,\" Mr Colley said.\n\"Good planning, as we've seen in the past, has ridden over all of these bumps.\n\"Don't be too rash. Companies will still be paying dividends; they certainly won't stop paying dividends.\"\nThe S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped below 5000 in early trade on Tuesday, before investors defied the poor start to trading, a negative overseas lead and another steep drop in Chinese stocks to be up around 2 per cent by lunch time.\nRick Maggi, of Westmount Financial, said that his SMSF clients tended to be \"buy and hold\" investors.\n\"My older clients, in particular, have seen this sort of thing before and are not panicked,\" Mr Maggi said.\n\"It's the bubble we all thought would burst in China. My instinct is that it will recover, and quite quickly.\"\nBryce Doherty, who is the head of UBS global asset management in Australia and New Zealand, said recent volatility reinforced the wisdom of diversification.\n\"As a vast generalisation, [SMSFs] tend to be just in equities and cash,\" he said.\n\"That means when there are these bumps in the market they are more heavily impacted than if they were completely diversified.\"\nHLB Mann Judd wealth management partner Michael Hutton said it was best to avoid selling stocks at a time like this.\n\"Stocks seem relatively cheap so it would be a shame to sell out at this point if you don't have to,\" he said.\n\"Also if you've got shares in dividend-paying companies, often their dividend stands up pretty well even when the share price goes down.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T13:55:13.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
