They are all offering impressive paintings by Australian blue chip artists, and for those with a spare million to spare, this is what is, or was, on offer.\nTo get more Money more often, why not follow us on Twitter? We’re @FairfaxMoney\nDavid Band's untitled bottle on a blue background.\nOn August 25 (last night if you are reading this on paper) Sotheby's​ auctioned a rare John Brack painting, Junior Latin American at the InterContinental in Sydney. Estimates were for a hammer price of between $1-$1.4 million\nAdvertisement This 1969 painting is part of Brack's acclaimed ballroom dancing series. In May 2007, Sotheby's Australia sold another in this series, The Old Time (1969), for $3.36 million, setting a new auction record for the artist and a world record for any work by an Australian artist at auction.\nAlso for sale was Sidney Nolan's The Emu Hunt (1949) with estimates of $600,000 to $800,000. This work has never been previously exhibited in Australia.\nSweet, by Frank Malerba.\nOn August 26 (tonight for paper readers) Deutscher and Hackett will be offering a 2007 painting by Jeffrey Smart, The Caravan Park , with estimates of $650,000 to $850,000, and a 1973 John Brack, Up in the Air , for $300,000 to $400,000.\nTheir sale is being held at the Cell Block Theatre in Sydney.\nAnd on Sunday, Mossgreen kicks in with Part One of the massive Peter Elliott Collection at the Museum of Contemporary Art's Foundation Hall at Sydney's Circular Quay. Featured are three significant Brett Whiteleys, the most expensive being The Arrival – A Glimpse of the Botanical Gardens , with estimates of $400,000 to $600,000. There's also a smaller and cheaper Jeffrey Smart, First Study for Bus Terminus , with estimates of $120,000 to $180,000.\nAn Unfinished Story by Jarek Wojcik.\nYou may gather from this highlights package that Brack, Nolan, Smart and Whiteley are now the only performers in this league, and you'll need $100,000 just to get your toe in the door. Not quite true. The work of a younger generation of artists is also available on the secondary market, sometimes for less than $1000.\nIn Melbourne last month, Leonard Joel held a sale of what they call Petite Contemporary Art, not a reference to the size of the work but to the price range.\nIt was an experiment, to see if people are interested in affordable contemporary art. Most of what was for sale was created this century by artists who are still alive. The sale is aimed at younger buyers with a $1000 to $2000 to spend instead of $1 million.\nRon Mueck's It's a Girl! key ring.\nWhat they are looking for is something bright, colourful and funky, that will look good on the walls of renovated apartments in the inner-city. \"This is their aesthetic,\" says Sophie Ullin, Joel's Head of Art.\nTypical of what they were after was the Ron Mueck​ It's a Girl! key ring, attracting a lot of interest and selling for $732 including buyer's premium. It was created by Mueck in 2006.\nMueck, born in Melbourne, famously started out making puppets for the Shirl's Neighbourhood TV series, but is now considered very much an international star. He sold his monumental sculpture, Pregnant Woman , to the ANG for $800,000.\nThat key ring could prove to be a good investment. Others that performed well were Jarek Wojcik's​ An Unfinished Story (sold for $2232 IBP), David Band's Bottle on Blue Background ($2976 IBP) and Justin Feuerring's​ Facial Forms (RED), which sold for $3294 IBP. These results were well above estimates, others sold for less.\nFrank Malerba's​ Sweet went for $610 IBP, another work by Wojcik sold for $160 on the hammer, the bargain of the night according to Ullin.\nShe says the response was strong enough for her to consider another sale at the end of this year, or early next year.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@FairfaxMoney"], "published": "2015-08-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:18:40.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
