Photo: Reuters\nThe People's Bank of China announces on Tuesday night that it is cutting one-year interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.6 per cent and lowering the ratio of deposits that Chinese banks must hold.\nThat move propels a bargain-hunting sharemarket bounce, and sends Wall Street almost 3 per cent higher. In the final hour of trading, investors sell again. Wall Street closes 1.4 per cent down.\nSharemarkets in Australia, China and elsewhere respond by gyrating like one-legged disco dancers.\nSharemarkets in Australia, China and elsewhere respond by gyrating like one-legged disco dancers. After falling as much as 86 points, the S&P/ASX 200 Index closes 36 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher. The Shanghai Composite Index weaves its way between a 4.2 per cent gain and a 3.8 per cent loss, and finishes 1.3 per cent down. Share futures also palpitate, but at the local close point to a Wall Street rally.\nTuesday night's moves by the People's Bank of China suggests it knows where the problem lies. Photo: AP\nConfused? The sharemarket volatility shows that you are not alone.\nAdvertisement Ted Samuels, an equity portfolio manager with Capital Group, a $US1.4 trillion fund manager, says one of his best pieces of advice in times like this is to turn off the TV.\n\"Listening to dire predictions is what causes people to pull out of the markets at exactly the wrong time,\" Samuels says, adding that \"patience has always won out\".\nRelax, this is not a repeat of 2008 and 2009.\nHere's a few things to latch onto in the volatility storm.\nThere are two market downturns. They are linked but need to be looked at individually.\nOne is in China, where a share price bubble is deflating. The Shanghai market has fallen about 38 per cent from its mid-June high.\nThere's collateral damage in that, for investors caught and for Beijing's plan to restructure and deleverage state-owned enterprises by floating them on a bull market, for example.\nHowever, China's sharemarket is not yet a crucial source of funds for the Chinese economy and only about one in 30 people in China owns shares. The sharemarket is still up about 35 per cent in a year, and after failing to defend the bubble, Beijing appears to be allowing the market to find a new base. It's the right call.\nThe second downturn is Western sharemarkets, including Australia's market.\nShares in the West were a bit above their long-term value when the latest downturn began, but were not in bubble territory.\nShare values in the West rested on expectations for global economic growth that, in turn, assumed that growth in China would stabilise around 7 per cent. Unexpectedly weak Chinese data challenged the status quo.\nWeaker growth in the world's second-biggest economy and biggest industrial commodity customer would pressure everything that drew on it, including global growth, commodity prices, corporate profit margins and share prices.\nShares in the West had fallen enough by Tuesday to produce blue chip dividend yields that attracted bargain hunters. Total shareholder returns include share price gains or losses. It is not clear yet whether China's growth scare is real or imagined.\nChina's Central Bank has the right target. Tuesday night's moves by the People's Bank of China does suggest that it knows where the real problem lies.\nThey were initially seen in the West as an attempt to shore up China's sharemarket after a 7.6 per cent slide that day. However, they are aimed mainly at China's economy.\nThe PBOC will need to do more. Its rate cut was overdue and cautious. The reduction in the bank deposit ratio also basically recreates liquidity that has drained from China's financial system in the past month or so. It is a monetary policy reset rather an easing.\nLike our Reserve Bank, the People's Bank has room to cut rates further if it needs to do so. It could also push the accelerator harder by cutting the bank deposit ratio again, injecting cash into the system. Beyond that, another blockbuster is held in reserve: direct spending by the government.\nThis is not the global financial crisis revived. This is not a repeat of 2008 and 2009 so far because there is no credit market contagion.\nThe confidence in China's ability to continue growing that BHP Billiton chief executive Andrew Mackenzie displayed on Tuesday when he announced BHP's profit result stemmed, in part, for example, from BHP's monitoring of credit markets and credit risk, in China in particular.\nThe group has seen no serious signs that the sharemarket downturn is morphing into a global crisis-style credit and liquidity squeeze that would affect its business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T05:31:04.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
