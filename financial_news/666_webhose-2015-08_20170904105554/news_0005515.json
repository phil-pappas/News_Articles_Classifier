Today it's the turn of Volta Regional Hospital and we are donating 100 pieces of mattress for the wards,' he noted in his address. \nHe added that 'most facilities in hospitals require upgrade and the supply of these mattresses will bring some relief and comfort to patients while they are on admission here'. \nDr. John Tampouri, Medical Director at the Volta Regional Hospital, who received the items on behalf of the Volta Regional Hospital, expressed profound thanks to adb for coming to their aid to help replace the worn-out mattresses in the wards. \n'We are overwhelmed by the gesture of adb, and we sincerely thank the bank for this support.
