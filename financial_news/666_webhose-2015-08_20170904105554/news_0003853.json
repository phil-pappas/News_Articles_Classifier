The office of the Senate pro temp is allotted more than US$1,483 million; office of the Speaker more than US$974, 000; the House of Senate over US$11 million while the House of Representatives carries bulk of the budget over US$23 million. At the moment, members of the House of Representatives make between US$8,000-US$12,000 monthly in salaries, allowances, communication and other benefits. Senators make around US$12,000 all bundled in categories such as salaries, allowances, communication and others. \nDespite high earning in an underdeveloped country by the lawmakers, they are still pushing for the state to continue to provide for them during their entire life passing the pension bill which will obligate the country to pay them during their entire life, even transferring to their spouses. Credible sources has informed FPA that the President is said to be unhappy with the extravagancy of the proposals lawmakers are seeking for themselves to the detriment of ordinary Liberians who are struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder. \nThe President, according to one source, is not against benefits for former elected officials but the extravagancy will simply put a lot of burden on the ordinary people, especially when there's nothing in it for them. \"It is unthinkable for anyone to harbor such outrageous pension thoughts,\" said the source speaking on condition of anonymity. \nFrontPageAfrica's legislative reporter at the Capitol Tuesday sensed jitters amongst lawmakers suggesting that something was amiss about the bill amid reports that President Sirleaf had already vetoed the legislation. Lawmakers remained tightlipped about the contents of a communication from the Executive Mansion Tuesday. The communication was part of a six-item agenda working tools for plenary of the Senate. \nHowever, the secretary of the Senate was not allowed to read the president's communication in plenary as Senator Geraldine Doe-Sheriff, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Executive opted for the communication to be diverted to executive. In legislative proceedings executive grants the lawmakers privacy to discuss issues behind closed doors. Lawmakers who attended the secret executive session were tight-lipped about what was discussed but sources have told FrontPageAfrica that the leadership of the two houses met in an urgent meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss the President's Veto of the bill. \nThe pension bill was proposed in 2013 to amend and restate an Act approved October 8, 2003 published by authority of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Monrovia, Liberia on October 17, 2003, providing pension and retirement for the President and the Vice President, President Pro-Tempore of the Liberia Senate and members of the Legislature, elected officers of the chambers of the National Legislature, the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Subordinate Courts of Liberia. \nThe amended law \nIn the amended Law former President who was elected and has served his/her term successfully and is not re-elected, thus retiring to private life, and who is not in any way gainfully employed by the government of Liberia, shall receive an annuity to be divided into monthly payments equal to fifty Percent (50%) of the incumbent president salary and twenty five (25%) of the incumbent president's Monthly allowances and benefits. \nIn addition to the cash immunity the former President according to the law shall have to be accorded the following benefits for the rest of their life including; full medical benefits for they and their spouse, full executive Protection service protection, Diplomatic passports, Duty free Privileges for all personal effects, two vehicles once every three years and at least 6 personal staff to include a chief of staff, a secretary, a cook, a Butler and (2) Drivers. \nUpon being re-elected or appointed to another position within Government the annuity payments granted the former President shall be suspended and if he/she qualifies for a second annuity upon termination of services with the Government, he/she shall be greater of the two. The law also calls for payment after death that spouse of a President who dies in office shall be paid 50% of the annuity and all benefits during their natural life. \"Upon the death of said spouse, all such monthly payments shall be paid in equal proposition to each of the minor children but in the case the spouse remarries all benefits shall cease. \nIn comparison to the U.S. whose constitution and laws mirrors Liberia, retired legislators in America are not entitled to any of the benefits Liberian lawmakers are asking. Under U.S. laws, members of Congress do not receive their full pay as a pension upon leaving office. That's the case whether they served one term or several. \nThe basic eligibility for collecting a pension is as follows, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress: CRS, June 13: Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at the age of 62 if they have completed at least five years of service. Members are eligible for a pension at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after completing 25 years of service. The amount of the pension depends on years of service and the average of the highest three years of salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member's retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary. \nUS Lawmakers Pales in Comparison \nThis, suggest that members of the U.S. House of Representatives -- who are up for reelection every two years -- would not be able to collect pensions of any amount if they only served one term. U.S. senators, on the other hand, serve six-year terms and would be able to collect pensions after one full term. But the pensions wouldn't be equal to their full salaries. \nIn contrast, Liberian lawmakers are seeking benefits right after losing an election. According to the Congressional Research Service, as of Oct. 1, 2013, there were 367 former members of Congress who had retired under the Civil Service Retirement System, the old system that was criticized for being too generous. Those members were receiving an average annual pension of $71,664. The pensions of the 250 former members who retired under the Federal Employees Retirement System, which began in 1987, average even less. Their average pension was $42,048 in 2013, CRS said. \nIn Liberia however, lawmakers are demanding lifetime support from government. In the case of the Speaker, Section 2.5.0 of the bill under Annuity for former members of the National Legislature proposes, that a former Speaker who was elected and has served his/her term successfully and is not re-elected, thus retiring into private life but no longer in the employ of the government should receive from the government an annuity into monthly payments equal to fifty percent(50%) of the incumbent speaker's salary and twenty five percent of the incumbent speaker's monthly allowances and benefits. \n\"In addition, he/she shall be provided the following for the remainder of his/her life to be paid by the State; which includes full medical benefits, full EPS protection, a Diplomatic Passport, Duty Free Privileges for all personal effects, a vehicle once every three years and at least five personal staff to include a secretary, a cook, a butler, and a driver. However, upon being re--elected or appointed to another position within government, the annuity payments granted the former Speaker shall be suspended and if he/she qualifies for a second annuity upon the termination of services with the government, he/she shall be granted the greater of the two.\" \nWhopping Benefits for Judges, Speaker, Deputy \nAdditionally, the bill proposes that upon the demise of the former speaker all such monthly payments and all other benefits shall be paid to the surviving spouse, and upon the death of this spouse in equal to portions to each of the minor children. In the case of the Deputy Speaker, the bill is seeking to give the retiree twenty five percent of his monthly allowance and benefits and other services for the remainder of his/her life after leaving offices. Those include full EPA protection, a Diplomatic Passport, Free Privileges for all personal effects, a vehicle once every three years and at least four personal staff, to include a Chief of Staff, a Secretary, a cook and a driver. Like the speaker, the bill recommends that upon the demise of the deputy speaker, all of his/her benefits should be pass on to surviving spouse. \nSimilarly, the bill also seeks twenty five percent allowances and benefits for the head of the senate with all the benefits as the speaker and the deputy speaker. Regarding former members of the national legislature, the bill suggests twenty five percent allowances and benefits after they are voted out of office for the remainder of their lives with full medical, diplomatic passport, duty free privileges for all personal effects. The bill is also seeking for continuance of benefits after the former lawmaker dies. \"Upon the demise of a former legislator, a one-time benefit payment shall be made to the surviving spouse; same to be determined by the national legislature.\" \nSimilar benefits apply to a retired Chief Justice, four associate justices. However, upon the death of the former Chief Justice or Associate Justices, fifty percent of all benefits should be paid to the surviving spouse; and upon the death of the spouse in equal portions of each of the minor children. \nSimilarly, a twenty five percent allowance benefits is also being sought for former judges of Subordinate courts in Liberia with a one-time death benefit payment being made to the surviving spouse to be determined by the judiciary. \nAmid speculations Tuesday about a presidential veto, the insensitive nature of the proposed legislation, political observers say that despite passage by both houses in the national legislature, the president's rejection is likely to appease angry constituents and force lawmakers back to the drawing board to fine tune a bill whose future appears to be mired in a state of uncertainty.
