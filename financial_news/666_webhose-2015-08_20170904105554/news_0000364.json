There is no room for taking a backward step when it comes to this unit. Aggression and attitude have become synonymous with Kohli and he wants this to be 'hammered' into the psyche of this team. Just before the start of India's one-off Test against Bangladesh a couple of months back, Kohli had said, \"I certainly believe in giving the team a chance to pick up 20 wickets. I am a big fan of playing five bowlers in a 6-5 combination.\"\nHis opinion has now been echoed by team director Ravi Shastri, who has assured that the five-bowler plan is going to be the way forward for India.\n\"It could be five, could be six or it could be four - whatever it takes to take 20 wickets. You have to do your best. You don't want to reach that position of the sixth bowler but you want ideally four if not five. The endeavour is to look to take 20 wickets so you can win matches. You have to think in that fashion,\" Shastri said ahead of the first Test against Sri Lanka, which gets under way on Wednesday.\n\"Five bowlers is the first option at all times unless you get a track where you know four bowlers are enough, where you know will turn from Day One or where it is going to seam and hoop all over the place from Day One. Then you might not need five bowlers. But (we will apply) the Bangladesh formula as much as we can. It will be an added responsibility for the batsmen, but it also gives you a chance to stay in the contest if you are bowled out quickly,\" he added.\nThere is no room for half measures in this side. Previous skipper MS Dhoni was apprehensive about going into the match with pacy but wayward bowlers like Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron, relying more on the steady Bhuvneshwar Kumar. That is no longer the case as Bhuvneshwar's lack of pace means he isn't in the scheme of things on the slow wickets of the subcontinent.\nIshant Sharma, with his devastating spell of 5/23 in the practice match in Colombo, might well have bowled himself into the side. He could take his place alongside Aaron for new-ball duties. Bhuvneshwar and Umesh, in fact, hardly got a bowl on Monday after being pushed to the sidelines in the training session.\nShastri was seen spending a lot of time with leg-spinner Amit Mishra, discussing flight, pace and lengths to bowl on Lankan tracks. \"We haven't decided if we'll go in with a three-spinner combination. The pitch has been under the covers for a very long time and we don't yet know what kind of grass cover it has,\" he said.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Virat Kohli,Varun Aaron,Ravi Shastri,Ishant Sharma,Amit Mishra ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:27:06.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
