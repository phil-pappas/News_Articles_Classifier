Photo: Jesse Marlow\nRubber products group Ansell this week reported that its earnings improved by anywhere between 11 per cent and 20 per cent depending on which metric took your fancy.\nBut right at the end of the report were the numbers that spooked punters: due to \"ongoing uncertainty\" earnings a share for the current year were forecast at $US1.05 to $US1.20, compared with $US1.23 for the year just completed.\nThe market response to this news was short, sharp and nasty: the scrip fell from $24.75 to as low as $19.42 in one day.\nEnter three of the group's non-executive directors, chairman Glenn Barnes and Peter Day who stepped up to the plate and paid $21.73 and $20.89 respectively for shares. John Bevan waited a day or two longer and paid $20.63.\nTwo of them are marginally ahead of the game at this early stage: the shares closed yesterday at $21.24.\nElsewhere among buyers, Lim Kim Hai, executive chairman of Regional Express, continued buying shares in the regional airline.\nLast month the group changed its earnings guidance from a \"moderately positive\" outcome from tailwinds and headwinds to a \"moderately negative\" impact.\nThe scrip fell from $1.02 to as low as 88Â¢.\nRobert Bryant, until recently the chief at Money3, topped the sellers' table when he sold about 16 per cent of his stake.\nMr Bryant suddenly \"retired\" from the money lender's board last month.\nHe is requisitioning a meeting aimed at throwing Wilson HTM staffer Vaughan Webber, Miles Hampton and lawyer Bettina Evert off the board.\nMr Bryant wants shareholders to vote him and Patrick Tapper on to the board.\nThe battle won't be easy: he is up against the power behind the throne at Money3, Alexander Waislitz and his Thorney group, which holds about 9 per cent of the capital.\n*The reporter owns MNY scrip.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:42:16.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
