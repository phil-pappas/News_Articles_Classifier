Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray\nChinese authorities have unleashed a regulatory blitz following one of the worst stock-market routs on record, detaining a financial journalist for \"spreading rumours\" and four executives from Citic Securities for alleged insider trading.\nCitic's managing director, Xu Gang, and three other executives have admitted insider trading, according to the state-run newsagency Xinhua, causing shares in China's biggest brokerage to slump almost five per cent.\nMeanwhile, Caijing journalist Wang Xiaolu expressed \"remorse\" for fabricating a story and causing chaos on the stock market in a confession that was broadcast on national television but has been criticised by advocates of market reform.\nAt the same time, an official at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, Liu Shufan, reportedly admitted to taking bribes from a listed company in return for securing approvals.\nFar from being an effort to clean up the Chinese stock market, which has for years been likened to a casino, analyst Fraser Howie said the dramatic response from authorities was \"more like a witch hunt.\"\n\"This is a case of let's punish someone because the market has fallen,\" said Mr Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism .\n\"There is no indication this is a genuine case of the regulator turning over a new leaf.\"\n \"The government's embrace of market reforms seems tenuous at best,\" he said.\nConfusion about the government's intentions regarding the stock market has fuelled volatile trading in recent weeks. The benchmark Shanghai Composite dropped 25 per cent in the five days to Wednesday, sparking turmoil on global markets, before rallying at the end of last week.\nThe index also pared losses in early trade Monday to close less than one per cent lower at 3205.99, amid reports of government buying ahead of this week's military parade in Beijing.\nThe 70th anniversary of World War II's end is being dubbed domestically as a celebration of the \"victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japanese aggression.\" It will involve 12,000 soldiers marching through the capital on Thursday and be presided over by President Xi Jinping, allowing him to show off the country's military might.\nBut it comes amid great uncertainty regarding the country's economic outlook and nervousness among global investors and China's trading partners following the recent sharp declines on the stock market.\nCaijing's Mr Wang wrote in an article on July 20 the CSRC was considering withdrawing its multi-billion dollar support for the market after it had pumped an estimated $US200 billion into propping up shares earlier that month.\nThe CSRC denied the story at the time but on August 14, the regulator did announce it would wind back its direct intervention in the market, stepping in only when there was \"unusual volatility\" or \"systemic risk.\"\nWhile a crackdown on insider trading is generally welcomed, analysts questioned the timing of the Citic investigation. China's regulator has also flagged new rules for high frequency trading but most of its actions are targeting activity on the market since it has been falling. No actions have been taken against trading during the year to June 12, when the Shanghai Composite more than doubled.\n\"The government wants to regulate the market but they are sending out a scary signal to global investors that the rules can change overnight,\" said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore.\nAs a result, the government's response could complicate China's inclusion in the MSCI global emerging market's index or the yuan's chance of being added as the world's fifth reserve currency.\n\"China should be in any global index and any global currency basket but the problem is the volatility is so huge and it is not market-driven behaviour,\" said Mr Zhou.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-08-31T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:14:26.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
