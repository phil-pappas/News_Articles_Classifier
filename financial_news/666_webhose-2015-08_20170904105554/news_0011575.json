MTN is a very credible organization that will do all that it takes to give our customers quality service and we do that with the highest ethical standards\" \nIn an interview, he stated that, “MTN we are not stingy at all, as you see in our monthly filling promotions, we are giving out houses, cars, generators, phones and others. Am not sure any stingy organisation will do all that.” \nHe added that MTN is giving back to communities in many ways through events like the MTN Hit Maker, MTN soccer academy, MTN Heroes of Change as well as the MTN Ghana Foundation. \nAccording to him, It is not expensive using MTN because it is affordable and cheaper with the fastest 3.75G network. \nBonus and get 100 percent bonus credit, EVD unit transfer you get 100-percent bonus, 30percent bonus on Mobile Money top-up, so I don’t see any reason that we are stingy. It is the only network that is providing the best of care and it is the network that is ensuring that the life of customer is a whole lot. \nAbubakar Mohammed indicated that the forum seeks to bring MTN services and other developments closer to its customers. \n“And so when we meet on such platforms we educate them on our products and services. Promotions we are running and also create the opportunity for them to ask questions,” he noted. \nHe added that, “Most of them do not know about our services or they don’t even use it so this platform will create the opportunity to educate them in order for them to appreciate some of our services.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T23:04:05.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
