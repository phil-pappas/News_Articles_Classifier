The reason that I’m pointing out this event is because arts and culture are what shape our society. All of the people out there who believe that all Pakistani people are bad really need to open their hearts and minds, as we are all members of one race, the human race. That being said, as you view the current day culture in Brooklyn, NY on this new drama series “Love is Blind” , you will realized just what the producers were trying to show their viewers. \nThe Pakistani characters in the new series see life differently, and the creator of “Love is Blind”, Wanly Florexile, includes into the episodes a lot of what Muslim Pakistani culture practices. For example in the first scene of Episode 1, a show entitled “The Setup”, you see a Pakistani Muslim in prayer in a lovely temple. It is beautifully set, and the background sounds are also fitting. The music that plays is actually titled “Beautiful Islamic – Call to Prayer (Azan)” by Adhane. The director’s awareness makes this, the very first scene, set the tone of religion from the beginning, something that the New Center for Pakistani Culture in Brooklyn is also making aware to the public every day. The music in that episode, by the way, was set up and composed by William “iBeat” Bookman. \nThe main Pakistani character in the new YouTube series “Love is Blind” is the youngest one. Her name is Fatimah, and she is a high school student about to graduate. Fatimah is in love with a Haitian young man named Robert, and Robert loves her just as much. As we all know, interracial relationships in America of any kind will always have haters out in society. This is because there are many people out there who believe that one race should only date or marry that same race. Director Florexile shows just how deep Pakistani culture is as he displays Fatimah’s situation to the viewers as the episodes continue. As the shows progress, you wouldn’t believe the hurt and pain the young lady goes through that she simply does not deserve from society. \nRobert cares about her and can likely relate to what she is going through with racism being a Haitian American himself. But, the thing he likes the most about her is how unattached to money she is, and how she is always trying to get him to save his. What is one of the most hurtful things Fatimah is going through also stems from Pakistani Muslim culture, planned marriage. Her parents are doing everything they can to make her stop liking Robert and hook up with this much older man whom she doesn’t even know. But, as the title of the new YouTube series indicates, Love is Blind, and the younger people of our generation don’t see color or culture as a barrier to happiness.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:48:59.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
