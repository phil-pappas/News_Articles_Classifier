Louise Kennerley by David Oon If the idea of property development in a self-managed super fund sounds outrageous, you may be shocked to know there is no blanket ban on it. Rather, like many unusual types of investments a SMSF can make, the key to compliance is on how the investment occurs. The focus here is on the most common pitfalls and some strategies to address them.\nThe broad goal of the superannuation rules is to ensure that assets in super are preserved and protected for retirement. This by itself does not appear to limit property development. It is the actual manifestation of the rules that places limits on the ways property development can occur.\nIf the many superannuation rules are complied with, the arrangement should not fall foul of the law. Extreme caution should be exercised before and during, since it can be easy to contravene the law without realising. Trustees should seek professional advice in advance. Also, while it may sound obvious, it is worth remembering that the practical or easy way to go about SMSF property development may not actually comply with the law.\nA common objection to property development in a SMSF is the suggestion that a SMSF is not allowed to run a business. This is a misunderstanding. As long as the broader rules are complied with and the SMSF's trust deed allows it, a SMSF can run a business. The Australian Taxation Office has even contemplated this in TR 93/17.\nArm's length Broadly, superannuation funds are required to deal at arm's length with other entities. It is best practice to retain objective evidence (such as Quote: s from unrelated sources) to be able to demonstrate that what occurred was at arm's length. Also, where there is a dealing with another party that is not arm's length, and the income of the SMSF is inflated beyond what would have been arm's length, this gives rise to non-arm's length income.\nNon-arm's length income is taxed at the highest marginal rate, even where the fund is in pension mode.\nAn extremely important question is whether a SMSF is able to borrow to fund property development. At the risk of oversimplifying the law, a SMSF cannot do this. With some limited exceptions, a SMSF is only permitted to borrow to acquire a single piece of real estate. The borrowing must meet the strict criteria for a limited recourse borrowing arrangement (often referred to as a bare trust arrangement).\n The SMSF cannot borrow to fund improvements to the land. Also, while the loan to the SMSF is in place, the real estate cannot be fundamentally changed.\nSome examples of a fundamental change would be a subdivision, the construction of a building on what was originally vacant land or a residential building being changed to a commercial building. These would all give rise to problems if the loan was still in place.\nIf a SMSF needs to borrow to acquire the real estate, this usually prevents any property development taking place before the loan is paid off. The position is much more flexible if the SMSF has the cash to buy land and develop it without borrowing.\nRelated party providers SMSF members who are builders or otherwise involved in property development may want to use their own services in a SMSF property development, but trustees are not allowed to receive remuneration for services performed in relation to a fund.\nThere are some exceptions to this, such as where the trustee is qualified and licensed, and carries on the same services in a business that is done for the public. Secondly, SMSFs are not allowed to acquire assets from related parties (such as building materials that become the SMSF's property when they are affixed to the land). However, there are some special strategies that aim to address this.\nWhere a SMSF has one or more unrelated joint venturers (an entity outside the family group may be unrelated), some choose to have the development occur in a unit trust or a company, with the SMSF being one of the \"investors\". In certain special circumstances, this can allow borrowing at the unit trust or company level, without needing a limited recourse borrowing arrangement in the SMSF.\nHowever, having a structure like this can mean a unit trust is taxed like a company under special tax rules. Also, ensuring that joint venturers are not related in the relevant sense involves a thorough consideration of detailed associate laws.\nParties such as accountants, banks and auditors may need to be convinced that a proposed property development complies with the law. Expert advice can sometimes assist here. However, where a commercial lender is involved, it can be difficult to achieve certainty that they will lend.\nProperty development in a SMSF is only for those with a steadfast commitment to working with their advisers to comply with the stringent rules.\nDavid Oon is a senior associate with DBA Lawyers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:29:02.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
