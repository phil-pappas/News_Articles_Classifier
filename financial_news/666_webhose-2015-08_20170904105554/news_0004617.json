Surely O’Sullivan is exaggerating: Payrolls have risen at an average of 211,000 per month so far this year, a strong trend but nowhere near the rapid pace of more than 300,000 (or even 400,000) a month that was recorded at various times during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.\nHigh Frequency Economics Jim O’Sullivan But, O’Sullivan counters, job growth in the past was boosted by the tailwinds of extremely strong growth in the labor force, as first the Baby Boomers grew up and then as tens of millions of women joined the work force for the first time. Yes, jobs were increasing at 3% to 5% per year, but so was the labor force.\nToday, nonfarm payrolls have risen 1.8% so far this year, about three times as fast as the growth of the labor force. The difference between the payroll growth rate and the labor-force growth rate is among the largest ever seen.\n“If we keep getting 200,000 per month, the unemployment rate will keep falling,” O’Sullivan said.\nGrowth in gross domestic product “remains disappointing and global developments continue to threaten, yet the labor market keeps improving,” O’Sullivan said. GDP has been strong enough to drive down the unemployment rate by nearly a full percentage point in the past year, which is also among the largest declines seen in the past 30 years.\nAnd, with the trend in inflation tame, the continuing improvement in the labor market means that Federal Reserve officials “will start tightening as soon as the next meeting, as they should,” he said. They will go slowly, which means monetary policy will be accommodative for a long, long time yet to come.\nO’Sullivan is the most decorated economic forecaster in the history of our monthly contest, which began in 2003 as a way to reward those who are best at forecasting the nearly daily deluge of data, such as jobs, inflation, housing, manufacturing orders, and sales, that move markets the most.\nO’Sullivan has won our monthly contest a record 14 times, and has been the Forecaster of the Year seven times, including the past four years in a row. He’s leading the pack for his fifth straight title in 2015.\nAlso read: How Jim O’Sullivan beat odds of 3.7 million to one\nO’Sullivan’s forecast Actual* ISM 53.0% 53.5% Nonfarm payrolls 215,000 223,000 Trade deficit -$42.0 bln -$41.9 bln Retail sales 0.1% -0.3% Industrial production 0.3% 0.3% Consumer price index 0.3% 0.3% Housing starts 1.170 mln 1.174 mln Durable goods orders 4.5% 3.4% Consumer confidence 99.5 90.9 New home sales 530,000 482,000 Gross domestic product 3.5% 2.3% * Subject to revisions Against his 47 rivals in the July contest, O’Sullivan had the most accurate forecasts on five of the 11 indicators we tracked: Industrial production, the consumer price index, new home sales, housing starts, and the trade gap.
