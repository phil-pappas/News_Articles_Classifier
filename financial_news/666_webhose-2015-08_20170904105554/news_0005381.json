The software package helps engineers, architects, and other design professionals to digitally prototype products prior to production, and draft industry-specific products. The automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial machinery, and electrical and electronics industries use CAD solutions. These solutions enable end-users to digitally prototype their products before production. \nThe automotive industry accounts for the highest number of R&D facilities in India, most of which are located in cities, such as Pune and Chennai. These facilities use CAD solutions to design various auto components, parts, and vehicles. We expect the R&D investment to continue growing during the forecast period, as vendors, including Maruti Suzuki, are increasingly investing in the setting-up new R&D facilities in India. \nAccording to the report, CAD solution providers are increasingly focusing on tier II and tier III cities of India. Places, such as Surat, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Jamshedpur, Nagpur, and Pune, are experiencing high growth in the manufacturing sector, which is increasingly employing CAD solutions for product designing. \nHigh implementation cost of CAD has led to several companies in India turn away from the technology. The implementation is also a lengthy process, and so the ROI realization, resulting in a decline in demand for CAD in India. \nKey Topics Covered", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:29:02.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
