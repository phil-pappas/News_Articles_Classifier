The stock was the biggest drag on the Dow and the S&P. \nChinese stocks plunged again, reigniting fears that Beijing may be intent on a deeper devaluation of the yuan and pushing oil prices and industrial metals, including copper, to near six-year lows. \nAll 10 major S&P sectors were lower. The steepest fall was the energy index's 0.63 percent decline, led by Exxon's 1.3 percent decline. The index was down for the fourth straight session. \nThe materials index was down 0.6 percent, with Freeport-McMoRan's 3 percent fall leading the declines. The index previously fell as much last week when China devalued the yuan. \nAt 13:09 p.m. EDT (1709 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 39.48 points, or 0.23 percent, at 17,505.7. The S&P500 was down 6.07 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,096.37 and the Nasdaq composite was down 25.55 points, or 0.5 percent, at 5,066.15. \nDow component Disney fell 1.8 percent after Wells Fargo cut its rating on the stock and also on the stock of five other media companies, including CBS. Disney was the second-biggest drag on the Dow and S&P. \nThe market weakness was partially offset by strong results from Home Depot and data that showed U.S. housing starts rose to a near eight-year high in July. \nHome Depot rose as much as 3.4 percent to a record high of $123.80 and gave the biggest boost to the Dow and the S&P 500. \nHome improvement companies and home builders are enjoying a spot in the sun. D.R. Horton, Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL - news ) , Lennar, PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM - news ) and KB Home (NYSE: KBH - news ) all rose between 1 and 3 percent following the data. \n\"The good data on housing is certainly helpful since its 4 percent of the U.S. GDP,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's something we know the Fed looks at relative to not only its impact on employment and things residual to the housing market but as well as to the wealth effect of homeowners.\" \nIn other retail news, TJX, jumped 6.7 percent to a lifetime high of $76.43 after it reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly comparable store sales. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,057 to 933. On the Nasdaq, 1,835 issues fell and 858 advanced. \nThe S&P 500 index showed 40 new 52-week highs and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 63 new highs and 66 new lows.
