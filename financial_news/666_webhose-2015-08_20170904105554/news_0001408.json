Senator Nick Xenophon wants to torpedo Pyne out of his seat. by Simon Evans Emma Kaines is the store owner of bedroom furniture retailer and manufacturer Out of the Cot in the leafy Adelaide suburb of St Morris, which operates about 100 metres from the electoral office of prominent South Australian federal MP Christopher Pyne.\nShe says this week's announcement by Prime Minister Tony Abbott that Adelaide would get a $39 billion shipbuilding program is an important shot in the arm for the state.\n\"I think the actual psyche of people really needed that,\" she says. The view of the broader family behind the business is universal. Father Stefan Pacula says its important for perceptions. \"The reality might be different, but it's a real fillip for confidence,\" he says.\nFurther up the road is St Morris Upholstery, run by the Fritsch family. Sam Fritsch says the deal to build frigates in South Australia is a plus for the economy but it's a shame the Abbott government has presided over the demise of the car manufacturing industry.\n\"As a South Australian I do feel sad that the car industry is ending,\" Fritsch says.\nAnother South Australian, independent senator Nick Xenophon, wants to do some ending of his own. He is hellbent on targeting South Australian federal iberals in the next federal election if Abbott continues to renege on a promise made before the 2013 federal election to build the next generation of 12 submarines at the ASC facility at Osborne, near Port Adelaide.\nXenophon, who began his political career as a No Pokies MP in state politics before transferring to the bigger national stage as a staunch backer of South Australia's interests, has a big following and says he's going through an extensive process to choose the best possible candidates to run in various seats as part of his Nick Xenophon Team stable. \"We're going through a very exhaustive process,\" Xenophon tells AFR Weekend . He also said the level of detail in the shipbuilding announcement is worrying and he wants the best possible outcome on all fronts for his home state. \"The credibility of the Abbott government is questionable\".\nHe is regarded by political experts as a real chance to unseat Pyne.\n Pyne, the federal Education Minister, has won the seat eight times and held it since 1993. His is one of three seats held by federal Liberals in South Australia which are regarded as vulnerable, the others being Hindmarsh and Boothby. Much of Pyne's electorate comprises affluent suburbs in traditional Liberal territory although it does encompass workingclass suburbs such as Holden Hill and Gilles Plains. A union poll conducted by ReachTel of 739 residents in late July found that a Nick Xenophon candidate would attract 38 per cent of the primary vote.\nProfessor Clem Macintyre, head of the school of politics at the University of Adelaide, says Xenophon is a real threat to Pyne's hold on power in the seat of Sturt, which is held by a margin of 10.5 per cent. \"That's why we had a cabinet meeting in Adelaide this week,\" he said, referring to the three-day visit from Abbott and his senior ministers.\n\"Nick Xenophon is a very effective local campaigner\".\nDirecting preferences away from the federal Coalition would likely deliver the seat to the Nick Xenophon Party, and this is something the Labor Party would relish even though it may be damaging to them in the future.\n\"It's a bit of a devil's dilemma for Labor,\" Macintyre says.\nBut he said there is a \"degree of resentment\" about the Abbott government having been bad for South Australia which will be difficult to remove, but this would likely change if there were an announcement about the submarines being built in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:28:41.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
