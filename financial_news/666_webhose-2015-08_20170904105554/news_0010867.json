Fourth-generation technology, which went mainstream worldwide around 2010, enables users to watch videos and download big documents on their phones. \nIn an apparent bid to placate Erdogan, Turkish officials had dubbed the technology being auctioned as 4.5G, but subsequently dropped the term. Wednesday's tender is a sale of mobile spectrum used all over Europe for 4G, which allows for up to 10 times faster mobile broadband than 3G technology. \nThe three operators also each posted the highest bids in subsequent less costly tenders for higher bandwidths, Yanik said. \nGenerally, lower bandwidths offer faster data speeds but over a shorter distance and are useful for densely populated areas, while larger bandwidths offer greater coverage but less speed for rural areas. \nThe fifth-generation technology Erdogan craves remains years away from formal definition and is not expected to be ready for widespread commercial rollouts until 2020.
