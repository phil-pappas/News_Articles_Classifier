We’re @FairfaxMoney\nAt the same time, in the small caps universe, which is Under the Radar's speciality, there have been numerous examples of stocks which have produced results that are better than expected. In some cases, we've seen results that were not that good, but which investors were willing to overlook in the context of previously discounted expectations.\nAdvertisement It says a lot that shares in Maca, a mining services company, rallied about 2 per cent this week after its profit result. This was a day when there was more red ink than a Churchill Latin essay.\nJust look at another contractor, UGL, whose stock is up 12 per cent as I write. Less than two years ago this company had a multi-billion dollar market cap but now finds itself in our universe (mind you, its share price decline included $500 million capital return).\nYou might be forgiven for thinking the company had a poor result when you read that it made a headline loss of $236.4 million.\nLooking behind the myriad write-offs and one-offs and the company's \"underlying\" earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $47.5 million was in line with guidance, the company has more cash than debt and its outlook is positive. UGL said that it is \"on track to achieve FY16 guidance of $2.3 billion revenue and 3 per cent EBIT margin\".\nInvesting in shares is all about looking ahead. Speaking of which, other companies that have performed well this reporting season include the retailers Nick Scali, Oroton and JB Hi-Fi.\nAs we have said in the past, consumer-facing companies in this country as benefiting from above average population growth.\nThe bigger point, however, is that the ASX is one of the most concentrated share markets in the world, and events this month show that it pays to diversify your portfolio into the small end - something that is often overlooked.\nThe total value of companies listed on the ASX is about $1.3 trillion and half of this consists of the biggest seven or eight companies – including the big banks, BHP, Telstra, Wesfarmers and CSL.\nOf the 2200 odd companies listed, about 80 per cent or 1800 are under $300 million in market capitalisation, which is our universe.\nAs we've argued for some time, big companies have been trading at higher than their long-term average earnings multiples. This week they are being sold off as part of an equities asset class.\nAt the open in the US on Monday, almost without exception they were thrown out with the bathwater.\nThis sort of indiscriminate selling has affected big and small caps alike and will create some of the great opportunities of the next bull market.\nWe aren't saying that the sell-off is over yet, but we have sharpened our focus dramatically and we relish the investing possibilities we expect to see in the next few months.\nGet Free Access to Under the Radar Report.
