That's a 32% rise in usage over the past ten years, Pulse reports; in 2005, there were only 16.1 monthly transactions. Americans spend, on average, $9,291 annually with their debit cards, up from $7,807 ten years ago. Interestingly, cash withdrawals using a debit card are down, from 3.4 withdrawals per month in 2005 to 2.0 withdrawals per month in 2014. That downward trend in withdrawals may be due to increased usage of mobile app payments in an economy where cash transactions are on the decline. Even so, usage of debit cards is rising, and that growth should continue, experts say. Currently, there are about 50 billion debit card transactions in the U.S. on an annual basis, as debit card use grows widely -- more so than credit cards, Pulse reports. \"The past decade saw a major shift in consumer preference to paying with debit cards, which accelerated after the 2008-2009 recession,\" said Steve Sievert, executive vice president of marketing and communications for PULSE. \"We believe there is still opportunity for debit growth, considering that consumer use of debit for smaller purchases is rising, and the average active debit card is used about five times per week.\" \"Consumer use of debit has been nothing short of remarkable,\" adds Tony Hayes, a partner at Oliver Wyman, which co-authored the Pulse study. \"Debit has steadily gained wallet share as consumers shift their spending to this payment type. The use of debit for small-ticket purchases is particularly noteworthy, where one-third of all debit transactions are for less than $10 - purchases that historically would have been made with cash or not at all.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T17:34:54.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
