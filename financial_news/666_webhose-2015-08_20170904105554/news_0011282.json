Dean Osland Share on twitter by Amanda Saunders Newcastle, home of the world's biggest coal port, has joined the global fossil fuels divestment push after the city's council voted overnight to exit holdings in the big four banks if they continue to fund fossil fuels projects.\nAbout 80 per cent of the City of Newcastle Council's $270 million investment portfolio is invested in the big four banks, mostly through term deposits. Those holdings are spread about evenly across the big four.\nBut after the council passed a motion overnight Tuesday, six votes to five, it will dump holdings in the banks for more \"environmentally and socially responsible\" financial institutions whenever its term deposits come up for renewal.\nIt will be done only if the rate of return is comparable with the council's holdings in the big four, and the alternative has the same credit rating.\nLabor councillor Declan Clausen, who introduced the motion after winning office in a by-election this year, said that while Newcastle was the world's largest coal-exporting port, it was \"important that the city looked at diversifying [its] economy\".\n'Writing is on the wall' He said the coal industry in NSW \"understands the writing is on the wall, coal is not going to be a leader long into the future\".\nThe divestment commitment is part of a review of the council's investment policy on Tuesday night.\n \"I noted our investment policy didn't have any criteria in it about ensuring that investments were environmentally and socially responsible, it was entirely silent on the matter,\" Mr Clausen said.\nNow, when choosing investments, the council will invest in banks and financial institutions that \"don't invest in things that produce pollutants, greenhouse gases, habitat destruction, uranium, potentially abuse human rights, involvement in bribery and corruption, or the manufacturing of alcohol, tobacco or gambling products.\"\nThe council's $270 million portfolio is split across 20 term deposits, so there is regularly something coming up for review and reinvestment, and \"we will make sure we are choosing funds that are better for the environment,\" Mr Clausen said.\nThe term deposits come up for review every three to six months.\n\"Every time they come up for review, we will be moving money away from [the big four]. All else being equal, we are going to choose the greenest option,\" the Labor councillor said.\n\"There have been plenty of times when the big four banks are less competitive than what other institutions can offer.\"\nCouncil will look to the Socially Responsible Investment Association of Australasia, and activist group Market Forces' tool to compare the green rating of institutions and banks.\nHe said there were at least 20 to 30 institutions that would meet the council's requirements, provided their rate of return was comparable to the big banks.\n'Large change' in investment portfolio ME Bank is an example of an institution with a credit rating on par with the big four banks that does not invest in fossil fuels.\nMr Clausen expected that the next six months would see a \"large change\" in the council's current investment portfolio.\n\"Obviously my view would be that we move away, almost completely in time, but it will depend how it plays out,\" Mr Clausen said.\nNewcastle is the seventh council in Australia to announce it will shun fossil fuels. To date, 35 institutions in Australia and 350 globally have pledged to exit from fossil fuels. Newcastle's announcement follows a divestment commitment from the ACT Government last week.\nMr Clausen said that \"with a lack of leadership from state and federal government, it falls to local government to act\".\n\"Newcastle's economy has changed a fair bit, in the past we have obviously been very reliant on coal, but before that we were very reliant on steelworks,\" he said.\n\"There are an increasing group of start-ups in Newcastle that are looking at a clean-tech future, we are embracing those opportunities. The coal downturn has particularly affected the Hunter Valley. Clean techs are going to be a significant employer moving forward. Council is being on the front foot about that.\"\nNewcastle's council usually votes in two blocks. The first is a block of seven, consisting of five Labor councillors and two Greens, and the second a grouping of six Liberal Independents. The vote on the investment policy review was passed 6 to 5, with two absent.\nMr Clausen said there was appetite in the community for environmental reform in Newcastle.\n\"That came through strongly when I was out canvassing for votes,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mandaksaunders"], "published": "2015-08-26T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:10:39.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
