These contributions are estimated to be worth between $6 billion and $9 billion a year.\nHistorical factors mean the vast majority of this money currently flows to the union-aligned industry super funds.\nBut Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg wants to break the link between union-negotiated awards and superannuation. He has suggested stripping the Fair Work Commission of its role in selecting default super funds .\nBut Dr Minifie warned some oversight of which funds should be allowed to be used as default funds would still be needed. That role might be provided by Fair Work or APRA.\n\"There is little reason to believe that breaking the link between awards and default super would improve outcomes for many workers currently covered by that process, in fact there is a risk it could leave them worse off,\" Dr Minifie said.\n\"If the government does remove the process for default super fund selection out of the awards system overseen by the Fair Work Commission it must also usher in a new mechanism to ensure that only the most suitable MySuper products are pre-qualified.\"\n MySuper products are the no-frills super funds for people who don't want to make their own choice.\nOnly three retail funds currently have a MySuper product listed in any modern award. Suncorp is listed in one award and National Australia Bank's wealth management arm MLC in three, while AMP is named in 15 – a legacy of its history as a mutual favoured in old state-based awards.\nAt least another 12 retail institutions have launched a MySuper product since 2010, but are yet to be listed as an option in any modern awards.\nThe Financial Services Council says any approved MySuper fund should be allowed to act as a default fund, and employers should be able to choose their preferred default fund.\n\"At present, competition is restricted at the workplace level by the modern award system and enterprise agreements which have the capacity to remove an individual's right to choose a fund,\" FSC chief executive Sally Loane said.\n\"The model will engender price-based competition to bring down fees in the superannuation industry.\"\nBut Industry Super Australia says Australians do not want banks further involved in their super.\nIndustry Super chief executive David Whiteley pointed to the results of a survey in which 71 per cent of respondents agreed scandals over poor financial advice showed bank boards were not working effectively.\n\"I think the community at large doesn't have a high level of trust in the banks, particularly people over 30,\" he said.\n\"If the community formed a view that government proposals intentionally or unintentionally would lead to the banks having greater stake in superannuation that could be of concern to them.\"\nThe Industry Super survey was conducted by UMR Strategic Research, which asked people whether they agreed or disagreed that \"the scandals over poor financial advice from the big banks show that the bank's boards are not working effectively\".\nJust over 70 per cent somewhat agreed, agreed or strongly agreed.\nRespondents were also asked whether \"bank-owned super funds are too focused on squeezing as much money as possible out of their customers\".\nThis time 65 per cent agreed, while 21 per cent were unsure and 10 per cent slightly disagreed.\nThe government plan to inject more competition into default super is accompanied by another major policy shift – requiring all super funds to have one-third independent directors and an independent chairman.\nIndustry super funds say this will make them operate more like banks, therefore undermining a model of governance that has allowed them to outperform rivals.\nBoth changes are viewed as a bid to erode the dominance of the union-aligned non-profit industry funds in the superannuation sector.\nAccording to the Grattan Institute and based on APRA figures, superannuation funds manage about $468 billion in default accounts, about a quarter of all superannuation assets.\nAbout 10 million people are in default superannuation, with about 18 million accounts in total.\nThe average balance in default superannuation is currently about $25,000 per account and about $45,000 per person.\nAverage default balances will grow strongly over coming decades, reflecting the high and growing contribution rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:57:46.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
