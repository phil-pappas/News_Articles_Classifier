According to National Journal, Huckabee continued: “And if for some crazy reason you are not gonna vote for me in the caucuses, for God’s sakes stay home that night where it’s warm and do not leave your home.” Huckabee won Iowa’s caucuses in 2008.

A once bare-bones “Draft Biden” movement has entered a new and more aggressive phase that resembles an exploratory committee, the Times writes.

He’s laser-focused on solving the climate crisis,” she told Politico.\nFiorina on vaccines: Carly Fiorina believes parents should have the right to not vaccinate their children for all diseases . And, said the Republican presidential hopeful in Iowa on Thursday, schools should be able to exclude children who are unvaccinated for communicable diseases from attending classes. “When you have highly communicable diseases where you have a vaccine that’s proven, like measles or mumps, then I think a parent can make that choice,” Fiorina said, according to Time magazine. “But then I think a school district is well within their rights to say, ‘I’m sorry, your child cannot then attend public school.’”\nPerry seen as first to drop out: Who’s going to be first to drop out of the presidential race? Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry , according to this week’s Politico Caucus, the publication’s weekly bipartisan survey of strategists, activists and operatives in Iowa and New Hampshire. Some 40% of early-state Republicans and nearly half of early-state Democrats think Perry, a Republican, will be first. “No money and cannot gain traction, even though he has the best record and a superb message,” said one Iowa Republican.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/insiders-rick-perry-will-be-first-to-drop-out-121350.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/politics/joe-biden-on-beach-vacation-wades-further-into-16-bid.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/al-gore-not-planning-to-run-against-hillary-advisors-say-121351.html", "http://www.nationaljournal.com/2016-elections/mike-huckabee-to-iowa-vote-for-me-or-for-god-s-sakes-stay-home-20150813", "http://time.com/3997620/fiorina-vaccines/"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:56:40.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
