Results may not total 100% due to rounding. \n\"It all depends on how the market trades. As long as the spot behaves and trades around the 6.40 level, officials should be more comfortable and refrain from stepping in,\" Goh continued. \nExperts widely agree that Beijing isn't allowing the yuan to be free floating for now; rather it's embracing a managed floating regime, one characterized by more flexibility and calculated intervention. \n\"Going forward, the closing spot rate will probably represent the official view, while the bias of the fixing relative to the closing rate may reflect the bias of the market,\" Citi explained in a note on Thursday. \nThe PBoC's tolerance level may be between 6.3-6.4 per dollar, judging by intervention levels, the bank added. <p>Yuan&rsquo;s slide may help some small businesses</p> <p>How currency swings in China stand to impact some small business importers.</p> Managing expectations \nThe PBoC's actions this week has heightened confusion about its tolerance for market forces. \nOn Thursday central bank deputy governor Yi Gang simultaneously tempered run-away currency depreciation expectations and confirmed the role of market supply and demand in exchange rate formation. But it remains to be seen whether the central bank can really pull off this balancing act. \nRead More Weaker yuan? A yawn for start-ups: VC \n\"Who should we believe - government or market?\" asked Citi. \"The PBoC official said it would respect the market, but the market may want to see more depreciation in the near term,\" revealing how difficult it will be to achieve equilibrium between regime flexibility and currency stability. \nIndeed, the extent of depreciation bets remains elevated. \nThe PBoC's statement that \"the fixing adjustment process is basically complete,\" i.e. the yuan's approximate 3 percent depreciation since Tuesday was sufficient, can't be taken seriously, JPMorgan analysts pointed out in a Thursday report. \n\"Just like the one-off devaluation wording used on August 11, this is a backward-looking statement. It does not rule out the possibility of further depreciation if driven by new market developments.\" \nMizuho economists echoed that view. \n\"The policy bias is to prevent the RMB from spiraling out of control, but a market-based approach still implies a weaker RMB given continued depreciation expectations,\" they said in a Friday note. \nING is forecasting the currency to trade 6.55 per dollar by year end, while Citi is predicting 6.8 and Mizuho is anticipating levels between 6.50-6.60. \nGoing forward, \"it will be worth watching what further actions the PBoC may take from here, including communications, window guidance, strengthening monitoring on FX transactions or intervention,\" JPMorgan said.
