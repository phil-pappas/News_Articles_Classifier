These younger lots will be groomed in such a way that they are able to take over within two-three years from now,\" a senior National Insurance official said.\"Of course, there is a little scarcity of senior people within the organisation. So, we will go in for a mix of old generation with young leaders to begin with. However, within next few years, you will see more and more young people taking over the senior people within the organization\", he added.
