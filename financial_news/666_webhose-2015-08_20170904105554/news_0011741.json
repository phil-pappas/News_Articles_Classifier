Photo: Edmond So \nThese are good times for firms betting against China's economic growth and the quality of assets at commercial banks. \nThe proof is in the earnings for the first half of the year from China's premier \"bad bank\", Hong Kong-listed China Cinda Asset Management, which specialises in digesting bad debt at lenders and directly refinancing troubled companies. \nCinda posted 5.3 billion yuan in profits, a year-on-year growth of 47.7 per cent. That rapid growth comes at a time when China's biggest banks have posted nearly flat profit growth for the same time period and bad debt levels show no sign of receding. \nAgricultural Bank of China on Thursday posted a non-performing loan ratio of 1.83 per cent, an industry high. Analyst data showed that profit growth at Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest lender by assets, fell in the second quarter of the year. \nAll the better for Cinda. Its results were boosted by a major return to the traditional distressed asset business, or buying bad debt from the banks. Until this year, the business had taken a backseat to what Cinda calls \"restructured assets\" and what analysts have dubbed a form of highly leveraged shadow banking. \nSince the company restructured in 2011, it has pushed heavily into debt restructuring, which involves borrowing from banks at low interest rates and then re-financing bank loans for troubled companies at much higher rates. While highly profitable and far less resource-intensive than traditional bad debt management, the operations concerned investors as more Chinese companies showed signs of financial distress this year and the credit cycle comes to a close. \nThe restructuring business remains several times larger than the traditional one but management appears to be pushing for a change of pace. \nCinda bought about 26 billion yuan in traditional assets between January and June, or 265 per cent more than the same period last year. Growth in restructured assets fell by 60 per cent to 31.5 billion yuan. \n\"Some investors' concerns have been heard,\" said Wei Hou, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"Management has become more risk averse.\" \nThe firm's share price in Hong Kong closed up more than 6 per cent on Friday after falling an intraday 9 per cent on Thursday, the day it announced that subsidiary Cinda Financial SPV had made a HK$68 billion bid for Bank of China (Hong Kong)'s Nanyang Commercial Bank. \nThe acquisition, which is still pending several approvals, would add Hong Kong and mainland banking licences to its growing suite of licences for businesses such as securities and futures broking, insurance, real estate and financial leasing. \nThe deal would be the biggest bank buyout in Hong Kong history, something investors have not been keen on due to the high valuation of Nanyang. \nAnalysts have questioned Cinda's true interest in running a commercial bank. But the addition of the licences, particularly the offshore one, would cut out other banks currently acting as middlemen on offering bank-specific products. \n\"When you market these through other banks â€¦ there are lots of products and there's no telling if your product will be listed as the first one,\" said Cinda senior manager Chen Xiaozhou on Friday. Chen also stressed that, if the deal is approved, distressed debt management would remain at the core of the business. \nAnalysts said that Cinda will still have to prove to investors the value of adding the bank to its arsenal. \n\"The synergies would have to be big,\" Wei said. \nChina Huarong gets HK nod for up to US$3b IPO, says source \nState-owned bad debt management firm China Huarong Asset Management has won approval from Hong Kong's stock exchange for its initial public offering, expected to raise as much as US$3 billion, a person with knowledge of the plans said. \nThe company will wait before marketing the IPO, the source said, pointing to a late September or early October offering. \nA Beijing-based spokeswoman for Huarong declined to comment. The firm has yet to disclose terms of the IPO. \nThe company will become the second of China's four biggest bad debt managers to list after China Cinda Asset Management raised US$2.8 billion in Hong Kong in December 2013. \nHuarong's 2014 net profit was 13 billion yuan, up 30 per cent from 2013. For the three months ended March 31, profit rose 42 per cent to 4.9 billion yuan. \nChina International Capital Corp, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and ICBC International will jointly sponsor the offering. \nReuters This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as Cinda profits from return to traditional business Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T14:55:21.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
