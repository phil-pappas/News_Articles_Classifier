China, which has weighed in heavily claiming 18 companies with unicorn status -- up from 11 just a year ago – could be particularly unsteady. China’s economic slowdown and stock market volatility will likely impact the growth rate of these Chinese unicorns and other startups globally. Look for far fewer financings at stratospheric levels too as venture capitalists draw back and harvest their current set of portfolio companies for investment returns. Those VC firms that invested early in these startup stars before valuations soared in later financings will be the winners. VCs speaking at Silicon Dragon forums admit it’s challenging to gauge when to go ahead for fear of missing out on a champion or when to hold back due to risks. Silicon Dragon’s ranking of China’s top ten most valued Chinese startups (below) offers a snapshot today of these breakthrough leaders, ranging from fintech to hardware to social shopping and adtech. Notably, four of the ten most valuable startups in China are in e-commerce, pumped up by China’s advanced mobile commerce and payment platforms. Watch this space as the rankings and numbers are likely to change fast in the coming months. 1. Xiaomi Valuation : $46 billion Total funding : $1.45 billion VC backers: Digital Sky Technologies, Qiming Venture Partners, Qualcomm Ventures, Morningside Group, IDG Capital Partners Most recent round : $1.1 billion Series E, December 19, 2014 (with an additional undisclosed Series E - II by Ratan Tata, April 26, 2015) Founded in 2010, this fast-growing Chinese hardware company specializing in high-end smartphones with low price points, achieved an incredibly high $46 billion valuation in December 2014, up from $10 billion in January 2014. Facebook takes honors as the only VC-backed startup to have ever raised capital at a higher valuation-- in 2011 in an investment from Goldman Sachs that valued Facebook at $50 billion.Having surpassed Samsung in 2014 to become China’s top smartphone seller, capital is now being poured into increasing sales in key growth markets India, Southeast Asia and Brazil. Xiaomi is taking on the wearable market too with the Mi Band, competing with front-runners Fitbit and Apple.Known for its customer-centered innovation model, Xiaomi relies on crowdfunding to gauge appeal of ecosystem products, manufacturing those with high enough demand. 2.
