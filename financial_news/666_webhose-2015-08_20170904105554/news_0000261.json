The new top dogs at the grocer, chief executive David Potts and chairman Andy Higginson, made their latest move this week by promoting Clare Grainger to the role of human resources director in what many believe to be a sign that Morrisons is close to completing the restoration of its board and executive team. \nSome of the world’s most celebrated chief executives have credited their success to surrounding themselves with people more talented than themselves, and Messrs Potts and Higginson are well aware that the overhaul of Morrisons is more than a two-man job. \nIn what could cruelly be described as Mr Higginson’s bonfire of the vanities, chief executive Dalton Philips was the first to be canned , along with his much-championed fruit and vegetable misting machines. Shortly after taking over from Mr Philips, Mr Potts was quick to swing the axe himself . The list of scalps claimed included retail director Martyn Fletcher, property and strategy director Gordon Mowat, logistics director Neal Austin, head of Morrisons convenience business Nigel Robertson, fashion director Tim Bettley and trading director Casper Meijer, who refused to move from the Netherlands to the UK full-time he preferred to head home to his native Holland on a Friday. Somewhat understandably, Mr Potts is requiring top management to be based in the UK, preferably in Yorkshire, to make sure turning around the troubled grocer is their top priority. \nOnly Trevor Strain, the good-humoured and straight-talking finance director, who stepped in to take a larger role in the gap between Philips’ defenestration and Potts’ arrival, survived the cull. Mr Strain already had a tick against his name after working previously for Mr Higginson and with Mr Potts at Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) . Despite Mr Higginson saying in February that his job was to “build a new Morrisons not a mini Tesco”, recent hires of former Tesco men Darren Blackhurst as group commercial director and Gary Mills as group retail director raised eyebrows. \nIt is fair to say that the team behind Tesco’s former glory days have been cropping up in senior roles across the retail landscape. For example John Browett is the new chief executive of Dunelm while Alex Russo has joined Asda as its new chief financial officer. That said, Morrisons has still sought to downplay the recent raft of Tesco hires, which has mainly been helped by headhunters at Ridgeway Partners. \nFor this reason Ms Grainger’s appointment stands out. Her 25-year-long career in the British supermarket sector has been split between Asda in Leeds and Bradford with Morrisons. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) is notably an internal hire, which might help to soothe any Morrisons staff who were beginning to feel sore about the apparent Tesco takeover, and she is also the sole female director on the management team, despite the bulk of supermarket shopping still being carried out by women. \nOne of the first jobs Mr Potts set those head office staff who survived the cull was a return to the shop floor to understand the supermarket’s faults, flaws and strengths. Previously, head office staff only had to visit the shop floor once a year, at Christmas. Mr Blackhurst, who joined from his former role as commercial director of B&Q, was sent on a week-long tour of shift work across the group’s Northern supermarkets to meet shoppers again. \nElsewhere on Mr Potts’ management team, there remains a question mark over the permanency of Andy Atkinson’s role as interim marketing director. Mr Atkinson, who took over from Nick Collard, already has to do without the advertising services of celebrity double-act Ant and Dec. \nIt is also understood that a decision has not yet been taken on whether to replace Mr Mowat’s role in charge of property. The supermarket, along with its “Big Four” rivals, is scaling back from rampant store expansion plans as it adapts to the changing needs of increasingly time-poor shoppers. \nFor Mr Potts, the future of the group’s M Local convenience stores remains a big challenge. Convenience is the fastest growing part of the supermarket sector but so far Morrisons has failed to make it work, and shut 23 stores earlier this year. Insiders have said that M Local is placed in one of the more troublesome baskets of problems for Mr Potts, but for now the biggest challenge will be luring shoppers back without past frivolities. With a strong top team in place, that should be easier than it was. \n= You scratch my back... = \nThe art of back scratching is alive and well if the latest hiring at corporate boutique Perella Weinberg is anything to go by. The firm has just named Wolfgang Reitzle as an advisory partner the very same Wolfgang Reitzle who hired Perella Weinberg as an adviser to steer the rocky $44bn (£28.2bn) merger between his Swiss cement firm Holcim and its French rival Lafarge (EUREX: 504482.EX - news ) . \nIt is understood that Perella’s industrials specialist, Dietrich Becker, holds the key to the relationship after receiving a call from Mr Reitzle to help rescue the deal when cracks emerged in March. It is unknown how many millions of pounds Perella Weinberg received, but figures originally estimated that both teams of advisers would share fees of around $100m. Mr Becker also has advised Mr Reitzle on takeovers during his turnaround of German industrial gas group Linde (Amsterdam: LE6.AS - news ) . Mr Reitzle, instantly recognised by his pencil-thin moustache, has long played a key role in German business. But still, sometimes it’s not what you know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T08:47:13.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
