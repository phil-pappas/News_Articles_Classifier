Statscan revised the first quarter deficit up to C$18.15 billion - the second highest on record - from an initial C$17.47 billion.\nA strong gain in exports in June helped trim the trade in goods deficit to C$6.74 billion from C$7.07 billion in the first quarter.\nOverall exports of goods edged up C$680 million to C$128.83 billion, largely due to higher prices. Total imports of goods rose by C$350 million to C$135.57 billion, in part due to higher shipments of motor vehicles and parts.\nThe deficit on trade in services shrank by C$240 million to C$5.49 billion as non-residents increased their spending in Canada. This reflected the higher number of foreign travelers, Statscan said.\nThe deficit on cross-border investment income flows dropped to C$4.00 billion from C$4.19 billion as earnings by Canadian investors on their holdings of foreign securities advanced for the 11th successive quarter.\n($1=$1.32 Canadian) (Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by W Simon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:42:03.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
