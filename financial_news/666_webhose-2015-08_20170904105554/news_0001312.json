Greek officials have previously said they expect the bailout accord to go to the country's parliament for approval by Aug. 18. \n\"Efforts are being made to conclude the negotiations, the horizon is by Monday night or early Tuesday,\" said a Greek official who declined to be named. \n\"When the new bailout comes to parliament for a vote it will be one bill with two articles - one article will be the loan agreement and the MoU (memorandum of understanding) and the second article will be the prior actions,\" the official said, referring to measures Greece needs to take for the bailout accord to take effect. \nThe negotiations began on July 20. A senior Greek finance official told Reuters the aim was for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers to review the accord on Friday, Aug. 14. \nAthens is negotiating with European Union institutions and the International Monetary Fund for up to 86 billion euros (£60.89 billion) in fresh loans to stave off economic collapse and stay in the euro zone. The bailout must be in place by Aug. 20, when Greece has a repayment falling due to the European Central Bank. \n(Reporting By George Georgiopoulos; Writing by Michele Kambas; Editing by Digby Lidstone)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T22:41:47.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
