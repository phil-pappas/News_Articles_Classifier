Paul Jeffers Share on twitter by James Thomson You've got to hand it to David Flanagan, founder and managing director of iron ore minnow, Atlas Iron.\nAfter a harrowing few months, which saw the company briefly shut down mining in April, Flanno, as he is known in the mining sector, has pulled off a circus trick that involves him running as fast as he can to keep upright on a rolling barrel.\nAtlas Iron's results, released late on Thursday night for some strange reason, underline the precarious predicament.\nThe barrel in this case if a key covenant on Atlas Iron's $US268 Term Loan B debt facility, which says Atlas must maintain a two-to-one ratio of total asset value to secured debt. If it doesn't, the creditors could move in for the kill.\nFlanno has just managed to keep his balance on that barrel. As at June 30, Atlas had total assets of $775.5 million against secured debt of $349 million.\nBut it's taking some fast running to stand still. As received iron ore prices plunged 40 per cent, Atlas has been trying to slash its costs such that it can breakeven when iron ore prices are at $US50 a tonne, and the Australian dollar is at $US78.5¢.\nIt's only managed to do that via its famous contractor collaborative agreement that has seen its key contractors including transport group McAleese drop their prices in return for a greater slice of the cash generated by Atlas' mines and a deal that will see contractor prices rise as the iron ore price does.\nIn addition, BGC Contracting and McAleese are now Atlas' major shareholders, with a combined stake of almost 28 per cent. Forget the \"us against them\" dynamic that usually defines miner/contractor relations – Atlas looks like a grand utopian joint venture.\n Or at least it would if the iron ore price could tick up a bit. Despite cutting $150 million worth of costs this year, Atlas still slumped to an underlying loss of $51.5 million. It's statutory loss was $1.4 billion, thanks to $1 billion worth of writedowns.\nThose hits are taken now, but Flanno and Atlas will still have to keep the balancing act going. As well as ensuring its costs remain low, and praying the iron ore holds well above $US50 a tonne (it was $US57 a tonne on Friday morning, up 1.3 per cent) he will also have to watch the Australian dollar.\nUsually, iron ore miners like to see the dollar fall, but the fact Atlas has its debt denominated in US dollars means a dropping dollar makes this debt burden heavier to carry.\nA refinancing will be a key part of the balancing act before that the debt matures in December 17.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-08-14T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:07:56.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
