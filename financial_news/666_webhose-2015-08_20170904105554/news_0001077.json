The international crude oil contract traded at over $100 a barrel at the start of last year, but has since dropped to below $47, hurting Kazakhstan's economy and government finances. \n\"In recent years we have built much, increased staffing and wage levels,\" said Nazarbayev, who has ruled the oil-rich Central Asian state since independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, in comments released by his office. \n\"However, now we observe a lack of funds. In connection with this, expenditure on new projects will be strictly limited by opportunities to increase the income base.\" \nNazarbayev also said he expected low commodity prices could continue for a further five years and that Kazakh exports had been hurt by low demand in Russia and China. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T15:55:47.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
