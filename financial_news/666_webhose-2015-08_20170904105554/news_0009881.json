Mirvac head of residential John Carfi said many people had been waiting for some time to purchase in the new estate.\nWinners are grinners: a woman smiles as her number is drawn. Source: News Limited\n“Our greatest challenge has been dealing with the huge volume of people who want to buy,” Mr Carfi said, adding that the system would be used in future whenever demand far exceeded supply. Daniell Fernandes, 27, and partner Jasmaine Vella, 24, were among the prospective buyers who had their numbers drawn.\nThe Brighton Lakes development will be built later this year. Source: Supplied\n“It’s not an ideal system for buying a home, but it beats camping outside the sales office the night before to be first in line,” Mr Fernandes said. The couple are eagerly awaiting the official release of Brighton Lakes homes next weekend, but admit they are only halfway to getting a property.\n“We have the chance to buy one of the homes, but it doesn’t mean we will actually get one. We still have to compete with the other people whose number got drawn in the ballot.”\nA community green at the heart of the development will include a tennis court, swimming pool, playground and barbecue facilities.\nOriginally published as Lucky draw ... for place in a queue ", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/realestate/news/developer-in-liverpool-hosts-ballot-to-determine-who-will-be-first-in-line-to-buy-new-homes/story-fni0cly6-1227503200927", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/developer-in-liverpool-hosts-ballot-to-determine-who-will-be-first-in-line-to-buy-new-homes/story-fnd91nhy-1227503200927?sv=583a1b0bfac458ce1a6cb918968f9dd7", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/developer-in-liverpool-hosts-ballot-to-determine-who-will-be-first-in-line-to-buy-new-homes/story-fnd91nhy-1227503200927?sv=583a1b0bfac458ce1a6cb918968f9dd7"], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T12:45:27.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
