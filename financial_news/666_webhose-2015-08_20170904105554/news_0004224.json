We’re sharing our findings to help advance adoption and help manufacturers’ maximize the business benefits.” \nThe report indicates what applications, business benefits and challenges, equipment, materials and services are capturing the attention of 3D printing’s most committed users – and where their companies will invest. Among the most fascinating results: The majority of respondents – representing the aerospace, automotive, consumer and medical sectors – strongly believe more end-use parts will be designed specifically for additive manufacturing (AM) in the future Additive metal use is expected to nearly double over the next 3 years The majority of respondents said that regardless of their company’s in-house AM capabilities, they believe there will always be value in partnering with an AM service provider to augment internal capabilities \n“If your company is a committed user of 3D printing, the report will provide assurance that you are headed down a similar path of your peers and face many of the same challenges to adoption. If you’re still dipping your toe in the water, the results may serve as a wake-up call to take swifter action,” added Allison. \nTo download a free copy of the report, please visit http://pages.stratasysdirect.com/trend-forecast.html . \nStratasys Direct Inc. is an indirect subsidiary of Stratasys Ltd., a leading global provider of 3D printing and additive manufacturing solutions.
