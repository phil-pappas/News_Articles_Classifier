( http://on.ft.com/1WUZLDR ) \nSoundCloud said the PRS action was regrettable but declined to comment further on how it would defend the legal action. \nLast year, SoundCloud was close to a deal with major record labels like Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, and Warner Music Group for licenses to continue playing their songs and avoid potential legal disputes. But recent media reports have indicated problems with the firm's agreements with the record labels. \nPRS for Music could not immediately be reached for comments.
