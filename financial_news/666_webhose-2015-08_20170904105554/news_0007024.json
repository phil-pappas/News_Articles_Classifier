Josh Robenstone by Jacob Greber, Tony Walker and Mark Ludlow Treasurer Joe Hockey has pushed back against Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens' warning the economy's longer-run potential growth rate may have slumped on weak productivity and population growth.\nWith a major debate now under way in the top echelons of Australia's economic policymaking elite, Mr Hockey emphatically rejected Mr Stevens' speculation that the economy's normal speed has fallen to around 2.8 per cent from the long-assumed pace of just over 3 per cent.\nIf true, the deterioration in the nation's future economic performance could derail the Abbott government's hopes of restoring the budget surplus by early next decade.\n\"I'm not as pessimistic in that regard because the Australian economy is going through some significant restructuring at the moment,\" Mr Hockey told AFR Weekend in an interview.\n\"I think we can get back up to 3.25 per cent, 3.5 per cent.\"\nMr Hockey's view has been questioned by the International Monetary Fund and several high-profile economists, including at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who recently cut their estimate for \"potential\" growth to a little under 3 per cent.\nDowngrade affects budget projections The downgrade has major implications for the government's May projections that the budget deficit will swing back to surplus by early next decade. Much of that is based on an assumption that economic growth will average an annual 3.5 per cent for five straight years from 2017-18, which would be an almost unprecedented run of growth.\n Mr Stevens effectively cast those assumptions into doubt last month when he said trend output may be lower than 3 per cent.\n\"Perhaps the growth we have seen is in fact closer to trend growth than we thought.\"\nGross domestic product rose 2.3 per cent in the March quarter, meaning the economy has been below trend for all but three of the past 27 per quarters.\nMr Hockey told AFR Weekend that his May budget forecasts were firmly \"on track\" and were not going to be revisited.\n\"In some areas, we are exceeding expectations.\"\nThe Treasurer hinted that he has clashed with Treasury forecasters over their view that the jobless rate would rise to around 6.5 per cent. So far, the rate has held well below that, but bounced to 6.3 per cent last month after a rise in participation rates.\nForecasts on unemployment Asked whether his budget assumptions are too heroic, Mr Hockey said: \"I don't accept that because forecasters naturally get it wrong – they inevitably do – and usually have a number of different positions.\n\"The RBA, for example, is lowering its expectations of unemployment and one of the most robust discussions I've had with Treasury was about forecasts on unemployment,\" Mr Hockey said.\nMr Hockey listed as reasons for his optimism the rebound in non-mining construction and improving services exports, and \"a massive roll-out in new infrastructure\".\nIn a speech in Brisbane on Friday, Reserve Bank assistant governor Christopher Kent said federal and state governments would have to react quickly to the consequences of lower economic growth, which could get worse before it gets better.\nDr Kent stood by the RBA's prediction about lower economic growth over the next few years, saying it was based around the most recent data including population growth falling from 1.8 per cent to 1.4 per cent.\n\"We have made the best-guess assumption on population growth on the most recent data we've seen. It's understandable population growth has eased back a bit from quite strong levels and it's not quite as strong,\" Mr Kent told an Economic Society of Australia lunch in Brisbane on Friday.\n\"But that could turn. It make sense it's a bit low if our labour market conditions have weakened but they have improved elsewhere in the world.\n\"But market conditions could change here and elsewhere, and that could turn around. It's not a prediction you could count on for a long period of time. We've just made the best assumption we can.\"\nPopulation growth Mr Kent said governments would have to be nimble to react to changes in population growth, which would impact on economic growth. But he said it wasn't all downside with less revenue flowing into government coffers because a slower population growth would mean less spending on services.\n\"It affects both revenue and expenditure as well over time – just like it affects the growth of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the economy,\" he said. \"In terms of the balance it doesn't necessarily have any strong implications because it's going to be affecting both sides of that,\" he said.\nBut he said Australia was better placed to deal with lower economic growth because of lower levels of public debt. \"If you're an economy in Europe or in Japan which has very high public debt, and less growth in the population to generate revenue to service the debt, that makes life harder,\" Mr Kent said. \"But we don't have especially high public debt as a share of GDP at state or federal levels.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:06:06.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
