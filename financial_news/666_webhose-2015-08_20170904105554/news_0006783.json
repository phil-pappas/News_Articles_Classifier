The airline, which does not engage in fuel hedging, saved more than $1 billion year-over-year in fuel costs in the quarter and expects more than $4 billion in fuel savings for the full year.\nAlaska Air Group , parent of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, posted second-quarter GAAP net income of $234 million, up 41.8% year-over-year (YOY) from net income of $165 million in the 2014 June quarter.

This is the ultra-low-cost carrier’s 50th consecutive profitable quarter. The airline said the results were due to maintaining low costs and flexibility to react to the market. Revenue rose 10.9% to $322 million, while expenses dipped 2.1 % to $229 million, producing an operating profit of $92.7 million, up 64.4% from a $56.4 million operating profit in the prior-year quarter.\nChorus Aviation , the parent company of Canadian regional airline Jazz Aviation, posted second-quarter net income of C$31.4 million ($25.4 million).

The airline said the results were due to strong demand and low fuel prices.

However, when measured on a non-GAAP basis—when compared to a 2Q 2014 net profit of $61 million (excluding gains on that quarter’s sale of JetBlue subsidiary LiveTV to Thales)—JetBlue’s 2015 second-quarter results more than doubled year-over-year.\nRepublic Airways Holdings —parent of Republic Airlines and Shuttle America —posted second-quarter net income of $4.3 million, down 78.6% from a net profit of $20.1 million in the year-ago period.

The Florida-based ultra-low-cost carrier reported second-quarter revenue of $553.4 million, up 10.8% year-over-year and expenses of $431.1 million, up 9.4%.\nUnited Airlines earned record second-quarter net income of $1.2 billion, up 51.2% from the same period last year, as the company continues to reap the synergies from the merger with Continental. United’s board further authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program. Total revenues for the quarter fell 4% from the same period in 2014 to $9.9 billion.\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) reported second-quarter net income of $1.23 billion, well more than doubling a net profit of $454 million in the 2014 June quarter, even as revenue dropped 1.2% year-over-year to $14.1 billion.

Virgin America’s second-quarter operating revenue was $400.9 million, up 0.5% year-over-year (YOY).

Second-quarter yield fell 4% year-over-year to C$0.181, due in part to what WestJet president and CEO Gregg Saretsky called “weaker than expected economic growth” in Canada.\nLatin America\nSão Paulo-based low-cost-carrier GOL reported a second-quarter net loss of BRL354.9 million ($112.4 million). The result more than doubles its net loss of BRL145 million in the 2014 June quarter.

The net deficit, lower than the year-ago quarter’s $58.9 million net loss, is attributed to difficult macroeconomic conditions in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, to which LATAM has a great deal of exposure. LATAM’s second-quarter revenue dropped 20.8% year-over-year to $2.41 billion, but the steep decline was offset by a 21% decrease in expenses to $2.4 billion (fuel costs were down 34.3%). Operating profit was $17.2 million, up 12.1% from operating income of $15.4 million in the 2014 June quarter.\nEurope\nAirberlin reported a second-quarter net loss of €37.5 million ($41.6 million), widened from a net loss of €8.6 million in the year-ago quarter.

The German carrier said this year’s shift in the Easter holidays and last year’s Lufthansa strike affected earnings performance during the quarter.\nAir France-KLM reported a first-half net loss of €638 million ($700.3 million), widened from a loss of €619 million in the year-ago period. The Franco-Dutch group said “exceptional volatility” in fuel process and currency exchange fluctuations, plus pressure on unit revenues, led to the increased losses. Revenue in the first half rose 2.4% to €12.3 billion, while passenger numbers were up 1% at 42.6 million.\nAer Lingus reported a first-half net loss of €12.6 ($13.9 million), marginally widened from the €12.3 million deficit for the year-ago period. First-half revenue was up 7.4% at €749 million, compared to €697.2 million year-over-year, with the carrier experiencing what it described as strong growth in passenger fares, retail and cargo. The first-half results are expected to be the last set of financial figures Aer Lingus will issue as an independent entity.\nKazakhstan flag carrier Air Astana reported a first-half net profit of $8.3 million, reversed from a loss of $36.4 million in the year-ago period. The airline said the results were due to cheaper fuel and other cost-savings measures, plus continued expansion with new routes from its home hub of Astana to Paris, Seoul, Bangkok and Tbilisi, Georgia.\nThe Finnair Group reported a first-half 2015 net loss of €6 million ($6.7 million), narrowed from a €23.9 million net loss in the year-ago period.

Flybe only releases profit figures in its half- and full-year results.\nIcelandair Group reported a second-quarter EBITDA of $50.3 million, up 11.3% from $45.2 million in the year-ago period, due to profitable organic growth and lower fuel prices. According to a company statement, transport revenue was up 2%, with total revenue down 1%. Equity ratio was 36% at the end of June. Icelandair said net cash from operations was $86.7 million.\nInternational Airlines Group (IAG) , parent of British Airways, Iberia and Vueling, reported a net profit of €358 million ($397 million) for the second quarter ended June 30, up 27.9% on the same period last year. Revenue for the period was up 11.2% to £5.7 billion, while operating costs were up 8.9% to £5.1 billion, resulting in an operating profit of €530 million, up 39.5% on the year-ago quarter.\nLufthansa Group delivered a net profit of €954 million ($1.04 billion), reversed from a loss of €79 million a year ago. More than half the net profit— €503 million—was bolstered by the first-quarter disposal of its stake in JetBlue. First-half revenue rose 8.5%, to €15.4 billion, compared to €14.2 billion for the year-ago period. Yields for the group’s airlines rose 2.4%, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations.\nIrish low-cost carrier (LCC) Ryanair announced a net profit of €245 million ($271.4 million) for the first quarter of its financial year, up 25% compared to €197 million for the year-ago period. First-quarter revenue rose 10% to €1.65 billion, while passenger numbers climbed 16% to 28 million.

The carrier partly attributed the losses partly to a foreign exchange (Forex) loss of MYR28 million, compared to a Forex gain of MYR20 million in the year-ago quarter. The airline said the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) had depreciated 13% year-on-year against the US dollar in 2Q 2015.

This was an increase of 64% over the PHP3.178 billion earned in the year-ago period. Cebgo is formerly Tigerair Philippines. The first half also saw CEB Group revenues increase 10.4% year-on-year to PHP29.506 billion. Operating expenses at PHP23.469 billion were 1.2% lower in 1H 2015 than during the same period last year, largely due to lower fuel costs.\nJapan Airlines (JAL) Group achieved a net profit of ¥32.6 billion ($262.1 million) for its fiscal first quarter, more than doubled from a net income of ¥14.7 billion for the previous year. The carrier cited strong international demand for the increased profit. With JAL’s international capacity rising 2.4% in the quarter, traffic for this period was up nearly 9%. This raised international load factor 4.6 points to 77.9%, with revenues from this sector up 2.1%.\nKorean Air posted a first-half consolidated net loss of KRW302 billion ($267 million), reversed from a KRW206 billion profit in the year-ago period.

Korean currency weakness hit the carrier particularly hard since 63% of its debt is in US dollars.\nThailand-based Nok Air reported second-quarter net loss of THB51.3 million ($1.5 million), narrowed from a THB159 million loss in the year-ago period. The low-cost carrier (LCC) said a “major contributor” to the still-significant loss was incurred by subsidiaries, principally its joint venture with Nok Scoot Airlines, as well as increased domestic competition. Revenue rose 14 % to THB3.2 billion year-on-year, while expenses increased 9.2% to THB3.3 billion compared to the prior-year quarter, leading to a total operating loss of THB500 million for the six months to June 2015.\nSingapore Airlines’ lower fuel costs helped offset weak yields as well as losses from affiliates and hedging in the fiscal first quarter, which ended June 30. The group achieved a net profit of S$91.2 million ($66.8 million) for the period, up from S$34.8 million profit in the year-ago period. Group revenue fell 3.2% to S$3.6 billion, excluding subsidiary Tigerair.\nThai Airways reported a second-quarter loss of THB12.8 billion ($378 million), widened from a loss of THB7.7 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Cargo yield dropped 6.6% and load factor fell 10 points to 58.3%.\nSingapore-based low-cost carrier Tigerair reported net loss of SGD1.7 million ($1.25 million) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, narrowed from a SGD65.2 million net loss for the year-ago quarter.

Operating revenue rose 4.7% to $1.84 billion compared to $1.76 billion in the prior-year period, while expenses dropped 11.6% from $1.99 billion to $1.76 billion.\nMiddle East\nSharjah-based low-cost carrier Air Arabia reported a first-half net profit of AED237 million ($64.5 million), down 4% year-over-year (YOY). The slight downturn was “mainly driven by pressured yield margins due to market conditions, as well as a number of strategic investments made by the airline in first half 2015.” Revenue for the half-year was marginally up, to AED1.8 billion from AED1.7 billion YOY, while direct costs were down 6% to AED1.4 billion YOY.\nKuwait-based Jazeera Airways turned in a group net profit of KD6.2 million ($20.5 million) for the first half of 2015, up 27.1% from KD4.9 million last time.

First-half revenues dropped 5.7% to $930 million year-over-year. The Israeli flag-carrier said the decline was due to several factors, including adverse exchange rates against the dollar and a 14% decrease in inbound tourism, which led to a 6.5% reduction in passenger revenue. Cargo revenue rose 1%.\nTurkish Airlines reported a first-half 2015 consolidated net profit of $406 million, more than quadrupled from net profit of $88 million in the year-ago period. Although the currency of the country in which Turkish Airlines is domiciled is Turkish lira, the group tracks results in US dollars. In the second quarter, Turkish increased its consolidated net profit 33.2% to $253 million from the year-ago quarter (in Turkish lira, net profits rose 66% to 662 million).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T07:20:59.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
