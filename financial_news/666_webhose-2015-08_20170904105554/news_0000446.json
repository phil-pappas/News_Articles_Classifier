The central bank forecast only a slow pick-up in inflation, which now sits at zero. \nMost economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected two members of the Monetary Policy Committee to vote for a rate hike. Some had expected three. \nThe prospect of continued low interest rates boosted rate-sensitive sectors such as housebuilders and property-related stocks. \nHousebuilder Taylor Wimpey rose 3.1 percent, making it one of the best-performers on the FTSE 100 and taking it to a new eight-year high. \nBarratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) rose 2.3 percent, also hitting its highest level since 2007. Persimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) rose 2 percent to a record high. \n\"Housebuilders were weak on expectations of a quicker rate hike. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , these are being bought again as a play on rates staying low for longer,\" said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers. \"We think concerns regarding rate rises and the likely impact on the sector have been overplayed.\" \nCommodity prices remained weak, with copper reaching a six-year low, sending miners 2.2 percent lower. \nAmong other top declines, RSA fell 1.9 percent. Although RSA's own pretax profit beat expectations, Swiss rival Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) , which is interested in bidding for RSA, said it would not overpay for the British insurer. \n\"In the short term, we expect RSA to trade based on the probability of a takeover bid, rather than fundamental valuation,\" Bernstein analysts said in a note. \"Hence, on balance we expect the stock to trade down in the very short term.\" \nOther insurers rose, with Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) up 4.7 percent after strong results. \nAviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) also benefited from well-received earnings, adding 1.5 percent after posting forecast-beating half-year operating profit. \nBP and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) contributed to Thursday's falls as they traded without the attraction of their latest dividend payouts, down 2.8 percent and 4.2 percent respectively.
