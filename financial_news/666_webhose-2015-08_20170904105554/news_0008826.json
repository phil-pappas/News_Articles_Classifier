PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Aug 9, 2015 CHANNEL 4 Finding the right plan is not easy \nSitting on the wrong tariff leaves you paying hundreds of pounds every year unnecessarily. \nFinding the right plan is not easy, given the bewildering range of deals and regular takeovers of mobile companies. \nThis year, BT has bought mobile operator EE and Hutchison Whampoa which, owns Three, has taken over O2. \nRetailer Phones 4u went into administration last year. \nWhether you are looking to buy a new mobile or get the best deal for your existing handset, here is how to avoid the pitfalls. Terrific tariffs \nFinding the right tariff is, possibly, more important than choosing the right handset. \nKate Devine, head of broadband and mobiles at MoneySupermarket.com, says: “To find the right tariff for your usage, first work out how you use your current package of minutes, text and data. \n\"Otherwise you may be stung if you exceed your monthly limits or end up paying for airtime you do not use.” \nDevine says most networks now offer an online account service and an app to give you a breakdown of your recent usage: “Some, including EE, let you set alerts to warn if you are reaching your inclusive monthly limit. \n\"Most Android handsets have a setting that allows you to set this yourself.” \nIf you are regularly incurring extra charges for exceeding your tariff, contact your network to request an upgrade. \nDevine says: “It may cost more each month but you should still save money overall as you will no longer incur excess charges.” \nMost networks will not allow you to downgrade to a cheaper tariff, so if you are paying for airtime you never use, you will have to wait until your contract expires. \nMoneySupermarket allows you to compare mobile deals online. \nIt shows The Smartphone Company offering a refurbished Apple iPhone 6 16GB plus unlimited minutes, texts and 2GB data for £34 a month with Vodafone. \nMobile Phones Direct offers flagship android handset, the Samsung Galaxy S6 32GB, for £29 a month with 1,000 minutes,unlimited texts and 1GB data, again with Vodafone. \nOnce your handset is paid off, you have greater freedom to shop around. \nErnest Doku, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, says: “Several tariffs separate the handset and airtime, so you do not end up paying for a handset you have already paid off, notably O2 Refresh, Virgin Freestyle and Tesco Mobile.” \nIf you are happy with your existing handset you may wish to switch to a cheaper SIM-only deal. \nDoku says these deals combine competitive low tariffs with flexibility. \nHe said: “A 30-day rolling contract offers you lower fees and the freedom to switch when a handset arrives that you like.” \nAnother option is to take out a bundle that allows you to combine your TV, broadband, landline and mobile phone from one company. \nDoku says taking multiple services from one company can save you money overall and is simpler as you have only one bill to deal with. \nThe downside is that comparing complex bundles from providers such as BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media can be mind-boggling. Pay and go \nMillions of Britons still prefer Pay-As-You-Go mobile deals over a contract. \nKim Staples of BroadbandChoices.co.uk says: “As with a contract, you still have to work out which package suits your usage.” \nThree has a good value PAYG package charging 3p per minute for calls and 2p per text but you may get a better deal by bulk-buying. \nShe says: “Tesco Mobile offers 5,000 texts for £5, while Vodafone charges £10 for unlimited PAYG texts, 150 minutes and 250MB of data.” \nIf you use your phone to surf the internet rather than text or call, Staples says EE offers access to its fast 4G network with a £10 monthly data pack. \nShe says: “For a good all-round deal, People’s Operator offers texts, minutes and data from £5 a month.” \nCompare the best deals online at: MoneySupermarket.com/mobile-phones, BroadbandChoices.co.uk/mobile/ phone-deals or uSwitch.com/mobiles.
