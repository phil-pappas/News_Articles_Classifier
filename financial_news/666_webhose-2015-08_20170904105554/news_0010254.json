But make no mistake, moms and dads worried about their own household economies are looking for value and are increasingly going online to find deals. \"As seen over the last 13 years, spending on back-to-school has consistently fluctuated based on children's needs each year, and it's unlikely most families would need to restock and replenish apparel, electronics and supplies every year,\" explains Matthew Shay, president of the NRF. \"Parents this summer will inventory their children's school supplies and decide what is needed and what can be reused, which just makes good budgeting sense for families with growing children.\" Evidently, more parents believe they can save money by shopping online. The NRF estimates 35.6% of all back-to-school purchases will be transacted digitally. If that sounds like a savvy plan to you, your next step is to decide what online sites you'll use to buy school supplies, clothing and electronic goods. To aid in that decision, TheStreet canvassed the web for the best online shopping site for back to school purchases. Here's a \"quick-hit\" list: Snagshout - This online discount shopping site was created to put consumers in greater control of their purchases and their ability to sway other shoppers to make similar purchases. According to Snagshout, shoppers can \"snag\" a deal for their favorite products (up to 90% off) and then write an honest review to help other potential customers make a decision. Snagshout says it works alongside Amazon to \"serve as a product discovery platform for shoppers to purchase consistently updated products ranging from groceries to clothing in exchange for their honest review.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:26:51.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
