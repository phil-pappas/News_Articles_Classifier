A big increase in foreign currency loans to corporations is also a vulnerability, the authors said.\n\"The main challenge going forward will be to achieve a 'soft landing' as regards the pace of credit extension, both as regards the headline rate as well as in the specific segment of foreign exchange lending to the corporate sector,\" said the paper, which examined banks in potential European Union member countries.\nStill, banks' ability to withstand shocks appears high due to considerable capital buffers and relatively high profitability, the paper added.\nIn the Balkans, several countries face financial stability risks linked to weak economic dynamics and a high rate of non-performing loans.\n\"Albania, Serbia and Montenegro appear as particularly vulnerable in this regard,\" the paper said, also noting high loan-to-deposit ratios in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
