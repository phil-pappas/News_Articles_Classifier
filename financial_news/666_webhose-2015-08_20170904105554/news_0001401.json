Baker signs bill designating state sales tax holiday for Aug. 15-16 \nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 8/6/15 10:16 am EDT - Updated: 8/6/15 10:19 am EDT \nBOSTON â€” Massachusetts shoppers can look forward to another annual sales tax holiday this month. \nGov. Charlie Baker on Thursday signed a law that will suspend the 6.25 percent sales tax for the weekend of Aug. 15-16. \nBaker said the holiday gives consumers a break while also helping retailers with added business. He added it was something that Massachusetts shoppers look forward to each summer. \nThe state has had a sales tax holiday in all but one year since 2004. \nCritics say it largely helps \"big box\" national retailers and doesn't do much for the state's economy. \nThe sales tax remains in effect for cigarettes and big-ticket purchases, such as cars and motorboats, and anything costing more than $2,500. \nFood and most clothing are already exempt from the sales tax. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:26:57.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
