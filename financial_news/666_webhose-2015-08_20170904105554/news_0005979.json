Photo: Ben Rushton\nTarek Robbiati, the chief executive of \"no interest\" financier FlexiGroup, will leave on Friday to take up a job as chief financial officer at United States telco Sprint.\nFlexiGroup chief financial officer David Stevens and chief operating officer Peter Lirantzis will step into the breach.\nThe company will be led by the pair until it can find a replacement for Mr Robbiati, who has been chief executive and managing director of FlexiGroup since January 2013.\nIt said the search was well under way and the company was happy with the interest shown in the role.\nAdvertisement Mr Robbiati, a former Telstra executive, will take up his new job at Sprint Corp in Kansas on August 31, after the FlexiGroup board agreed to allow him to leave before his notice period ended.\nThe company's share price fell about 3 per cent to $3.11 on Thursday morning. Overall, the All Ordinaries index had fallen by about 0.6 per cent by midday AEST. The stock has fallen 22 per cent since its high of $4 in September 2014.\nMr Robbiati led a diversification strategy into business leasing and acquisition of new credit card and consumer rental business ThinkSmart, as well as investing in digital technology in line with its big retail customers, such as Harvey Norman and Dick Smith.\nHowever, investors have been worried about a loss of several long-serving and influential executives to rivals before Mr Robbiati took over and since. That includes most recently FlexiGroup's national accounts manager Craig Dufficy, who start-up competitor zipMoney poached to be its new national sales manager .\nMr Stevens and Mr Lirantzis are well respected leaders at the company and have held their roles for some time.\nHowever, FlexiGroup's biggest shareholder and founder, Andrew Abercrombie, will spend more time mentoring and guiding Mr Stevens and Mr Lirantzis.\nThe move means the company will probably be without a chief executive when it reports its 2015 annual results on August 17.\nFlexiGroup is a favourite in the bidding for the New Zealand finance business of Fisher & Paykel and industry watchers say Mr Stevens and Mr Lirantzis are well qualified to manage the deal.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/zipmoney-attacks-flexigroup-ge-through-5m-backdoor-listing-20150628-ghzv0g"], "published": "2015-08-06T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T12:00:09.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
