But there's a glaring omission from the movie that has led to some serious criticism of the film. \nOne of the most infamous moments in N.W.A. lore was Dr. Dre allegedly physically assaulting female hip-hop journalist Denise “Dee” Barnes. \nIn 1991, Barnes claims she was viciously beaten by then-N.W.A. rapper Dr. Dre on the floor of the woman's bathroom of the Po Na Na Souk nightclub in Los Angeles. \nBarnes says Dre was provoked by a recent segment which aired on her FOX show \"Pump It Up!\" in which Ice Cube, who had just left the group, trashed his former colleagues. \nAccording to the LA Times , a version of the incident was included in an early draft of the screenplay for \"Straight Outta Compton.\" (Jaimie Trueblood/Universal) Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre in \"Straight Outta Compton.\" Here’s a description of the scene from the Times piece: \nIn the scene, the fictional Dre, “eyes glazed, drunk, with an edge of nastiness, contempt” (per noted from the script) spots Barnes at the party and approaches her. \n“Saw that [expletive] you did with Cube. Really had you under his spell, huh? Ate up everything he said. Let him diss us. Sell us out.” \n“I just let him tell his story,” Barnes’ character retorts, “That’s what I do. It’s my job.” \n“I thought we were cool, you and me,” Dre fires back. “But you don’t give a [expletive]. You just wanna laugh at N.W.A, make us all look like fools.” \nThe conversation escalates, Barnes throws her drink in Dre’s face before he attacks her “flinging her around like a rag-doll, while she screams, cries, begs for him to stop.” \nThis is one of numerous scenes that were never shot. Others included Dre being shot four times in the leg, his house catching on fire during a wild party, and a flashback of his younger brother in the fight that ended his life. \nAt a public Q&A, the film’s director F. Gary Gray addressed the omission of the Dee Barnes incident saying, “We couldn’t fit everything into the movie,” saying he chose stories that better “served the narrative.” \nBarnes wrote about the incident not being in the movie for Gawker recently: \n(Youtube/SPIRTHTRONPU) Dee Barnes in 1990. “[My attack] isn’t depicted in 'Straight Outta Compton,' but I don’t think it should have been, either,” she wrote. “The truth is too ugly for a general audience. But what should have been addressed is that it occurred.\" \nBarnes sued Dre for damages and the two settled out of court . \nThis is not the only incident. Dre’s former fiancée Michel’le told Vlad TV that he physically abused her, even “shooting at” her during an argument. \nIn a story for Rolling Stone recently, Dre admitted to being violent towards women in the past. \n(AFP) “I made some f horrible mistakes in my life,” he said. \n“I was young, f-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T00:28:14.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
