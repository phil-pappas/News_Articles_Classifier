Have asked concerned organisation to give an explanation”.\nCongratulatory letters are sent by the HRD Minister every year to the top performers of CBSE board examinations as well as to teachers.\n“Thank you for congratulating me on the excellence I exemplify. However, having been a teacher for the last twenty years, your official letter head is an affront to my sensibilities as a Language teacher.\nThe attached photographs are self explanatory. Please ensure that at least the people who work for you, in your ministry, are well educated,” Kumar said in her Facebook posting.\n 21, 2015 7:13 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:21:50.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
