The unexpected weakness sent sterling sharply down against the dollar on Thursday. \nThe pound fell by 0.45pc against the US currency, as investors bet that the disappointing retail sales figures could mean that the Bank of England waits even longer to raise its interest rates. \nThe headline retail sales number was dragged down by a 2.6pc drop in fuel sales. But excluding fuel, overall sales rose by a more solid 0.4pc, with department stores and household goods shops performing particulary well. \nThe fall in energy costs and an ongoing price war in Britain's major supermarkets meant that average prices dropped by 3pc in July compared with the same month a year earlier, which means shoppers' cash is going further. \nSales volumes - the amount of goods sold - increased by 4.2pc in July compared with the same month a year earlier, marking the 28th month of year-on-year growth - although economists had hoped for a rise of 4.4pc. \nJohn Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: \"Retail sales volumes continued to grow in July, but the pace of expansion has slowed from the very strong rates recorded earlier in late 2014 and early 2015.\" \n\"The figures suggest that consumer spending will remain a positive contributor to economic growth in the third quarter, but at a more moderate pace than earlier in the year,\" Mr Hawksworth said. \nDominic Bryant, an economist at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) , was more optimistic, saying that the \"recent fall in oil prices should support real incomes and, therefore, retail sales in the coming months\". \nHe said: \"Consumer spending seems likely to grow by around 3pc this year, which should support GDP growth of 2.5pc.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T14:43:45.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
