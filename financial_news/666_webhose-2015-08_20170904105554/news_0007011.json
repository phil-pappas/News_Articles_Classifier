Domino Postiglione DPP Share on twitter by Shaun Drummond Mobile wallets, or e-wallets, have been around for years but only the most recent – Apple Pay, which is not available yet in Australia – appears to have gained any currency with consumers.\nEnsuring consumers can not only redeem card rewards with a mobile device but be told when they are near a vendor where they can earn points, might entice more consumers to make the switch.\nAll sorts of players, from telcos to tech giants, banks and card companies, are keen for cards go fully digital and for their e-wallet or device to be the one used to do the buying, giving the provider transaction data in return or, in Apple's case, a cut of banks' card fees.\nCommonwealth Bank added recently a feature to its mobile banking app that allows loyalty card data to be stored by scanning its barcode with the phone's camera. Combined with its contactless payment function for Android phones, it's getting close to a full e-wallet.\nApple, which just renamed the Passbook app it uses for Apple Pay to Wallet, and Google's new Android Pay – replacing the failed Google Wallet – also allowed recently credit and loyalty cards to be stored.\nNow that all sorts of cards can be stored in one place, the dream of replacing wallets bursting with cards with some ubiquitous device starts to become possible. Nobody has convinced people to do this en masse yet, but what would it mean for awarding and redeeming card points and perks if they do?\nFor the consumer, cards consultant Mike Ebstein reckons people are fundamentally lazy, so they will choose a default card, from which it could get harder for banks to get them to switch.\n\"The only difference is if you have turned your phone into a mobile wallet, you will have almost certainly set a default card,\" he said.\n It will probably depend on which wallet you end up using, be it linked to the device, operating system, bank, card company or telco.\nIf it is independent of the financial institutions – say a Google, Apple or Amazon – users might be more inclined to flip between cards with a swipe of their thumb.\nIf it is a wallet/app from a bank or a card company, then perhaps their card will get favoured.\nHowever, the ability to alert people to deals and rewards on the cards they have stored might be a game changer.\n\"Tactically it might make a difference,\" Mr Ebstein said. \"Savvy marketers will know that I am walking down Martin Place in Sydney, so they can say, 'If you go into Westfield or DJs or whatever, which is 100 metres to your right, then you can get these deals or this many points'.\"\nThe problem is whether anyone actually wants to be pestered by personalised marketing messages popping up in their new digital wallet.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DrummondShaun"], "published": "2015-08-16T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T01:05:50.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
