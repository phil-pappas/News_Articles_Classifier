It was after World War I that he shifted to cotton and sugar farming and quickly became Uganda's leading sugar industrialist. \nBy 1924, he had a 6,000-acre sugar estate in Lugazi where he had also put up a factory. He then expanded his estate and it stretched to 22,000 acres, which produced 60,000 tons a year and employed 10,000 people. \nIt was Mehta's son, Mahendra Kumar, who started developing the Miwani estates and factory where they were also manufacturing Sukari Gur from their jaggeries. Sukari Gur was popular with both Asians and locals. \nToday, Lugazi is Uganda's largest sugar producer -- despite the 1972 setback when the Mehtas were evicted from Uganda during Idi Amin's purge on Asian entrepreneurs which saw more than 50,000 leave. \nIt was only after the toppling of Amin that President Yusuf Lule invited the Mehtas and the Madhvanis back to their sugar estates and factories, which were dilapidated and neglected. \nLike the Mehtas, the Madhvanis had established the Kakira sugar plantations, thanks to the business acumen of Muljibhai Madvani, who had arrived in East Africa as a teenager to work at a brother's shop in Jinja, Uganda. \nThe business, Vithaldas Haridas & Co Ltd, grew quickly, acquiring land and expanding rapidly. With enough money and land, they borrowed a leaf from the Mehtas and went into the sugar industry. \nThey closed down the shop and Muljibhai's elder brother left for Kenya's coast where he took over Ramisi Sugar, which had opened in 1927. Muljibhai decided to build the Kakira plantations. \nBy the time he died in 1958, aged 64, Muljibhai had established the Kakira industrial complex, and operated a sweets factory (known by the brand name Madhvan), a ghee factory, a glass mill, and a jaggery plant. \nThe business was taken over by Jayant Madhvani, who died in 1971 aged 49 years. \nThis was the time that Asians were coming under pressure from Uganda President Idi Amin to leave. \nAs far back as 1967, Uganda had surprised the ministry officials with the growth of its sugar industry. By then, of the three East African countries, only Uganda had a surplus stock of 35,000 tonnes of sugar, thanks to both Kakira and Lugazi estates. \nBoth Madhvani and Mehta groups had sought to be allowed to fill Kenya's 7,000 tonnes export quota agreed under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. \nWe have not seen records on whether Kenya agreed to this suggestion. But there is a policy document authored by Mr Ralph Clark, a development planning adviser based at the Treasury, which informed the thinking about sugar imports from Uganda (perhaps to date). \nHe wrote in the document dated January 1967: \"Imports from Uganda would need to be considered in the context of trade policy with Uganda as a whole ... If providing existing mills are working to capacity ... there would seem to be nothing lost to the Kenyan economy. \nA price much above (Kenya's production price) would represent a subsidy to the Ugandan economy, which may be worthwhile if there are other compensating advantages.\" \nDocuments in government files show that as Kenya continued to start its sugar industry on the wrong footing, the Mehta Group Uganda sought to help and wrote to the Director of Settlements, Mr J.S. Mburu, with offers on transport and transloading of cane. Kenya refused. \nOne of the early warnings was that Muhoroni factory (with the loss of Chemelil Estate) would become \"uneconomical\" if the lands around the factory were not fully developed. This warning is contained in a 1967 paper that was presented to the Sugar Advisory Council. Uganda \nNominated MP Johnson Sakaja has urged Cord and Jubilee leaders to stop political bickering and look for a lasting … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Nation. All rights reserved.
