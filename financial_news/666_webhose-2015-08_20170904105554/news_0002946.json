It cannot afford to see pilots trained at such high costs on taxpayers money leave the company within a couple of years. \nMoreover, training is a time-consuming affair,” aviation expert Subhash Goyal said. During the training period, which can extend to a few months, the services of a pilot cannot be used for flying purposes. \n“The bond should have been there from the very beginning or adequate changes should have been made to the service terms to ensure that the airline recovers the money,” a ministry official said. \nWith no contractual obligation, B787 pilots are at the liberty to leave whenever they wish to. \n“All those who have resigned are co-pilots but had an average 4,000 hours of flying experience. You can become a captain with half that experience in a private airline. So, it’s no surprise why these pilots have resigned,” another airline official said.
