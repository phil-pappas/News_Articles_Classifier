Volumes were relatively thin as the UK market was closed for a public holiday. \nThe Federal Reserve left open on Friday the possibility of a September rate rise, although several of its officials said the prolonged turmoil in financial markets might delay the first policy tightening in nearly a decade. \nWeaker Asian markets, coupled with more volatility in Chinese stock markets which have fallen sharply this month amid signs of a slowdown in the Chinese economy, also weighed on European equities. \n\"The Chinese markets remain in a sensitive position and most market participants remain bearish despite the positive swings experienced within the Shanghai Composite Index late last week,\" said FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in ArcelorMittal (Other OTC: AMSYF - news ) declined 5.6 percent after the company's South African division said it was planning to shut two mills in the country as the unit struggles with weak demand and lower prices. \nFrench telecoms group Iliad (Paris: FR0004035913 - news ) also fell 4.7 percent, with some traders citing disappointment over the free cash flow levels, even though Iliad reported higher interim profits. \nOn the upside, shares in Eni rose 1 percent after the Italian energy company announced the discovery off Egypt of the largest known gas field in the Mediterranean. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Additional reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Alison Williams)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:52:30.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
