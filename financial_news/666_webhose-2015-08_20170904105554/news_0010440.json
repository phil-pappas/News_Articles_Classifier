Fitzgerald, Shareholder at Tucker Arensberg and former Bankruptcy Judge, in the Western and Eastern Districts of Pennsylvania, the District of Delaware and in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nFrank Arenas is licensed in Colorado to grow and dispense medical marijuana. He and his wife own a building, half of which is used for the cultivation and the other half of which is leased to a marijuana dispensary. These activities are legal in Colorado, but, despite then Attorney General Eric Holder’s expressed willingness to work with Congress [i] to reschedule marijuana and remove it from the Schedule I (high potential for abuse) drug list [ii] , 21 U.S.C. § 856(a) has not been amended. Thus, knowingly opening, renting, using or maintaining any place, even temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance is a federal crime. Similarly, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to manufacture, distribute, or dispense or possess with intent to do so, a controlled substance. \nWhen Mr. Arenas tried to evict his tenant but lost the effort and, instead, suffered a judgment that Arenas could not pay, he and his wife filed Chapter 7. [iii] They listed their nonexempt marijuana plants with a value of $6,250 and their building as worth $262,725 but as over-encumbered with liens. The trustee filed a notice of no distribution but after he received some indication that a purchaser would take the property, he withdrew that notice and consulted with the United States Trustee (“UST”) to determine whether he could administer the property. The UST said no and filed a motion to dismiss the case for cause because the property could not be administered without violating federal law. In response, the Debtors moved to convert their case to Chapter 13. The bankruptcy court denied the motion to convert and dismissed the case. Debtors appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (“BAP”). \nIn analyzing whether engaging in marijuana trade, legal under Colorado state law but illegal under federal law, constituted cause to dismiss the bankruptcy for lack of good faith, the BAP concluded that bankruptcy relief is unavailable to debtors whose business activities violate federal law. [iv] Relying on Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Mass., 549 U.S. 365 (2007), the BAP opined that good faith is an affirmative requirement for confirmation of a plan under 11 U.S.C. § 1325(a)(3) and that a debtor whose plan payments would be funded with proceeds of a criminal activity could not meet the standard that the plan be proposed in good faith and not by any means forbidden by law. Moreover, a Chapter 7 trustee could not administer these assets without running afoul of the Controlled Substances Act. [v] Thus, Debtors could not fund a plan and could not stay in Chapter 7 \nThe BAP noted that Debtors had never asked the bankruptcy court to require the Chapter 7 trustee to abandon the marijuana assets if he could not administer them. But even if they had, this estate had no ostensible means of producing a dividend to creditors other than the marijuana business. Allowing Debtors a discharge would permit them to keep the marijuana assets through the abandonment while being protected from collection activities. The BAP concluded that such a result “strikes us as prejudicial delay that amounts to cause for dismissal.” [vi] \nThe tension between state law authorizing a marijuana trade and federal law prohibiting it should make lenders wary of involvement in this type of business. Unfortunately, that same tension means that a person searching for a lending facility to start or maintain this trade encounters difficulties approaching traditional lenders for funds. Who, then, will lend the money? \nIn February, 2014, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), [vii] the agency primarily responsible for administering the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act (”BSA”)), [viii] issued a Guidance to clarify BSA expectations for financial institutions seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. [ix] Notwithstanding the effort, the restrictions identified in the Guidance were substantial for financial institutions that may want to participate in the lending market for these transactions. Among others, the lending institution was not relieved of the obligation to file suspicious activity reports (“SAR”), although a limited report was authorized in some circumstances. [x] As noted in the Guidance: “Financial institutions shall file with FinCEN, to the extent and in the manner required, a report of any suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. A financial institution may also file with FinCEN a SAR with respect to any suspicious transaction that it believes is relevant to the possible violation of any law or regulation but whose reporting is not required by FinCEN regulations.” [xi] \nSome of the activities on the “watch list” were described in the FinCEN report as follows: \nThe Cole Memo provides guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Cole Memo priorities”): Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. [xii] \nIt remains to be seen whether nontraditional, legitimate lenders will provide substantial financing for marijuana businesses authorized by state law but acting in violation of federal law. One concern must be that financing activity that the federal government views as a crime would constitute aiding and abetting, also in violation of federal law. Prudent bankruptcy counsel may want to consider these issues when advising their clients regarding extending cash collateral or making DIP loans for debtors engaged in the marijuana trade, and, in light of Arenas, question the likelihood that a court would approve of either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T21:44:52.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
