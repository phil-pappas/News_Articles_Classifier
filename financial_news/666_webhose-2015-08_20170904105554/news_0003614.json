He added that he thinks rates will rise this year. \nBritain's central bank is under pressure to move rates higher due to low unemployment and strong GDP growth. Both the Office for National Statistics (ONS) < and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) , the respective UK and US statistical agencies, made GDP revisions in the last week . In July, the ONS said the unemployment rate for March to May was 5.6%. \nLast month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney revealed that the BoE is looking to raise interest rates \"at the turn of this year.\" \n\"Short term interest rates have averaged around 4.5% since around the Bank's inception three centuries ago,\" said Carney in a speech on July 16 . \n\"It would not seem unreasonable to me to expect that once normalisation begins, interest rate increases would proceed slowly and rise to a level in the medium term that is perhaps about half as high as historic averages. In my view, the decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T09:49:52.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
