The survey was completed in mid-August, before concerns about an economic slowdown in China triggered a selloff across global markets.\nTim Touchette, president of Attache Corporate Housing, which rents furnished accommodations to corporate and government clients, says his concerns began growing after more of his corporate clients began booking shorter stays. Unsure what is driving the change, Mr. Touchette worries that it could become a drag on revenue growth at his 10-person company that is based in Washington, D.C.\n“Our average length of stay is usually around four months or more,” said Mr. Touchette, owner of the 14-year-old business. “Now we’re seeing people who want to go two months at a time to start.”\nConfidence in the U.S. economy among small-business owners has been declining for much of this year . In the most recent WSJ/Vistage survey, only 42% of the 682 small companies surveyed said economic conditions were better than a year ago, down from 47% in July and a January peak of 67%.\nMore News\nWomen Make Strides in Business Ownership Small Business Loan Program Suspends New Lending But small-business owners’ waning optimism about the larger economy belies their outlook for their own operations. Fifty-seven percent of small firms surveyed expect their total number of employees to increase over the next 12 months, while 46% forecast growth in investment spending. Nearly three-quarters expect higher revenue over the next 12 months and 57% forecast profitability to rise.\nSmall businesses “still are fairly optimistic about their own prospects, but when they look out to the general economy they are getting concerned,” said Richard Curtin, an economist at the University of Michigan who analyzed the data. Their views are “more consistent with slowly growing gross domestic product rather than with a downturn.”\nAlyssa Connell, founder of marketing firm Connell Aviation Group Inc., fits the bill. Basing her view of the economy in part on the business plans of her clients that include small town airports, avionics companies and others in aviation and aerospace industries, Ms. Connell said she expects the next year to be one of slow growth.\nEven so, she plans to double her employees to 30 as her 10-month-old Cedar Falls, Iowa, business expands its operations. “We have found a niche in being a specialist and in being affordable,” she said.\nLuis Alvarez, president of Alvarez Technology Group Inc., a Salinas, Calif., information technology services firm with 38 employees that serves small and midsize companies, said he recently added two new employees and forecasts revenue to be up 15% this year, based on the firm’s performance in the first half of 2015.\nHis clients’ spending plans for the next 18 to 24 months have fueled his optimism. “They haven’t told us that economic conditions are making them pause,” he added. “Many of them are taking advantage of the cheap financing available to accelerate their growth, which means our growth is accelerating with them.”\nSmall businesses are riding renewed strength in the U.S. economy after being battered during the recession when consumer spending fell, home prices declined and banks pulled back on lending.\nLower unemployment, improving consumer confidence and rebounding housing prices have helped “support a revival of small businesses,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “The fact they are more oriented to U.S. consumers is a big plus for them.”\nSome business owners say their businesses are strong but troubles rippling through the global economy could yet hit their operations. Peter Argondizzo, founder of Argo Translation Inc., a Glenview, Ill., firm with eight employees, says that about one-quarter of his business is from translating materials for U.S. companies’ Chinese operations. “We haven’t seen any slowdown in that, but maybe it’s too early,” he said.\nMr. Argondizzo this year hired an additional salesperson and project manager and has one more position he is seeking to fill. “Our business is strong and demand seems strong right now,” he said. “For us, at our size, hiring three employees in one year is pretty big,” he said.\n‘ I don’t necessarily want to be the guy that rains on the parade. ’\n—Robert Gross\n, of Gross Automation But the economic rebound is still shaky. The decline in oil prices has taken the steam out of a pocket of growth in the overall economy, with firms that benefited from the energy boom laying off workers and cutting back on spending. And while unemployment is improving, wage growth is tepid, something that economists say has constrained consumer spending growth.\nRobert Gross, the owner of a 25-year-old distributor of automation and controls in the Milwaukee area, said government restrictions and lower energy prices have meant lower demand from the energy and mining industries, while the strong dollar has hurt foreign sales.\nWith revenue down, Mr. Gross is reducing head count and temporarily cutting hours at his 30-person company, Gross Automation. “I don’t necessarily want to be the guy that rains on the parade,” he said. “But it’s tough out there.”\nWrite to Ruth Simon at ruth.simon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T00:54:07.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
