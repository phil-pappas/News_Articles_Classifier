Near-term resistance is at 1.3232, the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the 50% level at 1.3347. Alternatively, a turn below the 23.6% expansion at 1.3090 clears the way for a test of the 14.6% expansion at 1.3002. We entered long USDCAD at 1.2649 and have since taken profit on half of the trade . The remainder of the position will remain in play to take advantage of any further on-coming gains. The stop-loss is now at the breakeven level.
