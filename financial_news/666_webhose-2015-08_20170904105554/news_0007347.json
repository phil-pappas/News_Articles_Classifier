Photo: Harrison Saragossi\nStockland, one of the nation's largest home builders, says while the golden decade of housing demand is intact, the rate of price growth will moderate, leading to an increase in housing affordability.\nOwner occupiers and first home buyers outweigh investors in the group's residential portfolio, which focuses on stand-alone dwellings in mixed use developments in and around the capital cities.\nStockland chief executive Mark Steinert​ said the residential market along the eastern seaboard was very strong, with an emphasis on inner city Sydney, metropolitan Melbourne and the proposed new development at Caloundra South on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.\n\"The rate of price growth will moderate to about 4 to 5 per cent, we predict, but that will help with affordability concerns,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"The improvements in new infrastructure, with about $20 billion earmarked, particularly in NSW, has been a game changer for urban redevelopment, which has driven demand and profit growth for these new projects across the country.\"\nStockland is developing the Willowdale site in Sydney and Cloverton​, Melbourne, among others, and will also look at land held by its logistics division, such as at Merrylands NSW, to convert to housing.\nThe diversified group has lifted underlying profit 9.4 per cent to deliver $608 million for the year to June 30. This was boosted by the housing boom and improving retail markets for shopping centres. The group has a strong exposure to the Sydney office market, which is also seeing improved leasing conditions.\nThis was in line with market expectations. UBS analysts said the favourable operating environment was reflected in the strong result.\nMr Steinert said the residential business achieved a substantial 73.5 per cent uplift in profit and ended the year with a record 3742 contracts on hand.\n\"This result reflected generally positive market conditions in the corridors where we operate and the progress we've made launching six key projects in two years and broadening our customer reach with diverse product offerings,\" he said.\nStockland's commercial property chief, John Schroder, said the division remains a key driver of the group's success.\nThe final distribution was12¢, to be paid on August 31. The annual distribution was 24¢.\nMr Steinert is targeting growth in underlying earnings per security in the 2016 financial year of 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent and funds from operations per security of 8.5 per cent to 10 per cent, assuming there is no material change in market conditions\nHe said while the outlook for specific markets remains uneven, with some caution among businesses and consumers, \"we expect conditions to remain reasonably supportive\".\nThe other plank of the group, retirement living, reported an operating profit rise of 19.9 per cent from the previous year to $48 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:38:25.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
