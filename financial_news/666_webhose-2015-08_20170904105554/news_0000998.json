Jim Rice Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Jonathan Barrett Mining magnate Andrew Forrest has expanded his controversial strategy of lodging exploration applications over his Pilbara cattle stations.\nLate last month, Mr Forrest's investment vehicle Squadron Resources applied to explore parts of Nanutarra, where the billionaire holds the pastoral lease.\nMost, if not all, of Mr Forrest's exploration applications are on his own stations. This has raised questions over whether the billionaire founder of Fortescue Metals Group has a bona fide interest in the minerals, or whether the exploration applications are designed to block rival miners from disturbing his expanding cattle operations.\nA spokesperson for Mr Forrest said Squadron was building a diverse portfolio of early-stage exploration projects.\nMost of Andrew Forrest's recent major investments have been in agriculture, not mining Alex Ellinghausen \"These recent tenements are prospective for copper/gold base metal exploration,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We will continue to deploy funds into the exploration sector and meet all obligations and maintain the pristine environment.\"\nThe new exploration application over parts of Nanutarra accompany a larger-scale \"pegging\" of mineral rights at Uaroo , which is leased by Mr Forrest. The mining magnate has also lodged extensive applications over his family's historic station, Minderoo.\nMining Act's spirit undermined Past reporting by The Australian Financial Review has found that Mr Forrest used companies run by friends or himself, such as Fortescue Metals Group, to lodge exploration applications over his childhood Pilbara home, in order to prevent other miners from accessing it.\nWhen administrative pressure was applied on the Forrest-friendly companies to \"use or lose\" their exploration rights, the companies invariably tipped each other off that they are about to relinquish control of the mineral tenure, and another Forrest-friendly company stepped in.\nThis undermined the spirit of the state's Mining Act, designed to encourage exploration and mining. But the practice is not considered illegal and therefore appears to be a way people can exploit the intention of the mining laws by maintaining mineral rights to a piece of land indefinitely.\nWhile Mr Forrest has retained his one-third share in Fortescue, many of his major recent purchases have occurred in the agricultural sector.\nHe recently purchased the leases to the Brickhouse and Minilya stations, according to The West Australian , taking his pastoral land holdings in Western Australia to more than 1 million hectares.\nIn 2014, Mr Forrest purchased Harvey Beef, which he says now employs 400 staff and processes more than 130,000 head of cattle a year.\nFortescue has built its operations on other people's pastoral leases, which included establishing its first mine, Cloudbreak, on Gina Rinehart's Mulga Downs station. The rights of a miner usually outrank the rights of a pastoral lease-holder as long as various conditions are met.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/barrett_ink", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/111791755610985370077"], "published": "2015-08-11T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:55:24.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
