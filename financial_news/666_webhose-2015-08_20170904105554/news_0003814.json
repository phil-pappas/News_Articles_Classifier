The firm has been editing out references on its website to data deletion and its ability to help banks keep their data away from the government.\nThe New York Post has previously reported that Symphony deleted a video from its website that bragged its software could help banks avoid billions in fines by making data deletion easier. Continuing its efforts, Symphony has recently deleted a section about data security from its website and additional references that emphasize more privacy via data encryption and permanent data deletion capabilities.\nThese were among the removed comments: “End-to-End Encryption: Symphony is completely private. Your data is 100% protected by encryption keys known only by you, never by us.”\n“Guaranteed Data Deletion: Symphony has designed a specific set of procedures to guarantee that data deletion is permanent and fully documented.”\nA blog post from July entitled, “To Encrypt, or Not to Encrypt?” is also now gone. That post included a passage touting its encryption capabilities as a way to protect firms’ privacy. “Our government officials are concerned that their inability to monitor end-to-end encrypted devices inhibits their role in keeping America safe. Conversely, Americans are concerned about preserving their right to Privacy, and encryption helps individuals enforce that right,” read that post.\nA Symphony spokeswoman responded that the website “was updated as part of our August 3rd product launch.”\nSymphony is no longer promoting messaging security features as a way to prevent the government from getting banks data. Instead, text describes “an ‘end-to-end’ security capability that protects communications from cyber-threats and the risk of a data breach—while safeguarding our customers’ ability to retain records of their messages.”\nThe spokeswoman also said that “Symphony does not change regulators’ ability to obtain messages from our clients. Symphony delivers messages to its clients to download, decrypt, and archive, and they are able to provide those messages to regulators just as they would with other compliant messaging systems.”\nThe New York Post report raised some eyebrows. The New York Department of Financial Services’ acting superintendent, Anthony Albanese, sent a letter to Symphony Chief Executive David Gurle on July 22 asking for more information about the video. On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren stepped up the pressure on the firm, as the Massachusetts Democrat sent a letter to six financial regulators raising concerns about Symphony’s description of its new system, “which appear(s) to put companies on notice - with a wink and a nod - that they can use Symphony to reduce compliance and enforcement concerns.” She asked the heads of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to brief her by Sept. 6 about the impact of this system on their ability to enforce the law.\nSymphony was formed when, in October of last year, fourteen of the world’s biggest financial-services firms, including Goldman Sachs, bought instant-messaging software company Perzo Inc and formed a new company funded by a consortium of financial firms that includes many big names —Goldman Sachs GS, +0.64% , Bank of America Corp BAC, +0.45% ., Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK, +0.46% ., BlackRock Inc. BLK, +0.68% , Citadel LLC, Citigroup Inc. C, +0.45% , Credit Suisse Group AG CS, -0.14% , Deutsche Bank AG DB, -1.01% , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.50% , Jefferies LLC, Maverick Capital Ltd., Morgan Stanley MS, +0.79% , Nomura Holdings Inc. NMR, +0.44% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.77% . Some of those banks have spent billions to settle investigations for interest-rate rigging and currency manipulation that rested on evidence of instant messages and other electronic communications between traders in the banks and between them that provided evidence of the alleged illegal activity. Those messages shocked the public and prosecutors and embarrassed the banks because of their blatant disregard of the law and their irreverence.\nLast year, while the firm was still called Perzo, Symphony CEO Gurle was interviewed and talked about its “zero knowledge” security capabilities.\nThe industry-led effort to find a substitute for Bloomberg LP’s ubiquitous messaging system may be about control—Bloomberg saves the banks’ data and could be the target of a regulator’s subpoena— but may be more about money. A Bloomberg terminal costs $24,000 a year. Multiply that by the thousands of terminals on every trading floor, and its adds up to another big cost banks may be trying to erase. A Bloomberg LP spokesman declined comment.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wntWbaLHIYc", "http://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=931", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulator-seeks-details-on-symphony-communication-practices-1437590083?mod=djemCFO_h"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T00:00:31.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
