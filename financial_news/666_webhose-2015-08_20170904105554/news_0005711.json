It has powers to impose a fine of up to £500,000 on companies with inadequate data protection. \nAn ICO spokesman said Carphone, which detected a breach of its systems on Wednesday, had alerted watchdogs on Friday. \nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police, which hosts the national unit responsible for investigating serious cyber crime, said officers were aware of the incident but an investigation had not been opened because Carphone had not reported a crime. \nCarphone made the incident public on Saturday, saying it had been the victom of a “a sophisticated cyber-attack”. The data taken concerns online customers of OneStopPhoneShop.com, e2save.com and Mobiles.co.uk, as well as iD Mobile, TalkTalk Mobile, Talk Mobile and Carphone Warehouse itself. \nUp to 2.4 million names, addresses, dates of birth and bank details were stolen, as well as the encrypted credit card information of 90,000 customers. \nThe company came under fire yesterday after TalkTalk admitted that some of the passwords stolen by the hackers may not have been encrypted, making it much easier for criminals to use the data for fraud. \nAlthough the companies reset passwords on their own systems, research shows that people often reuse passwords across multiple online retailers. \nCarphone also defended itself against criticism over the delay of three days between detection of the breach and informing those affected. A spokesman said it had needed time to work out what had been stolen and how the systems were breached. \nThe retailer, part of Dixons Carphone (Stuttgart: CWB.SG - news ) , said it was contacting those affected via email. They were advised to change their online passwords and contact their bank to put their accounts on alert for suspicious activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T18:00:27.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
