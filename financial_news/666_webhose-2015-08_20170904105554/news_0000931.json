Penny Bradfield by Phillip Coorey Ewin Hannan Royal Commission\nFederal Liberals are venting their anger at the party's NSW division for failing to anticipate the consequences of inviting trade union royal commissioner Dyson Heydon to address a party fundraiser.\nThe furore has damaged Justice Heydon's credibility and blunted one of the more potent weapons the government was hoping to wield against Labor as the federal election drew near.\nJustice Heydon is facing demands from Labor, the Greens, some independents and unions to step down, and for the commission to be terminated. However Prime Minister Tony Abbott continued to stand by the commissioner on Friday and most Liberals contacted by AFR Weekend expected the Prime Minister not to force the judge's resignation.\nChristopher Pyne defends Dyson Heydon in Parliament on Thursday. Alex Ellinghausen However, there was general acceptance inside the government that Justice Heydon's credibility and impartiality had been damaged and his royal commission defanged.\n\"It's a terrible, terrible look,\" said one minister.\nSaid another: \"It's probably more a stuff-up than a conspiracy but it's a bad look.\"\nLabor: 'best outcome' Labor and the union movement also accepted Justice Heydon was unlikely to go but privately were happy, saying this was the best outcome politically because Mr Abbott would be forced to keep defending him, while the royal commission's final report, due before Christmas, would be easier to dismiss as politically motivated.\nEducation Minister Christopher Pyne said forcing Justice Heydon's resignation would be \"a complete overreaction\", but he did not deny the affair had left the former High Court judge compromised.\n\"Why he was invited in the first place is beyond me,\" he said. Other Liberals concurred, preferring to blame the NSW division rather than Justice Heydon, who was not commenting further.\nThe Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption has been derailed and Mr Abbott left with another crisis after it was revealed Justice Heydon was to deliver the annual Sir Garfield Barwick Address. The event, organised by the legal branch of the NSW Liberal Party, had been publicised since April 14.\nThe invitations, written on the NSW Liberal Party letterhead, made it clear the address was a party political fundraiser.\nJustice Heydon withdrew from the event just before the story broke in the media but in an email, left open the possibility of helping with Liberal Party fundraisers once the commission had ended.\nAlbanese says position is untenable Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said Justice Heydon's position was untenable.\n\"What was he thinking and what was the Liberal Party of NSW thinking inviting someone during a royal commission?\" he said.\n\"This is an $80 million royal commission that has been blown out of the water by an $80 fundraiser.\"\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver and ACTU president Ged Kearney wrote to Mr Abbott on Friday, urging him to shut down the commission.\n\"This appearance of bias and partisan behaviour taints any and all findings of the royal commission and the ACTU calls on you to terminate the proceedings immediately,\" they said.\nUnion leaders received advice from lawyers on Friday about applying to the commission to have Mr Heydon stood down but played cool on this option. They were also reluctant to boycott the inquiry as union employees could be exposed to legal action if they refused to appear to give evidence.\n\"There is a view that we could just leave him there because his credibility is completely shot with the public,\" one senior official said on Friday.\n\"That is a very strong view.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:06:13.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
