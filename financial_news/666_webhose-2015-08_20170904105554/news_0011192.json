Photo: Supplied\nNot all of us are technically proficient, but plenty of us want to have the latest gizmos.\nTwo New York-based Australian lawyers have formed a business to ensure Australians (and everyone outside the US) can receive the latest tech wizardry emanating Stateside, beating slow-footed local importers and sales agents to the punch.\nPhillis Chan and Ben Chaung, a couple who left Melbourne two years ago, formed Big Apply Buddy a year ago to provide those who have to have the latest something before everybody else with the contraptions and wearables that bestow great social credibility on users and wearers.\nActivity trackers are among the \"must-have\" big sellers. Big Apple Buddy's clients were sent the Fitbit Charge HR two months before Australian stockists and the Jawbone UP3 three months earlier.\nAdvertisement However, there are a host of gadgets in huge demand, which aren't available locally.\nHave you heard of the Hello Sense sleep tracker or the Soundhawk smart hearing system? What about the Thync wearable mood-changing device, the Amazon Echo smart speaker or the Basis Peak activity tracker? Then, of course, there's the Seek Thermal Camera (an infrared phone attachment) and the Olio Smartwatch .\nNo, me neither. However, these are a few of the Big Apple Buddy clients' favourite locally unobtainable things.\nIt's not just electronic goods.\nThe latest US fashions are in demand, as are meal replacement powders such as Shakeology and Soylent , which are only available in the US.\nChan says the business has grown organically.\nAs soon as they arrived in the US, their friends badgered the couple for American products.\nThe demand was so relentless, she formed the company.\nChan, 28, says she and her husband planned to practice law when they first settled in Chicago but the state of Illinois requires foreigners to have been resident for four years before they can undertake bar exams.\nBy the time the couple moved to New York where they could do the exams, they had recognised the global need for items available only in the US, and had the makings of a business.\nChan says she is doing a roaring trade in the Apple Watch, still unavailable in Belgium, South Africa and Portugal.\nIt has only been released in 16 countries.\nThis is well known, but with other desirable goods, it's not always easy to arbitrage timings between a US product release and its release elsewhere.\n\"What we do is track products and follow a lot of the tech blogs, so we know where things are and where they aren't,\" Chan says.\nWhile Australia remains its biggest market for US must-have products, other countries are gaining market share.\nThe business uses Google AdWords to ensure its advertising gets across to the markets lacking a specific product and tails off the marketing as soon as a product appears. Big Apple Buddy has accrued about 1500 clients in 55 countries in the past 12 months.\nChan is not worried by the decline of the Australian dollar. Her clients are mostly professional and money is no object. Nor will it matter when the GST-free threshold on imported online goods lowers from $1000 to just $20, which is likely to add extra costs for online shoppers.\n\"Our clients are definitely not price sensitive,\" she says. \"All they're interested in is access.\"\nBig Apple Buddy touts itself as a \"personalised shopping concierge\", sourcing the item, checking and repackaging the goods on arrival and preparing customs documentation.\nIn this sense, it is no different to eBay and Amazon, it just offers greater contact with the customer.\nChan also says the company improves on the service of US parcel forwarders.\nOften stores won't accept either foreign credit cards or non-US billing addresses.\nThere are competitors such as ShopMate , Australia Post's parcel-forwarding company, and Cuzin , a crowdsourcing shopping platform, but Chan says these cater \"for a different audience\".\nThe business takes $US40 ($54) on each transaction and only charges more if several goods are requested. In most cases, extra items attract about $US10 each.\nChan is coy about the business details. There are only three staff.\n\"Luckily for us, this is the kind of business which has not required a great deal of capital investment. I'd say we're probably doing a little better than breaking even after a year in the business,\" she says.\nWhile her husband and business partner is still practising law in New York, Chan says she will not be returning to legal practice.\n\"I'm not even thinking about the law any more,\" Chan says. \"This is a hell of a lot more exciting.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.shakeology.com/en_US/", "https://www.oliodevices.com/", "https://hello.is/", "http://www.thermal.com/", "https://www.soylent.com/", "https://www.cuzin.com/", "http://www.thync.com/", "https://shopmate.auspost.com.au/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00X4WHP5E", "https://www.mybasis.com/"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:58:23.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
