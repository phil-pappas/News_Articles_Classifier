The decision overturns a lower court ruling that had invalidated the 2013 regulation.\nThe Department of Labor said in the rule that home health aide employment had increased 65 percent between 2001 and 2011 to 924,650 and personal care aide employment doubled to 820,600.\nThe three-judge panel concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act gave the Department of Labor authority to determine which in-home care services are exempt from minimum wage and overtime protections. The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.\n\"The Department's decision to extend the FLSA's protections to those employees is grounded in a reasonable interpretation of the statute and is neither arbitrary nor capricious,\" Judge Sri Srinivasan wrote on behalf of the court.\nThe case is Home Care Association of America v. Weil, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, No. 15-5018.
