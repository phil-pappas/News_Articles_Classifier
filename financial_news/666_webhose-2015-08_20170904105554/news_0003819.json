None of this would have been possible if Sam Hodges, the co-founder, had a better experience with banks and lenders when he built a successful gym franchise many years ago. Brokers were constantly knocking on his door, eager to steer him to products that offered the highest commission. Just figuring out how much a product actually cost could be a challenge. And when he finally did determine the actual cost, he was shocked by how expensive it could be for small businesses to borrow. Those bad experiences helped give him the inspiration to create a better alternative for small businesses to borrow.\nWith Funding Circle, interest rates start as low as 5.49%, and can go up to 22.79%. In addition, an origination fee between 0.99% and 4.99% is charged. Borrowers can see the range of interest rates available by visiting a page called “ Rates and Fees .” That may seem obvious, but many lenders do not disclose fees and interest rates before a borrower applies. The lack of transparency in the small business lending market, especially from new entrants, has not gone without notice. Last week, a group of lenders, nonprofits and industry leaders launched a small business bill of rights . Funding Circle helped lead the charge, and I had the opportunity to speak with co-founder Sam Hodges about why the bill of rights is needed.\nSam told me that Funding Circle helped create the bill of rights because he sees borrowers all the time who are confused by complicated products. An annual interest rate of 6.99% would cost a borrower less than a 4% factor fee for a 60 day term, but many borrowers just are not able to do the math. Whereas consumer lenders have to convert interest rates and fees into an annualized interest rate for comparison, small business lenders are not required to do so. Borrowers end up paying more, without realizing their mistake. And lenders with lower interest rates often lose business to more expensive competitors. Misleading products often win when borrowers are not required to disclose the true cost of borrowing.\nIn addition to a lack of pricing transparency, many products are designed for stacking. As Sam described the practices, it bore a striking resemblance to payday lending for consumers. Rather than creating an amortizing loan, many lenders give an advance and charge a fee. After a relatively short period of time, the entire loan becomes due in a balloon payment. At that point, the borrowers are given a choice. They can pay another fee to extend, or pay the balance in full. For many small business borrowers, similar to payday borrowers, they become stuck in a trap. Unable to afford to pay the balloon payment, they end up paying the much lower fee to extend. In effect, the businesses become stuck in an interest-only loan.\nThe small business market remains incredibly fragmented. The nation’s largest banks, like JP Morgan Chase Chase , tend to make small business loans via plastic. Chase has built the Ink brand, which targets small businesses. Small business credit cards can be a great tool when used properly. Credit cards offer 25 day working capital for almost no cost. So long as you pay your statement balance in full, no interest will accrue. If interest does accrue, Chase charges a purchase APR of 13.24%. However, there are limitations with credit cards. The underwriting is primarily based upon your individual credit score. Risk -based re-pricing remains legal with small business cards, even though it was banned for consumer cards. That means the interest rate on your existing balance can be increased if your credit score deteriorates. And the credit limits provided on small business credit cards look more like a personal credit card rather than a corporate line of credit.\nIf you need to borrow more money, or have suppliers who take longer than 25 days to make payments, a big term loan could be useful. However, for small businesses, the sector remains highly fragmented. There are many small, garage-based lenders and brokers. The brokers can receive large incentives, and often steer borrowers to the most expensive lender rather than the best deal. And many lenders charge extremely high interest rates, disguised as low fees.\nEnter Sam and Funding Circle. They have created an application process that takes fewer than 10 minutes. Your business can borrow up to $500,000. But unlike other lenders, Funding Circle is not promising money in an hour. Instead, the approval process can take up to ten days. However, in exchange for waiting, borrowers can receive much lower interest rates than many competitors.\nBut by supporting a bill of rights, Funding Circle has made it clear that it doesn’t just want to make money. It wants to change an entire industry. Leading from a position of strength may be a smart long-term business strategy. Regulators are paying close attention to small business lenders. Those who don’t embrace transparency may enjoy outsized earnings today, only to deal with the consequences later.\nNick Clements is the author of the Forbes eBook, How To Crush Credit Card Debt , available on Amazon .
