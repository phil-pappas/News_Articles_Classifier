The fruits will be incorporated into new and limited edition recipes. “We want to give consumers something new and a great way to innovate is through exciting fruit,\" he said. Organic British quince is hard to find Yeo Valley, which pays a premium for British organic fruit, has developed a supply chain whereby small batches of fruit can be transferred to a central processing hub to be quick-frozen and used for future recipes. This means the company can buy up farmers' surplus fruit as and when it is ripe. \"We can be very agile,\" said Rusga. \"We once went from saying yes to a fruit to shelves in just three months.\" Yeo Valley has managed to source blackcurrants from a family farm in Herefordshire, as well as rhubarb and damson plums from the UK but has struggled to find rarer fruits, such as gooseberries . \"We love damsons, and that crop is sporadic, we'd love British gooseberries and quince,\" said Mr Rusga. \"It's crazy that we can't find organic British Bramley apples.\" Yeo Valley is attempting to fight back against the rise in imported products and support local farms, the company claims. “There aren’t many family businesses left in the UK,\" said Yeo Valley boss Tim Mead. \"The big are getting bigger every year. For every 200 lorries that we send out across the UK to supply supermarkets, three times that number are coming across the channel every week.” Since launching in 1992, the Yeo Valley brand has become a household name , best known for its natural yoghurt pots. The company has a turnover of £300m a year, employs 1,500 people, and is still privately owned by the Mead family. Yeo Valley has benefited from a recent surge in popularity for yoghurt as a breakfast or healthier afternoon snack . Yoghurt sales have trebled since the 1970s, as eating habits from continental Europe have spread to Britain. Estimated at £2bn in 2014, sales of yoghurt and yoghurt drinks experienced growth of almost 14pc since 2009, according to figures from research firm Mintel. Three in five people in the UK now choose yoghurt as a dessert. telegraph.co.uk Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T12:57:08.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
