Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) across Europe also plunged as the political turmoil in Greece and disappointing international data, including poor manufacturing numbers from China. In the US, Markit (NasdaqGS: MRKT - news ) 's manufacturing PMI fell to 52.9 in August from 53.8 the previous month, surprising analysts who had predicted the reading would remain unchanged. 1530: Consumer confidence in the Eurozone rose slightly in August, figures released on Friday by the European Commission showed. The report showed consumers in the 19-country bloc became more optimistic, as the index climbed 0.3 points in August from July to -6.8 in its flash estimate. In the European Union as a whole, consumer sentiment climbed by 0.3 points to -4.6. \n1445: US equities slid on Friday, as unimpressive data out of China weighed on sentiment. Just before 1500 BST, the Dow Jones Industrial was down 150 points to 16,840.30, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were 18 and 55 points lower respectively, with the latter falling below the 200-day moving average for the first time in 10 months. \n1430: The US manufacturing sector continued to expand in August, but the rate of growth fell to its lowest since October 2013. The Markit flash Purchasing Managers' Index declined from 53.8 in July to 52.9 in August, compared with expectations for an unchanged reading. \n1220: The FTSE 100 has set a new low for 2015, falling past its January nadir of 6,298 to just over 6,285.9 a few moments ago. The rout in the blue chip index, which now looks on course for a ninth successive day, represents a 10% correction from its all-time high in April. To those worried about the wider effect, Capital Economics said the sell-off was unlikely to be large enough to effect the continuing consumer spending recovery. \"The relationship between equity prices and consumer confidence has been very weak recently, perhaps reflecting the declining proportion of households' financial assets accounted for by shares. Movements in real earnings and house prices have been much more important determinants of consumer confidence than changes in equity prices. And the outlook for real earnings, and to a lesser extent house prices, remains positive.\" 1152: \"As things stand markets appear to be pricing in the prospect of a September rate rise at about a 30/70 probability as US data continues to give conflicting signals as to the underlying strength of the US economy,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets . \"A lot has been made of the fact that in the last Fed statement the insertion of \"some\" into the third paragraph appeared to suggest that the bar to not acting on rates had got that little bit higher, a belief reinforced by subsequent comments from the Atlanta Fed President and FOMC voting member Dennis Lockhart in the past few weeks. \n1124: \"The FTSE appears to be holding above 6300, but with its oil and mining stocks, bar the odd anomaly like Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) , firmly in the red, the UK index is going to struggle to end its current losing streak,\" said Spreadex 's analyst Connor Campbell. \"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) news of a public sector surplus couldn't inspire it to relinquish its losses, and an empty afternoon is unlikely to do so either.\" 1050: Analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) believe the Eurozone is yet to be affected by the worries surrounding the Chinese economy. \"After an weak start to Q3, the August PMI showed remarkable resilience, especially Germany's manufacturing index, despite slowing Chinese activity,\" they said. \"Meanwhile, France's PMIs continue to suggest decent momentum despite weakening slightly. In turn, barring an unexpected downturn in September, euro area July-August PMI suggests a stable output momentum from Q2, with the average currently at 54.0 \" 1010: Analysts at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) said the Eurozone PMIs point to solid growth in the quarter of 2015. \"The August PMIs for the Eurozone suggest the recovery remains broadly on track and the third quarter growth looks likely to be around 0.5% quarter-on-quarter,\" they said in a note. \"However, risks to subsequent quarters are building given the seemingly sharp slowdown in China, falling equity markets globally and a rising euro.\" 0952 : July's public borrowing figures showed UK's public finances are now fully benefiting from the economic recovery's strength, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. For the first time since 2012, the Government ran a surplus in July, of £1.3bn. \"July's figure means that borrowing in the first four months of the fiscal year of £24bn was 24% lower than the £31.4bn seen last year - a bigger drop than the 21% the OBR expects to see for the year as a whole,\" said Capital Economics' senior UK economist, Samuel Tombs. \"With eight months of the fiscal year still to go and often large revisions to early borrowing estimates, it is too soon to conclude that the Chancellor is meeting his fiscal plans with room to spare and could therefore reduce the scale of the austerity measures set to hit the economy.\" 0930: Germany's private sector grew at a faster rate in August, boosted by stronger-than-expected growth among manufacturers, a survey released on Friday showed. Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged 0.3 points higher to 54.0 in August, marking the 28th consecutive month of expansion in the Eurozone's largest economy and comfortably above the 50 threshold that indicates expansion. \n0915: The ongoing crisis in Greece has dampened consumer confidence in Germany, an industry poll revealed on Friday. The closely-watched GfK (Swiss: GFK.SW - news ) consumer confidence index for September slid 0.2 points to 9.9, against expectations for an unchanged reading, as the optimism among consumers was hit by a minor set-back in August. \n0905 : Far-left members of Greece's ruling Syriza party have revealed plans to form a splinter party, Popular Unity, following the resignation of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and calling of snap elections overnight. On Friday, President Prokopis Pavlopoulos formally gave the conservative opposition a chance to form a new coalition government after Tsipras's government resigned. \n0900 : UK stocks dropped after Greek prime minister Alex Tsipras stood down, paving the way for new elections. According to Greek media reports on Friday, as many as 25 rebel MPs from the main party Syriza are now planning to break away and form a new party. Just after 0900 BST, the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 were both down 0.5%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T05:54:49.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
