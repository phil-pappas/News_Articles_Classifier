Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said Bronwyn Bishop's career in Parliament is likely at an end altogether, after allegations she misused expenses on chartered flights, helicopter rides, weddings and arts events forced her to resign as Speaker.\nMr Abbott has also admitted he personally would pay a price for the scandal, along with his government, when asked why it took three weeks since the allegations arose for her to be sacked from the role.\nWhile Mrs Bishop was forced to tender her resignation from her role as Speaker on Sunday afternoon , Mr Abbott said on Sunday she would be allowed to remain on the backbench as the member for Mckellar.\nNow, it appears even that position is in doubt.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott says Speaker Bronwyn Bishop is truly sorry for the entitlements controversy. Andrew Meares \"She has made some serious mistakes, she was the one who paid the highest price. She's lost a position that she loved and it's likely her career in the parliament is substantially at an end,\" Mr Abbott said.\nThe comments also come in the wake of a strident opinion piece from former Treasurer, Peter Costello, who called on her to to retire from public life, saying she was \"arrogant\" and \"hopelessly out of touch\".\nBefore forcing her to resign, Mr Abbott had said the scandal was resolved when she initially pledged to pay back the funds for her $5,277 helicopter ride from Melbourne to Geelong.\nBut on Tuesday Mr Abbott admitted it had been damaging.\n \"I accept whenever things like this arise there is a price to pay the government has inevitably paid a price, and I dare say a little personal price for me,\" Mr Abbott said.\nThe Prime Minister said he hope this would be the last time his government is hit by such expenses scandal.\nQuestioned on ABC radio in Adelaide, Mr Abbott said his move to appoint Mrs Bishop in 2013 was not a 'captains pick', as it was seen at the time.\n\"You can scoff away there, fair enough, fair enough, gents, but look it has always been a matter for the party room,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-04T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:07:57.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
