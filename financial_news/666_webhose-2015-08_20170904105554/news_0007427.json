Spot gold was up one per cent at $US1,128.66 an ounce, having touched a one-month high at $US1,131.90. Traders noted strong resistance at $US1,135. US gold futures for December delivery settled up one per cent at $US1,127.90 an ounce. Expectations that the Fed is on track to increase rates for the first time in nearly a decade helped push gold to five and a half-year lows last month. Rising rates lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar. However, mixed US data and worries over global growth and stability after China devalued the yuan last week, dampened that speculation, allowing gold to recover. \"The minutes show the Fed was concerned about disinflationary pressures coming from China before China's move to allow its currency to depreciate,\" said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer of Merk Investments in Palo Alto, California. \"As such, the market appears to price in that a September rate hike is now less likely, providing support to the price of gold.\" The US dollar extended losses after the minutes were released, dropping as much as 0.7 per cent. Spot platinum was up 1.7 per cent at $US1,007 an ounce and palladium was up 2.1 per cent at $US606.72, though neither was far from multi-year lows reached earlier this month. Miner and commodities trader Glencore posted a 29 per cent fall in first-half earnings just a day after saying it was considering closing its Eland platinum mine in South Africa due to falling prices. \"The mine produced about 35,000 ounces of platinum in 2014, but was expected to expand significantly,\" Macquarie said in a note. Silver was up 2.5 per cent at $US15.23 an ounce, recouping some losses after it tumbled nearly three per cent on Tuesday, its biggest one-day loss since early July.
