It's a case of business 101: you raise money, you invest money, you grow (hopefully), you make a profit and that generates a return for investors.\" \nUber has aggressively expanded across the world in recent years, but is investing heavily in technology, as well as marketing and legal fees, as it attempts to win over regulators and public opinion. \nThe company is accused by many opponents of breaking the law, abusing employment rights , and overstating the benefits of working for the company. Its ability to undercut traditional taxi services has, however, won it a legion of fans. \nGawker's documents showed that its costs and expenses in the second quarter of 2014, at $163.8m, outstripped those in the whole of 2013. \nUber has been raising huge amounts of money at regular intervals. Last week, it reportedly raised $1bn at a $51bn valuation . This makes it the highest-valued startup in the world, equalling Facebook's record before it went public. \nSuch huge investments mean the company is unlikely to be too troubled by its losses, especially with revenues growing rapidly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:19:40.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
