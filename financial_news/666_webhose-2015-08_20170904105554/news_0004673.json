Photo by Max Donner \n“Guest agrees to permit Carrier to inspect any and all baggage or other items with or without the Guest being present at any time.” Is this policy from the Soviet era 1980 Moscow Olympics ? Or is it from the Gestapo supervised 1936 Berlin Olympics? Unfortunately, it is actually part of the standard contract written by the carrier slotted to provide floating hotel services for visitors to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. These kind of inconsistencies challenge confidentiality and free speech commitments made to journalists covering Rio 2016 . Third party baggage inspection could conflict with renewed efforts by sports federation leaders to curb match fixing. These kinds of details are at the tip of an iceberg of issues that the Rio 2016 Hospitality Working Group needs to address during this week’s visit of the Rio 2016 Co-ordination Commission. \nCould it get worse? Yes. The same carrier’s contract makes it effectively impossible for journalists, coaches, referees, sports federation officials or sports agents to fulfill their own professional obligations during the 2016 Summer Olympics. The contract effectively bans so-called “tools of trade.” Specifically, the contract insists that “no tools of trade will be presented to the carrier within any receptacle or container as baggage….the Guest further warrants that he or she has not carried onto the vessel goods or articles for the purpose of trade or commerce.” Does this mean that parents of athletes who have to work as their managers because teenagers under 18 from many countries are not allowed to enter into contracts on their own will have to pass up lucrative sponsorship deals? This is just one of dozens of examples of standard contracts for leisure travel that do not fit the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro or the affiliated test events that have already started. \nAnd EducationFirst, the official language training supplier for Rio2016 is spotlighting another issue that makes understanding and fixing these kinds of inconsistencies more difficult. EF advertisements are using the label “Gringophobia” to tag the large community of sophisticated Brazilians who have an emotional problem with learning English well enough to review and amend contracts. This capability is needed to comply with standard operating procedures for Olympic host cities. \nAnd now there is another issue that the Rio 2016 Hospitality Committee needs to grapple with. This August is the first month that substantial inventories of accommodations just before and during the Rio 2016 Olympics have been made available for online booking by market leaders Expedia, Travelocity, and Booking.com, a subsidiary of Priceline. All of these are U.S. owned and managed companies that have a symbolic role to play as standard bearers for the U.S. business community. But sports travelers trying to secure space this month are reporting “Heads I win, Tails you loose” style inconsistencies. Individual consumers receive written confirmations that “this reservation is non-refundable and cannot be cancelled.” But then the online travel agencies come back and say that they are terribly sorry but there is no more space and they will be pleased to substitute another room nearby. This is awkward enough in any case, but the topography of Rio de Janeiro often means “nearby accommodations of the same size” are actually located in difficult to access hillside areas that require walking up 150 steps just to get to the front door. \nIs there a solution? Yes, but it can be expensive. Several official ticket resellers approved by Rio 2016 also offer all-inclusive travel packages. Cosport is the Rio 2016 Official Ticket Reseller for the United States and is already accepting reservations for a variety of packages that include hotel stays secured by blocks of rooms. Cartan Global is an authorized Rio 2016 ticket reseller for 36 countries and is also making all-inclusive packages available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T23:16:01.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
