After all, only 19% of working Americans have upped their retirement savings over the past year, according to a new Bankrate survey. Plus, 10% haven't put any money into a retirement account in 2015 or 2014. \"With millions of Americans behind in their retirement savings, it is important not only to save, but to save more each year,\" said Greg McBride, CFA, Bankrate's chief financial analyst. \"Even for those saving the maximum, 401(k) contribution limits increased for 2015, affording the opportunity to put more away for retirement.\" If you find yourself in a fog when it comes to retirement, steer clear of these calamitous mistakes: 1. Assuming the Markets Will Always Go Up Just because you have $100,000 sitting in a 401(k) doesn't mean it's going to be worth $200,000 in five or ten years. In fact, the broad S&P 500 is up around 200% since its March 2009 low, leaving many analysts wondering just how much steam is left in the bull market. Not to mention, the markets await the Federal Reserve's looming rate hike. Low rates for six and half years helped spark this bull market. \"If you are drawing a 4% income stream off of a $500,000 portfolio, that nets you $20,000 a year,\" said financial planners Kevin Houser and Gary Plessl, authors of The Book On Retirement: Are You Ready for the Second Half of Your Financial Life? (Richter, 2015). But if the market crashes and your $500,000 turns into $250,000, to maintain that $20,000 a year, you'll need to draw 8% from your portfolio. \"Unless the market recovers very quickly, your portfolio will likely dwindle down to nothing,\" they said. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:04:04.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
