Photo: Reuters\nHedge funds are a force for good but mum and dad investors should steer well clear. That is the view of one of the word's academic experts on hedge funds, NYU Stern School of Business Professor Stephen Brown.\nProfessor Brown, an Australian who has had a long and distinguished academic career in the United States spoke to The Australian Financial Review about some of the myths about hedge funds. While he believes hedge funds serve a useful purpose in financial markets as 'provider of liquidity', he is concerned that retail investors in Australia are able to invest directly in some hedge funds without the resources, knowledge and abilities to use them effectively.\nThe main issue confronting Australia is investor suitability and is something that needs to be addressed.\nProfessor Stephen Brown, NYU Stern School of Business \"I have done a huge amount of research on hedge funds. I am not a high net-worth investor and I'm not allowed to invest in hedge funds [in the US] and I know more about them than almost anyone,\" he told the Financial Review .\n\"But retail investors [in Australia] can. You have to be prepared to do the operational due diligence, to know that in a liquidity crisis hedge funds will lose money and to invest in a diversified portfolio. If you can't meet those criteria you shouldn't be investing in hedge funds.\nAdvertisement \"The main issue confronting Australia is investor suitability and is something that needs to be addressed,\" he said.\nProfessor Brown was in Australia as a guest of the Centre for International Finance and Regulation and will be returning to Monash University who initially funded his studies in the United States. He says a portfolio approach to investing in hedge funds can actually reduce investment risks.\n\"They are risky but if you construct a portfolio of hedge funds you reduce your risk to about half of the S&P500; as the returns are gained from rents providing liquidity.\"\nRisks One of the biggest hurdles for retail investors, he says, is to conduct the extensive due diligence in hedge funds, the costs of which make more sense for large institutions to wear. But he says there are many instances of large pension funds failing to detect problems because they were unwilling to spend the time and money to investigate fund risks before handing over tens of millions of dollars.\nBrown said the decision last year by US pension fund CalPERS to exit hedge fund investments presented a watershed moment for the industry. In 2000 it was CalPERS decision to invest in hedge funds that gave the green light to other institutions, setting up the industry for enormous growth beyond managing money for the super wealthy. But last year it decided to turn its back on hedge funds for good and Brown expects more institutions may follow suit.\n\"With the high fees obscure investments and strange strategies, [they asked] 'why are we bothering?' That was a killer blow.\"\nThe typical 2 and 20 fee – hedge funds typically charge a 2 per cent management fee and a 20 per cent fee for outperformance – has been questioned as warping incentives for hedge funds to take risks with client funds. But Professor Brown says his research suggests that hedge fund managers tend to err on the side of caution, unless they are under pressure.\n\"If you take too much risk you increase the probability the fund will fail. But losing a mandate is what you don't want to do and is more serious in terms of bottom line consideration. It's really the funds that are borderline that jack up the risk. If you are at the borderline of failing you'll double down.\"\nBrown is also an advocate for allowing short selling and believes that state intervention banning short selling often proves to have the opposite impact in making markets more unstable. When he visited Malaysia in 1997 as then president Mahathir Mohammad was contemplating a ban on short selling, he told journalists such a move would trigger a 31 per cent fall if it were announced. The market duly fell 30 per cent.\nHe had his doubts recent moves by Chinese policymakers to ban short selling will be effective in calming markets.\n\"The role of shorting is to provide hedging opportunities so if you can't hedge you have to get out of the market, and sell. Shorting is risky for an individual but for an institution it's quite different.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:40:52.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
