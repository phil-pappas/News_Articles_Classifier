This is the party who had a plank in their platform about damming the St. Lawrence River for Hydro Electric power and in Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s riding, ran another candidate with the name Pierre Trudeau (I got to vote in that election in that very riding). Their first plank for this election in their platform? Nationalize Tim Horton’s ! Glad to see the return to common sense politics. \nI was glad to see Steadyhand come out with the commentary Good Debt, Bad Debt which points out the alarming rise in Canadian debt. Tom Bradley’s commentaries about the Banks encouraging an already heavily in debt society that there is a concept of “ Good Debt ” distresses him, and I agree. With low interest rates about to go away, what is going to happen when the rates go up? Thanks to reader @Gene2u for pointing this out, very good article. \nThe rest of the parties seem very excited about the Mike Duffy trial, except for Mr. Harper who hopes we aren’t watching it. We’ve lost 1 or 2 candidates thanks to unfortunate tweets in their past (guess I’ll never be running for public office) as well, that is about all that has been going on in the election. \nGas prices continue to drop, which is bound to screw up the CPI for the coming months, but with oil sitting at below $40 a barrel, it is about time that gas prices dropped. Is this doing any good for Canada? Depends on where you live, if you live in Alberta, NO ! \nDid you realize there are 77 Expiration Dates that you Should Track ? Time Magazine has an interesting list for you. My Writings for Week Ending August 21st \nThe summer is slowly coming to a close and an entertaining fall lies ahead (with plenty of election shenanigans and tom-foolery) : Keep this in mind if you want to change your Bank Before the dawn of oppressive bank fees my idea of having a bank account at whatever bank that was near my work was a great idea, however since high bank fees became the norm, A Great Financial Idea Dies . As if I really needed more reasons to espouse changing banks if you are being treated shabbily, however somehow I found More Reasons to Change Your Bank . Rob Carrick did mention in his piece in the Globe and Mail Nine castles that cost less than a Vancouver condo my RDSP: Banking Challenge Ignored , and no bank has taken me up on my challenge. \nI am also mentioned in this fun article too: Hey, that's me! In the article that is, oh and Millenials shouldn't move back in with their parents either! https://t.co/0eQE2fXg9w \n— Big Cajun Man (aw) (@bigcajunman) August 17, 2015 Plenty of Good Money Stories from this Week \nDo you have a small business? If so, how are you going to exit the business when you retire or for other reasons? If you haven’t thought about that (much) the Blunt Bean Counter went into his archives to give us Estate Freeze – A Tax Solution for the Succession of a Small Business , and it points to a bunch of other useful resources in this area. \nBarry from Money We Have has written about Bad Financial Advisors already (on this very site), but wants to ensure you don’t get ensnared by one of these dastardly creatures so he wrote Recognizing Bad Financial Advisors . Last week I highlighted a couple of frugal NFL players , and this week Mark from My Own Advisor brings us Frugal Athletes – Including One Who Lives in a Van , which highlights still more frugal athletes. \nMichael James asks a good question (that I made the flippant comment, “Who care, you are dead”) What Happens to My CPP if I die Early ? Again, my only advice on the topic is don’t die early (as with all retirement questions). Speaking of CPP, Mark from 2nd Career Search implies Americans Envy the Canada Pension Plan ? Not really, but it is still a very interesting read (pension envy, is that a real thing?). With even more retirement talk Boomer and Echo had a Guest Writer talk about I’d Rather Be Fishing: My Early Retirement Story , personally I’d rather everyone else was fishing too, so there were less cars on the road! Breaking Mortgages \nGoing into Preet’s archives for this one, how much will it cost to break your mortgage ?
