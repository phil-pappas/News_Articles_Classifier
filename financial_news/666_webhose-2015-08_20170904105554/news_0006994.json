We can't think of a better group to be building for,\" said Ted Livingston, founder and chief executive of Kik. \nLivingston said Tencent, which operates the WeChat messaging service in China, was the best partner for his firm because it allows users to connect with friends as well as shop, order taxis, and play games, among other things. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was clear they understood chat deeply, making them a great sounding board,\" he said in a blog post. \n\"When we met the Tencent team in China, it became clear that we had a shared vision. We agreed that someone would do in the West what WeChat was doing in China. The only question was who. We both believe it could be Kik.\" \nThe Ontario-based group launched in 2009 has 51 employees, according to its website. \nIn its mission statement, Kik says \"the smartphone era represents a transformation as big as the rise of the PC or the creation of the Internet\" and that \"chat is at the core of the smartphone era.\" \nTencent, in its most recent quarterly report, saw its net profit surge by 25 percent buoyed by growth in online advertising revenue and from WeChat. \nWeChat, also known as \"weixin\" or micro-message in Chinese, has reached 600 million in monthly active users since its launch in 2011. \nThe app is more versatile than US rival WhatsApp, allowing its users to find each other by shaking their smartphones, book and pay for taxis, as well as send text, photos, videos and voice messages (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T02:37:23.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
