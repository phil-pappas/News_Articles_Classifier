Here, in five charts, is a look at this week’s financial-market highlights. \n#1: China Devalues the Yuan \nChina’s abrupt move Tuesday to devalue the yuan triggered the tightly controlled currency’s biggest one-day loss in two decades. It was a policy U-turn that signaled Beijing is growing increasingly worried about slowing growth and which instantly made Chinese goods more competitive with American products, drawing industry complaints and straining ties. \n#2: And Markets Shudder \nMarkets world-wide were jolted by the devaluation, dealing another blow to battered commodities prices amid the prospect of crimped demand from one of the world’s biggest raw-materials consumers. Many currencies and shares were battered by the resurgent worries about global growth. But the move delivered a windfall to investors that bet against the free-floating currencies of China’s regional trading partners. By week’s end, the yuan had steadied, but Chinese stock futures signaled that pessimism persisted. \n#3: Oil Slips From Bad to Worse \nEven before oil slid to fresh six-year lows following China’s yuan devaluation, futures markets signaled that traders see prices staying lower for longer. Prices for delivery in a year or two have fallen even more than prices for near-term delivery. Many producers are balking at locking in prices at current levels, and could be forced to cut back further on new drilling if prices remain below their break-even costs. \n#4: While Property Climbs to Heady Levels \nOn the other end of the boom-bust cycle: commercial real estate, where prices are hitting records, fueling concerns that the global property market is overheating. The valuations of office buildings sold in London, Hong Kong, Osaka and Chicago hit record highs in the second quarter, and reached post-2009 highs in New York, Los Angeles, Berlin and Sydney. Low interest rates and a flood of cash being pumped into economies by central banks have made commercial real estate look attractive compared with bonds and other assets. \n#5: And Deal-Making Sets a Record Pace \nAnother go-go market: mergers and acquisitions, which are on pace this year to hit the highest level on record, thanks to a buying spree from companies on the hunt for growth in a sluggish economy. Takeover-deal announcements would reach $4.58 trillion this year if the current pace of activity continues, according to data provider Dealogic, comfortably above the $4.29 trillion notched in 2007.
