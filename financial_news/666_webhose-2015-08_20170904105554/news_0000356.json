As a result, its transits are only visible to astronomers 9 per cent of the time.\nIn fact, had researches not detected the planet now, their next chance to do so would not have come until 2066.\n“It’s amazing how fortunate we were in catching it at the right time. It’s a good reminder that there’s always a value in checking again,” Kane said.\nKepler-453b blocked 0.5 per cent of its host stars’ light during the transit, which enabled researchers to calculate that the planet’s radius is 6.2 times that of Earth, or about 60 per cent larger than Neptune.\nIts size indicates it is a gas giant, rather than a rocky planet, and thus unable to have life despite being in the habitable zone, researchers said.\n“But it could have moons that are rocky, which means you could have life on the moons in this system,” Kane said.\nAny inhabitants of the system would see two suns in their sky – much like the view from the planet Tatooine in the movie “Star Wars” – orbiting each other every 27 days.\nThe larger star is about 94 per cent the size of our sun, the smaller star only 20 per cent the size of our sun and much cooler, emitting less than 1 per cent of the larger star’s energy. Kepler-453b takes 240 days to orbit its host stars.\n“We didn’t know circumbinary systems could exist until Kepler came along, and since then we’ve been finding them in larger numbers,” Kane said. The first two-star system was discovered by the Kepler Mission in 2011.\nThe research appears in the Astrophysical Journal.\n 11, 2015 2:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T04:07:00.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
