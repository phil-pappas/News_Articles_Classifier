What about those who don't or can't have children? \nThere is huge interest in the new “family home allowance”, the mechanism by which a couple’s joint £650,000 inheritance tax allowance is topped up with a separate, £350,000-per-couple allowance applicable only to their home. \nIt means families with expensive properties can pass a total of £1m to their children tax free. \nMost readers support the move, based on your emails and comments. \n- Inheritance tax changes: the 7 key questions \n- New IHT rules: we answer your questions \nBut there is already a stream growing stronger as more families grasp how the changes will apply to their own circumstances of complaints. \nThe clearest objection is that the new £175,000-per-person allowance is not available to people without children. The tax break is for the family home and, crucially, it applies only where the family home is given to children or grandchildren. \nSo a couple with no children effectively face a £140,000 bill (40pc death tax applied to £350,000) which couples with children would not have to pay. \nThis exclusion of the childless has incensed some, including one reader who said: “Many of us have found our wealth inflated by house price rises over which we had no control. The Chancellor’s proposals are designed to recognise and address this issue, so why are those of us without children being excluded? \n“In any other area of life, such discrimination against the childless, and, by implication, our nieces and nephews who are our legatees, would be unthinkable. Why should anyone, family or not, to whom I wish to leave my money be financially disadvantaged simply because my wife and I are childless?” \nIt is a valid question. \nOf course, the tax system has long been used by government to shape family patterns and behaviour. \nThe ability to pass assets freely between spouses, on death or before, with no tax consequences is a major tax incentive to marry albeit an unromantic one. \nThe Conservatives, acting on their “commitment to recognise marriage in the tax system”, went further with their marriage allowance, effective since April. It enables couples to transfer unused personal tax allowances from a low earner to their higher-earning spouse. \nThe value of the marriage allowance is small, however, at a maximum of £212 per couple. \nIncentivising marriage is one thing. Making a massive £350,000 tax concession available only to those with children is another. Getting married is for most couples a choice. Having children, for many, is not. \nThe Government has costed its inheritance tax proposals and calculates the bill at nearly £1bn for the tax year 2020‑21. \nHow much more would the policy cost if the benefit applied not just to home owners’ “direct descendants” but to any beneficiaries? \nThe numbers aren’t available but I suspect the figure would not be much greater. \nWhat would clearly be simpler is if the basic inheritance tax threshold rose to £500,000 per individual, whatever their married or parental status. \nAs I’ve written here before, tax breaks are only as good as they are workable and fair. \nrichard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T12:44:02.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
