He used to be able to spot a rabbit from an impossible distance and now he stares lovingly into cupboards and mirrors for no apparent reason. All of his senses are retreating, and even friands have lost their appeal. He is on his way out of our lives.\nHe is and has been just the best dog ever and I don’t know how we’re all going to live without him.\nOh Peanut, you’re going to break our hearts. Source: Supplied\nLike so many people with pets, we’ve imagined a million things about the life of Peanut. We’ve made up stories about what he’s thinking, we’ve given him a personality and played games with our ideas about what he thinks of us.\nWe gave him a place in our family that helped us to fill in some of our missing pieces. He’s been our clown, our little brother and our conscience. We won’t just miss him when he dies, we’ll also miss the whole imaginary world we lived in with him, and we’ll be lost for a time, not sure how to find a way to do the things he did for us without him.\nIf you let them in, animals can open up parts of your heart and mind that humans can’t reach. Animals take up a space inside you that is both safer than what you can find with people and wilder. And from that safe, wild space they invite you to come home to yourself. You don’t have to do anything special, be anyone special; you just have to accept that space they’re offering you. When your animals die, you don’t just miss them, you also miss the place in yourself that they helped you to find.\nAnd sometimes an animal comes into your life at just the right time and helps you to put yourself back together and profoundly comforts you, giving you someone to care for and touch, bringing a kind of loving routine with them and making you feel that you’re OK and that you matter. And when that happens, it’s a big job after they die to come to the point where you can imagine those things about yourself without their constancy and their warm body to remind you.\nThere’s also a strange kind of guilt you can feel when your pet dies that makes the sadness afterwards kind of sticky and uncomfortable. When they’re dying, or they disappear or have a terrible accident, you’re faced with how dependent they are on you, on all of us really, and how vulnerable and voiceless they are.\nYou have to make all the decisions, hoping that what you do is what they would want, and because you never really know because they can never really tell you, it’s sometimes hard to settle peacefully into feeling you did the best that you could, which can complicate your feelings of loss.\nThe creatures we share our lives with carry so many of our emotional burdens; our desire to be loved and accepted, our hopes for a loving family, our childhood feelings and past losses.\nWhen Peanut dies, he will die as himself, a loving, emotionally astute, diffident and cultured dog, but he will also die as all the things we imagined him to be and all the things we hoped for when we first brought him home.\nWe will be sad beyond measure.\nSweet boy.
