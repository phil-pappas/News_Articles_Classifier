There were 34 convictions in 2014-15, 41 in 2013-14 and 10 in 2012-13, respectively. \"The existing laws to deal with evasion of direct taxes include Income Tax Act and the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015,\" he said. Sinha said the Black Money Imposition of Tax Act provides for substantially enhanced amount of penalty for failure to furnish the return of income by a person being resident in India. \"It also provides for rigorous imprisonment up to 7 years with fine for willful failure to furnish the return of income in applicable cases,\" he added. Further, the minister informed that to curb domestic black money, the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Bill, 2015 has been introduced to amend the Benami Transactions Act, 1988. The proposed amendment bill on its enactment will enable confiscation of benami property and provide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding of tax evaded money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate , he added.
