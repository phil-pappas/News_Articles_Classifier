But now with council and developers backing it, it has become one of Sydney's largest project,\" McGrath agent, Ben Forsyth, said.\n\"The Green Square project will take seven to eight years to complete and so value will not peak overnight. There will provide steady growth. There is definitely value in the area and it is worth getting into it in the next 12 months.\"\nMr Forsyth's $2 million sale of 92 Portman Street in nearby Zetland with fellow agent Mark Lauzon scaled a new residential sale record for the suburb.\nA local family purchased the four-bedroom home to take advantage of the Green Square amenities.\nSydney clears 78.1 per cent The last week of winter prefaced what would be a strong spring.\nAuction clearance rates was 75.4 per cent across the capital cities higher than 72.9 last week.
