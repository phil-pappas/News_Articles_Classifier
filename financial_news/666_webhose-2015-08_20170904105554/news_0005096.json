They argue that “all national banking systems, in the event of a crisis, behave as though they were de facto state-owned by their home government” and that \"the greatest threat to national solvency is likely the private debt of these banks”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:50:56.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
