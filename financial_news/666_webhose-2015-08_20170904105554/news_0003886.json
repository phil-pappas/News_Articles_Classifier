Just Retirement (LSE: JRG.L - news ) shareholders will own roughly 60% of the combined group and Partnership the remainder after its shareholders receive 0.834 Just Retirement shares for each of theirs, valuing the group at £668.5m. The deal, which has been backed by both boards and both companies' majority private equity shareholders, will be put to shareholder vote, as well as a proposal to raise £150m. \nJust Retirement's chief executive officer Rodney Cook and finance director Simon Thomas will take the same roles in the enlarged group, with Partnership's current chief financial officer David Richardson taking the role of deputy group CEO, while the company's current CEO Steve Groves steps down. \nThe merger is expected to result in pre-tax cost savings of at least £40m per year by 2018 but are likely to require one-off integration costs of £60m over two years. \nBoth firms said the fundamental reforms to the UK annuities market introduced by the government in its 2014 budget - where pensioners were given greater access to their savings - had led to sales of the products falling by 42% from £11.9bn in 2013 to £6.9bn in 2014. \nBoth companies responded fairly promptly to the changes, reducing their respective cost bases and focusing on their defined benefit de-risking propositions, such that today defined benefit de-risking accounts for around half of the new business sales for both companies. \"This transaction represents a unique opportunity to accelerate the existing strategy of both businesses,\" said Just Retirement chairman Tom Cross Brown. \"Our two businesses will be bigger, stronger and more efficient together, which we believe will allow us to deliver better returns to both policyholders and shareholders.\" Partnership chairman Chris Gibson-Smith added: \"Both businesses have at their core a focus on using outstanding intellectual property and underwriting expertise to deliver better value products and improved customer outcomes within defined benefit, UK retail retirement income and international markets.\" Partnership also published first-half results, which comfortably bested expectations, with new business, IFRS operating profits and MCEV NAV all ahead of the market's forecasts as new sales of individually annuities increased by over a third in the second quarter compared to the first. \nAnalyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: \"We believe this deal makes enormous sense, with both private equity partners offering irrevocables. The cost savings are material and leave the merged group, post the equity raise, with the firepower to hit a market which we expect to grow considerably in the coming years (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T14:38:45.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
