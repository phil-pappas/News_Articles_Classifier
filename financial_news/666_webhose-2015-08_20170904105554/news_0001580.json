The gas and condensate field was discovered in 2010, according to Gazprom.\nDouglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer in Washington, said the addition \"represents a new arrow in the quiver of U.S. sanctions on Russia.\"\nHe said the addition means that no U.S. origin items or non-U.S. origin items containing more than 25 percent U.S. content can be exported or re-exported to the field without a Commerce Department license, which he said was not likely to be issued.\n\"This goes beyond the current Russia sanctions, which prohibit certain items to be exported to Russia when they are used directly or indirectly in the exploration for, or production of, oil or gas in Russian deepwater (greater than 500 feet),\" Jacobsen said in an email.\nThe action builds on those taken since last year by the United States and the European Union after Russia's annexation of Crimea and its use of force in Ukraine.\nLast week, the United States imposed additional Russia and Ukraine-related sanctions, adding associates of a billionaire Russian gas trader, Crimean port operators and former Ukrainian officials to its list of those it is penalizing in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.
