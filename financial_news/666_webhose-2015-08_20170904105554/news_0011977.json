The Senate has a responsibility to shine a spotlight it.\n“The more evidence I see, the more appalled I am at how consumers have been taken advantage of by this industry,” Senator Dastyari said. More give, less take ... But will he have time to appear? NAB CEO Andrew Thorburn. Picture: Supplied Source: News Corp Australia\nLast week, the Reserve Bank of Australia told the inquiry that some interest rates were inexplicably high, while consumer advocacy groups said there was a need to tighten lending criteria and raise minimum repayments.\n“It would be unprecedented for the Committee to need to use its compulsion powers; any decision to use those powers would be a matter for the committee,” Senator Dastyari said. “I would hope we won’t need to use our powers in this instance.” Happy to take questions ...
