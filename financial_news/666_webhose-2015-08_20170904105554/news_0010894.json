The bank’s analysts said the airline was likely to reach its 2020 goal for earnings growth as early as next year, helped by falling fuel prices as well as cost savings and its deal to buy Aer Lingus (Other OTC: AELGF - news ) . \n“We believe IAG provides rare evidence that structural change is achievable in ‘legacy’ airlines,” the analysts said. \nRising in its slipstream was EasyJet , up 2p to £16.77, to make the budget carrier one of just six blue-chip stocks to gain value in an otherwise downbeat day of trading. \nThe FTSE 100 closed 102 points or 1.7pc lower at 5,979.2. Taking its cues from a late sell-off in the US markets on Tuesday, the index was in the red for all but a few minutes during the trading day. \nWall Street opened higher, raising hopes that the US markets would snap a six-day selling streak, but it was not enough to rouse the London market from its rout for long. \nThe People’s Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) (PBOC) finally moved to cut interest rates and ease lending rules for banks on Tuesday, before pouring another 140bn yuan (£14.1bn) into the country’s banks yesterday . However, the measures were not enough to revive confidence in traders fearful of what the Chinese stock market crash means for the wider global economy. \nThe Shanghai Composite fell 1.3pc yesterday, easing off from a 15pc fall in the first two days of the week. The index has lost about 40pc of its value since June, having previously doubled in price in the first few months of the year. \nTrading volumes in London are still elevated, although yesterday they started to ease back towards normal levels for the traditionally quiet summer months. Yesterday, about 1.2m trades took place in London’s order book, twice the average volume of August 2014, as investors reacted to the continued downward pressure on stock prices. On Monday, more than 1.7m trades took place, followed by 1.3m on Tuesday. \nTaking its place among the handful of rising blue-chip stocks yesterday was the pump-maker Weir Group, gaining 26p or 2pc to £13.58. During a tough year for companies related to the oil sector as crude prices slumped from their peak, Weir’s shares have halved in value. \nYesterday, rival oil services firm Schlumberger (Hanover: SCL.HA - news ) announced a $14.8bn takeover of Cameron, raising the prospect of further deals in the sector. \nCommodity firms resumed their place on the list of the biggest fallers following Tuesday’s relief rally for most stocks. Silver miner Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) was the biggest loser, down 7pc, or 45p, to 594.5p. \nBG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) , the oil firm being taken over by Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , dropped 3.8pc to 923.9p, while its suitor fell 2.9pc to £15.86. The declines mean that the proposed takeover is now worth £10.89 to BG shareholders, moving further away from the £13.50 cash-and-stock offer that Shell made in April. \nWPP (Swiss: OXWPP.SW - news ) , the advertising giant that has spent £467m on takeovers this year, fell 3.7pc or 51p to £13.11 after striking a cautious note in its interim results. \nThe group said it remained “unabashed bulls” on China but that the recent stock market collapse could create short-term problems. \nPaddy Power (LSE: PAP.L - news ) and Betfair became the latest betting shops to announce a high-stakes merger , fuelling both sets of shares. Paddy Power rose 18.5pc to 93.02p, while its future partner gained 20.4pc to £31.34. \nFeeling left out was William Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) , which declined 2.9pc to close at 255.9p. \nRoyal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) eked out a gain of 2.9p to close at 324.1p following an upgrade from Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) analysts to “overweight”. \nRSA fell 2p to 512.5p, ending a positive run this week after takeover suitor Zurich declared its interest in buying the insurance group for 550p per share. \nPanmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes wrote that the takeover is “all over bar the shouting”, adding that “RSA shareholders should grab the cash offer”. \n“We also think it unlikely that an alternative offer will be forthcoming, partly given the mooted offer price and partly due to the size of RSA’s pension deficit,” he noted. \nElsewhere in insurance windfalls, Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) chief executive Nigel Wilson became the owner of 291,765 more shares in the firm as part of his long-term incentive plan vested earlier this week, the firm announced yesterday. \nAt yesterday’s price of 248p, the award was worth £724,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T22:03:30.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
