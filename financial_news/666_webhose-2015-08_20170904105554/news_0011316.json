Peter Braig Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Australia must have a proper review of the entire retirement income system, including pension and superannuation taxes, and it needs a more sustainable tax base if debt and deficit are to be tackled and productivity lifted, the National Reform Summit will recommend.\nWednesday's summit, sponsored by The Australian Financial Review , The Australian and KPMG, involves the nation's pre-eminent business, industry, welfare and seniors groups, and the ACTU, and was called amid frustration at the glacial pace of reform at the political level.\nIn a statement agreed to by an inner group of participants, the summit says \"reform is now urgent\" and challenges will soon become crises unless addressed.\n\"We agree that too much of the current debate is consumed by special interest lobbying and single-issue politics at the expense of the broader community interest,\" the statement says.\nIt cites the priorities as lifting productivity growth and workforce participation, tax reform, fiscal policy to drive economic growth, and a sustainable retirement income system.\nIn a shot at the major political parties, the summit calls for a holistic approach to retirement incomes \"rather than the piecemeal changes and proposed changes that have marked the political debate to date\".\nLabor proposes changing superannuation taxes for the highest earners and well-off retirees, while the government has made cuts to the pension for better-off self-funded retirees but has vowed to never touch super.\nBut the summit urges that agrees \"reforms should consider changes in both superannuation tax arrangements and age pension arrangements with particular attention to their interaction to improve fairness, efficiency, adequacy and sustainability\".\n 'Widespread concern' at super It suggests super tax concessions are being used as means to minimise tax, rather than saving for retirement, and that this comes at a cost to government and should be curtailed.\n\"There is widespread concern that the way these concessions are delivered is inconsistent with the purpose of the retirement income system,\" it says.\n\"Any review should ensure the design of the tax concessions is consistent with the objectives of the retirement income system.\"\nOn taxation, it says that without significant reform, debt and deficit will linger and holes in the social safety net will continue to widen.\nIt alludes to, but does not specify, the need to increase the GST , recommends replacing stamp duties with a land tax, and takes aim at capital gains tax concessions for housing investors and, indirectly, negative gearing.\n\"Weaknesses are emerging in our public revenue base. These have been papered over temporarily by income tax bracket creep at the Commonwealth level and a surge in housing stamp duties in some states, but neither is a sustainable source of public revenue,\" it says.\n\"If current policy settings persist, federal and state governments are likely to post substantial deficits for many years to come.\"\nTax on savings unfair The statement says doing nothing on tax or tinkering \"is not an option\".\nIt speaks of the need to get rid of \"highly-inefficient transaction-based taxes that impose an unnecessary drag on the economy\" and to lower company tax to more competitive levels.\nUnder principles for reform, it advocates replacing stamp duties on conveyances and insurance with more efficient, uniform taxes, such as a land tax, as has been undertaken in the ACT.\nIn a shot at capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing, it says: \"Different sources of individual investment income should be taxed as consistently as possible, such as capital gains and related deductions.\"\nLabor has promised to review CGT and negative gearing as part of its housing affordability policy while the government has promised to leave them alone.\nThe statement tiptoes around workplace relations, an area of vehement disagreement between unions and business groups.\n\"Productivity growth is created by generating additional value through innovation, investment and improve workplace practices., not simply by working longer hours or reducing real wages.\"\nBut it also urges flexibility.\n\"Workplace relations arrangements should be responsive to the changing nature of work and meet the needs of the modern workforce.\"\nIn a speech to open the conference, Treasurer Joe Hockey will back this, saying workplace relations will be driven by digital disruption.\n\"Having a debate about deregulating shopping hours is almost redundant given the emergence of 24/7 internet shopping,\" he will say.\nThe groups agree to disagree and what spending should be cut and which taxes increased, but they agree \"the structural budget deficit should be remedied progressively\" to make sure the country retains its fiscal credibility and AAA credit rating while enabling the government to spend money on stimulus at times of economic downturn.\n\"All expenditure programs, including direct expenditures and tax concessions, should be subject to rigorous evaluation to ensure efficiency and effectiveness over time.\"\nProductivity the priority Opposition Leader Bill Shorten will tell the conference there needs to be a collective effort from business and both sides of politics to drive both productivity, which he calls the \"number one reform priority\", and confidence.\nMr Shorten will criticise the summit for ignoring climate change which \"must always be discussed in the context of productivity and reform\".\nHe will say political and industry opposition to renewable energy \"often borders on the hysterical\".\n\"If we don't get serious about tackling climate change, if we don't get serious about investing in renewables, then we cannot say we are serious about economic reform.\"\nâ€‹Prime Minister Tony Abbott will deliver a video message from Cape York while Mr Hockey will tell the forum to be bold but realistic.\n\"Your collective efforts today must deliver real outcomes that consumers understand and are willing to embrace,\" he will say.\n\"The community is not against change, it just wants to make sure that reform has a purpose.\"\nMr Hockey will urge the summit to acknowledge the sovereignty of consumers.\n\"With new technologies, freer markets, less regulation and global and immediate capital flows, consumers are the great reformers and now governments need to make a choice,\" he will say.\n\"Either we can continue to empower consumers and allow them to be sovereign. or we can try to regulate and tax the new emerging economy into a newer version of a 1990 [Holden] Commodore.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:10:09.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
