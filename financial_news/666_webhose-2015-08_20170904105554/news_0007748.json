Conspicuous by its absence is iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ( EEM ). It fails a 0.4% expense ratio cutoff.If you want to speculate on emerging markets for a few days, EEM is a fine vehicle. Its heavy trading volume makes it easy to get in and out of positions. But if you want to own the category for a long time, EEM is just too expensive.EEM and VWO follow slightly different paths. Their portfolios overlap (big holdings in both are Tencent Holdings and China Mobil) but are not identical. You might prefer the Vanguard fund for its better results in the first seven months of 2015, but a smarter reason to prefer it is that it costs less. Performance is a sometime thing. Cost is a permanent thing. It is entirely predictable.Vanguard takes a sweep at the top of this table, with help from low expense ratios and a dose of securities lending. Its FTSE Europe ( VGK ) costs a $10,000 investor only $64 over the course of a decade. The price of its sister fund in the Pacific runs $156.You might want either an occidental or an oriental slant to your portfolio. If you want a worldwide mix in your IRA, you’d probably be better off skipping the entire specialized-foreign category in favor of something from our Diversified International ranking. A large collection of country or regional funds doesn’t make sense except in a taxable account from which losses can be harvested.Rules for the Best ETFs scorecard, and links to 13 categories of funds, can be found here .\nTicker Fund Assets ($ mil) 1 Expense ratio (%) 10-year cost 2 VGK Vanguard FTSE Europe 15,023 0.12 64 VSS Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Sm-Cp 2,608 0.19 83 VPL Vanguard FTSE Pacific 3,090 0.12 156 VWO Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets 43,996 0.15 163 SCHE Schwab Emerging Markets Equity 1,381 0.14 207 IEMG iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets 7,147 0.18 217 SCHC Schwab International Small-Cap Eq 621 0.18 236 IEUR iShares Core MSCI Europe 667 0.14 259 IPAC iShares Core MSCI Pacific 554 0.14 274 FEZ SPDR EURO Stoxx 50 4,750 0.29 275 VNQI Vanguard Global ex-US Real Estate 3,166 0.24 313 EFAV iShares MSCI EAFE Minimum Volatility 2,922 0.2 318 ACWV iShares MSCI All Country World Mini Vol 2,200 0.2 324 CQQQ Guggenheim China Technology 72 0.71 329 EEMV iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Mini Vol 2,575 0.25 381 FEU SPDR Stoxx Europe 50 280 0.29 434 HAO Guggenheim China Small Cap 205 0.76 460 TOK iShares MSCI Kokusai 351 0.25 463 SCZ iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap 5,117 0.4 477 IDLV PowerShares S&P Intl Dev Low Volatil 342 0.25 501 FNDF Schwab Fundamental Intl Lg Co 688 0.32 528 EELV PowerShares S&P Em Mkts Low Volatil 225 0.29 534 ADRD BLDRS Developed Markets 100 ADR 74 0.3 536 ADRE BLDRS Emerging Markets 50 ADR 157 0.3 544 QEMM SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Qual Mix 69 0.3 580 RING iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners 43 0.39 628 EFG iShares MSCI EAFE Growth 2,000 0.4 638 EFV iShares MSCI EAFE Value 2,896 0.4 644 PICK iShares MSCI Glbl Metals & Mining Prdcrs 59 0.39 649 1: July 28, 2015. 2: Cost of holding $10,000 for a decade; assumes 5% growth.
