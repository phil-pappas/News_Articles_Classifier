MGI, announced the launch of a new account deposit product with Banco de Occidente Bank. This new service will allow the customers of the global innovative money transfer and payment services provider to send money directly to all Banco de Occidente accounts in Honduras.MoneyGram has chosen to expand its service with Banco de Occidente Bank since it is one of the largest and most trusted banks in the region. The new product will allow customers to remit funds quickly and at their convenience. \nHonduras appeals to MoneyGram since the region received nearly $3.3 billion in remittances in 2014, most of which was sent from the U.S. The Honduran economy is heavily dependent on money sent home from migrants.Earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with Agricultural Bank of China. Per the agreement, MoneyGram will provide money transfer services in over 3,700 locations. MoneyGram’s successful cooperation with the Agricultural Bank of China will provide the immigrant Chinese a fast, reliable and convenient money transfer service to their families back home.The company has also aligned with over 30 post offices and numerous national banks globally to provide convenient and affordable money transfer services. The company’s competitive strength and market share has been increasing in the global remittance space as the majority of its peers are small, under-capitalized, not well organized and face difficulty in operating under the increasingly stringent global regulatory requirements.Going forward, the global market for remittance services is expected to be stable given the protracted and favorable secular trends of labor force migration. Hence, even in the longer term, money transfer will remain the driving force at MoneyGram due to increasing demand as reflected in management’s long-term projection of annual money transfer revenues of $2 billion by 2017.MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other stocks such as Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. HAWK, Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. CPSS and On Deck Capital, Inc. ONDK also carry the same Zacks Rank as MoneyGram and are worth considering. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
