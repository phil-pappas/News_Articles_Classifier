The installation company took us through the unnecessarily complicated paperwork. \nFour days later this was sent to SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) . It asked for a reading for the “feed-in tariff”. By then it had reached 83.91 units, which were to be ignored even though this electricity had been sent to the grid from our panels. \n• 'SSE (Amsterdam: UW8.AS - news ) hasn't paid me for the electricity my solar panels have generated' \n• Solar panels better than a pension, says minister \nI was told that I had not completed one of the required declarations and immediately scanned my photocopied application to which I had added the required information. \nI was told to expect to wait for payment for three months. After that time I received a letter asking again for the very information I had acknowledged at the beginning. \nThis is becoming very frustrating. Can you please help me? JA, Hants \nYou posted the information again and telephoned after a few days to check that the paperwork on your file was now complete. \nYou were told it was and assured that your contract would be sent out in the next 10 days. It did not appear so you phoned again, to be informed that all work on contracts had been stopped to concentrate on payments and SSE could give no date when contracts would again be looked at. By then the reading stood at 900 units. \nI spoke to SSE and two weeks later it issued the contract. It paid £209 for units backdated to when you first lodged the application, while £50 was given for goodwill. \nYou challenged it on the fact that you had been deprived of 84 units (worth about 14p each) for the power you sent to the grid before the first reading. \nYou were told the starting point for payments was due to an Ofgem ruling. \nOfgem says the rules around FIT (feed-in tariff) are set by the Department of Energy and Climate Change . It is important that suppliers of solar panels and wind turbines are checked as compliant with the Microgeneration Certification Scheme . All has to be above board so the supplier knows it is a genuine unit. There has to be an eligibility date. \nIncidentally, since April your unit price has increased slightly. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T06:37:50.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
