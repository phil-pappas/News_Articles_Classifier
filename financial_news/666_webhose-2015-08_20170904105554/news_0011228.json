The product has been launched in association with the India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation, which will guarantee the incremental risk, Sabharwal said, adding that it conforms to all regulatory norms. \nThe product is targeted at middle-aged individuals and the self-employed, he said. Such products are popular in the US and Canada, Sabharwal added. \nIt can be recalled that over-leveraging of property by multiple loans is one of the reasons for the collapse of the American banking system in 2008, which led to the collapse of the global economy with the fall of Lehman Brothers and many other Wall Street titans. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T23:34:59.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
