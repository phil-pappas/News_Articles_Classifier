This was weaker than the reading of 58 expected by economists, but remains well above the 50 level that divides growth from contraction. The survey excludes retailers. \nWhile hiring remained strong, Markit said the pace of growth eased to its slowest since March 2014. Markit said there were \"more worrying\" signs across the wider economy, with employment growth in manufacturing, construction and services falling sharply in July to the lowest since September 2013. \nMr Williamson said July's PMI data suggested the economy was on course to grow by 0.6pc in the third quarter, representing a slowdown from the 0.7pc expansion seen in the first quarter. \n“A deterioration in service sector growth is the latest in a stream of signals that the economy has slowed as we move into the second half of the year. The fall in the services PMI follows signs of ongoing weakness in manufacturing and a renewed slowing in the construction sector,\" he said. \nMr Williamson added that the slowdown in growth and job creation suggested Bank of England policymakers would be in no rush to raise interest rates , even though Mark Carney, the Bank's governor, said growth of 0.6pc was consistent with tightening policy: \n\"Despite the dip in the PMI in July, the service sector continues to act as the main driver of economic growth. The survey data points to GDP growth merely easing from 0.7pc in the second quarter to a still-impressive 0.6pc at the start of the third quarter, which will do little to deter hawks at the Bank of England from voting for higher interest rates,\" said Mr Williamson. \n“However, the majority of MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) members will most likely see no need to rush into hiking rates any time soon. The doves will view the recent signs of cooling economic growth and slower job creation, also noting that inflation is currently zero and shows few signs of lifting higher due to the strong pound and falling oil prices.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T14:09:26.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
