(They are not.)\nWhether by email, phone or in-person meetings, and “although some of these interactions between trustees and staff may have been unpleasant” no “evidence of document tampering or inappropriate influence or interference” was found, Goodis reported.\nMavroyannis had singled out Trustee Shelley Laskin and the board’s auditor, and Laskin said Wednesday she was “very concerned with the allegations that spoke directly to my personal integrity” and is pleased they were dismissed by the commissioner.\n“I have always been honest, open and accountable to my constituents and I will continue to do so. We need an end to individuals being targeted.”\nThe auditor also told Goodis she had not felt under any pressure to alter documents.\nGoodis makes several recommendations, including ensuring enough staff are on duty in the FOI office “to adequately respond to FOI requests,” as well as providing training to staff and trustees about the freedom-of-information process.\nHe also noted that while the board has begun to disclose trustee expenses online, the information posted is several months out of date and provides little detail of how public money is spent.\nMavroyannis resigned from the board earlier this year, one of a handful of senior staff to leave amid wide-spread turmoil within Canada’s largest school board.\nMore on thestar.com\nLeft turn from Sheppard Ave. onto Leona Dr. goes nowhere: The Fixer\nPedestrians need to watch out, but apparently not drivers: Fixer", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T23:39:42.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
