Puerto Rico bond prices have slipped amid speculation that the island won’t be able to repay what it owes as its economy stagnates and residents leave for the U.S. mainland.\nIsland officials have said that Puerto Rico may skip the payment on the Finance Corp. bonds, which have some of the weakest protections for investors.\nThe debt is only paid for with money appropriated by the legislature, instead of a general claim on the commonwealth’s tax money. Faced with a budget shortfall, lawmakers didn’t provide the money when they passed the annual spending plan in June.\nIsland officials said that Puerto Rico’s available cash was limited to funding essential services such as health and safety.\nGarcia Padilla said in June that the commonwealth cannot pay all of its obligations, following years of borrowing to paper over budget shortfalls. Officials plan to draft a debt-restructuring plan by Sept. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T03:06:10.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
