The benchmark rate hasn't been that low since May 21.\nThe rate on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages declined this week to 3.06 per cent from 3.15 per cent. The panic selling and extreme gyrations in stock markets sent investors to the safety of US government bond prices, raising their prices and dampening their rates. Mortgage rates often track the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, which dipped below 2 per cent on Monday. The yield recovered to 2.18 per cent on Wednesday.
