Steve Heller TMFTopDown Jul 30, 2015 at 1:45PM \nAlthough we don't believe in timing the market or panicking over market movements, we do like to keep an eye on big changes -- just in case they're material to our investing thesis. \nWhat's Happening: Shares of 3D Systems ( NYSE:DDD ) were down by as much as 10.9% this morning after rival Stratasys ( NASDAQ:SSYS ) released its second-quarter results before the market opened today. \nWhy It's Happening: In the second quarter, Stratasys' revenue increased by about 2% year over year to $182.3 million, translating to a net loss of $0.55 per share, or an adjusted net profit of $0.15 per share. These results fell in line with Wall Street expectations calling for Stratasys to generate $182 million in revenue and earn $0.15 per share in adjusted earnings. \nThe market doesn't seem to have taken kindly to the fact that Stratasys withdrew its full-year guidance, but provided guidance for the third quarter, which fell significantly below analyst expectations. \nIn the third quarter, Stratasys anticipates to generate between $175 million and $190 million in revenue and earn between $0.03 and $0.13 per share on an adjusted basis, whereas Wall Street was hoping it would generate $216.5 million and earn an adjusted $0.47 per share. \nAs far as 3D Systems is concerned, the 3D printing company is slated to report its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, August 6. At the time of this writing, Wall Street expects 3D Systems to grow its sales by nearly 15% year over year to $173.7 million and take home $0.09 per share in adjusted earnings. \nIt seems this is a classic sympathy sell off, where 3D Systems investors are reacting negatively to a downbeat development from a competitor. Fortunately, investors won't have to wait long to find out if today's action was warranted. \nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism... The Economist is calling it \"transformative\"...
