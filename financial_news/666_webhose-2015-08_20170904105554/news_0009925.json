On Friday, Shanghai's benchmark index (.SSEC) was nearly 38 percent below where it was on June 12. \nThe premier reiterated earlier remarks that there's no basis for continued depreciation of the yuan (CNY=CFXS) following its devaluation on Aug. 11. The yuan \"will stay basically stable as a reasonable and balanced level,\" he said. \nLi said recent cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), interest rates, taxes and fees and measures aimed at stabilizing the market were already paying off. \nAnalysts say that further measures are necessary to support the economy and calm markets. \nChina's economy, which in the past produced double-digit growth, is slowing. The government reported that annual growth in the second quarter was 7 percent, a figure that some economists doubt. \nLi said China would \"enact more targeted and responsive macro-regulation to offset downward economic pressure, more robust reform and innovation efforts to energize the market, and more effective delivery to secure the positive momentum for growth\". \nHe said China needed to encourage new forms of investment and financing by local governments and businesses, such as local debt swaps and corporate bonds. \nHe reiterated the role of an open, transparent capital market but said risk management needs to be improved to prevent regional or systemic risks. \n\"China has great potential for further development and is well capable of effectively managing risks and keeping them under control,\" Li said. \n(Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T08:59:00.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
