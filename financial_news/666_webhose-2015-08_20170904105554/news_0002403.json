Bloomberg by Angus Grigg China's central bank ended three days of weakening the yuan on Friday morning, in a sign Beijing is happy with how much the currency has fallen as global markets scramble to adjust to Beijing's new foreign exchange policy.\nThe People's Bank of China set the yuan reference rate at 6.3975 against the US dollar, a slight increase from where the currency was set on Thursday.\nThe currency's official rate has now fallen 4.4 per cent since Tuesday, when the PBOC began weakening the yuan without warning.\nIn a rare press conference on Thursday PBOC deputy governor Yi Gang dismissed suggestions Beijing was attempting to orchestrate a 10 per cent weakening of the yuan to support sluggish exports.\nRather, he said the devaluation was aimed at closing the gap between the yuan's value and market expectations of what that level should be, a process that was \"almost completed,\" he said.\nWhile the market will now have a more prominent role in setting the exchange rate, the PBOC would still intervene when the market is \"distorted\", he said.\nFriday's fixing suggests the PBOC used its discretion to intervene in setting the currency. However it did reference Thursday closing price for the yuan, which pared back losses after the PBOC said it would keep the currency at a \"reasonable\" and \"balanced level\".\nThe Australian dollar was up slightly at US73.72c.\nOn Tuesday the PBOC announced a \"one-off\" currency devaluation, weakening the yuan by 1.9 per cent against the US dollar, the most in two decades, and introducing a change to the way it sets the exchange rate.\nThe PBOC said it would refer to the previous day's market close in setting the \"daily fix\" and that resulted in the yuan being further weakened by 1.6 per cent on Wednesday.\nThe change unsettled global markets, affecting everything from Apple shares to the oil price.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T16:11:12.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
