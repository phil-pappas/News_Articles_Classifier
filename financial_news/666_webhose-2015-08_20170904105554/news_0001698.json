I used to give the details of this flat in my income-tax return (I used to file ITR-4 as I had income from business or profession). During the accounting year 2014-15, I built a new house in Kerala (in a municipal area) where I intend to shift and spend my retired life. I wish to show this house property as well in my income-tax return for the accounting year 2014-15. Can I show both the properties in my return as self-occupied and not let out thus having no rent income? Or, do I have to show one property as let out and add the rent amount in my taxable income?\n—Olat Krishnan\nWhen an individual owns more than one residential property, any one residential property at the discretion of the individual is considered as self-occupied property (SOP). Hence, the other residential property owned, even if it is not actually let out, will have to be considered as “deemed let out property” (DLOP).\nAs you already own one residential property in Kolkata, any subsequent acquisition or construction of residential property, if not actually rented out, will have tax implications.\nAny one property of your choice shall be considered as SOP and the other properties shall be considered as DLOP. For the said DLOP, the deemed rent will have to be offered to tax.\nThe deemed rent has to be calculated by determining the rent at which the residential property may reasonably be let out. This calculation may be based on valuations of similar properties in the neighborhood or certificates issued from the society or a certified valuer.\nYou can claim tax deduction towards the actual municipal taxes paid and standard deduction of flat 30% (after deduction of municipal taxes) towards repairs and maintenance charges against the deemed rent.\nApart from this, the entire interest on housing loan can be claimed for tax deduction against the net rental value.\nThe balance rent amount, if any, will be taxable under the head of “income from house property” in your income-tax return form.\nAdditionally, you can claim deduction towards repayment of the principal portion of housing loan subject to overall cap of Rs. 1.5 lakh per financial year under section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961, if not already availed.\nHowever, if you actually rent out the second house, then the actual rental value (and not the deemed amount) shall be considered and you can claim the aforesaid deductions towards municipal taxes, standard deduction and interest payment against the rental value.\nPlease note that if you own two residential properties and if the second residential property is not likely to be rented out for at least 300 days in a financial year, there may be wealth tax implications for the second property for the financial year 2014-15.\nQueries and views at mintmoney@livemint.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:20:09.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
