It began Friday and wraps up Saturday. \nThe Iowa holiday allows shoppers to buy select clothing and footwear priced at less than $100 without paying sales tax or local option taxes. The two days are usually among the best of the year for Iowa retailers. \nRetailers say the event draws thousands of Nebraskans to the state for back-to-school shopping, too. Nebraska is one of 34 states that doesn't have a sales tax holiday. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T20:28:38.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
