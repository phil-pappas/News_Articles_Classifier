Peter Braig by Ben Potter If the court ordered temporary delay to Adani's Carmichael coal project proves permanent, one person who will be able to claim vindication, apart from the environmental campaigners, will be former Citigroup analyst Tim Buckley.\n\"I think it is highly probably the project will not proceed,\" said Mr Buckley, director of Australasian energy finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a group which argues that coal is in structural decline.\n\"I have been saying that now for two years.\"\nMr Buckley believes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has empowered energy minister Piyush Goyal to transform the Indian power sector.\nThermal coal to peak This includes a $250 billion foreign investment in renewable energy, a modern grid, tripling the amount of Indian coal produced and ending India's reliance on imported coal from Indonesia and Australia within a year or two.\n\"The combination of those three things means the high cost supplier is going to be squeezed out, and in India the high cost supplier of electricity is imported coal,\" he said.\nAs a result Mr Buckley believes India's imports of thermal coal will peak this year at about 192 million tonnes and follow China's imports into rapid decline, to zero by 2021.\n Mr Buckley's forecasts are similar to that of top economist and Labor emissions trading scheme architect Ross Garnaut but they are far from the consensus, which is for continued growth in India's coal consumption and imports even as China's demand peaks and declines.\nBut if even partially true the forecasts would be bad news for Australia, which has seen thermal coal exports soar from about $4 billion a year in the early 2000s to a peak of $18 billion in 2012 and back to $12 billion in 2013.\nMr Buckley said the coal industry had misunderstood the scale of the transformation planned for the Indian power sector by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and energy minister Piyush Goyal, who said in May that he was confident India would not need to import any more thermal coal.\n\"Goyal has studied the Chinese electricity market for five years now, and he is trying to replicate exactly what the Chinese have done in an Indian context,\" he said. â€‹\nRestructure makes 'huge difference' He said that Adani's capacity to fund the $10 billion Carmichael project itself had been drastically reduced by the conglomerate's restructure into four separate listed companies this year.\nThat meant Adani Enterprises - the coal mining and trading arm - was no longer vertically integrated with the power company and the mine would have to stack up on its own fundamentals.\nThe restructure makes a huge difference because external shareholders such as Blackrock and Fidelity would not be willing to fund an unviable project, Mr Buckley said.\n\"A year ago Adani Enterprises was a $10 billion company. Adani Enterprises could have funded this project a year ago and they didn't have to have recourse to minority shareholders,\" he said.\n\"If Adani Enterprises doesn't have the financial resources internally they hae to go to external shareholders who can argue on the financial merits and you only have to look at Peabody Energy's share price to know that the financial markets are not going to be throwing money at Adani Enterprises.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:09:44.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
