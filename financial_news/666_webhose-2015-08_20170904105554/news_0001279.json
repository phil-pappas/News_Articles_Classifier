They’ve had a perfect year for a studio.” \nTwo films that are counted in Universal’s total gross —“Unbroken” and “Dumb and Dumber Too”— were released toward the end of 2014, but are included in the market-share calculation because their revenue played into 2015, said Dergarabedian. ‘It’s about partnering with the right people, having the right people under your umbrella and picking the right projects.’ Paul Dergarabedian \nUniversal’s performance has been carried by the success of “Jurassic World,” which has grossed $636 million domestically and is the highest grossing film all-time world-wide with $1.6 billion, according to data from Box Office Mojo. Domestic grosses from “Furious 7” ($351 million), “Minions” ($303 million) and “Pitch Perfect 2” ($184 million) have also been big hits for the studio. \n“If you were an executive at Universal five years ago trying to plan the biggest year at the box office, I don’t think anyone could have predicted this,” Dergarabedian said. “Universal Studios certainly has one of the best track records of any studio, and right now they’re on a roll. It’s about partnering with the right people, having the right people under your umbrella and picking the right projects.” \nUniversal Studios, with its $1.9 billion gross, has more than doubled its market share from a year ago, and has the largest share at 28%. The studio with the next highest market share is Walt Disney Co.’s DIS, -0.33% Buena Vista at 20%, which has grossed $1.4 billion, according to data from Rentrak. \nTime Warner Inc.’s TWX, -1.01% Warner Bros. comes in third with a 17.% market share and a $1.2 billion domestic gross. \nAll of those studios have increased market shares compared with the same point in the year last year, when 20th Century Fox, a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA, +0.50% led the pack with 19% of the market. Fox is currently fourth in market share at 12% and $821 million in domestic box office revenue.
