REUTERS/Yuya â€¦ TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Corp (9984.T) reported an 8 percent rise in quarterly profit as loss-making Sprint Corp (S.N) fared better than expected, leading the Japanese telecoms conglomerate to declare it was seeing \"light at the end of the tunnel\" for its U.S. unit. \nSoftBank, which bought the U.S. carrier for more than $20 billion in 2013, said on Thursday its April-June operating profit rose to 343.6 billion yen ($2.75 billion) from 319.4 billion yen a year ago. \nSprint has struggled to compete against larger rivals AT&T Inc (T.N) and Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) even while it burns through cash trying to acquire and retain customers. But in a sign of possible improvement, Sprint on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and lower churn, or defections. \nSoftBank also said it was buying back up to 120 billion yen in shares, a move CEO Masayoshi Son said came from the company's renewed confidence and belief that its shares were undervalued. \n\"Repurchasing shares is an effective way of returning profit to shareholders. But it's also a message from management to markets, regarding the share price,\" he told reporters. \n\"We've now become fully confident.\" \nThe company did not give an outlook for the full year, but analysts on average have been forecasting 1.04 trillion yen, according to the average of 19 estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. \nBased on such forecasts, SoftBank shares have lately been trading below 8 times forward earnings estimates, lagging behind multiples of over 10 for Japanese telecoms rivals KDDI Corp (9433.T) and NTT DoCoMo (9437.T). \nAnalysts have said the comparatively low valuations were mainly due to concerns about Sprint's outlook. \n(Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T11:23:25.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
