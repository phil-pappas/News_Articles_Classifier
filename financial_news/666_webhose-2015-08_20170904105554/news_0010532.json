At this time last year, the nationwide total was 716, with 459 killed in Kruger.\nMolewa said Kruger was still the epicentre of the crisis. \"Kruger remains a magnet because of numbers. You won’t walk 2km in Kruger without coming across a rhino.\"\nKruger has the largest concentration of rhinos on the planet, with an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 white rhinos, about half of SA’s population of the species.\nSA has more than 80% of the world’s rhino population with about 18,000 white rhinos and close to 2,000 black rhinos.\nFundisile Mketeni, CEO of South African National Parks, also pointed to Kruger’s size and topography as attractions for poachers. The park is the size of Israel and much of its terrain is remote, making it tough to police.\nIt also shares a 450km border with Mozambique, from where many poachers come.\nSo far this year, Molewa said, there has been a 27% increase in poachers entering the park. There were 12 active poacher groups at any given time on its 2-million hectares.\nArrests of suspected poachers in the park are also up to 138 so far this year, compared with 81 in the same period last year.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:22:39.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
