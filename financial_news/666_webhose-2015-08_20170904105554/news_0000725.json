Photo: Louie Douvis\nVirgin Australia and Delta Air Lines have gained final regulatory clearance for their alliance on routes between Australia and the US, just months before competition is set to intensify on the trans-Pacific when rivals Qantas and American Airlines begin new flights.\nThe green light comes as Virgin and one of its largest shareholders, Etihad, lodges an application with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for regulatory approval to extend their alliance for 10 years. Their tie up on routes between Australia and the United Arab Emirates began in 2010.\nThe final approval from the ACCC on Friday for Virgin's alliance with Delta for a further five years falls short of the 10 years that the airlines were seeking. The regulator said it had given approval for a shorter period because of the \"ongoing evolution of services on the trans-Pacific and the dynamic nature of the aviation industry\".\nACCC chairman Rod Sims said the regulator accepted that travellers were likely to value the airlines' \"integrated network\" between Australia and the US.\nAdvertisement \"The alliance has also resulted in enhanced products and services, including increased and better connections, access to each other's flights and better schedule spread, loyalty program benefits, and improved lounge access,\" he said.\nVirgin flies daily to Los Angeles from both Sydney and Brisbane, while Delta has a daily flight between Sydney and LA. Between them, the two airlines have a 37 per cent share of traffic on the key Sydney-LA route.\nThe alliance with Delta is one of four key alliances Virgin has cemented since 2009. But unlike those with Air New Zealand, Etihad and Singapore Airlines, Delta does not have a stake in Australia's second-largest airline.\nCompetition between Australia and the US is set to intensify in December when American Airlines, which has not flown to Australia since the 1990s, begins daily Boeing 777-300ER services between Sydney and LA.\nThe expansion is part of a deepening of its alliance on the trans-Pacific route with Qantas, which will result in the Australian airline redeploying its Boeing 747-400 jumbos to fly between Sydney and San Francisco, ending the monopoly that United Airlines has held on the route.\nTheir expansion will boost capacity between Australia and the US by 9 per cent. Last month, the ACCC gave Qantas and American Airlines interim approval despite opposition from Air New Zealand and Hawaiian Airlines.\nIn their application, Qantas and American Airlines asked the regulator to approve their deeper alliance – a revenue-share agreement – for a decade. However, like the Virgin-Delta deal, the length of approval they have sought is also expected to be too long for the ACCC.\nHawaiian Airlines has warned that the alliances on the trans-Pacific threaten to lock out smaller airlines because they will be denied access to domestic passenger traffic. It has cited as an example Virgin's rejection of its advances to expand their code-share alliance.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/transport/aviation/hawaiian-airlines-warns-qantasamerican-alliance-threatens-competition-20150714-gibxit"], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:51:57.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
