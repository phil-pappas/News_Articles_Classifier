Patrick Scala Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell The battle for market share between the major grocery chains and independent retailers has led to the weakest supermarket sales growth in almost two years.\nWhile overall retail sales growth exceeded market forecasts in June , delivering a long-awaited shot in the arm to traders, food sales growth was weaker than expected due to intensifying price competition between Woolworths, Coles and independent retailers.\nSupermarket and grocery store sales rose just 2.9 per cent - the weakest rate of growth since September 2013 and well below the six month trend - as Woolworths, Coles and independents supplied by Metcash cut prices to regain market share lost to Aldi.\nOverall food and liquor sales grew by 2.7 per cent, compared with growth of 3.4 per cent in May and the 12-month average of 4.8 per cent.\n\"It's hard to read too much into it but you're starting to see signs that supermarkets are going a bit harder on price,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath​.\nPressure on margins Food price inflation is estimated to have slowed to 1.3 per cent in the June quarter, compared with 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter 2014, increasing the pressure on supermarket margins.\nThe June Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that cutting grocery prices is a zero sum game – consumers do not necessarily buy more packaged food and groceries when prices fall and growth in volumes barely offsets lower prices.\n \"The deterioration in food sales suggests market growth has been affected by the price investments made by Woolworths and Coles, and volume uplift has been insufficient to offset this,\" said Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Simotas.\nAnalysts believe Woolworths continued to lose market share in food and groceries in June even after the retailer stepped up discounting for branded and private label groceries and trimmed online prices to lure customers back to stores.\nCutting profit guidance in mid-June, for the second time in four months, Woolworths said Australian food and liquor sales had fallen 0.7 per cent on a same-store basis in the quarter to date. Analysts said there was unlikely to have been a change in momentum in the last two weeks of the month.\nColes \"held up OK,\" according to Deutsche Bank, and sales at independent retailers improved slightly as a price-matching program at IGA stores gained momentum.\nAldi the drawcard \"Woolworths invested in price and Coles is doing a bit of the same and people are shopping more at Aldi – that's my sense of it,\" said Mr Kierath.\nWhile promotional discounts are deeper than they were last year, analysts say pricing remains rational and there are no signs of an all-out price war.\nWoolworths announced plans in May to slash costs by more than $500 million and pour the savings into lowering grocery prices and improving service in supermarkets to \"neutralise\" Coles, which has been outperforming its larger rival for 23 consecutive quarters, and to \"contain\" Aldi.\n​Analysts and investors are hoping to see Woolworths supermarkets return to same-store sales growth over the next few quarters. However, UBS analyst Ben Gilbert believes it could take two years for Woolworths to return to a defendable, like-for-like sales growth trajectory.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/woolworths-to-axe-800-jobs-as-weak-food-petrol-lead-to-sales-fall-20150505-ggv1rd.html"], "published": "2015-08-04T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:40:13.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
