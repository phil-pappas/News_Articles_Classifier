Rather if it ends up weakening the yuan, it would fuel competition in devaluation. There's no wonder U.S. stocks have lost steam,\" he added.\nThe CBOE Market Volatility Index, at 36, was still elevated, indicating significant uncertainty, even though it was below the previous day's peak of 53.3, which was the highest level since January 2009.\nIn the currency market, the dollar also lost steam as traders flocked to save-haven currencies such as euro and yen.\nThe euro was $1.1529, little changed from late U.S. trade, but more than a full cent above Tuesday's low of $1.1396.\nThe dollar also slipped back to 118.90, failing to maintain its brief foray above the 120 mark.\nEmerging market currencies remained under pressure, with the Brazilian real falling 1 percent to a fresh 12-year low of 3.59 per dollar as investors worried about a deep economic recession and a growing political crisis in Latin America's largest economy.\nCommodity prices managed to hover a tad above multi-year lows hit earlier in the week, but concerns softer demand from China could lead to oversupply kept a tab on them.\nBrent crude futures last traded at $43.36 per barrel, about a dollar above 6 1/2-year low of $42.23 touched on Monday.\nThe price of copper, often considered a proxy for global economic activity because of the metal's extensive use, rose 2.3 percent to $5,065 per tonne.\n(Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T03:43:35.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
