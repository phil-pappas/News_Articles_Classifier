It won’t provide an explanation. I have the usual payments going in and out. I don’t have an overdraft and don’t go overdrawn.\nThis will have a huge impact on both my business and my day-to-day life yet I am powerless to stop it. No one at Lloyds has ever questioned me over anything and credit agencies Experian and Equifax confirm there is nothing on my file to suggest any illegal activity. AW, Bristol\nBanks and building societies , like other commercial organisations, are under no obligation to continue to do business with you if they don’t want to. However, there are rules that banks have to follow about treating customers fairly and no bank or building society should decide to close an account for an improper reason.\nWhen you run a business a bank’s decision to shut your account can be particularly problematic – failure to honour a payment could have extensive, and potentially disastrous, financial consequences. Once your account is forcibly closed it can also make it very difficult to open another one.\nWhen I contacted Lloyds press office the decision was instantly reversed. It has said in a statement that it had “concerns about certain activity”. While it cannot confirm details, as the activity is still under investigation, it has confirmed that it knows you had nothing to do with the issue it is concerned about, and its decision was made “too harshly”.\nI don’t know what would have happened if you hadn’t contacted the media but it seems likely you would have been left without a banking facility. You could have complained to the financial ombudsman but that would have taken some time.\nRecognising that it has caused you “distress and inconvenience”, Lloyds has given you £100 by way of an apology.\n• Anna Tims is on holiday\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
