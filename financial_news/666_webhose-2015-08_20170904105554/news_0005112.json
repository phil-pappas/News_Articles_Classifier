It had since been remedied. \nThe plane carried a Namibian crew and a South African patient and his daughter. They were pilot Steven Naude, 53, co-pilot Amore Espag, 23, and paramedic Alfred John Ward. \nThe South African patient was named as 80-year-old Gabriel le Roux, who died alongside his daughter Charmaine Koortzen, 49, a South African who lives in Oranjemund in Namibia. \nPrivate ambulance service ER24 released a statement at the time which read: \"It is understood from the Airports Company of South Africa that all aircraft approaching Cape Town International Airport at the time were placed in a holding pattern due to a technical fault with their radars. \n\"The E-med Rescue 24 aircraft was also in the holding pattern at the time. We lost contact with the aircraft approximately seven miles outside of the airport,\" the statement said. \nMorokane said they would co-operate fully with investigations by the transport department's Aircraft Accident Investigations Unit and the SA Civil Aviation Authority. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T03:25:23.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
