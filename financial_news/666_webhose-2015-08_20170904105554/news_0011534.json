The big question is now what happens in healthcare equipment.\"\nTECHNOLOGY TRANSFER\nHealthcare is a key area in which China wants to promote its homegrown medical devices and create incentives for medical institutions to use locally made products.\nBeijing wants to reduce soaring healthcare costs while improving the health of its 1.4 billion people.\nThe medical equipment devices market, worth an estimated 212 billion yuan ($33 billion) in 2013, is dominated by foreign players such as Siemens, General Electric, Philips and Toshiba.\n\"We see the market slowdown. Obviously, we also see there the emergence of local competitors that nibble at the market share... and I think that is what all major companies will have to reckon with,\" Philips CEO Frans van Houten said last month.\nChinese providers like Mindray Medical International and China Resources Wandong Medical Equipment Co. Ltd are mainly making their presence felt in simpler imaging devices such as ultrasound machines so far.\nBut with technology transfer thanks to joint ventures that most foreign firms set up to produce in China, foreign suppliers cannot hope to keep indefinitely their ownership of the market for high-end computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.\nMost foreign firms with significant Chinese operations have such joint ventures: certain industries like automaking require them, while other companies see JVs as a way to local market knowledge, government connections or distribution channels.\nSiemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser described the dilemma last month, explaining why Siemens continued to partner with Shanghai Electric despite the Chinese company's having become more of a direct competitor.\nShanghai Electric owns a 40 percent stake in Italian power engineering group Ansaldo Energia, which is now seen as favourite to buy assets being shed by Siemens' rival Alstom as part of a bigger Alstom-GE deal.\nKaeser told sceptical analysts: \"We continue with a very close partnership with Shanghai Electric because the better technology you offer the more welcome you are as a partner, especially in China.\" ($1 = 6.4095 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Additional reporting by Sabina Zawadzki in Copenhagen, Christoph Steitz in Berlin, Martinne Geller and Tom Bergin in London, Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki and Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm; editing by Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T14:23:21.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
