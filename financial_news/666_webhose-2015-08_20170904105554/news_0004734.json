(Submitted photo) Top Projects: Metro Transit Highway 610 & Noble Parkway Park & Ride By: Frank Jossi August 14, 2015 7:02 am 0 \nAddress: 4401 95th Ave. N., Brooklyn Park \nProject cost: $10 million \nProject size: 170,000 square feet \nOwner: Metro Transit \nArchitect: Snow Kreilich Architects Inc. \nEngineer: Stantec \nEditor’s note: This is the 13th installment in Finance & Commerce’s Top Projects Series of 2014. Previous installments are available here. \nThe Highway 610 & Noble Parkway Park and Ride Facility is one of the most sustainable parking ramps ever built in the Twin Cities. Solar panels power LED lights. Geothermal heating warms the bus shelter. An occupancy sensor controls lighting. \nReflecting Metro Transit’s commitment to sustainability and “getting the most bang for their buck” was the goal of the project, says architect Tyson McElvain of Minneapolis-based Snow Kreilich Architects Inc. \nThe firm has done a number of government projects, he said, and many of them require sustainable approaches as part of the design. \nFor the Noble Parkway project, the indoor waiting area employs in-floor radiant heat — generated by the geothermal system — for the comfort of passengers waiting for buses. The three-story ramp’s environmental focus extends to the outside where low-level water filtration areas and ponding cleanse rainwater runoff. \nThe park & ride’s architecture is considered intriguing even though McElvain makes clear the intention of the design was never to hide the fact the building is a parking garage. A white articulated facade — rather than flat slabs — creates abstract patterns. The whiteness plays off black precast panels enclosing the ramp and service areas. \n“In ramps you’re trying to hide the cars, create an interesting facade and make sure that light from headlights doesn’t spill out to neighboring buildings,” McElvain said. “Metro Transit wants their buildings to look good.” \nA separate tower section connected to the ramp encloses the waiting area, an elevator and stairs in a curtain wall of windows. An interior LED screen offers information not only on bus routes and times but also the ramp’s solar energy production and geothermal activity. \nThe park & ride “is tremendously efficient in circulation of passengers” and energy use, McElvain said. “It has a lot of material interest without trying to be something it’s not.” Pause Play Play Prev | Next Snow Kreilich designed a white articulated facade -- rather than flat slabs – to create abstract patterns on the parking ramp.
