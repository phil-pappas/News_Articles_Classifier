Monsanto drops takeover bid for Syngenta AFP â€“ 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nUS agriculture and seed giant Monsanto dropped its campaign to acquire rival Syngenta Wednesday, saying the Swiss company refused to engage after repeated efforts to spur talks. \nMonsanto said it would focus on its core business after Syngenta (Xetra: 580854 - news ) rejected a sweetened August 18 bid that included a much higher break-up fee in case the deal was blocked by regulators. \nMonsanto in April launched its proposal for the Swiss company, offering 449 Swiss francs for a transaction it said would bolster the US company's prowess at developing new seed technologies. \nHowever, Syngenta quickly rebuffed the offer, calling it \"inadequate,\" in part due to a $2 billion breakup fee that the Swiss company said underestimated the regulatory scrutiny the deal would engender based on antitrust concerns. \nMonsanto said the August 18 offer would have amounted to 470 francs per share overall, including a 245 franc cash component. The proposal also lifted the breakup fee to $3 billion. \nMonsanto said it still believes the two companies would have \"benefited from substantial synergies, significant cash earnings per share accretion... as well as a responsible capital structure.\" \nHowever, it concluded it had no choice but to drop the deal \"without a basis for constructive engagement from Syngenta.\" \nIn morning trade, US-listed Syngenta shares plunged 13.7 percent to $66.42, while Monsanto jumped 7.4 percent to $96.02.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T18:30:11.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
