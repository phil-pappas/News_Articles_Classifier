But, what's frexting and how is it any different from sexting, which involves exchanging sexually explicit messages or pictures? Say you wake up in the morning and send a just-outtabed pic to your guy (disheveled hair, smudged kohl, dressed in a decolletage top -basically, the works!) in a bold attempt to pique his interest. \"Sexy,\" he replies.Shortly after, a second message pops up in which he demands more. While your partner reels in the explicitness of the picture, you pause to consider the unabashed lack of subtlety in the message and realize it's not a bad thing after all! Why? Well, because the photo demands immediate and unhindered attention.\nAnd the same pic could be sent to one of your girlfriends as well, the subtext being completely different. The response from them might be something on the lines of, \"Whoa, girl! You look hot!\" Since, in all fairness, we're all social animals with an insatiable need for validation, frexting comes as a breather. In frexting, you send your friend(s) a picture of your flabby tummy or fabulous derriere only to get an honest and empowering reply.\nYour friend might even say, \"Work on the abs and flaunt that booty in a pair of low-waist denims,\" but that will give you the positive vibe you need. Think about the numerous occasions when you sent your girlfriends the pic of a dress you might be checking out in the trial room. Why do it?\nSimply because their opinion matters. In a world where wearing a pair of slouchy track pants can become the premise for sexualization and objectification, frexts are safe and confidence-boosting.\nSo, get over the initial dilemma of sending your first frext, pick up your phone, look stylish and click away! http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sexting,relationships,frexting,dirty SMS ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-08-11T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:35:27.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
