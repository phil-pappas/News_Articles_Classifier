And what would be more natural than to bring them together, if not in a movie, then at least in an ad.\nThe legendary Amitabh Bachchan and the flavour of the season Kangana Ranaut have recently shot an ad together and the man responsible for bringing them together was the ‘Midas Touch’ director Rajkumar Hirani – the ad was shot on Friday.\nA source from the set said that, “Kangana Ranaut has never sported a look like this before – absolutely stunning”.\nThe same source added, “Mr. Bachchan was highly impressed by Kangana’s conduct on the sets and said that she was extremely professional, soft spoken and very easy to work with.”\nSpeaking about his experience of working with Kangana Ranaut, Amitabh Bachchan said, “At work at last. With the wonder called Kangana Ranaut. She’s so good and talented and wonderful.”\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 7:22 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:42:23.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
