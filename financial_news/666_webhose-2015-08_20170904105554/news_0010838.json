In contrast, Montreal-based National Bank of Canada rose 1.6 percent after posting profit that beat analysts’ estimates.\nNet income for the period ended July 31 rose to C$2.48 billion ($1.86 billion), or C$1.66 a share, from C$2.38 billion, or C$1.59, a year earlier, Toronto-based Royal Bank said Wednesday in a statement. While adjusted profit topped estimates, revenue of C$8.83 billion missed analysts’ prediction of C$9.15 billion.\nThe performance of the lender’s main business lines was mixed. RBC Capital Markets earnings fell 15 percent to C$545 million on a decline in trading revenue and lower equity issuance and loan syndication. Wealth-management profit was little changed at C$285 million, while insurance dropped 19 percent to C$173 million.\n‘Souring’ Outlook Personal and commercial banking, Royal Bank’s largest division, rose 13 percent to C$1.28 billion, fueled by record Canadian banking results. Investor and treasury services, which includes the global custodial business, rose 52 percent to C$167 million.\nThe performance in domestic retail banking was “solid” and helped by international banking contributions, John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Plc, said in a note to clients.\n“The contributions from its other segments, which are anticipated to fuel future growth, moderated, somewhat negating the benefits and souring the relative outlook on Royal Bank’s third quarter,” he said.\nRoyal Bank set aside 4.6 percent less for bad loans across the firm, though gross impaired loans jumped 19 percent to C$2.38 billion from the second quarter, the firm said. The soured loans were tied to a couple of oil-and-gas accounts in its capital-markets unit and one account in U.S. and international wealth management, the bank said. Impaired loans in oil-and-gas almost quadrupled to C$183 million from C$46 million in the second quarter.\nThe company boosted its dividend 2.6 percent to 79 cents.\nNational Bank, the sixth-biggest lender, said profit rose 2.7 percent to C$453 million, or C$1.28 a share, from C$441 million, or C$1.24, a year earlier. Personal and commercial banking, wealth management and its capital-markets business all had higher earnings.\n“We view this result positively as Canada P&C earnings were strong, while financial markets earnings came in better than expected despite a challenging market environment,” Darko Mihelic, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T20:00:21.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
