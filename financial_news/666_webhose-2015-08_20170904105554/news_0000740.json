With the latest Greek bailout agreed, professional investors argue it is time to buy before stock markets \"take off\". \nDylan Ball, who manages the Templeton Growth fund, told Telegraph Money why his confidence remains high : \"The region has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons and sentiment did take a knock when Greece was teetering on the edge of leaving the single currency. This has stopped the market taking off and I am betting on this reversing from now until the end of the year, as QE is eventually going to have an impact and send share prices higher.\" \nA number of respected multi-managers, whose job is to form a broad view of the best mix of assets and then subcontract detailed portfolio decisions out to specialist fund managers, have also been increasing their European exposure. These include Jupiter’s investment chief , John Chatfeild-Roberts, who runs the Jupiter Merlin fund range, overseeing £9.5bn in savings. \nBen Willis, of wealth manager Whitechurch Securities, also thinks now is the time to buy. \nHe said: \"As the dust settles on the Greek situation and QE in Europe begins to take shape, business confidence will improve, whilst a weak euro will provide impetus for exports. The recent obsession with Greece could provide some contrarian buying opportunities and so Europe remains one of our favoured regions over the medium term. \n\"China is of course a big concern, but I think the European recovery is a domestic story and will be driven more by increased consumer spending. Some international business and Germany in particular may suffer in the short term, but investors need to be brave and accept that there will be some volatility along the way.\" \nHere are three smarter ways to profit. \n1. Buy a fund that has loaded up on 'cyclical shares' \n\"Cyclical shares” are closely aligned with the economy and will therefore benefit from an uptick in consumer spending. \nGarry Potter, who buys funds for F&C Investments, suggested Neptune European Opportunities, which favours shares in companies that sell discretionary items. One of the fund’s biggest bets is SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) , the global beer and soft drinks business that owns Peroni and Castle lagers, among other brands. \nJason Hollands, who works for Tilney Bestinvest, the adviser, tipped Threadneedle Europe Select. “It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has an emphasis on larger companies with strong brands, competitive advantages and resilient earnings,” Mr Hollands said. \nTop holdings include L’Oréal and Anheuser-Busch InBev, which brews Budweiser. \nDarius McDermott, of FundCalibre, a fund raring website, named Jupiter European and BlackRock European Dynamic as two funds that he is backing to benefit more than others. \n2. Just stick to Germany \nAnother but more riskier option, Mr McDermott suggested, is to put all your eggs in the one country that stands to benefit most from a revival taking place Germany. \nSince the turn of the year the euro has depreciated significantly, falling around 10pc again the pound. \nThe weaker currency benefits exporters, so therefore Germany, with its manufacturing and export-led economy, stands to benefit, even given a fall in the rate of China's growth, which has spooked the German stock market in recent months, with its blue-chip DAX index, down 12pc over the past three months. \nMr McDermott said Baring German Growth is the only single-country active fund available to investors, costing 0.82pc a year. \nInvestors who want a cheaper deal should instead consider a tracker fund, which will follow the up and down movements of the German stock market, such as iShares MSCI Germany ETF, which charges 0.48pc. \n“Crucially, the largest German export companies are listed on the German stock exchange so an investor in German equities is getting direct exposure to that export growth,” Mr McDermott said. \n3. Protect yourself against further euro falls \nFor those who are concerned about backing a losing currency it makes sense to eliminate this risk and settle for the same investment return on an overseas market as local savers. \nThe way to do this is to buy a special version of a fund that \"hedges\" against currency movements. Unfortunately, relatively few European funds offer a hedged share class. \nAmong the ones that do are Artemis European Opportunities Hedged and JPM Europe Dynamic Hedged. Both these funds are “suitable options”, according to Mr Hollands. \n\"To give you an idea of how the currency hedge has boosted returns, over the last 12 months the hedged version of the JPM fund is up 22pc, versus 10pc on the unhedged. Likewise for Artemis, the hedged version is up 22pc versus 13pc on the traditional version,\" Mr Hollands said. \n\"From here however, given the steep depreciation in the Euro, the case for currency hedging is more balanced that it was several months ago, but is still a useful tactic. I am personally now half exposed to currency hedged European funds and half unhedged.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:05:09.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
