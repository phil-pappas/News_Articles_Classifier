Azeff and others then traded on the information, which had not been disclosed to the public. Three other individuals, Korin Bobrow, Howard Jeffrey Miller and Francis Cheng, were found to have used the information in violation of Ontario securities laws. \nHearings in the case took place last year. The OSC ruled against the men in March. A sanctions hearing took place in May and the results were released Tuesday. \nFinkelstein must pay sanctions of $450,000 and costs of $125,000. He is banned from the province’s securities business for 10 years. \nAzeff must pay $750,000 in penalties, $175,000 in costs, and disgorge profits of $$49,996. He’s been kicked out of the province’s securities business for 10 years. \nBobrow faces a $300,000 penalty, $125,000 in costs, an order to disgorge $10,217 in profits, and a 10-year ban from the securities industry. \nMiller must pay a penalty of $450,000, costs of $50,000, disgorge just $24,485 in profit. He is banned from the securities business for 10 years. Cheng faces a $200,000 penalty, a $25,000 cost order, and is banned from the industry for 10 years. \nIn total, the OSC has issued penalties and costs of $2,859,698, made up of $2,150,000 in administrative monetary penalties, along with $625,000 in costs, and disgorgement orders of $84,698.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:17:03.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
