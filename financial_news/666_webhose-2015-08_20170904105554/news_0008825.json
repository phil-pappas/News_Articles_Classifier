In the UK we have created a tough regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, and given it strong powers to protect people from abusive practice, and we are working tirelessly to shut down scams. \n\"But people who are seeking financial advice in a foreign country won’t always have the same safeguards.\" \nThe pensions minister, Ros Altmann, was so concerned by the findings that she urged savers investing their money overseas to hire a lawyer to check for expensive catches hidden in the small print of their paperwork. \nRecent pension changes, giving over 55s free access to their entire pension savings, mean a greater number of pensioners now have more freedom to retire to sunnier climates. \nBy setting up operations overseas, financial firms can sell investments to British savers without being regulated by the British watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, which has in years gone by introduced a series of stringent regulations to protect consumers against rip-offs. \nSavers are particularly at risk in regions such as Asia, Africa and some countries in eastern Europe, where there is little or no financial regulation. Providers and salesmen can legitimately deduct large upfront commissions, and hire salesmen with few recognised investment qualifications to sell their products. \nIn one example seen by this newspaper, a customer who had saved £350 a month into a Hansard bond with a 30-year term wanted access to his money after five and a half years. Despite the policy being worth £5,899.52 they were told the “surrender value” was just £50.92, with the rest being swallowed by charges. \nHansard refused to comment on the scale of its withdrawal penalties. A spokesman said: “All our products are sold by independent advisers and it is their responsibility to ensure that investors are given all relevant information. We do not sell directly to investors.” \nIn another case, de Vere, which claims to the biggest financial adviser in the world, sold a British man living in Thailand a pension through insurance firm Royal London 360 (now called Rl360), for which set-up charges came in at £45,554 or 12pc of his £378,675 fund. \nA deVere spokesman said: “deVere in most countries does not charge a fee. In certain countries the law requires fees to be charged. Where that is the case, the fee is normally 1pc, but depending on the product there are rare circumstances where a higher fee may be charged, but, again, clients are always made fully aware of this.” \nGillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Dreams of retiring abroad can be shattered if people lose their life savings. Always check that someone claiming to be a financial adviser is registered with the FCA and be aware that UK based advisers may not be qualified to give advice on overseas products. \n\"If you do use an overseas financial adviser check whether there is a regulating body in that country, and if they are registered. The FCA has a list of organisations to avoid. If you live abroad you can still access the Pension Wise guidance service if you have a UK based defined contribution pension, either online or over the phone.” \nSarah Lord, head of financial planning at Killik & Co, a British FCA-regulated firm, said: “The operation of offshore advisers, in the main, is totally unscrupulous. In many offshore jurisdictions, such as Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, there is very little requirement for disclosure of remuneration with up to 15pc of assets being advised upon being taken in hidden commissions. \n\"The requirement to demonstrate suitability is negligible.” \nHave you had a bad experience with a financial adviser?
