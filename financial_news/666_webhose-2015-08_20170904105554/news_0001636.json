Each tract got a single bid, and BHP Billiton Petroleum (Deepwater) Inc. made 26 of the bids. \nThe smallest sale in that area before Wednesday was in 1986, when $56.8 million was bid on 41 tracts. \nBP Exploration and Production Inc. made a single bid. Ecopetrol America Inc. made one on its own and three together with Anadarko US Offshore Corp., and Peregrine OI7 Gas II LLC made two. \nAn offshore industries trade group said Tuesday that low oil prices were among factors likely to depress interest in the sale. \n___ \n7:10 a.m. \nThe federal government is offering nearly 22 million acres off the Texas coast to oil and gas developers, though low oil prices are likely to limit interest. \nThe sale is scheduled for Wednesday. The last comparable lease sales in the western Gulf of Mexico brought in $109.1 million and $100.1 million. \nA March sale in the far more popular central Gulf of Mexico brought the lowest number of bids since 1986, and officials said low prices were the reason. Since then, the price of U.S. crude has dropped $1.44 a barrel. \nAn offshore trade group said in a news release Tuesday that members look forward to the sale \"but do not anticipate jaw-dropping results.\" The National Ocean Industries Association cites low prices, uncertainty over new regulations and an upward trend in lawsuits over permits and leases. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:07:39.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
