PUBLISHED: 18:43, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:19, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 GETTY Over three million people in the UK suffer from diabetes \nInitially more than a million diabetes patients stand to benefit from the Noctura 400, which could also deliver £1billion in health service savings through earlier, less complicated and more effective intervention. Treating diabetes overall costs £10billion. \nDeveloped by PolyPhotonix (PPX), the soft mask contains small, removable electronic discs with advanced lighting and face-sensor technology. \nThese prevent, heal and monitor blindness caused by the most common diseases associated with Type 1 and 2 of the condition – diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema.

That is why light-based technologies in healthcare are finally coming into their own.” \nPPX’s breakthrough therapy for such early stage and deteriorating diabetic sight-loss conditions is primarily home-based. \nThe mask’s non-invasive process offers significant advantages both in terms of cost and patient comfort, compared with more conventional treatments such as eye injections or laser, which isn’t permanent and has other sight-reducing side effects. GETTY Diabetes can lead to retinopathy and macular oedema, which can cause blindness \nPPX’s first product has passed some clinical trials and is already being used in 35 UK hospitals and some opticians.Eyes lack oxygen during sleep, something the body normally adjusts to, but diabetics have low oxygen levels and the treatment prevents overcompensation leading to increased blood flows, bleeds, leakages and sight loss.The mask works by delivering a precise dose of a low green light (using organic light emitting diodes) during the night programmed to suit each patient, rectifying the impact of the diabetes and providing maximum stimulation for eyes with the least energy.Patients return their mask to their hospital for a replacement every three months. Light-based technologies in healthcare are finally coming into their own Richard Kirk, PPX founder \nThe data gives doctors a better idea about vision changes and treatment plans, as well as more accurate evidence as to whether it has been worn correctly as compliance is a major issue in diabetic care.Investment totalling £20million –£19million of innovation and enterprise funding and £1million in angel backing – has so far gone into bringing PPX’s concept to market.PPX turns over £700,000 and employs 21 in its production unit near its research partner, the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) in County Durham. \nA new factory in 2017 with staff of more than 60 and global exports is not just a vision for the future but the reality, says Kirk. \nWith an international market of 102million patients for the Noctura, PPX sales rollout to the US, Europe and Middle East is also under way. \n“PPX’s is a disruptive technology, there is nothing else like it,” says Kirk. “We’re planning a whole family of biophotonic products, including further versions of the Noctura and a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration. \n“Incidence of diabetes is set to increase by 50 per cent by 2030. There is a tsunami of costs facing health and social care services.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T00:43:32.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
