Ratings agencies slashed their AAA ratings to junk or withdrew them altogether. That meant bond issuers no longer benefited from their coverage.\nBond insurers essentially lend their rating to municipalities who use insurance to lower their borrowing costs.\nFor example, Puerto Rico's insured bonds are trading at hefty premiums compared to uninsured bonds. Insured debt of the Puerto Rico power authority, which is currently in restructuring talks with creditors, recently sold for around 96 cents on the dollar, while uninsured debt is selling for around 54 cents.\nBefore the crisis, around half of all new municipal bonds had insurance from nine insurers, with nearly 60 percent covered in 2005. By 2012, that had fallen to just 3.6 percent, although it has climbed steadily to 6.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, Thomson Reuters data shows.\nAlthough insurers have slowly recovered since then, Puerto Rico could be their first major test in terms of losses.\nPuerto Rico's Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in June that the U.S. Territory could not afford to pay its debts, adding that all Puerto Rico's bonds were now negotiable. That shocked many investors who believed the problem was contained in Puerto Rico's public corporations.\nPuerto Rico actually defaulted on Aug. 1 by paying only a fraction of what was due on its Public Finance Corp (PFC) bonds. None of those bonds were insured,\nCrucially, S&P's Veno reaffirmed the ratings on Puerto Rico's two biggest insurers, MBIA - through its National Public Finance Guarantee subsidiary - and Assured Guaranty, after the governor's comments. But a downgrade in response to bigger-than-expected losses could limit their ability to get new business from municipalities that borrow based on their credit ratings.\nKey to the health of the insurers will be whether they can maintain the momentum in writing new business or whether bond investors can go without insurance or diversify into firms with little or no Puerto Rico exposure such as Build America Mutual (BAM).\nMany stock investors have not stuck around to find out. Shares in both MBIA and Assured plummeted after the governor's statement. MBIA's shares fell to their lowest level since 2010 although they have since recovered some of their losses.\nBoth companies said in statements they can handle pessimistic scenarios in Puerto Rico. MBIA pointed to the \"extremely strong\" capital position of its National Public Finance Guarantee subsidiary. Assured said it had the \"resources and loss mitigation expertise\" to handle its exposure to Puerto Rico.\nAssured has $4.9 billion of net exposure to Puerto Rico and $12 billion in claims paying resources. It also generates $400 million from its investments portfolio. Given that municipal claims are paid out over the life of the bond and not all at once means that it is more than adequately capitalized to honor any claims made by investors on Puerto Rico debt.\nAssured says a 20 percent loss to the $773 million of power authority bonds it insures would result in annual claims of just $13 million. But losses could be substantially higher in the event of a wider and deeper default.\nAssured is also rated 'AA' compared to MBIA's 'AA-', giving it an extra buffer in the event of a downgrade.\nMBIA's gross exposure of $4.3 billion to Puerto Rico is lower than Assured' s but is closer to claims paying resources of $4.9 billion at its National Public Finance Guarantee Corp unit. However, MBIA said it has seen business volumes growing since Padilla's speech.\nIts lower AA- rating also means a potential downgrade could have a more profound impact.\nStill, muni bond investors continue to buy the insurers' products, seeing value in insurance even if they may be distinguishing between the firms.\n\"Bond insurance will surprise to the upside,\" said John Loffredo, a fund manager with MacKay Municipal Managers, who says the firm's retail clients have been asking for it more frequently since Puerto Rico hit the headlines in 2013.\nLoffredo says 26 percent of the firms $13 billion in municipal bonds is insured. That number is as high as 35 percent in the firms $1.4 billion MainStay tax free fund, which Loffredo co-manages.
