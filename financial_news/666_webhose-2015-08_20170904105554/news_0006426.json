Karleen Minney by Michael Stutchbury Going by the online traffic on afr.com, one of our most-read stories this week was our announcement that Mark Latham had written his last column for The Australian Financial Review . It's one of those occasions when a newspaper editor-in-chief gets to feel what it's like to be in the middle of a media storm.\nIt started on Friday evening last week. I had been trying to get hold of Latham to catch up on a few things. That morning, the Financial Review 's BOSS magazine had featured Australian of the Year Rosie Batty as one of its 2015 \"true leaders\" as chosen by an independent panel. Our coverage mentioned Latham's controversial criticism of her. And I was dealing with a complaint from Catherine McGregor, the former Malcolm McGregor who, like Latham, worked in Bob Carr's office ages ago and who now is a senior Air Force officer.\nI've known McGregor personally for three decades and helped introduce her to the world as Catherine in the Financial Review in 2012. But now Group Captain McGregor was complaining about a Latham column of a couple of months ago that referred to her as he/she. Uncoincidentally, I was also getting media calls about an abusive twitter account that seems to be more or less connected to Latham.\nI tried again on Sunday to get hold of Latham but no luck, until late in the afternoon he replied that, while he had enjoyed writing for the Financial Review over the past eight years, he had now filed his last column. He declined my request to talk it through. It's usually not appropriate to canvas in any detail the stated reasons for the departure of any employee or contractor but, in this case, they had nothing to do with McGregor nor with this \"real Mark Latham\" twitter account.\nConcidentally, less than an hour later, online tabloid site BuzzFeed posted a story that featured highly-selective extracts of what I had assumed to be my private correspondence with what was proving to be an increasingly erratic McGregor. It also published a letter from Westpac to McGregor (though BuzzFeed didn't reveal her as the recipient) which revealed the bank's understandable discomfort over a loose campaign to link Latham's controversial columns to the successful Women of Influence event presented by the Financial Review and Westpac.\nThis unusual behaviour from a senior military officer ramped up a minor media frenzy. My mobile phone went nuts on Monday morning, when the \"real Mark Latham\" twitter feed declared that \"the AFR has sacked poor Latho\". I stopped answering unfamiliar numbers so I could prepare a story to go on afr.com to announce Latham's resignation.\nAs mentioned, the afr.com story took off, sparking debate about whether the man who could have become prime minister had finally flamed out or whether he was the victim of suffocating political correctness.\nIn Sydney's The Daily Telegraph , Miranda Devine wrote that she hated some of Latham's columns but said that the Financial Review had succumbed to pressure from Westpac and sacked him for being too offensive. Thankfully, Tele editor Paul Whittaker published my letter to the editor correcting the record on both counts and emphasising that I was sorry to see Latham go.\n But, then, on The Australian's page one on Friday, Shari Markson continues to wrongly suggest that the Financial Review and Latham parted ways over his inflammatory commentary about Rosie Batty and McGregor. And she wrongly claims that McGregor's complaints to me and Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood in part led to Latham's departure. They simply didn't.\nAnd, while the Financial Review has defended Latham's right to criticise the likes of Batty, no one columnist sets the masthead's overall agenda. The Financial Review does that.\nThe bottom lines. First, Latham's Financial Review column reference to McGregor was perhaps mildly mocking. But the ABC previously has aired something similar that it later ruled OK. At the time, McGregor reportedly said she wasn't that offended and she had a pretty thick skin.\nSecond, as revealed by one of the McGregor letters on Buzzfeed, Westpac previously had expressed its strong concern to the Financial Review about the derogatory nature of Latham's columns. But it also said these columns should not detract from the achievements of the Women of Influence awards, now in their fourth year. And, contrary to the campaign to undermine the awards, Westpac revealed that this year's nominations had exceeded those of previous years.\nThird, the \"real Mark Latham\" twitter feed can be pretty wild but also often incomprehensible. Many Financial Review readers are pleased to see Latham gone, but others from across the political spectrum say they'll miss his uncompromising western Sydney take on inner-urban elites, left-wing feminists and the loony right-wing fringe.\nMichael Stutchbury is the editor in chief of The Australian Financial Review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:48:04.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
