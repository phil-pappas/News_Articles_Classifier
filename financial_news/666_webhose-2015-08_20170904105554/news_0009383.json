When bond spreads spike the market is factoring in a higher risk.\n \"Credit spreads have been blowing out, but it is quite unusual that two months ago Australia looked cheap compared to the rest of the world and we are now looking expensive,\" Mr Wood said.\n\"This is different to the global financial crisis (GFC) when everything was sold off.\"\nNikko Asset Management global rates and currency strategist Roger Bridges said the relatively limited supply of Australian bonds has shielded them from the volatility.\n\"The amount of corporate debt is reducing, during the GFC we had 30 per cent corporate paper while nowadays it is down to something like 15 per cent,\" Mr Bridges said.\n\"We are seeing a lack of credit â€” that's why the Apple deal went so well.\"\nThe US technology giant last week printed $2.25 billion in Australian dollar bonds, smashing the record for the largest corporate bond issue in Australia.\nThe corporate debt conditions were starkly different to the US, where companies have been borrowing heavily to launch share buybacks and pay dividends, as well as protect their offshore earnings as a surging US dollar has mad the exchange rate more expensive, Mr Bridges said.\nAustralian companies are being viewed as attractive relative to the instability in Asian markets.\nGoldman Sachs this week moved into high-yielding Australian equities whose reliable dividends stood out among collapsing Asian equity and currency markets.\nMr Wood said Australian corporate bonds were likely to deliver steady returns over the next 12 months because he believed China's government had policy tools available to avoid a sharp slowdown in its economic growth.\n\"This in turn assists Australia's economic growth outlook and reduces the chances of a jump in Australian default rates,\" Mr Wood said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:08:13.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
