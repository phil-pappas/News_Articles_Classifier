High variance in the availability of pyrethrins limited their usage and encouraged the development of synthetic alternatives. Pyrethroids are synthetic insecticides with chemical structures that resemble pyrethrins. A majority of pyrethroids are derived by modifying the ester linkage or acid or alcohol moiety of naturally available compounds. Synthetic pyrethroids were developed to improve specificity and activity of pyrethrins while maintaining high knockdown and low terrestrial vertebrate toxicity.\nTechnavio's analysts forecast the global pyrethroids market to grow at a CAGR of 5.07% over the period 2014-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nCommenting on the report an analyst from Technavio’s team said: “Although more than 1000 pyrethroids have been discovered most of them are not yet commercialized. The most commonly modified features in the chemical structure are alcohol moiety ester linkage and acid moiety. Properties of pyrethroids and their applications are subject to extensive study. These chemicals are widely exploited to manufacture value-added products. Pyrethroids are used in the manufacture of indoor residual sprays particularly mosquito repellents and impregnated materials.”\nAccording to the report an increase in the consumption of value-added products and meat has increased the demand for cattle and poultry thereby increasing the demand for fodder. As we move higher across the food chain from grain to meat much of the former is required to produce the latter and hence increased usage of fertilizer and insecticides is necessary to achieve the requisite production of grain and fodder. An increase in acreage is often associated with a higher risk of crop diseases leading to an increase in the usage of insecticides to enhance crop quality and optimize crop yield.\nFurther the report states that lack of awareness about pyrethroids and pyrethrums among farmers in Asia Africa and South America hinders market growth as these regions contribute a major share to global agricultural output.\nThe key players in the Global Pyrethroids Market are BASF Bayer CropScience Dow AgroSciences Nufarm SinoHarvest Corporation Sumitomo Chemical Syngenta and United Phosphorus while other prominent vendors include Arysta Lifescience Cheminova DuPont FMC Monsanto and Shanghai Mingdou Agrochemical\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry. The report contains a comprehensive market and vendor landscape in addition to a SWOT analysis of the key vendors.\nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
