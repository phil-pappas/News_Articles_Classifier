May was revised down slightly to 0.9 percent from 1.0 percent.\nSales at gasoline stations rose 2.6 percent, the fifth consecutive month of gains as prices at the pump climbed. Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 9.4 percent as consumers bought more phones and home office electronics. The increase coincided with new rules limiting the duration of cellphone contracts, the agency said.\nAfter four straight months of gains, sales at new-car dealers declined by 0.5 percent, dragging the overall motor vehicle and parts sector down 0.1 percent.\nCanada may have been in recession in the first half of the year as the oil-exporting country has been hit by the drop in crude prices, and economists will parse the report for signs an expected rebound is taking hold.
