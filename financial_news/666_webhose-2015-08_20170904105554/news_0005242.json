Starting today, DataStax Enterprise (DSE) users will be able to visualize and analyze operational, machine data streamed from their DataStax implementations on their jKool dashboard along with any other machine data they are viewing. Subscriptions to real-time updates from DataStax will provide users with proactive detection of performance and availability issues in their mission-critical, DSE platform which includes: the Apache Cassandra™ NoSQL database as well as Solr and Spark. jKool’s real-time capability to spot problems and exceptions quickly and “find the needle in the haystack” provides immediate value to businesses using DSE as the platform for their applications exploiting the value in the Internet of Things (IoT), and other Web and Mobile applications. jKool’s instant insight helps reduce risk and can immediately improve the productivity of the DevOps and application support teams responsible for DSE.\njKool support for DSE includes the following: visualization and analysis of the availability of the file-systems, operating system and memory and other critical resources used by DSE clusters. In addition jKool provides insight into runtimes, DSE tasks such as compaction, garbage collection, data ingestion or processing rates, reads, writes and dropped counts. jKool also ingests DSE logs and can detect hung tasks and many other exceptions that impact DSE cluster performance and availability. Any abnormal condition or trend towards one can be detected. jKool can be used concurrently with DSE OpCenter.\nThe jKool SaaS platform automatically visualizes time-series data from sources such as Apache Spark, STORM, Syslog, Log4j, Logback, SLF4J, JMX or Java EE in real-time. Using SaaS, there are no servers, database or schemas to manage. jKool’s real-time scorecard provides immediate insight to developers or users in DevOps who can now make split-second decisions based on data in motion about their business-critical applications and infrastructure. They learn what they didn’t already know, take advantage of perishable insights, avoid preventable losses and uncover new opportunities.\njKool visualization includes behavior, performance, location and topology displayed on a real-time dashboard. Users can subscribe to topics of interest and get updates as they arrive or interactively ask questions using an easy-to-use, English-like query language (jKool Query Language or jKQL). jKool, a multi-tenant solution is itself built on the Apache open-source foundation of Cassandra and Solr from DataStax, along with Kafka, Spark and STORM all orchestrated in-concert via jKool FatPipes™ micro services technology. To make data ingestion easy and flexible, jKool provides a library of open-source collectors.\n“In today’s data-driven world, enterprises need to quickly capitalize on the data contained in their operational database systems to make decisions to better serve customers and drive business,” said Matt Pfeil, Chief Customer Office and co-founder, DataStax. “jKool provides users with a visual analytical solution to quickly capture and explore insight in their IT environment.”\n\"To date, operational intelligence is normally accomplished the “old fashioned” way, poring over multiple logs, writing notes and trying to make sense of tasks that span across applications and servers. This is a tedious process with low productivity and high risk. jKool’s real-time visualization and analytics can provide instant insight into operational, machine data in real-time improving productivity, reducing risk and increasing application quality,” said Charley Rich, vice president of product management at jKool. “Today, we are excited to add our support of operational intelligence for DataStax Enterprise, providing real-time visualization for all DSE metrics, performance and availability data and trends. DataStax clients can now have the same insight into their machine data as other applications”\nAbout DataStax\nDataStax delivers Apache Cassandra™ in a database platform purpose-built for the performance and availability demands for IOT, web and mobile applications. This gives enterprises a secure, always-on database technology that remains operationally simple when scaling in a single datacenter or across multiple datacenters and clouds.\nFor more information, visit DataStax.com.\nAbout jKool, LLC\njKool, LLC provides open source technology and a cloud-based service to provide real-time operational intelligence, visualization and analytics from streaming data for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), Retail, Finance and Digital Healthcare.
