The Trust is currently the largest non-bank financial institution in the country. \nThe primary responsibility is to replace part of lost income for Ghanaian workers or their dependants due to old-age, invalidity, or loss of life. \nThe Pension Scheme as administered by SSNIT has a registered membership of approximately 1.2 million, with over 140,000 pensioners who regularly receive their monthly pensions from SSNIT. The annual absolute growth of pensioners is over 7,000. \nBy their feature, a worker contributes 5.5% of monthly basic salary whilst the employer contributes 13% of worker’s monthly basic salary. \nFurther information from SSNIT also indicates that 2.5% is transferred to the National Health Insurance Fund for provision of medical insurance, and 5% is transferred to Tier-2. \nSSNIT effectively withholds 11% for the administration of Tier-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T19:51:52.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
