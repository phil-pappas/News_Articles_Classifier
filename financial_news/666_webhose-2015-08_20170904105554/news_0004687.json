Tsipras sought on Wednesday to contain a rebellion in his left-wing Syriza party ahead of a vote on a second package of reforms required to start talks on a rescue deal. REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou YIANNIS KOURTOGLOU Greece may seek €24 billion in a first tranche of bailout aid from international lenders in August to prop up its banks and repay debts falling due at the ECB, a pro-government Greek newspaper said in its early Sunday editions.\nAthens is now in talks with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund to secure up to €86 billion ($US94.48 billion) in bailout aid. It will be its third bailout since 2010.\nAvgi newspaper, which is close to the leftist Syriza government, said Greek authorities expected to conclude talks with lenders by mid-August.\nThe first tranche of €24.36 billion would be used to channel €10 billion as an initial recapitalisation to Greek banks, €7.16 billion to repay an emergency bridge loan, €3.2 billion towards Greek bonds held by the European Central Bank and other payments, Avgi said.\nIt has been estimated that Greek banks may require up to €25 billion to be recapitalised, a shortfall exacerbated by an outflow of deposits when a stalemate with lenders threatened Athens' place in the euro zone.\nThe flood of money leaving the country culminated in authorities imposing capital controls on June 29 to prevent a financial meltdown.\nIn exchange for funding Greece has accepted reforms including making significant pension adjustments, increasing value added taxes, overhauling its collective bargaining system, and measures to liberalise its economy and limit public spending.\nIf the talks are not completed in time, European authorities may have to provide further temporary financing as they did with a July bridge loan, though Avgi said that possibility had not been discussed with lenders.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T02:07:04.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
