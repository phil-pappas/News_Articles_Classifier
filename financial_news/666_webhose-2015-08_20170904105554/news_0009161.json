These people had not lost anyone in the Mumbai attacks and were thus pleading for leniency. But, the President and the Supreme Court did not listen to them and dismissed their petitions keeping the sentiments of the country in mind,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.\n“All those who asked for mercy to be shown towards Memon should be tried for being enemies of the country,” it asserted.\n“Memon has been hanged, and now government should take firm steps to ensure that no efforts are made to project him as innocent or martyr before the people,” the Sena demanded.\nThe Mumbai serial blasts was an attack on the country by Pakistan, the Sena said and added that the neighbouring country has long been planning terror strikes against India.\n“Dawood and Tiger are in Pakistan. Yakub too ran away to Pakistan and returned later. What is the point in showing mercy just because he came back to India? There was strong proof against him and his lawyer tried his best to save him,” the editorial said.\nThe ruling alliance partner also suggested a debate on the fate of the killers of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh still living despite being awarded death sentence.\n“One point which (Asaduddin) Owaisi made is worth thinking about. The killers of former PM Rajiv Gandhi and ex-CM Beant Singh are living after being given death sentences because the respective state governments are against their killing,” it said.\n“There can be a discussion on this and legal battle can also be fought. But only on these grounds mercy cannot be granted to someone responsible for hundreds of deaths in the Mumbai bomb blasts,” the Sena said.\n 31, 2015 11:46 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:23:28.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
