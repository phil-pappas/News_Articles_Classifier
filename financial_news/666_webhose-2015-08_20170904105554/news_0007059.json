Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell\nThe Australian dollar rebounded on Thursday on hopes China will not let the yuan depreciate more after its central bank stepped up its verbal support for the currency and said there was no basis for further weakening, given strong economic fundamentals\nThe dollar began the day at US73.8¢, up significantly from its low of US72.15¢ on Wednesday, to around the levels at which it traded before the People's Bank of China shocked markets on Tuesday with a \"one-off\" currency devaluation.\nThe Aussie did plunge half a US cent to US73.3¢ immediately after China lowered the yuan's fixing rate by another 1.1 per cent on Thursday morning, but within minutes had rallied to above US74¢, before settling at US73.9¢ in late afternoon trade.\nChina's three consecutive drops in the fixing rate have now shaved more than 4 per cent off the yuan since Monday. But the currency on Thursday morning reacted less dramatically to the lower target, raising hopes the market was stabilising.\nYuan declines eased after central bank intervention on Wednesday night signalled to traders that China will control the pace of depreciation to limit capital outflows.\nA press conference by the People's Bank of China on Thursday also helped calm investors.\n\"There's no basis for the depreciation to persist,\" PBOC assistant governor Zhang Xiaohui said at the rare briefing on the currency in Beijing. The adjustment spurred by Tuesday's change to how the PBOC determines the yuan's daily reference rate was basically already completed, she said.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...
