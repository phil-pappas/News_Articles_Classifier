Michel O'Sullivan by Vesna Poljak The profit season has failed to ignite optimism about the outlook for earnings in the next fiscal year as a series of underwhelming forecasts, coinciding with a correction in the Australian sharemarket, resets expectations.\nThe market's tendency to downgrade earnings estimates appears to be coming earlier than usual as the results for 2014-15 filter in and trading conditions are updated. The 2017 financial year is coming into clearer focus and only a few stocks have delivered convincing cases for upgrades.\nCitigroup equity strategist Tony Brennan said that with the equivalent of 40 per cent of the market by capitalisation having reported, \"the broadening earnings pressures do create more uncertainty about growth [in 2016-17]\". The 2017 fiscal year starts in less than 12 months' time.\nBroadly, Mr Brennan saw downgrades for one-third of stocks and only a handful of upgrades. The median revision to forecasts for this fiscal year is a downgrade of 1.9 per cent.\nMore damning is that consensus forecasts are still pencilling in earnings per share growth for the S&P/ASX 200 Index of 10.2 per cent in 2016-17, up from 1.3 per cent in 2015-16. The index is on track for an earnings contraction of 2.1 per cent for the 2015 financial year.\nTo return to double-digit earnings growth, the market is looking for a rebound in commodity prices to drive a 43.5 per cent jump in earnings within the resources sector next fiscal year.\n\"The significance seems more that a number of the areas the market was getting solid growth from in recent years seem to be facing greater headwinds, and it raises uncertainty about growth and returns over the next couple of years,\" the strategist said. \"It is really for the banks and other stocks that challenges are now more apparent.\"\nMr Brennan's take comes as other experts identify similar shortcomings in the quality of earnings coming through.\n 'Somewhat inauspicious' Credit Suisse's quantitative research showed that dividend payments were one of the few aspects of corporate results to surprise, roughly 1.8 per cent higher than expectations, with $6.5 billion in dividends declared so far.\nThe rate of dividend growth was 9.3 per cent, faster than the 7.4 per cent anticipated and beating the growth in net profit. The payout ratio of the market has advanced to 71.5 per cent compared with 69.8 per cent in the previous corresponding period.\nUBS strategist David Cassidy described the start of the results period, which runs until the end of August, as \"somewhat inauspicious\".\nHe pointed to the concentration of downgrades in United States dollar-earners, which have been a sector strongly in favour over the past year in anticipation of the declining Australian currency. However, the so-called US dollar-earners have not been immune to the falling euro, which has led to foreign exchange-related earnings reductions.\nMr Cassidy observed the market looked \"oversold\" but at the same time there was no obvious case for a rebound over the medium term.\n\"From a big-picture perspective, bank results have been relatively benign and the key iron ore price is showing some resilience,\" Mr Cassidy said, adding that companies with earnings linked to the domestic economy, such as Echo Entertainment, have performed solidly.\nExtreme share price reactions have been a standout feature of this results period, some of which has been attributed to the $16 billion banks have asked of investors through capital raisings. Fund managers have sold off underperforming companies to fund the capital call .\nAnsell and Computershare, which both endured double-digit downgrades, recorded relative share price declines of 16.4 per cent and 7.7 per cent in the aftermath, according to UBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:05:44.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
