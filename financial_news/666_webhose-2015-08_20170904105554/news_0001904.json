Andrew Meares by Joanna Mather Politicians should look to the business community to gauge what's acceptable when it comes to claiming work-related expenses, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said as a new poll shows the expenses scandal has damaged his chances of re-election.\nThe so-called \"family reunion\" scheme, a travel entitlement designed to allow politicians to spend time with spouses and children, is at the centre of ongoing reports about the sorts of extravagances that forced the resignation of Speaker Bronwyn Bishop .\nMr Abbott has announced a \"root and branch\" review of entitlements headed by ex-Labor Speaker Harry Jenkins and former Liberal leader Brendan Nelson .\nA ReachTEL poll conducted for Fairfax Media ahead of Parliament's return on Monday shows almost half of voters are less likely to support Mr Abbott following the expenses scandal.\n\"Politics is full of all sorts of ups and downs,\" Mr Abbott told Channel 9 on Sunday. \"It was a pity to lose Bronwyn but on the other hand we've now got a root and branch review in place,\" he said.\n\"The point is that obviously there are things which have ben inside the rules but they've been outside community expectations.\n\"The sorts of things that should be inappropriate in business should be likewise for politicians.\"\nMr Abbott's comments came as News Limited reported that Treasurer Joe Hockey charged taxpayers $14,000 to fly his family to Perth.\n New Speaker to be decided Monday Federal politicians are returning to Canberra after the winter break and the government's first order of business will be to select a new Speaker. That will be decided Monday morning by a ballot of the 74 lower house Liberal MPs.\nSources told The Australian Financial Review that Mr Abbott will be voting for Victorian MP Russell Broadbent, while Treasurer Joe Hockey is a fan of Adelaide's Andrew Southcott. But fellow frontbencher Scott Morrison is behind Victorian Tony Smith.\nMr Smith and Dr Southcott are still considered the favourites for the job.\nOutgoing Speaker Bronwyn Bishop was criticised for being too partisan and continued to attend party meetings in what is supposed to be an independent role in the Parliament.\nMr Abbott said it would be up to the new Speaker as to whether they attend party meetings.\n\"I'm very confident that whoever does emerge as Speaker tomorrow will be someone who can command support across the Parliament,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/abbott-dragged-down-by-scandal-as-shorten-surges-ahead-20150807-giuivw.html"], "published": "2015-08-09T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T11:04:48.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
