The programme aims to support research into areas of medical need in cardiovascular medicine. Four grants of up to €400,000 each will be awarded to researchers or clinicians following live presentations by selected finalists to a panel of high profile experts appointed by the ESC. \n“We are really excited to support the ESC in launching this unique peer challenge grant concept. We believe this will stimulate exciting new research with the ultimate ambition of improving the lives of patients,” said Professor Jörg Kreuzer, Vice President Medicine, Therapeutic Area Cardiovascular, Boehringer Ingelheim. “We are encouraging clinicians and researchers to submit their proposals to the ESC.” \n“This grant project is a reflection of the ESC’s commitment to encouraging new and innovative research aimed at improving patient outcomes in thromboembolic disease – a leading cause of mortality worldwide,” said Professor Francesco Cosentino, the chair of the programme’s scientific committee. “It is estimated that one in four people die as a result of thromboembolic disease, which causes abnormal blood clotting, and more research into this disorder is urgently needed. We are excited about this initiative because it is a great opportunity to perform important studies aiming to a better understanding of novel therapeutic strategies in this setting. We are now ready to receive applications from around the world for these prestigious grants - until the November 1st deadline - and look forward to announcing the four winners at European Heart House on December 1st following live presentations by all finalists. \nThe ESC Grants for Medical Research Innovation website, which includes details about the research categories, applicant eligibility and information about how to submit an entry for the peer challenge, is accessible from today via: www.escardio.org/innovationgrants . \nThe application deadline is 1 November 2015 and projects awarded funding will be announced in December 2015. ENDS \nNOTES TO THE EDITORS \nAbout ESC Grants for Medical Research Innovation \nThe ESC Grants for Medical Research Innovation will focus on improving patient outcomes in thromboembolic diseases. \nThe four awarded grants of up to €400,000 each will be made possible by an independent grant from Boehringer Ingelheim. Applications for projects are encouraged from medical professionals and research scientists from around the world. \nThe evaluation and selection process of the researchers will be conducted by a dedicated Scientific Committee independently appointed by the ESC. The Committee will evaluate all grant proposals. Studies selected are required to have a publishable outcome or data within 18 months from the grant being awarded. Distinct from other programmes, a short list of up to 8 applicants will be invited to present and defend their proposals live to the Scientific Committee at the European Heart House in Nice. The Committee will then decide on the same day the winners, and will continue to oversee the implementation of the successful research programmes. \nAbout thromboembolic diseases \nThromboembolic diseases, or diseases that can cause abnormal blood clotting. This includes atrial fibrillation, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease. One in four people die from causes related to thrombosis; it is a leading cause of mortality worldwide – ongoing research into the area is vital to enhance the treatment and care for patients at risk. \nAbout the European Society of Cardiology www.escardio.org \nThe European Society of Cardiology (ESC) represents more than 90 000 cardiology professionals across Europe and worldwide.
