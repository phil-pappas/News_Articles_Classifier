Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The mania for short-term yield across the self-managed superannuation sector has been blamed for worsening a national corporate investment strike that will ultimately lead to weaker economic growth and fewer jobs.\nEconomist Stephen Anthony said self-managed funds are \"in a flight to short-termism\", many favouring domestic shares for tax reasons rather than their long-run potential.\n\"Their portfolio allocations are not economic,\" said Mr Anthony, recently hired as chief economist for Industry Super Australia after several years advising groups such as the Business Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia.\n\"They're bringing private or business assets into self-managed structures for estate planning and tax reasons – none of this is driven by the long-term consideration of the Australian economy.\"\nA reason industry funds tend to outperform their competitors is that they own and develop infrastructure and other unlisted assets with a long-term approach to capital allocation. In a defence against planned changes to governance rules for industry super funds being pushed by the government , Mr Anthony warned that self-managed and retail funds tend to be more focused on shorter-term gains.\nChanging the way industry super boards are constituted at a time when economists, governments and the Reserve Bank of Australia are calling out for extra long-term investment is a risky bet, he said.\n\"Has it really been thought through from the perspective of economic growth?\" he said.\n\"If you want to mess with the Australian economy, mess with the capital stock,\" he said. \"If you want to retard the rate of capital formation through time, at the margin this is one of things you would do. This [Industry Fund] model has been very successful in forming and attracting capital.\"\n The remarks add to a growing debate about whether Australia's investment and corporate management cultures have become anti-growth and overly defensive – effectively threatening the next wave of potential economic opportunities.\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens has challenged corporate boards to lower their expectations about future returns when making investment decisions, and there have been warnings that the nation's sharemarket could become a global backwater because its companies are locked in a \"self-fulfilling doom loop\" caused by investor demands for dividends.\nLack of growth breeds fear ANZ Bank chief economist Warren Hogan, in a major interview for Monday's The Australian Financial Review , said the low-growth era affecting economies around the world is making companies and investors even more cautious about deploying capital and avoiding mistakes.\n\"In a world where there is less return, less growth, there's less room for error,\" Mr Hogan said. For instance, if an equities manager blows up his European share portfolio, his US equivalent would be unlikely to make up the difference as there is no yield or return in either market, he said.\n\"It's the same story for businesses. Where there's six projects out there and you get one of them wrong then it ruins the return on all the others.\n\"That means the level of precision has got to be higher. What we're seeing really powerfully here in corporate Australia is caution because people don't want to deploy capital and get it wrong.\"\nMr Anthony said one of the key reasons industry funds tend to outperform their competitors is that they own and develop infrastructure and other unlisted assets with a long-term approach to capital allocation.\nCompared to retail funds, they hold more than double the proportion of their funds in unlisted equities (6 per cent versus 3 per cent); seven times more in infrastructure (7 per cent versus 1 per cent); and 7 per cent in unlisted property versus 2 per cent, according to Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority figures cited by Mr Anthony.\nIn total, industry funds hold 20 per cent of their funds under management in unlisted assets, compared to 6 per cent across retail funds.\nMr Anthony warned that overseas evidence suggests that changes to the governance of super funds can change asset allocation decisions.\nRemoving employee and employer representation from super boards \"will pressure industry super funds to be managed and behave more like retail super funds\", Mr Anthony said.\n\"These reforms are likely to undermine growth footings in the economy,\" he said.\n\"It's a great irony that at a time when this economy needs all its investment settings firing, those funds have been placed in this situation.\"\nLower growth the new normal Governor Stevens questioned last month whether Australia's potential economic growth rate may have fallen from the 3 to 3.25 per cent range that has long been assumed as normal.\nPaul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, estimates the economy's potential growth rate may now be closer to 2.75 per cent, particularly if productivity growth doesn't pick up from its current levels and growth in the labour force declines, as appears to be happening.\nMr Dales believes even if the potential rate has fallen, actual growth is likely to be even weaker this year at about 2 per cent, increasing the likelihood of further interest rate cuts. This will, in turn, depress returns on fixed-income investments such as bonds and term deposits even more.\nBank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane last week pointed out that the average British investor has cut the average length of time a stock is held to six months from six years a generation ago.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-02T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:56:10.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
