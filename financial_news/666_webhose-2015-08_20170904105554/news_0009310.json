Nebraska doesn't have a sales tax holiday, although the idea has been kicked around from time to time by Nebraska lawmakers. \nThe Iowa holiday allows shoppers to buy select clothing and footwear priced at less than $100 without paying sales tax or local option taxes. The two days are usually among the best of the year for Iowa retailers. \nAlthough the sales tax holiday falls during the back-to-school shopping season, the tax exemption applies to merchandise for adults, too. \nInformation from: The Daily Nonpareil, http://www.nonpareilonline.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T20:23:38.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
