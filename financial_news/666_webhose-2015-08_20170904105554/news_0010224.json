Kejriwal said the scheme would benefit about 2.5 lakh people who mostly live in slums and unauthorised colonies -- the vote bank of the Aam Aadmi Party. \"I feel no scheme can be better than this. No matter how old the dispute is, those living in jhuggis (slums) can pay Rs.250 to settle it,\" Kejriwal said while launching the scheme in east Delhi's Vinod Nagar locality. While slum dwellers will have to pay Rs.250 for each month they did not pay the bills, there will be no action against those who admit to tampering with their electricity meters. The late-payment surcharge has also been waived. He said Rs.250 was a negligible amount and the AAP government had already halved the power rates. The chief minister urged power discoms to ensure that their staff do not issue inflated bills to the people. \"The power companies should ensure that there are no trumped-up cases of power theft,\" he added. Kejriwal said more and more people should avail the benefit of the scheme and spread the word. The AAP government has repeatedly accused Delhi's three power distribution companies of overcharging the consumers -- a charge these firms have vehemently denied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T13:21:31.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
