It sold for $1700.

Weâ€™re @FairfaxMoney\nThe badge for the MCC 1907/08 season sold for $325. Photo: Madeleine Heffernan\nFeatured at that sale was a near-complete collection of Melbourne Cricket Club membership badges, starting with the first year metal badges were issued (1901/02 season) through to the late 1970s.\nAdvertisement Incredibly, the vendors found these in a hessian bag stored in a garden shed in the family home. It's thought the collection belonged to their great grandfather. The family was unaware of them until the shed was cleaned out before demolition.\nLeski, whose auction house has since merged with the Mossgreen group, said at the time that vintage MCC badges appeared for sale periodically but he had never seen such a complete set in such good condition. And this was the first time he had ever offered the first MCC badge for sale.\nThis 1901/02 membership badge for the Melbourne Cricket Club sold for $1650.\nHe gave speculative estimates of $300 to $400 for the first two badges but was gobsmacked when the first one sold for a hammer price of $4750 ($5795 including buyer's premium), more than ten times the higher estimate. The 1902/03 season badge sold for $3050 IBP.\nAnd so it continued all night with a core group of eight to ten bidders slugging it out for each item. All the early badges sold for well over pre-sale estimates, the total collection fetched over $14,000. All but three lots sold.\nWhich leads us to another sale held more recently on 28 July through Gregsons in Perth.\nA membership pass in the form of a ticket, 1879/80.\nThis auction house based in Welshpool usually concentrates on the kind of varied goods obtained through forfeitures and seizures, deceased estates and bankruptcies, with items ranging from a box of trampoline springs to a 1973 MGB GT sports car.\nUsed office furniture is their stock in trade but manager David Jeffs was amazed to see a large collection of MCC badges turn up as part of a bankrupt estate, to be sold by the liquidators. The badges were in good condition, filed neatly in plastic booklets, and he suspected that these were worth considerably more than a box of trampoline springs. He remembered reading about the Leski sale and discovered that the one badge in that collection that was missing, for the 1903/04 season, was present in this collection. More remarkable was the appearance of several 19th-century MCC membership passes in the form of cardboard tickets. The earliest was for the 1879/80 season.\nThey took out a small ad in The Age promoting the sale.\nThe badge for the 1902/03 season was sold for $810.\nResults were considerably less than Leski's but still impressive when compared with other examples of sporting badges and tickets.\nThat 1879/80 ticket sold for $1700, highest price on the day. Other tickets from the 19th century sold for around $1400. The first MCC metal badge sold for $1650, the second for $810.\nSurprisingly the 1903/04 badge missing in 2013 only rated a winning bid of $500. Prices went down quickly according to modernity with anything later than 1920 generally less than $100. There were exceptions. A 1927/28 Country Membership badge which included a Ladies Membership Ticket sold for $650. This package, sold as one lot, is obviously considered a rarity.\nThere may be several reasons for the drop in values.\nFor a start Charles Leski is well known and respected among the small, established network of MCC collectors who are mainly based in Melbourne. These gents prefer to bid live and as Leski noted at the time, there were around ten in his rooms in 2013, competing directly against each other. This would have pushed up prices on the night. Some old school collectors are still reluctant to bid online, especially if they cannot physically check the condition of the items beforehand.\nOn the other hand, those who are comfortable with bidding online may well have picked up some bargains in Perth, including someone who scored a 1917 MCC Patriotic Carnival badge for only $1.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@FairfaxMoney"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T13:30:20.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
