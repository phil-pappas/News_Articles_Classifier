Not only are secured credit cards notorious for high fees and high APRs, they require a security deposit that is held while the account is open in case you default on the balance or don’t make your payments. \nMost of the time, this security deposit is held and returned when you close the account less any fees or outstanding balances. There are secured cards, however, which hold the deposit in savings accounts or CDs, allowing you to earn a little bit extra while the deposit is held. While the interest you earn isn’t enough to make you rich, it can add up especially if you deposit a large amount, which also results in a higher credit limit on your card. Here are the 5 best secured credit cards which pay interest on your deposit.
