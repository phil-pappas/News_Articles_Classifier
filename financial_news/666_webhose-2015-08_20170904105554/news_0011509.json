There's a serious undersupply of apartments in London,\" Steven Lowy said. \n\"The wind is behind our sales but, as it is a new business for us, we are working on how best to extract value in the long term.\" \nWestfield said the loss of $US797.3 million for the prior corresponding period is not comparable because it used only the earnings from Westfield America Trust. \nAt 1315 AEST, Westfield shares were down six cents, or 0.63 per cent, at $9.46. \nWESTFIELD WORKING WELL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T07:16:24.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
