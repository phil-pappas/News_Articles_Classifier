By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 24 minutes ago 1.071 -0.138 \nAsk an expert: We look at how much scope beneficiaries and others have to challenge instructions left in a will \nI owned my house outright at the time of my marriage to my present wife. I propose to leave it to my son by my first wife, now deceased, with the proviso that my present wife be allowed to live in it rent-free until her death. \nCould this be challenged after my death? NCB, via email The simple answer is yes, this could be challenged by either your wife or your son if they thought that they had not received reasonable provision under your will, according to Matthew Barnett, of law firm Harbottle & Lewis. \nIn a recent Court of Appeal case, an estranged daughter was awarded one-third of her mother’s estate despite the will expressly stating that she didn’t want her daughter to receive anything. \nHeather Ilott challenged her late mother’s will under specific rules , set out in the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act (Frankfurt: 0LW.F - news ) 1975, which give certain family members and other dependants the right to bring a financial claim against the estate of a deceased person. \nThe ruling was considered controversial because it appeared to curtail a well-established principle in England and Wales of “testamentary freedom”, whereby every individual is free to leave their estates to whoever they wish. \nMr Barnett said when a claims is brought under the Act, the court considers whether the will provides “reasonable provision” for a dependant, taking into account the need for support and maintenance. \n\"Over the years, there have been a number of cases where, on second marriage, children from a first marriage have brought claims on account of the fact that the will did not sufficiently provide for them,\" he said. \nWhen considering such claims, the courts would look at the case objectively and assess whether the person claiming had a reasonable entitlement for provision under the will and then whether the will failed to make reasonable financial provision for that person. \nThe status of the potential claimant is particularly relevant. A surviving spouse is entitled to a higher standard of provision than other claimants, such as children, who are limited to reasonable provision “for their maintenance”. \n\"Your wife could challenge the provision for her under the will (the right to reside in the house) if she is not to receive any other benefit,\" Mr Barnett said. \"In recent cases, the court has looked at what the spouse would have been awarded on a divorce as a useful benchmark when considering 'reasonable provision'. If the interest in the house is the only benefit under your will it may well not be considered reasonable financial provision for her. \n\"Your son could claim on the basis that he will not receive any benefit until after your wife’s death. This will of course depend on his own financial circumstances. In the case of Mrs Ilott, she was receiving housing benefit and claimed she faced severe financial hardship if she did not receive anything from her late mother’s estate.\" Got a question for our experts?
