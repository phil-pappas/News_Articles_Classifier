I spent some time looking at quite a few bullish scans Thursday afternoon. The only things that consistently appeared were inverse equity exchange-traded funds . \nThat isn't very bullish, to say the least. Still, we appear to be approaching a short-term oversold level, but note this is still short-term. \nIn looking at the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) , this may be one where we can get a bullish play off a bearish chart; however, in order for that to happen, it looks like we need more bears to push this lower first. \nSo, this is still a bearish chart with a downside target, and that downside target could very well be a bounce play as well. A little two-for-one deal. \nMust Read: 5 Top Dividend Stocks Billionaire John Paulson Loves \nIBB broke down under support on the daily chart yesterday. It's got a head and shoulders created by Dr. Moreau look to it. \nI give it some credence, but a simple bear flag breakdown is more appropriate, in my view. That limits the downside target a bit. \nThe price pattern is bearish until we have a close over $370 to get us fully above resistance. Right now, $360, then $370, stand as resistance. The ETF currently trades around $346. \nI've put up numerous secondary indicators covering trend, momentum, volume, price and volatility all over, which point in favor of the bears. \nWe see several oversold readings in the Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Force Index and moving average convergence divergence (MACD). \nThe Slow Stochastics, Ultimate Oscillator and Relative Strength Index (RSI) have not quite reached oversold levels. \nThe current chart suggests those levels would be achieved if IBB would quickly fall to the $330-$335 area.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T01:30:58.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
