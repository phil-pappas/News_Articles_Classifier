They were C$46 million in the second quarter.\nThose numbers, which come a day after Bank of Montreal reported a big rise in bad loans in the energy sector, suggest that the Canadian banks are starting to feel the impact of a plunge in the oil price, which is near 6-1/2 year lows.\nNet income for the quarter ended July 31 was C$2.48 billion, or C$1.66 per share, compared with C$2.38 billion, or C$1.59 per share, in the third quarter of 2014.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of C$1.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nProfit in the personal and commercial banking segment climbed 13 percent, and wealth management earnings were flat. Net income for capital markets, which was affected by weaker fixed income and equity trading, fell about 15 percent.
