The emails ask the reader to click on an Internet link to take care of the problem, but the link infects their computer with a virus.\nCaitlin Driscoll of the Better Business Bureau says the emails use the E-ZPass logo and look legitimate.\nBut turnpike officials say they don't communicate with E-ZPass users by email.\nAlso, the money for the electronic E-ZPass toll-paying devices is automatically drawn from a customer's bank account, so there's generally no need to send someone a message about their account. But even if there is, that will be sent by regular mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T02:05:40.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
