The euro fetched $1.1157, having gained 1.8 percent so far this week.\nThe yuan's sharp falls this week raised speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve may delay its proposed rate hike, reducing the dollar's yield advantage over other currencies.\n\"In short, the dollar has become expensive. Falls in oil prices mean subdued inflation. All in all, there is no need to raise rates in a hurry,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, senior strategist at Monex Securities.\nThe dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 96.372 , off its one-month low of 95.926 hit on Tuesday.\nThe yuan and other Asian currencies account for 40 percent of the dollar's trade-weighted effective exchange rate, Yamamoto said.\nTraders are looking to where the People's Bank of China will set the yuan's midpoint on Friday as they try to figure out Beijing's policy intentions.\nIf it sets Friday's mid-point below Thursday's level, at 6.4010 to the dollar, it could fan speculation that China wants a deeper fall in the yuan to spur exports to support the economy, said some analysts.\n\"The latest concerns triggered by the sudden policy action may be subsiding a tad. But there is no change in the fact that the Chinese economy is slowing,\" said Monex's Yamamoto.\n\"I think the yuan has become overvalued as other countries tried to cheapen their currencies and it will keep falling, playing catch-up,\" he added.\n(Reporting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T04:05:22.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
