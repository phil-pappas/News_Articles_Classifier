MAL FAIRCLOUGH Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan A multi-agency operation, that was to involve visa checks in Melbourne's CBD by the newly created Australian Border Force, would not have been overreach, Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin says.\nA political brawl over the now-cancelled operation escalated on Monday with Labor's Immigration spokesman Richard Marles accusing the agency's minister Peter Dutton of throwing his public servants \"under a bus\" while Coalition ministers moved to further distance the government from the bungle.\n\"I think we have seen a lot of explanation over the weekend as to what the events were, no, I don't believe it was an overreach, I mean police and security agencies work very closely together all the time in this country,\" Commissioner Colvin said.\nHe said he was not involved in discussions and arrangements, but his take out was that security agencies needed to better explain their activities.\n\"It certainly invoked a large reaction from the community, it reinforces why it's very important security agencies in this country are working closely together and we are explaining what we are doing to the community,\" he said.\nLabor has jumped on the kerfuffle, calling on the Auditor General to investigate the Border Force's powers , and demanding Mr Dutton stand up and explain what was intended in the operation.\n\"What you have is the minister going into hiding and throwing those in uniform under a bus,\" Mr MArles said.\nMr Dutton office received the press release on Wednesday but say it was not opened or read because it appeared routine.\n Mr Marles said, however, that the department had a capacity to crack down on visa fraud and Labor would support that.\nThe transition process as Customs and Immigration merged in July has seen a number of executives move on, with some concerned by the \"militarisation\" of the portfolio and others taking redundancies.\nCommissioner Colvin said he was also in discussions with the government over whether the AFP's powers go far enough.\n\"We are in constant conversation with the government about whether the laws meet the environment that we see change and it's changing before our eyes talk about the last 12 months there has been significant changes.\n\"So we are constantly talking to the government about what powers, what laws might be appropriate,\" he said.\nCommissioner Colvin said he had met with Muslim community leaders and had sympathy for their claims Muslim people are being increasingly targeted.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/labor-calls-on-auditorgeneral-to-investigate-australian-border-force-20150830-gjb1gt.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/aug/30/border-force-announcement-went-to-peter-duttons-office-first-official-says", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/department-faces-biggest-aps-executive-exodus-in-three-decades-20150716-gidnhv.html"], "published": "2015-08-31T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:37:56.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
