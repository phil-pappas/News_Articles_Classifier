However, since the spectrum caps have neither been raised nor done away with, the norms would not enable two big operators with large spectrum holding, Bharti Airtel and MTNL, for instance, to share spectrum in a circle.\nMeanwhile, spectrum trading was not taken up by the Cabinet on Wednesday as the law ministry has some reservations on the proposed norms and is still to give its final view.\nWith regard to sharing, the approved norms, in a departure from the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), do not allow operators to share administratively allocated spectrum and that acquired through auctions. Administratively allocated spectrum can only be shared with administratively allocated airwaves and auction ones with auction spectrum. This would constrain sharing between operators in a host of B and C circles where they have a mix of spectrum. Operators can only share such spectrum if they pay the price differential between the two.\nThis has been done to ease auditing of the shared spectrum.\nTrai had said that operators should be allowed to share administratively allocated spectrum with that acquired in auctions but in such cases only services permitted under the administrative allocation should be allowed. However, the department of telecommunications felt that it would be difficult for it to ascertain what services operators are providing in such cases.\nAs per the norms approved, sharing can be done between two operators in a given circle. For example, say in Delhi, it can be done between either between Bharti and Vodafone or Bharti and Reliance Communications. It can’t be between all three. Further, spectrum sharing can be done in all the bands – 800, 900, 1800, 2100, 2300 and 2500 MHz. However, operators need to have spectrum in these bands in the given circle. For instance, Bharti has spectrum in 2100 MHz in Delhi but Idea doesn’t. So the two cannot share this band of spectrum here. However, RCom has, so Bharti can share with it.\nFor purpose of spectrum usage charge (SUC), it would be assumed that the entire spectrum is being shared and rate of each operator post sharing would increase by 0.5%. If operator A and B have 8 MHz and 5 MHz spectrum, respectively, in the 1800 MHz band and each of them share 4 MHz, for the purpose of SUC it would be considered that the two are sharing their entire spectrum. Result: If prior to sharing the SUC paid was 6% of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR), post sharing it would increase to 6.5% of the AGR.\nSpectrum caps of 25% of the total assigned in a circle and 50% in a band would prevail. However, for sharing only 50% of the spectrum held by the other operator in the band being shared would be counted as additional spectrum, so effectively the cap gets a little liberalised. For instance, if operator A has 10 MHz and B 6 MHz, for purposes of cap for A the spectrum holding would be counted as 13 MHz (its own 10 and half of the other) and for B similarly it would 11 MHz.\nStill, this norm would prevent operators like Bharti, Vodafone or MTNL to share spectrum with each other.\nTaking a call:\n* Spectrum trading was not taken up as the law ministry has some reservations and is still to give its final view\n* Sharing norms will not enable two big operators with large spectrum holding to share spectrum in a circle\n* Operators cannot share administratively allocated spectrum and that acquired through auctions\n 13, 2015 1:36 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:40:50.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
