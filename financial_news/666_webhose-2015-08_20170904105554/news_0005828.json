Regional Health is a joint venture between Louisville-based Norton Healthcare Inc. and LifePoint Health , out of Brentwood, Tenn. The venture also acquired Scott Memorial Hospital , a 25-bed critical-access hospital in Scottsburg, a few years ago. Clark Memorial Hospital has been searching for an acquisition partner for about two years in an effort to bring in more capital and resources . Last year, hospital officials had discussed such a partnership with Norton alone, but more recently they have been in talks with Regional Health. A few weeks ago, News and Tribune reported that the Clark County Commissioners approved the sale. Regional Health will purchase the hospital for $76 million plus net worth and capital, that report said. “This is an exciting day for Clark Memorial, our team members, physicians and patients,” Martin Padgett , president and CEO of Clark Memorial, said in the release. \"Our team spent the last several months analyzing this partnership to ensure it is the right fit for our hospital and the communities we serve. That process only strengthened our belief that Norton Healthcare and LifePoint Health are the ideal strategic partners for us.\" Under the terms of the agreement, Regional Health Network will invest a minimum of $80 million in capital and technology improvements at Clark during the next 10 years. Regional Health Network also has provided sufficient funding to retire the hospital’s debt, including its pension obligations, the release said. “This is an exciting milestone in our relationship with Clark Memorial, and we are delighted to welcome the hospital to Regional Health Network,” Russell Cox , president of Norton Healthcare, said in the release. “Norton has had the privilege of working alongside Clark Memorial for many years and witnessed firsthand the outstanding efforts of its leadership, team members, physicians and volunteers. I see even greater opportunity to grow the hospital working together with LifePoint in the months and years to come.” As part of the acquisition, Regional Health Network offered employment to all active Clark Memorial team members and assumed all physician contracts. It has adopted Clark Memorial's charity care policies and will create a board with members from each entity and the community to ensure a local voice in the strategic direction of the hospital. “Clark Memorial Hospital provides exceptional care and service to its community,” William F. Carpenter III, chairman and CEO of LifePoint Health , said in the release. “The hospital’s commitment to quality and being a place where people choose to come for care, physicians want to practice and employees want to work is part of what attracted us to it.” Clark Memorial had been owned by Clark County government and was a non-profit entity. As part of Regional Health Network, it now will become a tax-paying entity. The acquisition agreement was reviewed and approved by the Clark County Council and Commissioners during a public meeting on July 23. Mergers and acquisitions have been rippling through the health care industry for the last few years, as federal health care reform has put pressure on providers to bring down costs. I recently reported that Floyd Memorial Hospital has been exploring options as well. \nWant Louisville Health Care news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
