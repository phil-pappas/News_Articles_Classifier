Photo: Patrick Scala\nHe said small home appliances like toasters and irons had been rolled out to four standard JB Hi-Fi stores with \"pleasing results\" and they would be in another 14 stores by November.\n\"The rollout of small appliances into our existing store network is a natural progressions of our proven HOME appliances strategy,\" he said.\n\"In the long term, we expect most stores to stock home appliances with the range ... tailored to suit each specific store.\"\nJB Hi-Fi will have an edge over big box rivals Harvey Norman and the Good Guys by selling small appliances in shopping centres that they cannot access, while Dick Smith plans to introduce small appliances to 100 stores over the next five months.\nChief financial officer Nick Wells said about 90 square metres of floor space would be turned over to appliances in existing stores, compared to about 135 square metres in HOME stores, but Mr Murray insisted this would not come at the expense of struggling categories like software.\n\"We are not prepared to accept any increased decline in software as a result of rolling out home appliances,\" he said, adding that space would be used more efficiently.\nMr Murray said he was looking forward to this year's important Christmas trade and expected sales to be supported by new tech products.\n\"Fitness, the whole watch category and things around your personal ecosystem – be it Fitbit, be it Garmin – there are plenty of products where the growth we're still seeing is very strong and it'll be another strong Christmas,\" he said.\n\"We've got plenty of established brands with plenty of innovation. It's not uncommon to see new phones released prior to Christmas … I see some things that we're going to have that we didn't have last Christmas that are exciting.\"\nThe retailer plans to open five new HOME stores in Australia and one JB Hi-Fi store in New Zealand over the next year, bringing the total number of stores to 214, and also convert 16 existing stores to HOME outlets, bringing the total number to 75.\nThe most recent ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence survey, released weekly, showed a confidence rating of 112.9, exceeding the long-term August average of 109.9.\nJB Hi-Fi releases its results earlier than many other companies and is seen as a bellwether for retailers in the reporting season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:36:34.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
