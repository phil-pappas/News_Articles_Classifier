Most funds also have a line of credit that can be drawn down, as some managers did during the credit crisis, to meet investors' requests for repayment, sources said.\n\"As an active fund manager, we have several different tools to manage our funds and one is to use cash and securities for liquidity,\" said William Housey, senior portfolio manager at First Trust Advisors in Wheaton, Illinois.\nShorter bond settlement times of up to three days, \"helps to mitigate some of the liquidity headline risk that has been around loans for a long time,\" Housey added.\nNearly one out of three Americans, more than 90 million people, have invested in registered funds, and since late 2009 assets in loan mutual funds and ETFs have increased by almost 400%, SEC Commissioner Kara Stein said in a June 15 speech.\nThere were 245 loan mutual funds with US$141bn in assets as of December 2014, according to the Loan Syndications & Trading Association, and four loan ETFs with about US$7bn in assets.\nThis year, investors have withdrawn US$8.8bn from loan mutual funds and ETFs, following record outflows of US$23.9bn in 2014 according to Lipper data. This contrasts with a record US$62.9bn of inflows into the funds in 2013, the data shows.\nIncreased redemption requests from investors continue to cause concern about slow settlement times.\nSecondary trades of leveraged loans settled in an average 19.3 days last quarter, according to Markit; longer than the seven days recommended by the LSTA, and more than six times the three days that it takes bonds to settle.\n\"Funds investing in these loans could face liquidity challenges if a significant number of investors make redemption requests at the same time,\" the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said in its 2015 Regulatory and Examination Priorities Letter.\nIn times of volatility, managers may increase cash holdings to help fund redemption requests.\nCashing in\nFidelity held 6.08% cash and 4.62% in fixed-rate bonds in its Fidelity Floating Rate High Income Fund as of June 30, according to its website. Its cash holdings were the largest among five of the biggest loan mutual funds, according to Moody's.\n\"We keep an appropriate level of cash balancing the opportunity in the market with the liquidity needs of our shareholders,\" a Fidelity spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement.\nOppenheimerFunds seeks to keep the Oppenheimer Senior Floating Rate Fund fully invested at all times, according to Joseph Welsh, portfolio manager of the fund.\n\"Cash balances fluctuate based on a variety of factors such as timing of trades, settlements and flows,\" Welsh said in an e-mailed statement.\nThe First Trust Senior Loan Fund, a loan ETF, is allowed to move the entire fund to cash in certain circumstances.\n\"We've written language into our prospectus that allows us to go to 100 percent cash for defensive purposes,\" Housey said. \"We have written the documents to give us as much flexibility as possible to weather a potential liquidity storm because we have to be thoughtful about the risks.\"\nThe fund held 14.03% in bonds as of July 31, according to its website.\n\"For temporary defensive purposes and during periods of high cash inflows or outflows, the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or it may hold cash,\" the fund's prospectus said.\nIncreased attention on liquidity may become more important as the SEC has said that it is updating its rules related to registered funds on the 75th anniversary of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The regulator is also considering changing liquidity-management rules.
