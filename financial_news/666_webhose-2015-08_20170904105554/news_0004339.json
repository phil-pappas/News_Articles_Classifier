Terpolilli \nYour summer travel plans may be all set for that big adventure or just a short drive to the beach but take the time to do a security check before you leave. Home burglars are also looking for an advance while you are on vacation. Here are a few reminders. \nHome \nIt is helpful to ask a trusted neighbor to watch your home and pick up the newspaper so it does not appear that you are gone. Use automatic lights that turn on at night. Have your mail picked up or stopped during a long absence. Stop delivery of packages. Be sure the lawn is mowed and outside appearances are not neglected. \nSecurity alarm services are great for monitoring a home invasion or glass breakage but leave instructions for a close friend in case that event occurs. \nTurn off computer devices and disconnect devices from the internet while you are gone and lock away valuables. \nCheck the outside water lines and irrigation systems for any leaks and disconnect hoses. \nLuggage \nReview your packing list and reduce the number of items you carry in your wallet. Lock away those extra credit cards that you won't need during your trip. Take a photo of your luggage before you travel in case your bags are lost or delayed, it will help the airline company locate your missing bags. \nCheck luggage tags for your current contact information. And leave a copy of your travel itinerary with a trusted friend or family. If you are doing international travel, make a copy of your passport and documents to leave with a family member. \nMake a list of medications that you are carrying during travels and a copy of the prescription is good to bring along with you. \nSocial Media \nAvoid announcing your travel plans ahead of a trip and delay posting your vacation photos till you get home. The open viewing that occurs on social media sites is an invitation for those who are trying to catch vacant homes. You may not realize there are criminals monitoring your personal information for just an opportunity. Be sure to enforce this with all members of the family. \nHave safe travels. \nFor the latest business news and local events, click on the subscribe button above and you will receive an email alert when the next article is released.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:20:20.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
