Norway was the first non-EU country to contribute to Operation Atalanta with a warship in 2009. \nLast year Ukraine contributed a warship while New Zealand sent a maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to the force. \nA Spanish navy liaison team will be on board the Colombian navy patrol boat, which has a crew of 65 people, to help coordinate day to day operations. \nPirates operating from the Somali coast have raked in millions of dollars in ransoms from hijacking ships. \nAt the height of Somali piracy in January 2011, 736 hostages and 32 ships were being held by pirates, according to the EU's External Action Service. \nBut over the past three years security for vessels and their crews off the coast of Somalia has improved significantly, with no merchant ship being pirated since May 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T00:39:26.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
