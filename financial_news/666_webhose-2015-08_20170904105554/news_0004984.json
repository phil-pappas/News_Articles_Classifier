Extensive solar panel production and the availability of raw materials, such as polysilicon, at very low prices are expected to elevate the growth of the market. \n“The Chinese government is providing financial support to encourage the development of the solar manufacturing industry, thus many vendors have heavily invested in setting up manufacturing facilities in China, which has significantly boosted the production of solar panels in the country,” adds Ghaus. \nTechnavio currently has more than 3000 market research reports on a huge range of topics, including:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T23:41:33.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
