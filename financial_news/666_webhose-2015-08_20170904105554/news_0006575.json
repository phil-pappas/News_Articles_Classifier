Analysts had pencilled in a drop of 1.5 million. \nAnd stocks of gasoline or petrol recoiled by 2.7 million barrels, which was far heavier than an anticipated decline of 1.25 million. \nThe weekly DoE update is a crucial barometer of crude demand in the world's biggest economy -- which is also a large producer of shale oil. \nAnalysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia. \nAnalyst Razaqzada cautioned that the oil market remained plagued by slowing Chinese demand, alongside rebounding Iranian oil supplies in the wake of Tehran's nuclear energy deal with the West. \n\"The prospect of fresh supplies from Iran and potentially weaker demand growth from China and the likes means the global supply glut could be worse than was expected previously. \n\"As such, the outlook for oil prices remains bleak,\" Razaqzada warned. \nIran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions, which have restricted its oil exports. \nMeanwhile, demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world's top energy-consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T21:33:36.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
