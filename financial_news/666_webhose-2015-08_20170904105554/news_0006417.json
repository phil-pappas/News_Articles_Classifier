The Commission asks the EBA to consider simplified LR and NSFR reporting requirements and different NSFR calibrations for certain firms. Scope of application. The Commission asks the EBA to consider whether certain types of credit institution should be fully excluded from the LR and NSFR. Impact of the NSFR on certain markets and activities. The Commission asks the EBA to examine the impact of the NSFR on issues including bank lending, the volume and liquidity of financial markets and business models.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:16:10.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
