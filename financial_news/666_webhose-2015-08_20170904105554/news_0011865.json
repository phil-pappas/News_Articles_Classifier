Japan's Nikkei dropped nearly 4%. \nChina's central bank said the benchmark rate for a one-year loan would be cut by 0.25 percentage points to 4.6% and the one-year rate for deposits would fall by a similar margin to 1.75%. \nIt also increased the amount of money available for lending by reducing the minimum reserves banks are required to hold by 0.5%. \nAnalysts said that would result in 650 billion yuan (£64bn) being released into the Chinese economy. \nOn Monday in the US, the Dow plummeted by an unprecedented 1,000 points, before closing down 588 - its worst decline for four years. \n\"In much the same way as we had a broad mark down yesterday, we've had a broad pull up today,\" said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) . \n\"It's possible that the market is now considering that it might have overshot slightly yesterday.\" \nBut the FTSE 100 remains in \"correction\" territory, more than 10% off its all-time closing high of 7,104 back in April. \nHowever, almost all top-flight shares rose on Tuesday, with the index pulled higher by a recovery in commodities stocks which have been pounded by falls in metal prices caused by China's woes. \nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) has reduced its three-month outlook for the FTSE to 6,000 points from 6,900 points, although it believes the global economy is not at risk of recession. \nThe mass sell-off was triggered by China's slowing economy - as well as plunging commodity prices and fears over the timing of the next US interest rate hike. \nThe People's Bank of China is under pressure to announce a new round of quantitative easing to boost money supply in an economy suffering weaker demand across all sectors. \nBeijing has intervened numerous times to try to stop speculators selling vulnerable assets, including allowing the state pension fund to invest up to 30% of its assets in Chinese stocks. \nHowever, China's policymakers have largely sat on their hands during the last few days of bloodletting - to the frustration of investors hit by plunging portfolios. \nMany analysts predict a continued deceleration - rather than crash - for China's economy, and dismiss comparisons with the 2008 global depression or the Asia crisis 10 years before that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:29:53.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
