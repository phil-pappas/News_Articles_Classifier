The net balance widened the trade surplus to a record 24.0 billion euros ($26.2 billion). Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting exports to fall by 0.5 percent and imports to increase by 0.5 percent on the month.\nGerman 10-year yields, the benchmark for euro zone borrowing costs, were 1 basis point lower at 0.71 percent, staying well within this week's 0.64-0.76 percent trading range. Other euro zone bond yields were 0.5-1 basis point down.\n\"The industrial production numbers pushed yields a little lower but I think it's some kind of a correction of the strong move we saw on Wednesday,\" said DZ strategist Christian Lenk.\n\"The non-farm payrolls are what everybody is looking at today ... Yields are still a little bit higher than a few days ago so the market is preparing quite strongly for the Fed to become active soon.\"\nEconomists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. labour market report due at 1230 GMT to show employers added 223,000 jobs last month, the same as in June.\n\"A reading above 225,000 would point to 'further improvement in the labor market' - a condition indicated by the Fed to consider it appropriate to raise the fed funds rate - and should be supportive of expectations of a September 'lift-off',\" UniCredit strategist Luca Cazzulani said in a note.
