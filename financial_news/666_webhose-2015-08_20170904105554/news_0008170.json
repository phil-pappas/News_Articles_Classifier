But not all the target company's shareholders are rejoicing Photographer:Kevin Lee/Bloomberg News Photo: Bloomberg\nMost fund managers would be pumped to hear a company they bought into only few weeks ago would be taken out by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway at a healthy premium.\nBut for Sydney based global equity investor Wayne Peters the news that Berkshire Hathaway would acquire aerospace parts maker Precision Castparts for $US37 billion ($50 billion), or $US235 a share, was a 'bittersweet' moment tinged with disappointment.\n\"It's a sweet deal for Berkshire. At $US235 [a share] he's stealing it,\" the principal of Peters Macgregor, the global equities fund founded in 1999, says.\n\"So as shareholders of Precision we are disappointed but we also have shares in Berkshire so it's somewhat of a consolation.\"\nAdvertisement The fund bought into Precision about a month ago, taking advantage of a sharp fall in the share price amid concerns of the falling impact of energy prices on its oil and gas businesses. Peters says Precision, which supplies parts to jet engine manufacturers, is a 'fabulous business' with returns on equity of around 15 to 17 per cent, net income margins of around 15 to 18 per cent and gross margins of over 30 per cent.\n\"It's a sticky type of business. If you are supplying mission critical components to jet engines customers aren't going to change for a lower price and run the risk that the products don't perform.\"\nPeters says he first became aware of the company after Berkshire analyst Todd Combs bought into the company in 2012. The one month gain for Peters MacGregor was about 15 to 20 per cent.\n\"We don't buy a position unless we are prepared to own it for ten years and our average holding period is seven years. So if we had held this for that period of time we would have made a lot more. In a market where it's challenging to find this quality at this value, it's disappointing.\"\nBut Peters, a long time follower of Buffett and regular pilgrim to Omaha, says the deal points to a positive future without Buffett, even if also underlines Buffett's deal-making prowess .\n\"We want Buffet to be operating in this way for our Berkshire investment but it's bitter sweet. What is interesting is that the deal has primarily been driven by Todd Combs and since he's one of the two securities analysts identified to succeed Buffett on that side of the business, its great news for Berkshire.\"\nPeters MacGregor head of research Nathan Bell says the deal was further evidence that Buffett \"hasn't loss his marbles\" as some had suggested.\n\"The bloke is as good as he as ever was - and even better than that he's surrounding himself with smart people,\" Bell says. \"Berkshire is taking on more options to have the ability to go on like it has in the past without Buffett. But he does attract deals but its good for shareholders to see him groom other leaders.\"\nThe deal came about after Precision chief Mark Donegan dropped in to visit Berkshire's Coombs in Omaha. Buffett came in late to the meeting and took an instant like to the Precision chief. A month later a $US33 billion deal was in the works.\nWhile some shareholders like Peters and Gerbera Capital are lamenting the great price – Buffett is proving adept at using is brand to extract sweet deals. Some analysts covering Australian insurer IAG believed the Buffett effect meant they gave away value to the Oracle of Omaha in a recent deal. But companies that take Berkshire money know they'll be left in charge and have access to capital to growth their business.\n \"If he didn't have the credibility and recognition in the market place, thew board would not have been willing to let it go for that price,\" says Peters.\n\"And it comes with the knowledge that they will no longer be capital constrained and they will be able to grow the business that could not have previously.\"\nThis deal is one of Buffett's largest and equates to about 10 per cent of the value of Berkshire. But he still has plenty of dry powder. With $US70 billion of cash, Buffett aims to keep $US20 billion in the bank at all times so the cash component of the Precision deal used up half his 'available cash'.\nHowever every quarter about $US10 billion flows into his coffers and there's no sign of the 84-year-old Buffett slowing down.\nPeters says Peters MacGregor is tracking well with a trailing 12 month return to the end of July of around 35 per cent and a 6.5 per cent return in July, while holding 30 per cent in cash.\nThe fund has made one other investment since buying into Precision – an investment in its customer, auto and engine maker Rolls Royce. Peters MacGregor joins celebrated activist fund ValueAct and Bondi Junction corporate neighbour Bronte Capital on the share register.\n\"About two thirds of its business is aerospace and its business has been hit by hard by its non aerospace businesses, but the forward order books in the airline space look phenomenal.\"\nWith an activist investor on board, the company could get an additional boost.\n\"Rolls is underperforming relative to its main competitor GE and it's really a duopoly industry in supplying engines for wide body planes.\"", "external_links": ["http://brontecapital.blogspot.com.au/2015/03/rolls-royce-and-sequoia-letter.html", "http://www.afr.com/business/insurance/warren-buffetts-halo-shines-on-iag--but-whats-in-it-for-berkshire-hathaway-20150615-ghovuc", "https://sumzero.com/headlines/industrials/PCP/281-buffett-nabs-another-fifty-cent-dollar-with-precision-castparts", "http://www.afr.com/news/world/north-america/warren-buffett-bets-on-big-buys-to-boost-berkshire-hathaway-20150810-giw3m0"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:39:27.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
