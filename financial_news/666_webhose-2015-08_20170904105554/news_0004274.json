That would mean a total of 300 planes within five years, he added.\nIran will finance the purchases through mechanisms including leasing, foreign loans and state funds, Khodakarami said.\nIranian and Western industry officials had earlier estimated that Iran, a country of 80 million people, would need a total of 400 aircraft in the next decade, assuming implementation of the nuclear deal proceeds smoothly and the sanctions are lifted.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 3:25 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:32:04.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
