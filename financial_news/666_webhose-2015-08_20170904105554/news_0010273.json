A build-up of inventories may weigh on growth this quarter, but the blow should be softened by rebounding business investment.\nBritain’s economy also enjoyed relatively healthy growth in the second quarter, but a strong pound may be damaging exports. A survey due on Thursday is likely to show the country’s dominant service industries barely accelerated this month.\nSTEADY HAND\nChina’s central bank cut interest rates and lowered the amount of reserves banks must hold for the second time in two months on Tuesday. Expectations are high for more easing before the end of the year.\nThe European Central Bank is expected to keep a steady hand when it meets on Thursday, days after data are likely to show there is still very little inflation in the currency bloc.\nAlmost half a year since the ECB started pumping €60bn a month of fresh cash into the economy, annual inflation data, due on Monday, will probably still show prices rose only 0.1% in August — nowhere near the bank’s 2% target ceiling.\nThere is a growing chance the ECB will extend its stimulus programme beyond the planned completion in September 2016, and if inflation data misses expectations that likelihood will only increase.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday. No change in policy is expected, despite the resource-rich country’s reliance on Chinese demand. Sweden’s Riksbank is also unlikely to move on Thursday.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T20:18:13.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
