( VLO), HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC) and Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) hit their respective 52-week highs on Thursday, Aug 13. For more than a year, these independent refiners and marketers of petroleum products have seen their stock price rally precipitously, as access to cheaper crude has given a boost to the entire industry. \nAs a company’s share bumps up to its highest point in a year, some investors may steer clear, thinking there is not much upside – which is true in certain cases. However, a high flying share price does not necessarily mean it's not a bargain right now. \nWhy are They Still a Buy \nIn the case of Tesoro, Valero, HollyFrontier and Alon USA there are a number of good reasons to buy the stocks even considering that they have already had an amazing run. Our favorable Zacks Rank seem to suggest the same. \nFirstly, with refiners being buyers of oil – that has been going through a prolonged period of low prices – its profitability has benefited due to depressed input cost. To add to this, robust demand for gasoline (the most widely used petroleum product) has lifted crack spreads and is set to provide further upside to the companies’ bottom line. \nSecondly, all of them have reported impressive quarterly results of late – comfortably beating estimates apart from improving year-over-year. From revenue to operating income, all key metrics are moving in the right direction for the companies. What’s more, analysts believe that the downstream operators will beat earnings in the upcoming quarters too. This should keep investors excited. \nMoreover, in order to take advantage of the strong gasoline demand and higher margins, the companies are operating their units at record high capacity, sometimes at more than 100%. Therefore, the future looks bright indeed, regardless of Tesoro, Valero, HolloFrontier and Alon USA’s ‘high’ share price. \nLastly, management is paying greater attention to business processes by reducing operating costs, enhancing the integration of the refining portfolio and investing in organic growth. All four firms are involved with a number of high-return projects that are expected to be cost effective. These projects will not only boost the companies’ competitive position, but will also provide significant earnings and cash flow growth visibility. \nBrief Description of the Stocks \nBased in Dallas, TX, Alon USA Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products, with primary operations in the South Central, Southwestern and Western regions of the U.S. The company – sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) – owns a 74,000 barrels per day (Bbl/d) crude oil refinery in Krotz Springs, Louisiana and a 70,000 Bbl/d unit in California. \nSan Antonio, TX-based Tesoro Corp. is one the biggest independent oil refiners in the U.S. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company owns and operates six refineries in the western U.S., with a combined crude oil processing capacity of approximately 850,000 Bbl/d. \nValero Energy Corp. – also from San Antonio, TX – is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the U.S. It has a refining capacity of 2.9 million Bbl/d across 15 refineries located throughout the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean.
