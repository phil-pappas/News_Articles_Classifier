The recent unrest has significantly weakened government institutions leaving CAR's roughly 4.5 million citizens with limited or no access to basic services, a loss of outside investment and dramatic violence. \nA unique delivery framework has been developed for the project under which AGETIP-CAF (Agence d'Exécution des Travaux d'Intérêt Public en Centrafrique), a national and public agency, will execute the road works rather than procuring them to third parties. With AGETIP-CAF's leadership, 71 local reconstruction teams of 500 workers will be set up to upgrade and maintain about 10,000 kilometers of national and rural roads which are in poor repair. The successful operation of AGETIP-CAF's regional offices may help to attract additional financing in the rural provinces. \nLONDO will help establish a community maintenance system (cantonnage communal) to support the sustainability of both jobs and improved roads. Local authorities will receive tools, equipment and technical assistance. Workers will receive bicycles for transportation to and from work sites and may also benefit, during working hours, from short trainings and consultation on topics such as HIV/AIDS, when locally available, to help improve socio-economic integration. \n\"By focusing on tangible outputs such as stipend payments and improved rural roads with LONDO's Labor Intensive Public Works approach, the project will go beyond infrastructure-building and will promote collective decision-making, collaborative behaviors, and community ownership,\" says Paul Bance World Bank Task Team Leader for this Project. \"LONDO will also lay the ground for more development projects to follow in areas of CAR that have been underserved in the past.\" \nLONDO benefits from strong collaboration between the Bank and several other international partners, including the UN peacekeeping mission (MINUSCA) and the Agence française de dévelopment.
