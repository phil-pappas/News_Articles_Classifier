However, soft Chinese economic data, sliding commodity prices and unconvincing U.S. inflation data have dulled expectations of a near-term U.S. rate hike. \nHigher rates would raise borrowing costs for consumers and companies, possibly hurting spending and economic growth. \nOne indicator of Fed policy expectations, interest rates on overnight indexed swaps, suggested traders now see a 27 percent chance of a rate hike next month, down from 32 percent on Thursday and off from 48 percent a week earlier, according to data from inter-dealer money broker Tullett Prebon (LSE: TLPR.L - news ) . \nThe euro, which is used as a 'funding' currency borrowed to buy riskier but higher-yielding emerging market currencies, easily topped $1.13 as investors reversed such trades and bought it back. \nThe euro was last trading against the dollar at $1.1358, up 1.05 percent. Earlier the euro hit a session high of $1.1375, last touched on June 22. \nData showing euro zone business growth unexpectedly accelerating this month gave the euro a brief boost, but most investors reckon China volatility and other external factors are more important drivers at the moment. \nThe dollar index of major currencies traded against the greenback was down for a third day and was last off 1 percent to levels last seen on June 30. \nAgainst the yen, which is also used as a funding currency and is a more traditional safe haven, the dollar fell to its weakest in six weeks, down 1.10 percent on the day at 122.28 yen . \n\"Receding expectations for the Fed to raise rates at its coming meeting on Sept. 16-17 wield the potential to weaken the dollar further over the short run,\" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. \"However, a door seen as still ajar to a move next month should help limit losses in the dollar.\" (Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York, Jemima Kelly in London and Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:32:21.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
