(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) \nMOSCOW (AP) -- Russia marked the one-year anniversary of its ban on Western agricultural products Thursday with an effort to destroy contraband food, a move that has raised controversy amid the nation's economic downturn. \nPresident Vladimir Putin's order to destroy the illegal imports underlines the Kremlin's determination to enforce the ban amid continuing tensions with the West over the Ukrainian crisis. \nMore than 250,000 people signed an online petition urging the Kremlin to give the contraband food to the poor instead of destroying it. Coupled with the ruble's sharp depreciation, the ban on Western food has helped drive consumer prices up, pushing an increasing number of Russians below the poverty line. \nThe Kremlin, hoping to stem the flow of banned products by raising the costs for those involved in contraband, has ignored the public outcry. \nThe national agricultural oversight agency, Rosselkhznadzor, said several shipments of banned imported products will be destroyed Thursday in the Orenburg region in the Ural Mountains and Belgorod and Smolensk near Russia's Western border. \nRussia slapped a ban on many Western agricultural products, including meat, milk products, vegetables and fruit on Aug. 6, 2014 in retaliation to the U.S. and EU sanctions over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine. Last month, the Kremlin extended the ban for a year following the EU's decision to prolong its sanctions through January. \nRussian importers found various loopholes to bypass the ban. Neighboring Belarus has become a major conduit for the banned items, making food out of European meat and other products, or simply repackaging banned European food to change the country of origin. \nWhisking products into Russia on fake documents has also reportedly taken place. Some smugglers provide documents purporting that a shipment of European food from Belarus is bound for Kazakhstan, another member of a free trade pact with Russia, while in truth it's intended for Russia. \nDefending the ban, Putin said it helped create incentives for local agricultural producers. Many farmers have lauded the move, hoping to fill the niche previously held by imports. \n\"Major distributors, who in the past bought from Holland and Italy now feel this will last,\" said John Kopiski, a British-born farmer who produces cheese and meat in Krutovo, about 220 kilometers (some 140 miles) east of Moscow. \"Generally, my opinion and our family's opinion about the sanctions is that we are grateful for them, because maybe they will shake up businessmen and shake us to the roots and we will start doing it ourselves.\" \nExperts warn, however, that while some local farmers thrived, it would take years for Russia to reach self-sufficiency on food and prices will rise, hurting the population. \nThe ban also pinched Russian restaurant owners, who have struggled to find a local replacement for imported products. \"We use basic food items, which are produced in Moscow region, and switch on our imagination and work with various additives,\" said Elena Rakova, managing director of Jean-Jacques Cafe in Moscow. \n___ \nVictoria Buravchenko contributed to this report.
