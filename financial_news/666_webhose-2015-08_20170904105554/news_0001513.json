That’s even after the slump in crude pulled the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite energy index down by almost a third in the past year.\n“In this lower-price environment, if we remain here for a period of time, I think expectations will come down and there might be more transactions completed as we move forward,” Fagerheim, 56, said in a phone interview from Calgary Aug. 7.\nThe average premium paid for Canadian oil and gas explorers acquired this year is 36 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Whitecap has done about nine deals valued at $2.3 billion in the past three years, the most of any Canadian company though less in value than Crescent Point Energy Corp. which executed eight deals worth $3.5 billion.\n“Generally, long term you’re looking somewhere between 12 to 20 percent as a premium,” Fagerheim said.\nWhitecap has the highest analysts’ rating of its Canadian energy peers with 17 buys and no holds or sells. The stock has gained 7 percent this year for a market value of C$3.6 billion ($2.8 billion), making it the fourth best performer on the S&P/TSX energy index, which has lost 13 percent.\nDividend Covered The Calgary-based company’s most recent acquisition was Beaumont Energy Inc. for C$563 million completed on May 1, according to the data. Fagerheim said the company looks for deals that complement its existing light-oil operations, with assets that can be grown by investing only 60 percent of the property’s cash flow on an annual basis.\nWhitecap considered purchasing parts of Teine Energy Ltd.’s portfolio in southwestern Saskatchewan earlier this year but balked at an outright takeover, Fagerheim said.\n“They didn’t fit from our technical perspective, they didn’t fit the asset profile that we like,” he said. Ken Hillier, Teine’s chief financial officer, said in an e-mail the company doesn’t comment on speculation.\nWhitecap’s capital budget and dividend payout is generally equal to or less than the cash flow it brings in, Cody Kwong, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. said by phone from Calgary. The company pays out only 39 cents in dividends for every dollar of cash flow, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nU.S. Investors Whitecap’s operations in Alberta and Saskatchewan also have a low corporate decline rate, which means it doesn’t need to replace as many barrels per year as some of its peers, allowing them to maintain production on a lower capital budget, Kwong said.\n“I think Whitecap is one of the very few that can take advantage of a down-market,” the analyst said.\nThe company’s dividend may be one reason it’s attracting U.S. investors. It’s only one of five producers paying a dividend among the 11 Canadian exploration and production companies worth between $1 billion and $4 billion.\nWhitecap, which began paying out in January 2013, gives investors 6.25 cents for each share held, for a 12-month yield of 6.1 percent.\nU.S. shareholders increased their stake in Whitecap to about 37 percent from about 5 percent in early 2013. Fidelity Investments is the largest shareholder with a 7.9 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund doesn’t comment on prospects for individual companies, Chris Pepper, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments Canada, said in an e-mail.\nOil Hedges Fagerheim owned 0.9 percent of the company as of July 20, the data show. Whitecap’s dividend is sustainable through 2015 and 2016, even if the price of oil stays low, thanks in part to hedging on West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark crude price, the CEO said.\nWhitecap has 51 percent of its oil production hedged at C$99.15 per barrel for 2015 and 27 percent hedged at C$99.18 for 2016, Fagerheim said.\nThe company will get a “two-fold uplift” when crude recovers as he expects through 2016, Fagerheim said.\nWhitecap’s hedging strategy gives investors confidence in the company’s ability to weather a sustained oil-price drop, according to investors such as Rafi Tahmazian at Canoe Financial LP in Calgary.\nOctober Key “These guys have come out of the other end of the storm,” Tahmazian said by phone. “They’ve done it through the hedge. They put some hedges on at the right time.”\nThere is an inherent risk in investing in companies that focus on expanding their operations through acquisition as opposed to organic growth though, Tahmazian said.\nThe fates of Canada’s more troubled energy producers may be settled in October, when companies traditionally meet with their bankers, he said. This could provide a window for companies such as Whitecap to pick up assets if bankers start pressuring companies to raise cash through deals.\n“There are a lot of guys who have a lot of assets they covet and they might not be able to hang on to them,” Tahmazian said.\n\",\"byline\":\"Allison McNeely", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:52:46.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
