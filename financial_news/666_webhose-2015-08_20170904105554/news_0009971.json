The median estimate in a Reuters poll taken before the output data puts annualised growth at 2.2 percent. \nSome members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party have already started talking about compiling new economic stimulus measures. \nThis is also a tense time for the Bank of Japan because it is counting on an acceleration in economic growth to drive consumer prices to its 2 percent inflation target. \nSOFT OVERSEAS DEMAND \nOutput fell in July as companies produced less smartphone parts, computers and cars, the data showed. \nManufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expect output to have risen 2.8 percent in August and decrease 1.7 percent in September. \nMakers of manufacturing equipment expect their output to tumble 9.1 percent in September, a worrying sign that overseas demand for capital goods is weak, Shiraishi said. \nIf output performs as forecast in August and September that would imply the economy grew 0.4 percent in the third quarter, but growth could be weaker as manufactures tend to be too optimistic, Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant wrote in a note. \nOne risk to the outlook for industrial output is domestic consumer spending. Weak household consumption contributed to a 1.6 percent annualised contraction in gross domestic product in April-June. \nPolicymakers have repeatedly said this was a one-off factor due to bad weather. However, the recent data have yet to show a clear recovery. \nExport demand is another worry, especially after the scale of China's economic problems sparked a global selloff in share markets. \n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T06:19:12.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
