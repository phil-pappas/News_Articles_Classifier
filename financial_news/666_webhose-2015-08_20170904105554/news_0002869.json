Philip Gostelow Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The Maritime Union of Australia has been ordered to pay $215,000 in penalties and compensation to workers after distributing posters that vilified employees as \"scabs\" because they refused to take part in strike action at the Fremantle Port Authority.\nFederal Court judge Antony Siopis found the union's Western Australian secretary, Christy Cain, and his then deputy, Will Tracey, sought to \"exact vengeance\" on the workers, including one employee who was named on the poster despite not working during the strike.\nMr Tracey in 2011 distributed the posters – entitled \"Scabs in Fremantle\" – which named the \"treacherous\" workers and accused them of being \"lowlifes [who] have turned on their colleagues to do the bosses' bidding\".\n\"After God made the rattlesnake, the toad and the vampire, he had some awful substance left over, with which he made a SCAB,\" the poster said. \"A SCAB is a two-legged animal with a corkscrew soul, water-logged brain and a combination backbone made of jelly and glue.\"\nIt said \"no one has a right to SCAB, as long as there is a pool of water deep enough to drown their body, or a rope long enough to hang their carcass with\".\n\"Judas Iscariot is a gentleman compared with the SCAB, for after betraying his mates, he had enough character to hang himself and a SCAB has not,\" it said.\n'Vindictive action' Justice Siopis found Mr Cain and Mr Tracey engaged in vindictive action to cause emotional harm, distress and fear to a small group of employees who had acted lawfully.\n He found the conduct of the MUA and Mr Tracey breached the Fair Work Act, imposing penalties of $80,000 on the union and $15,000 on Mr Tracey.\nIn seeking compensation for the five workers, the Fair Work Ombudsman told the court they had suffered loss due to marginalisation, apprehension and fear of violence.\nJustice Siopis said the five employees \"experienced a continuing fear of physical harm to themselves and their family, and the fear of damage to property\".\nHe awarded compensation of $20,000 each to four of the workers and $40,000 to the fifth worker who was named a scab because, while he did not work during the strike, he briefly fraternised with employees who did.\n'Unable to sleep' Justice Siopis said the worker was unable to sleep for a number of nights, felt outraged because he had not worked during the strike and was insulted when he sought an apology from Mr Tracey.\nThe judge said Mr Tracey told the worker he would not be able to work again in the maritime industry in Western Australia and that the worker \"feared\" that he and his family would suffer harm at the hands of disgruntled workers.\nFair Work Ombudsman Natalie James said on Tuesday that the court's decision \"sends a clear message that deliberately taking adverse action against employees is very serious conduct that will not be tolerated\".\n\"The conduct in this matter showed a complete disregard for the workplace rights and the personal wellbeing of individual employees,\" Ms James said.\n\"The conduct had a significant personal impact on the affected workers and the court has clearly taken a dim view of the behaviour.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-11T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:05:05.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
