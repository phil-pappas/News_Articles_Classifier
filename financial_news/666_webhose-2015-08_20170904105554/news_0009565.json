The group's annual general meeting tends to be held in October, and its dividends paid to shareholders in the same month.\nSuncorp will also get investors' full attention rather than be distracted by more big companies reporting towards the end [of August].\nSteve Johnston, Suncorp The company, which is reporting its full-year profits on Tuesday, will hold its AGM in September this year.\nSteve Johnston, chief financial officer at the $18.4 billion company, said the group had altered the template of its financial reporting internally but nothing had change in terms of the volume of information and accuracy of data given to shareholders.\nAdvertisement \"We bring the way we look at financial reporting back a month and a half,\" he said on Monday. \"Second thing is what we've become, is a lot more efficient and simple – the company [as a whole] has become more simple.\"\nSuncorp, under the leadership of retiring chief executive Patrick Snowball, has enacted a series of multimillion-dollar savings measures such as the Building Blocks program during his six year tenure as CEO.\nHis strategy included streamlining the group's policy systems, simplifying legal entity structures and consolidating technology platforms.\nThe company had also sold off most of its bad corporate and property loans inherited from the global financial crisis to Goldman Sachs in a $1.6 billion deal in 2013 – further simplifying the business.\n\"There's a big piece of transformation – a company-wide transformation that's enabled it,\" Mr Johnston said about fast-forwarding the group's results.\nOne analyst who declined to be named said that Suncorp's decision to streamline the way it conducted its financial reporting would be a boon for shareholders looking for income sooner.\n\"Suncorp will also get investors' full attention rather than be distracted by more big companies reporting towards the end [of August],\" he said.\nFigures from broker Credit Suisse showed that Suncorp is expected to book cash earnings of $1.016 billion for the year to June. IBES consensus expects the insurer to report $1.178 billion in earnings.\nThe company, which owns brands such as AAMI and GIO, is expected to dish out a 20¢ per share special dividend and a final dividend of 43¢ per share, which includes the special payment, according to Credit Suisse.\nThe broker said Suncorp's second-half results will be impacted by natural peril claims of over $200 million above the first half's experience, and the group may potentially have to top up their reserves in New Zealand.\nTuesday's earnings announcement will mark the last time Mr Snowball will deliver his last profits results. Mr Snowball is retiring from the Queensland insurer in September, and will be succeeded by Michael Cameron, former CEO of GPT Group.\nSuncorp's shares have risen 12.5 per cent to $14.33 the past 12 months, compared with the 2.2 per cent rise of the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:32:08.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
