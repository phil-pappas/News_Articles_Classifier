Quentin Jones/Fairfax Media Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith Rob Osborn is a process driven investor. Process is how he and Lazard Asset Management's co-head of Australian equities, Phil Hofflin, have gone about managing Lazard's well-regarded and consistently performing value-oriented strategy for the past 15 years. Their process starts with understanding how much a company should be worth away from the cycles that push stocks into undervalued and overvalued territory.\nThey buy stocks they deem cheap and sit and wait until the rest of the market comes around to their point of view. The process, however, doesn't capture everything. Osborn has, in fact, found himself on the sidelines of the two biggest themes that have rewarded investors for the best part of the past decade: Osborn managed to avoid resources stocks between 2009 and 2011; he's also been materially underweight banks for the past two years.\nNow the mining super cycle appears to be over, Osborn is finding value in resources companies and has recently been buying the big name miners. Despite missing out on the easy wins, Lazard's Australian equities funds have managed to rank among the best performing managers in the market, with the manager's concentrated strategy claiming third spot over three and five years according to Mercer's most recent ranking to the end of June.\nYou're quite underweight financials, has it been difficult not owning banks given how well they've performed over the past couple of years?\nWe have been underweight banks for a long, long time â€“ more than five years. NAB has been our only overweight because it's been the value investors' bank, but the banks have been our biggest underweights over the past few years. With financials, we're seeing that sector isn't expensive but it's not cheap. If you want to make good money from the sharemarket then you're not going to do it owning that segment. It's well priced and well held.\nYou didn't hold many resources from 2009 onwards also, how have you managed to make such good returns by avoiding the two biggest investment themes in recent memory?\nIt just goes to show if you stick to what you know, and stick to value, you don't have to have the hottest thing on the block to make money. Banks have been great performers since the mid-1990s, and even stronger over the past three to five years. But if you do your work and buy the cheap stocks you like, you don't have to be hooked to the index and you can still make money.\nWhere are you seeing value now?\n Big miners, the Tier 1 guys. Mainly BHP and Rio Tinto. Not much else in resources. The story there is cost out with the Australian dollar. They're selling in US dollar commodities and operating in Australian dollars. We see that as a massive opportunity, we've being buying [BHP and Rio stock] in the past 12 months. Our long-term iron ore price is down [to] around $38, so we believe the price is still going down further, but we are still finding value. The reason is cash flow. Even where the iron ore price is at the moment, they are still earning margins in excess of 50 per cent on those businesses. They're still printing money.\nDo you see value in any of the second tier iron ore producers?\nNo. It's very difficult to see value there.\nHow overweight are you in Rio and BHP?\nIn our concentrated fund we can have 8 per cent of the fund in a stock and we're at the max.\nAnd if those stocks get sold down will you keep buying?\nYes.\nSo what's the time frame for Rio and BHP to arrive at a valuation you think is reasonable?\nWe're always buying in three-year time horizons, so we won't be too concerned about what happens over the next two years. But especially when it comes to Rio, because Rio's capex program is tailing off so quickly, and the costs are coming out so quickly, we expect to see quite a lot of cash flow come out of these things. You can actually paint a scenario where they get re-rated quite quickly. If things get tougher here, you might think that's bad, but not for Rio. They're not selling to Aussies, they're selling overseas so the domestic economy isn't important.\nThe other big overweight I notice in your portfolio is the consumer discretionary sector. If the domestic economy starts to slow, won't that begin to hurt you?\nThat's all the individual positions, and when you start adding it up, it comes to a big number. We've invested in turnaround situations including Metcash. Pacific Brands is another one. Also Flight Centre. They all add up, but they're not related [to a particular theme].\nWhat does that overweight consumer position reveal about the Australian sharemarket?\nThe market seems to want to hurt stocks that aren't paying out money. Dividends seem to be king. So there are a lot of companies that have a lot of debt and what they are essentially doing is gearing up to pay out dividends. That's an issue. What we like is companies, such as Pacific Brands, that have no debt. It's not going to go broke because it can't, it's got no debt. It's got a business that's in turnaround. You can see Metcash doing it; they're having a hard time so they're selling businesses and cutting the dividend, so they're going into a low debt situation.\nBut aren't businesses such as Metcash structurally challenged? Sure it's good value, but can it come back?\nI think the challenge for Metcash is to be competitive and to maintain market share, and as long as they do that, then it'll be worth more than where it's trading at today, and that's the way we look at it.\nWhat's the time frame for recovery?\nWe think over the next two years, earnings will be soft, and if they can get control, earnings will return and there will be a re-rating because the rating the market has on them is saying it's going out the back door.\nWhat other lenses do you use when thinking about your portfolio as a whole?\nWe put it down to buying things where we understand the value and having a diverse portfolio. The hard part for Australians is [that] we are in a situation where the market is not diverse. So if you're buying the index, you're actually getting a very concentrated portfolio because you're buying a lot of financials. When you've got a diverse portfolio away from the index you can have a couple of stocks where you don't make money for a while but at the end of the day you can still make your money as a whole.\nWhat's your base case for the Australian economy?\nWe anticipate there will be low growth in the Australian economy. I think that's just a product of the effect the slowdown in resource spending is going to do to the economy. You've seen house prices go up dramatically, I think as that starts to come off, that's likely to cause some issues too. For the consumer-led businesses, we're forecasting that slightly lower GDP growth [than now] because mums and dads have a lot of debt.\nAnd how does that inform your strategy?\nWell it just tells you we're not expecting much top-line growth, we just think they are businesses that are fundamentally cheap. Cabcharge is another position we have in a challenged company, but Cabcharge has no debt, none whatsoever. Nor does Pacific Brands. So these are businesses you can afford to be in and wait, and when GDP eventually catches up they will re-rate.\nAny other examples of companies in your portfolio that are cheap you are happy to sit and wait in?\nAnother good example is Origin Energy. We've always had a target price on oil at $US60 [a barrel], the big problem for Origin now is they are perceived to have too much debt, but the reason they have a lot of debt is because they've been doing the LNG project in Queensland and they've been spending billions of dollars getting that going, but once that finishes and they start making money, the debt's just going to disappear. If they sold that asset tomorrow there would be no debt, but the market is putting a discount on it. The fact is, you are buying a quality business that seemingly looks geared but really isn't.\nDo you own any other resource or energy stocks? Any mining services or contractors?\nWe own Alumina, we also own Woodside. Not much else. The hard part with the mining contractors is if you go back 10 or 15 years, none of these guys were listed. The thing about our process is we won't buy companies that we don't know or understand how they perform through a cycle. It's one of the reasons we don't buy floats.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Matt_JS"], "published": "2015-08-17T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:56:54.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
