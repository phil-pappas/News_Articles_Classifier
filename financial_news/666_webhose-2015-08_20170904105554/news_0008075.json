First, the IRS published a new “Frequently Asked Question” \n\nYes. The Form W-8 will be considered to have been scanned and received electronically by the withholding agent, provided that the withholding agent does not know that the email containing the link to the third-party repository has been transmitted by someone other than the payee or an agent of the payee. Also, because the withholding agent has obtained the form at the payee’s direction, the form will be treated as having been furnished by/provided by the payee (see sections 1.1441-1(e)(1)(ii)(A)(1) and 1.1471-3(c)(1)). \nSecond, the IRS has issued revised publications addressing the information reporting requirements imposed by FATCA and the manner in which foreign financial institutions are required to submit such data to the IRS. Specifically, the IDES User Guide has been updated and includes a revised metadata section and additional instructions on IDES alert codes. In addition, the FATCA Metadata XML Schema v1.1 User Guide (Publication 5188)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:25:23.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
