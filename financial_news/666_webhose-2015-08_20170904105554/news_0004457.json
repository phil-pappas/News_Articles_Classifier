Photo: Jessica Shapiro\nRunning a business using a company can provide the owners with a number of benefits, but it also comes with a number of extra costs. One of the major benefits is being able to accumulate after tax profits to grow the business at a lower rate than most tax rates that apply to individuals. There is also the benefit of protecting personal assets if the business comes under legal attack.\nMost of the costs of operating a business through a company relate to those associated with the owners being employed by the business. For example when a business is operated as a sole trader the compulsory employment expenses of superannuation contributions and Workcover insurance are avoided.\nAdvertisement Q. I run a contracting business that employs a number of people and have recently converted from a sole trader to operating through a company. I need to work out how I can pay myself from the business. Do I do this is an employee or is there another way that I can organise for me to take money from the company?\nA. The most practical way for the owner of a business operated through a company to earn an income is to become an employee. In your case this will mean that your company will have the same responsibilities for you as the other employees.\nThis will mean that your company must pay the compulsory 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee contribution on the salary that you take. In addition you will need to be included your salary in the total salaries advised to your Workcover insurance company. This will result in your company paying Workcover insurance at the rate applicable to your duties within the company.\nAs a result of being an employee of the company you will also need to be careful of any private use of company vehicles or even costs associated with entertaining including the annual Christmas party. As a result of you being an employee you will be subject to the fringe benefits tax rules that relate to all of your other employees.\nThis would result in, if the company pays when you entertain customers and clients of the business, the company being liable for fringe benefits tax on a portion of the cost paid. Also depending on the amount that your company spends on the annual Christmas party for your employees fringe benefits tax could be payable on this as well.\nAn alternative to you taking a salary from the company would be based on you taking money as loans from the company instead. As there are rules against shareholders taking profits as loans from a company you would need to, as long as the after tax profit made by the company was greater than the money taken by you as a loan, pay a dividend to yourself in the year following when the money was taken as a loan.\nIn this situation you would pay tax on the dividend received but you would get a credit for the income tax paid by the company. This is a complicated area of income tax legislation so for before taking action you should seek professional advice.\nQuestions on small business income tax and other issues can be emailed to max@taxbiz.com.au\nMax Newham is the founder of www.smsfsurvivalcentre.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T07:32:30.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
