Instead, they're focused on their tax-free savings account.\n\"We try to contribute about $5,000 each a year,\" Matt said, adding they use a computer program to track their expenses and net worth.\nSo far, they've accumulated about $77,000 in their TFSAs.\nYet their main focus is paying down the $340,000 mortgage on their home, which is worth about $475,000. They're currently paying $475 a week on the mortgage, but they've been debating whether it's better to increase payments at the expense of savings, or the other way around, so they can retire early.\n\"What are the things we need to do to get to where we want to go?\" Matt asks.\nCertified financial planner MaryAnn Kokan-Nyhof said it's unlikely the couple can achieve their retirement goal without making some radical changes to their spending.\n\"These folks have plenty of after-tax cash flow every month,\" said the adviser with Desjardins Financial Security Investments in Winnipeg.\nTheir take-home pay is about $ 9,280 a month, which should be enough for them to cover their bills and save considerably for an early retirement.\nTheir spending seems to indicate otherwise.\n\"After subtracting their mortgage payment of about $2,060 and all the other non-discretionary expenses, they are still left with about $4,500 a month,\" she said.\nWhile some of that cash is going toward savings -- about $830 to TFSAs -- their excess cash flow isn't translating into long-term wealth.\nAnd they will really need to save as much as they can to retire early.\nThey will likely still be making mortgage payments for about two to three years after retiring. Then, they will need to replace 70 per cent of their current income (the rule of thumb for estimating retirement income), which would be about $6,500 a month after taxes.\nGiven their pensions will only be about 60 per cent of that amount -- before taxes -- they will be relying heavily on savings.\nBased on a five per cent annual return, they will have about $310,000 in RRSPs to help cover some of the costs. That sum would last about 30 years if they draw roughly $1,500 a month before taxes based on a four per cent return on their investments.\nCombined with their pensions, they'd have close to $6,000 a month in income before taxes. That's probably about $4,300 a month after tax.\nThe rest of the income would have to come from their TFSAs.\nBy the time they retire, their combined accounts would be worth about $350,000 based on a five per cent return and contributing about $5,000 a year each. If they want that money to last for about 30 years of retirement, they could draw roughly $1,670 a month providing their investments return about four per cent over that span.\nThat would make their total income about $6,000 a month after taxes.\nYet these numbers do not factor in inflation. In 15 years, $6,000 will have the same buying power as $4,000 today.\nThat's because $6,500 in expenses today will be more like $9,700 a month in expenses in 15 years.\nAnother planning concern is their savings strategy. While they should be putting money into TFSAs, they should also be contributing as much as they can to their RRSPs. And it should probably be a priority over their TFSAs.\n\"They are both high-income earners and will get more benefit from maxing up their RRSPs while they get no immediate benefit from contributing to a TFSA,\" Kokan-Nyhof said, adding they will receive a refund of 39.4 per cent, or $394 for every $1,000 of RRSP contributions. Moreover, it's unlikely in retirement they'd be withdrawing funds from their RRSP at the same or a higher tax rate, so there would likely be net tax savings on those contributions.\nAny additional money for savings once they've reached their contribution limit for the RRSPs can go toward their TFSAs.\nThe upside for Matt and Patty is they appear to have the income to retire early. But they must start budgeting more carefully. That involves more than tracking expenses using a computer program. They can't simply document spending on monthly fixed expenses and other necessities such as groceries and gasoline; they need to keep track of where their money is going.\n\"It can't just go under a 'miscellaneous' line if it's thousands of dollars each month unaccounted for,\" Kokan-Nyhof said, adding one of their budget lines lists about $3,500 under 'everything else.'\nOnly by accounting for all costs can they make changes so they can find the additional savings for early retirement.\nThat's about $12,000 a year in addition to their current savings to retire comfortably, and that may be achievable because almost $5,000 is going toward discretionary spending every month.\nIf that sum turns out to be too much for them to handle, they can look at other measures such as working until age 60.\n\"If they wait until then, and save an additional $400 per month each into RSPs, for example, they can achieve the 70 per cent income replacement and have it last until they reach life expectancy.\"\nOther options involve retiring at 55 and continuing to work part time to cover expenses -- something they're considering.\nBased on the numbers they've provided, their current course is not likely to work out well.\n\"The bottom line is, Matt and Patty must adjust,\" Kokan-Nyhof said.\n\"They need to work longer and/or save more, or suffer from the consequences of a restricted lifestyle for 30 years or more once retired.\"\n\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:33:35.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
