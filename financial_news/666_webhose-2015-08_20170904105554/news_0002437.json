Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Liberal MP Warren Entsch has introduced his bill to legalise same-sex marriage into Parliament, in an act of both futility and defiance.\nWith his government severely divided by the issue, Prime Minster Tony Abbott, who will block any attempts to enable the bill to be debated or put to a vote, scheduled a visit to the Australian Federal Police headquarters to coincide with Mr Entsch's moment.\nWith cabinet grappling over what to do next, hold a referendum or a plebiscite, Mr Abbott said that would not be resolved quickly.\n\"There are a few loose ends to tie up, and that will be dealt with in the next couple of weeks,\" he said.\nWhile the Labor benches were relatively full, just two ministers, Christopher Pyne and Malcolm Turnbull, were present for Mr Entsch's speech. Labor leader Bill Shorten was also present. Another minister, Senator Simon Birmingham, sat in the chamber in support.\n\"This bill does not create different classes of marriage, it is not putting a marriage between a same-sex couple above that of a heterosexual couple or vice versa,\" Mr Entsch said.\nHe said the bill protects religious freedoms on two counts. First, it exempts churches and other religious groups from having to marry gay couples if that is what they choose. Secondly, because \"you cannot replace one form of prejudice and discrimination with another\".\n\"This bill is designed to promote an inclusive Australia, not a divided one, a divided nation is what we will be if we continue to allow discrimination in relation to marriage on the basis of a person's sexuality,\" he said.\n \"The co-sponsors acknowledge and accept there are strong and conflicting views on marriage equality and we certainly respect those views. In addition, we are not in any way trying to change those views. However, we do what we believe is right.\"\nMr Entsch introduced the bill as the latest Fairfax/Ipsos poll showed a record 69 per cent support for same-sex marriage, while just 25 per cent were opposed. It also showed the government lagging Labor by 46 per cent to 54 per cent.\nA bitterly divided federal cabinet will debate on Monday evening whether to put same-sex marriage to a plebiscite or a referendum and whether to do it before, at, or after the next federal election, due late next year.\n'Jobs, growth and community safety' Ministers trying to get the government back on track were attempting on Monday to steer the national conversation back to the economy, tax reform and national security.\nMr Abbott said repeatedly the government was focused on \"jobs, growth and community safety\" while Social Services Minister Scott Morrison told reporters the government was focused on jobs.\n\"While there's been some superficiality in debate and commentary in recent times I think the Australian people should rest easy that this is a government focused on their concerns,\" he said.\nTreasurer Joe Hockey said while \"everyone else was talking about other issues\" last week, he was discussing trade and investment with Chinese officials.\n\"We've got to focus on policy, we've got to focus on what really matters to 100 per cent of the Australian community and that is jobs and growth and community security,\" he told ABC radio.\nLast week, both men arranged interviews with the ABC to put their respective views on gay marriage.\nMr Abbott, who until recently opposed a national vote, is now arguing strongly for a \"people's choice\".\nHe again over ruled Malcolm Turnbull and others who want a vote before or at the next election, saying the vote would be after the election.\nAttorney-General George Brandis has argued strongly against a referendum on the grounds there is not legal basis to hold one. The conservatives want a referendum because it represents the best chance of defeating change. Senator Birmingham said a referendum would amount to being \"tricky\"\nAfter introducing his bill, Mr Entsch told reporters he wanted a role in choosing the question that would be put to a national vote.\nHe also remained hopeful that he could convince colleagues to enable his bill to be at least debated.\n\"The fact that I have put it in means I would like it voted on,\" he said.\nLabor MP Terri Butler, who was to second the Entsch bill but will probably never get to do so, said afterwards Mr Abbott was occupied with trying to save his leadership.\n\"The Parliament should have an opportunity to vote on the bill - there should be an opportunity for the Liberal Party moderates, who have been treated so poorly within the Coalition, to support this bill in public,\" she said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-17T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:53:33.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
