How the market contends with that is problematic,\" he told Bloomberg News. \nMarket expectations for a US rate rise next month were given a boost Friday by solid jobs data, but they were tempered by warnings from a central bank official that low inflation still poses a risk. \nUS Federal Reserve vice chairman Stanley Fischer's remarks helped push down the dollar, which continued its slide on Tuesday. It changed hands at 124.64 yen in Tokyo against 124.72 yen in New York late Monday. \nThe euro was flat at $1.1019 while firming to 137.34 yen compared with 137.31 yen in US trade. \nOil dipped after adding more than two percent on Monday as dealers eyed the latest US energy (NasdaqCM: USEG - news ) report for clues about demand in the world's top crude consumer. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 20 cents to $44.76 while Brent crude for September eased 18 cents to $50.23. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) fetched $1,103.60 compared to $1,094.78 late Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T06:43:08.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
