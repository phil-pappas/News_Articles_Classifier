Accent's same-store sales rose 37 per cent in the first seven weeks, with Skechers one of the standouts.\n\"The ongoing performance of the Accent business is unprecedented in the current retail climate,\" said RCG chief executive HiIton Brett, \"with 30 per cent like for like growth over the last 12 months and double-digit like-for-like growth in each of the two years before that.\"\n\"There's no question the active lifestyle space and athleisure space is experiencing strong growth,\" he said.\nRCG's Brands business also did well, with strong demand for Sperry Topsiders, Saucony sports shoes and sneakers and CAT boots offsetting weak demand for Merrell's lifestyle range. Sales rose 36 per cent, underpinning a 24 per cent increase in earnings.\nThis offset lacklustre growth in RCG's core The Athletes Foot business, where sales rose only 2.5 per cent and earnings by 1.1 per cent, triggering a strategic review that could lead to new store formats.\nIncluding Accent, RCG's underlying net profit rose 16 per cent to $13.7 million, falling slightly short of market forecasts around $14.4 million.\nOne-off costs associated with the deal, which was funded through a $25 million placement to institutional investors, a $28 million unsecured vendor note and $50 million of bank debt, dragged statutory net profit down 11.7 per cent to $10.3 million.\nRCG maintained its final dividend at 2.5¢, preserving its cash to fund new stores and refurbishments. Accent plans to open 20 stores in 2016, including 12 before the end of September.\nRCG shares, which have risen 53 per cent since March, shed 3¢ to $1.12.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:17:52.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
