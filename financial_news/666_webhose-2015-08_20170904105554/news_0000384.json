Cole Bennetts Share on twitter by David Ramli Telstra's flagging mobile subscriber growth and rising dividend will be the key areas to watch as new chief executive Andy Penn delivers his first set of annual results for the telecoms giant.\nRising revenues from mobile phones and services have been a boon for Telstra as it fights to maintain growth amid a fall in copper-line phone calls. They have supported an increase in the dividend for shareholders and given the company more cash to buy new businesses.\nBut leading industry analysts are now questioning whether heated competition from rivals Singtel-Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia have dampened profits and growth in this vital area.\nThe $77 billion company will need all the shareholder support and cash it can get to fund Mr Penn's new strategy and its Asian aspirations .\nWill Telstra's grip on the mobile market start slipping away? Deutsche Bank research analyst Craig Wong-Pan expects Telstra to deliver a $4.2 billion net profit for the 2015 financial year and a 30.5c per share dividend. But he has labelled mobile market share gains or losses as Telstra's key risk.\n\"We have assumed increased competition has limited subscriber growth to 92,000 net additions in the second half financial year 2015 period,\" he told clients in a note. Increased data allowances would lead to a \"slight decline\" in the average revenue the company makes per user and \"compressed\" profit margins.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Raymond Tong is more positive, predicting a 31Â¢-a-share dividend will be announced on Thursday morning.\nHe estimates Telstra's mobile division has grown by 384,000 in the second half of financial year 2015 and that revenue growth will continue to accelerate in line with those at rival telcos.\n \"Telstra has raised handset pricing to more than offset higher handset costs,\" he said. \"We expect this will be supportive of margins.\"\nAccording to Citi Research analyst Justin Diddams, all eyes will be on the mobile market, where investors are expecting \"deteriorating trends\". He predicts Telstra will report a 300,000 rise in the second half of 2015, bringing its full year subscriber growth to 666,000 over the full financial year.\n\"While the near-term operational outlook looks encouraging, we expect the momentum to fade in coming years, as competition and market penetration increases,\" he said. \"Telstra can still deliver earnings growth (and solid free cash flow) supported by NBN cash receipts, further cost rationalisation and lower interest costs.\"\n\"With the shares trading at a premium valuation to the market, we retain our Neutral rating.\"\nThrough all of this it's worth watching how Telstra's Network Application and Services (NAS) division fares. NAS sells cloud computing and technology services to customers around the world and is seen as one of the telco's great hopes for boosting profits and relevance in its next iteration.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-08-12T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:11:44.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
