the boss of Realestate.com.au, knows online business has never been more cut throat or cluttered.\nRealesate.com has revolutionised the property industry – learn how your business will be impacted – and don’t fear, it will.\nMs Fellows is the chief executive of the ASX-listed REA Group, which owns and operates Australia’s realestate.com.au and realcommercial.com.au, as well as property sites in Italy, Luxembourg, France and China.\nShe was the first to admit at the recent American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Brisbane that “there will always be a role for print to play in selling housing and absoloutely should continue”.\nMs Fellows is determined to keep pushing REA to change, innovate and disrupt.”\n“The biggest threat to any business is staying ahead of the game and we are always thinking of ways to innovate and disrupt ourself,” she said.\n“At REA, our 20 year old legacy is built on disruption and we hire people who want to push the boundaries.”\nREA’s latest innovation gives consumers sale price details for every home in Australia, whether on the market or not.\nThat is a very powerful consumer took for buyers and sellers which means agents need to keep offering the best customer service possible because market information is now freely available to anyone with the internet.\nYou can check out neighbouring property values, what facilities are in the area, recent sales and even the closest schools.\nREA Group chief digital officer Henry Ruiz said giving price estimates for properties not currently on the market helped people understand what a property could be worth.\nThe estimates are based on similar properties in the area and there are links to agents who can provide more detailed appraisals.\n“When you’re starting to think about buying or selling, we appreciate there can be a bit of\nguesswork about what a property might be worth,’’ he said.\n“With a page for every property in Australia, we’re making it easier to research the market where you can see the previous sold histories, research property values and monitor what’s happening in your local market.’’\nCoreLogic RP Data provides the price estimates for realestate.com.au.\nOriginally
