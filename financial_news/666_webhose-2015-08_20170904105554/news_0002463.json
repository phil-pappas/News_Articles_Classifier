Bloomberg Grove says smartphone demand will be strongest in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand because they have much lower penetration rates than larger Asian countries. \"They have big population bases coupled with the massive migration of people from lower to middle class. As a first step, more people there will buy phones and data plans.\"\nMore than 200 million people in south-east Asia who do not have laptops or desktop computers will experience the internet only through a mobile device, he says. \"This trend will change everything. Component manufacturers will do well, but anybody providing a 'must need' smartphone app will see their users double.\"\nMontgomery Global Investment portfolio manager Chris Demasi says this theme has years to run. \"A structural boom in smartphone demand in developing Asian countries will play out over a long period. Growth in Chinese smartphone sales will accelerate again as the introduction of 4G technology spurs new demand. Then you have India and smaller emerging markets that will drive even higher smartphone demand.\"\nUnderpin demand The emergence of another three billion middle-class consumers by 2030, on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecasts, rapid growth in urbanisation and more advanced telecommunication infrastructure in Asia will underpin demand, Demasi says. \"A smartphone will be one of the most attractive purchases for an emerging-markets consumer with rising income.\"\nThe latest Google Consumer Barometer supports Demasi's view. It shows smartphone penetration is much lower in emerging Asian nations compared to developed markets, but significantly higher compared to other electronic devices.\nIndonesia's 43 per cent smartphone penetration of the adult population, for example, compares to 96 per cent in Singapore. But within Indonesia, smartphone penetration was higher than desktop computers (15 per cent) and tablets (4 per cent).\nAlthough the trend has strong foundations, global smartphone demand is a series of markets within markets â€“ across countries and by purchase type, from new smartphones to the critical phone upgrade market. Identifying undervalued winners across telcos, equipment and component providers and software firms is challenging.\nSmartphone demand, like most trends, is well known and priced into equity markets.\nMoreover, global smartphone demand is slowing. Smartphone shipments are expected to rise 11.3 per cent in 2015, compared with a rise of 27.6 per cent in 2014, International Data Corporation (IDC) says. IDC predicts Chinese smartphone demand to slow to 2.5 per cent in 2015, which will be the first time it has fallen below global growth rates.\nSlower smartphone sales and weakening Chinese demand were key themes in UBS's global smartphone-retention survey. The investment bank believes high-end smartphone demand is maturing and growth in low-end devices slowing, while competition is rising.\nStrong aspirational market That said, the UBS survey, released in May, pointed to a strong aspirational market in emerging markets as consumers upgrade smartphones. About 61 per cent of Chinese consumers surveyed intended to upgrade their smartphone in the next 12 months, compared to 54 per cent globally. A 12-month upgrade cycle in China compares to 24 months globally.\nUBS says a re-acceleration in Chinese smartphone demand is likely in the second half of 2015, as Chinese telcos step up their 4G networks, in turn spurring phone upgrades.\nJie Liu, portfolio manager at Acorn Capital, a leading small-cap investor in Asia, says the outlook for global smartphone demand is improving. \"The smartphone industry is still growing at a double-digit percentage rate and the fast-growing Indian, Brazilian and African markets will likely drive global smartphone shipments.\"\nLiu says there are two potential catalysts for an increase in demand: \"The first is the much-anticipated upcoming release of Apple's iPhone 6S, possibly in the third quarter of 2015. The second is the fast-charging feature to shorten the phone battery charge time by at least 50 per cent, which is being pushed by MediaTek Inc.\"\nLike other technology sectors, software and app developers will drive the next phase of smartphone growth, as hardware sales mature. Liu says: \"The way to establish a critical mass is to have a large market share in either hardware or key applications such as operating systems, app stores and anti-virus software. This is perhaps the reason some Chinese companies are trying to enter the smartphone space with their own brands despite the slowdown in industry growth. They may have their eyes on the ultimate prize: the mobile internet.\"\nLiu says smartphone component suppliers without their own phone brands are unlikely to be big winners in the mobile internet market, \"unless there are some killer applications that require specific components from specific suppliers\". \"Pure hardware-focused smartphone component suppliers may have their next big feast when 5G mobile communication systems are ready to be rolled out, likely around 2020.\"\nShort-term pressure Component suppliers face short-term pressure from slowing global smartphone demand, Liu warns. \"This has resulted in a channel inventory build-up and created pressure on upstream suppliers' revenue and margins. The inventory correction will likely take several quarters to complete.\"\nMontgomery Global's Demasi favours the US-listed Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc. Qualcomm, the biggest maker of mobile phone chips, charges royalty fees for handset makers to access its intellectual property for mobile device communication technology.\n\"Effectively, Qualcomm gets a small cut on every mobile phone sold that communicates via 3G and 4G technologies,\" Demasi says. \"As smartphone demand rises and networks are upgraded in emerging countries, Qualcomm's licensing fees, about two-thirds of earnings, will keep rising.\"\nQualcomm is significantly undervalued, Demasi says. \"After adjusting for its cash balance, Qualcomm trades on a trailing price-earnings (P/E) of 10 times. How many leading Australian companies trade on a P/E of 10 or with an opportunity anywhere near as large as Qualcomm's?\"\nApple trades on a similar trailing P/E multiple (excluding cash), Demasi says. \"Apple is a virtual monopolist in the premium smartphone and tablet segments and its growth prospects will be driven by China. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said China will be Apple's largest market at some point.\"\nAmong Hong Kong stocks, SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings is attractively priced, share valuation service Skaffold says. It estimates the mobile network operator is trading 36 per cent below its fair value.\nThe prominent global equities fund manager, PM Capital, favours AAC Technologies, a Hong Kong provider of acoustics and haptics, the vibration technology in electronic devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:11:18.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
