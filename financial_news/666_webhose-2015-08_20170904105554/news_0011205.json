For a population of just 320,000 people, that&apos;s a lot of guests.\nThat forecast has the government racing to build the necessary infrastructure.\n``I&apos;m very impatient and we&apos;ve been putting more funds into the sector,&apos;&apos; said Ragnheidur Elin Arnadottir, Iceland&apos;s tourism minister. ``We can&apos;t afford to not be efficient.&apos;&apos;\nIt&apos;s clear that tourism is helping Iceland&apos;s economy. The share of tourism to GDP rose 55 percent from 2009 through 2013, according to the latest data from Iceland&apos;s statistics office.\nCapturing that growth could help seal Iceland&apos;s status as a model for how to protect state coffers and consumers while successfully emerging from a banking meltdown. Policy makers are now hoping the nation&apos;s economic health, and a steady inflow of tourism cash, will help them withstand the removal of capital controls that are holding hostage $6 billion.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iHQdMgwD99TU/v1/460x260.png\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i5fJyRjQeNM4/v1/460x260.png\\"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T12:04:00.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
