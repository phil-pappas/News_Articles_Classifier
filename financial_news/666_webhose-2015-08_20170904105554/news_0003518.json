Total income for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 was $10,217,000, as compared to $8,595,000, (excluding the forgiveness of non-recourse debt income reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014), an increase of 18.9% over the results of the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. Total income of $34,696,000 reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014 included $26,101,000 of forgiveness of non-recourse debt. Included in total income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 is finance income on consumer receivables of $5,156,000, as compared to $5,074,000 reported in the three month period ended June 30, 2014. Income reported from CBC was $2,595,000 in the three month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $1,406,000 reported in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014, an 84.6% increase. In the three month period ended June 30, 2015, the CBC unit increased the number of cases funded by 93.5% over the three month period ended June 30, 2014. Income from personal injury claims was $1,729,000 in the three month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $1,779,000 for the three month period end June 30, 2014, a 2.8% decrease from the prior year, as slightly fewer cases closed in the period; however the value of the net investment in personal injury cases increased by $5.4 million, or 17.1%, from $31.7 million as of June 30, 2014 to $37.2 million as of June 30, 2015. Income from GAR Disability increased to $552,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 from $137,000 reported in the same period of the prior year. \nNet cash collections of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation, including cash collections represented by account sales, were $28,257,000 for the nine months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $30,743,000 in the nine month period ended June 30, 2014. Net cash collections of consumer receivables acquired for liquidation, including cash collections represented by account sales, were $8,838,000 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, as compared to $10,041,000 in the third quarter of the prior year. Net collections on Great Seneca were $6,751,000 during the nine months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $7,749,000 for the nine months ended June 30, 2014. Net cash collections on the Great Seneca portfolio were $2,288,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, as compared to $2,781,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. \nGeneral and administrative expenses were $27,793,000 for the nine month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $20,517,000 for the nine month period ended June 30, 2014. The increase reflects the growth of CBC and GAR Disability during the nine month period ended June 30, 2015, as staffing and advertising expenses have increased for each of the reporting segments. Additionally, CBC only reported six months in fiscal year 2014 compared to nine month in fiscal year 2015. General and administrative expenses for the personal injury reporting segment increased primarily due to the increase for bad debt reserves. These increases in the operating reporting segments have been offset by the reduction in costs in the consumer receivables and corporate reporting segments. Although costs associated with the review by the Division of Corporation Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") are included in the nine month period ended June 30, 2015, overall general and administrative expense is lower for the corporate segment reporting unit from the prior year. Also, there was a non-cash unrealized foreign exchange loss of $0.9 million related to the investment in the Topaz Fixed Income Fund in the current nine month period, as the investment is denominated in Euros. Also included in the results for the current period is a $295,000 unrealized gain on the Topaz Fixed Income Fund, reported as part of total income. General and administrative expenses were $9,177,000 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $7,012,000 for the three month period ended June 30, 2014. General and administrative expenses were higher during the current three month period due to the growth of the GAR Disability reporting segment, primarily resulting from the increase in advertising and staffing costs related to leads resulting in securing disability cases. In addition, general and administrative expenses related to the corporate reporting segment include current quarter expenses related to the SEC review. \nInterest expense was $1,710,000 for the nine month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $820,000 for the nine month period ended June 30, 2014. Interest expense was $632,000 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015, as compared to $413,000 for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the growth in the debt balance of the CBC reporting segment with and average debt balance of approximately $39.5 million for fiscal year 2015, as compared to approximately $25.4 million in fiscal year 2014. \nThe Company did not report any impairments during the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2015. The Company recorded $19.6 million in impairments during the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2014. Included in the three and nine month periods ended June 30, 2014 is a $14.0 million impairment recorded on the Great Seneca Portfolio. The carrying value of the Great Seneca portfolio at June 30, 2015 was $12,500,000, as compared to $21,601,000 at June 30, 2014. \nOn July 16, 2015, the Company made a payment to the IRS of approximately $13.0 million in anticipation of the conclusion of the examination by the IRS and in accordance with their notice of proposed adjustment, for the fiscal tax years ended September 30, 2009 through September 30, 2013. The adjustment is the result of a change in the accounting method used for income recognition for income tax purposes. Apart from the change in accounting method for income tax purposes, there were no other material disallowances or adjustments to other items of income, deductions, and credits to the tax returns under examination. The payment does not include approximately $507,000 of interest related to the tax year of the IRS adjustment, September 30, 2013 which has been accrued for as of June 30, 2015. The Company will be amending its federal tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, to reflect the new accounting method for income tax purposes. There is no state and local tax liability as a result of the Federal tax examination. \nGary Stern, President and CEO of the Company, commented \"Although our consolidated net income is down from the prior year, we are very excited about the progress of CBC Settlement Funding in the structured settlement business as the number of cases funded has more than doubled in the latest nine month period. CBC contributed $1.4 million to pre-tax profits in the nine month period ended June 30, 2015.\" Mr. Stern continued, \"GAR Disability Advocates is in position to continue growing over the next year. Income approached $1.0 million in the nine month period and we continue to build the disability case inventory. Costs remain significant as we continue to build the business. Also, although we have not purchased a consumer receivable portfolio domestically in several years, finance income on consumer receivables did increase over the prior period for the nine month and three month period ended June 30, 2015. We are optimistic of the prospects of our current business segments and we continue to seek additional investments in, or acquisitions of, companies in the financial services industry.\" \nA conference call to discuss the results of the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2015 will be held on August 10, 2015 at 4:00PM EDT. \nToll-free dial in number (US and Canada): (800) 668-4132", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:22:41.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
