WorkChoices was dead and buried.\nAnd that's the challenge the Productivity Commission has addressed in producing a plan that, to borrow the commission's analogy, is for renovation rather than a \"knockdown and rebuild\".\nBut in doing so, the commission leaves open the question of whether Australia has adequately addressed the issue of its extensive labour market regulation.\nAustralia's labour market is highly regulated, as it was even under the Howard government's radical WorkChoices reforms.\nAnd the obligation of advocates of any market regulation is to show that it will improve the general welfare.\nAs Gary Banks, the Productivity Commission's former chairman put it, the proponents of regulation: \"should be required to demonstrate that there are public interest benefits that exceed the economic costs, and that such benefits to society could not be achieved in more cost-effective ways.\"\nUnder Abbott's preferred approach the onus of proof in practice falls on the renovator.\nUseful suggestions The Productivity Commission's draft report makes some useful suggestions that would, for example, open the way for more flexible enterprise agreements and for minimum wage decisions to take greater account of the economic environment.\nBut is it the comprehensive, hard-headed assessment that Australians needed to see of one of their most important bodies of economic regulation?\nThe Productivity Commission rightly points to the labour market's impressive performance since the reforms of the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments.\nIt has repeatedly outperformed the official forecasts since the onset of the global financial crisis.\nIn the most recent episode, a 28 per cent fall in the terms of trade has seen in an increase in the measured unemployment rate of only about 1 percentage point.\nWhile that can be partly attributed to Australia's slowing population growth, it is an extraordinarily good result by historical standards.\nHowever, as we face a decade of slow economic growth and intensifying pressure from globalisation, the question is whether we need to do even better.\nManufacturing moving towards emerging markets Manufacturing is migrating rapidly from high-income economies such as Australia to the emerging market economies, which can offer high productivity, cheap labour and low taxes.\nThe rise of global value chains is facilitating this migration, while the international outsourcing of white collar jobs is extending the process to the services sector.\nAlan Blinder, a former vice-chairman of the US Federal Reserve, predicts that a third of jobs in the US – including highly skilled professionals – will eventually become susceptible to outsourcing to lower-wage countries such as India.\nWhat's true of the US will be true of Australia.\nThis is an environment in which Australia will need all the workplace flexibility it can get.\nIndustrial relations reform is not the only route to that flexibility.\nThe trade reform that forced employers and unions to face the challenge of global competition in the 1980s and 1990s undoubtedly played an important role in transforming Australian workplace relations.\nCompetition policy reform extended these pressures to the services sector.\nTony Abbott, who promised that there would be no return to the Howard government's WorkChoices industrial relations regime, might feel let off the hook by the Productivity Commission report.\nBut he should think again. The less he does to reform industrial relations, the more he will have to reform trade and competition policy if he wants to keep living standards rising at anything like the rate expected by voters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:40:57.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
