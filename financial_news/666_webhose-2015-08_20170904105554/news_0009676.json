As part of the overhaul chief executive David Knox will be stepping down from the role.\nThe group's board is looking to conduct a full strategic review, examining all options to restore and maximise shareholder value. This will be a complex issue as outlined by Dale Koendersâ€‹ from Citi.\nThat said, he is of the view Santos can continue to maintain investment-grade credit rating so long as oil is more than $US60 per barrel, the average trading range between February and June.\nBalance sheet a priority In his words, fixing sentiment towards the balance sheet is now a priority with the expectation of non-producing asset sales, infrastructure sale and leasebacks, derisking the GLNG project and instigating a rights issue as a backstop option to reduce gearing to a sustainable level.\nMr Koenders is of the view redundancies will deliver cost savings in the vicinity of $70 million a year on a forward basis. On a more positive note, he highlighted the GLNG project is only weeks away from starting up, effectively derisking Santos becoming cash flow positive in calendar year 2015, provided the oil price is about $US50 per barrel.\nTo provide an indication of how analysts view the stock it is worth examining current price targets set by Citi ($9.86), Deutsche Bank ($10.10) and UBS ($7.00).\n All three brokers maintained their buy recommendations following the interim result, but the company is now heavily reliant on a recovery in the oil price.\nTrevor Hoey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:00:38.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
