It also could be used by astronauts for recreational gardening activities during deep space missions.\nThe first pillows were activated, watered and cared for by Expedition 39 flight engineer Steve Swanson in May 2014.\nAfter 33 days of growth, the plants were harvested and returned to Earth in October 2014. At NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the plants underwent food safety analysis.\nThe second Veg-01 plant pillows were activated by Kelly on July 8 and grew again for 33 days before being harvested. The seeds had been on the station for 15 months before being activated.\nThe Veggie system was developed by Orbital Technologies Corp (ORBITEC) in Madison, Wisconsin, and tested at Kennedy before flight.\nVeggie, along with two sets of pillows containing the romaine seeds and one set of zinnias, was delivered to the station on the third cargo resupply mission by SpaceX in April 2014.\nThe collapsible and expandable Veggie unit features a flat panel light bank that includes red, blue and green LEDs for plant growth and crew observation.\nAfter the first crop of lettuce was returned from the space station, Dr Gioia Massa, the NASA payload scientist for Veggie at Kennedy, began working with a team of flight doctors and NASA safety representatives to get approval for the crew to eat the produce.\n“Microbiological food safety analysis looks very good on the first Veg-01 crop of romaine lettuce,” Massa said.\n 11, 2015 2:21 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:05:10.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
