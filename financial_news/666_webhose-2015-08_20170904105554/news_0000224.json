Reports Second Quarter 2015 Financial Results \nSecond Quarter Highlights Volume of 132.8 million pounds, a decrease of 1.5% year-over-year; Adjusted sales of $140.6 million, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year; Adjusted EBITDA of $41.0 million, an increase of 38.5% year-over-year; Adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $0.89 versus $0.49 in the prior year period; Net sales of $414.9 million, a decrease of 5.8% year-over-year; Net income attributable to GBC of $17.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, versus $9.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in prior year period; and Company raises 2015 full-year guidance. Press Release : Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. – 21 minutes ago +0.03 \nSCHAUMBURG, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- \nGlobal Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. ( BRSS ) (“GBC” or the “Company”) today announced the results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nSecond Quarter Operating Results \nVolume for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by 1.5% to 132.8 million pounds compared to 134.8 million pounds in the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in volume was primarily attributable to lower demand in the munitions market, due to continued destocking in the supply chain, partially offset by higher demand in the coinage and the building and housing markets. \n“We achieved solid second quarter results, and I am proud of our team’s execution that delivered strong earnings growth, strong cash flow, and margin expansion despite relatively flat volume. Operating performance at Olin Brass significantly improved year-over-year, and we continue to drive the productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives we implemented last year across all business segments,” said John Wasz, GBC’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “As anticipated, rebalancing of the supply chain in the munitions market led to a slight decline in overall volume. Overall, however, we’re encouraged by double digit growth in our green product portfolio, including Eco Brass, continued expansion of our A.J. Oster product portfolio, and further strengthening of the building and housing market.” \nWasz continued, “I would also like to draw your attention to our results in light of recent fluctuations in commodity prices. Quarterly average copper prices have decreased by 7% from $2.98 in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.77 in the second quarter of 2015 while over the same period our results have improved. We believe this is an example that illustrates how our business model as a metals converter employing a balanced book approach is effective in mitigating the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices on our results.” \nNet sales for the second quarter of 2015 decreased by 5.8% to $414.9 million compared to $440.5 million in the second quarter of 2014. The decline in net sales was mostly attributable to lower metal prices and lower sales of unprocessed metal. Adjusted sales, our non-GAAP financial measure, which reflects the value added premium over metal replacement cost recovery, increased by 2.2% to $140.6 million for the second quarter of 2015 from $137.6 million for the same period of 2014. A reconciliation of net sales to adjusted sales is provided later in this press release. \nNet income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. for the quarter was $17.1 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to a net income attributable to GBC of $9.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the same period of 2014. The increase in net income attributable to Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. for the quarter was primarily due to an increase in gross profit and the gain on the sale of the Company’s interest in the Dowa-Olin Metal Corporation joint venture (the “Dowa Joint Venture”), partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in the provision for income taxes. \nAdjusted EBITDA, our non-GAAP measure of consolidated GBC profitability, was $41.0 million for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of 38.5% compared to the second quarter of 2014. This increase was largely the result of a pre-tax gain on the sale of our interest in the Dowa Joint Venture and lower manufacturing conversion costs, both of which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. A reconciliation of net income attributable to GBC to Adjusted EBITDA is provided later in this press release. \nCash Flow and Leverage \nDuring the second quarter of 2015, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $21.9 million, which was driven by earnings and improvements in working capital in the second quarter of 2015. \nThe Company ended the quarter with cash of $78.4 million and no significant changes in our indebtedness. \n2015 Guidance \nThe Company is raising its full-year 2015 guidance. For the full year 2015, GBC expects: Shipment volumes to range from 505 million pounds to 525 million pounds, which is an increase from the prior guidance of 500 to 520 million pounds; Adjusted sales to range from $520 million to $545 million, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $515 million and $540 million; and Adjusted EBITDA to range from $113 million to $122 million, which is an increase from the prior guidance of $110 million to $119 million, which in both ranges include the gain on the sale of the Dowa Joint Venture. \nConference Call \nThe Company will host a teleconference and webcast at 8:30 a.m. (Central Time) on Friday, August 7 to review the results. To listen to the live call, individuals can access the webcast at the investor relations portion of the Company's website at http://ir.gbcholdings.com , or by dialing 855-878-0250, passcode # 87208744 approximately 10 minutes before the scheduled start time.

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Common Share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP. Adjusted sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP. \nYou should therefore not place undue reliance on Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted diluted earnings per common share, Adjusted sales, or any ratios calculated using them. Our U.S. GAAP-based measures can be found in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this press release. \nAdjusted EBITDA \nAdjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude the following: unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts in support of our balanced book approach, unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative contracts related to electricity and natural gas costs, non-cash losses due to lower of cost or market adjustments to inventory, non-cash gains and losses due to the depletion of a LIFO layer of metal inventory, share-based compensation expense, non-cash income accretion related to the Dowa Joint Venture, restructuring and other business transformation charges, specified legal and professional expenses, and certain other items. \nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA represents a meaningful presentation of the financial performance of our core operations, without the impact of the various items excluded, in order to provide period-to-period comparisons that are more consistent and more easily understood. We also believe it is an important supplemental measure that is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. \nAdjusted EBITDA is the key metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the business performance of our segments in comparison to budgets, forecasts and prior-year financial results, providing a measure that management believes reflects our core operating performance. For example, we use Adjusted EBITDA per pound in order to measure the effectiveness of the balanced book approach in reducing the financial impact of metal price volatility on earnings and operating margins, and to measure the effectiveness of our business transformation initiatives in improving earnings and operating margins. In addition, measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are defined and used in the agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Senior Secured Notes to determine compliance with various financial covenants and tests. \nHowever, our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. In addition, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are that Adjusted EBITDA: does not reflect every expenditure, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect the significant interest expense or the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; does not reflect income tax expense and therefore the cost of complying with applicable laws; is an imperfect substitute for cash flow as it eliminates depreciation and amortization expense but does not include cash expended for capital expenditures required to operate our business; does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; and does not reflect limitations on our costs related to transferring earnings from our subsidiaries to us. \nWe compensate for these limitations by using Adjusted EBITDA along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include operating income (loss), net income (loss), cash flows from operations and other cash flow data. We have significant uses of cash, including capital expenditures, interest payments, debt principal repayments, taxes and other non-recurring charges, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. \nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share \nAdjusted diluted earnings per common share is defined as diluted income (loss) per common share adjusted to remove the after-tax impact of the add backs to EBITDA in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted diluted earnings per common share supplements our U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the results of our business, and we believe it is useful to our investors and other parties for these same reasons. Adjusted diluted earnings per common share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP. \nAdjusted sales \nAdjusted sales is defined as net sales less the metal component of net sales. Net sales is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to adjusted sales. Adjusted sales represents the value-added premium we earn over our conversion and fabrication costs. We use adjusted sales on a consolidated basis to monitor the revenues that are generated from our value-added conversion and fabrication processes excluding the effects of fluctuations in metal costs. We believe that adjusted sales supplements our U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the results of our business, and we believe it is useful to our investors and other parties for these same reasons. \nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements \nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” that involve risks and uncertainties. You can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “projects,” “may,” “would,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or similar expressions that relate to our strategy, plans or intentions. All statements the Company makes relating to its estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or to its expectations regarding future industry trends are forward-looking statements. In addition, the Company, through its senior management, from time to time makes or may make forward-looking public statements concerning its expected future operations and performance and other developments. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may change at any time, and, therefore, the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those that it expected. The Company derives many of its forward-looking statements from its operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While the Company believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect the Company’s actual results. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to various risks and uncertainties, including: the failure to maintain the Company’s balanced book approach which could cause increased volatility in the Company’s profitability and operating results and may result in significant losses; the loss in order volumes from any of the Company’s largest customers, which may reduce the Company’s sales volumes, revenues and cash flows; the disruption to the Company’s business if its customers shift their manufacturing offshore; the occurrence of any prolonged disruptions at or failures of the Company’s manufacturing facilities and equipment which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; disruptions arising from inclement weather; and the failure to implement the Company’s business strategy, including its growth initiatives, could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. More detailed information about these and other risks and uncertainties are contained in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2015 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the Company’s Investor Relations website at http://ir.gbcholdings.com or the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . All forward-looking information in this press release is expressly qualified in its entirety by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon information available to the Company on the date of this press release. \nIn addition, the matters referred to in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release may not in fact occur. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on those statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
