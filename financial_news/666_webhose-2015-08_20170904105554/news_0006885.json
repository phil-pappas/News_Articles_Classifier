His lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nProsecutors said McPhail learned secret information about American Superconductor from an unnamed senior executive who, like him, belonged to the Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts.\nDespite hearing the information in confidence, McPhail starting in 2009 began sharing with his friends the inside information about the company's business activities and earnings announcements, prosecutors said.\nOver a two-year period, McPhail's friends made over $500,000 by illegally trading on the tips, prosecutors said. Parigian alone made more than $267,000, prosecutors have said.\nThe trial and Parigian's plea came after Casper rejected a bid to dismiss the case in light of a December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that curtailed authorities' ability to pursue insider trading.\nWhile the decision, which reversed the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, only applied to judges in New York, Vermont and Connecticut, defendants in other states have sought to take advantage of it in their cases.\nParigian's plea deal allows him to appeal Casper's decision. The U.S. Justice Department has meanwhile petitioned the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit's ruling.\nThe case is U.S. v. McPhail, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-cr-10201.
