The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \n1. Best Buy Co. Inc. Market Cap: $12.8 billion YTD Return: -9.6% \nOppenheimer : Outperform; $43 PT Oppenheimer Said: Our price target of $43 is based on ~14x our FY17 (Jan. 2018) EPS estimate of $3.05, a P/E multiple consistent with the valuation of other [consumer electronic] retailers. \nTheStreet Rating: Buy, B TheStreet Said: TheStreet Ratings team rates BEST BUY CO INC as a Buy with a ratings score of B. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate BEST BUY CO INC (BBY) a BUY. This is driven by a few notable strengths, which we believe should have a greater impact than any weaknesses, and should give investors a better performance opportunity than most stocks we cover. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its increase in net income, revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, reasonable valuation levels and good cash flow from operations. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company has had somewhat disappointing return on equity.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The net income growth from the same quarter one year ago has greatly exceeded that of the S&P 500, but is less than that of the Specialty Retail industry average. The net income increased by 12.3% when compared to the same quarter one year prior, going from $146.00 million to $164.00 million. Despite its growing revenue, the company underperformed as compared with the industry average of 10.5%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues slightly increased by 0.8%. This growth in revenue appears to have trickled down to the company's bottom line, improving the earnings per share. The current debt-to-equity ratio, 0.35, is low and is below the industry average, implying that there has been successful management of debt levels. Net operating cash flow has significantly increased by 77.65% to $318.00 million when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, BEST BUY CO INC has also vastly surpassed the industry average cash flow growth rate of -1.75%.
