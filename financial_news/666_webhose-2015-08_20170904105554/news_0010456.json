The trade-weighted index gained to 69.82 from 69.67. \nInvestor sentiment improved after China's Shanghai Composite Index closed higher for the first time in six sessions with a 5.4 per cent gain on the previous close. That bolstered the outlook for global growth and pushed up currencies linked to commodities such as the kiwi, and weakened safe haven currencies like the yen. \nThe US dollar broadly strengthened after second-quarter gross domestic product was revised higher to an annual 3.7 per cent rate, ahead of expectations for 3.2 per cent. \n\"There has been a notable turn in market sentiment overnight, assisted by upward revisions to US Q2 GDP growth,\" BNZ strategist Kymberly Martin said in a note. \n\"In this backdrop, the US dollar has strengthened, but the prize for best performers goes to the 'commodity-linked' currencies. 'Safe haven' currencies have underperformed,\" she said. \nOn Friday, traders will be eyeing reports on Japanese and German inflation, and UK second-quarter GDP. This weekend, the focus will be comments and speeches from the annual Jackson Hole meeting of central bankers in the US. \nOn Friday morning the New Zealand dollar slipped to 90.04 Australian cents from A90.48c on Thursday, advanced to 57.40 euro cents from 56.68 cents, increased to 41.86 British pence from 41.52p, rose to 78.08 yen from 77.16 yen and gained to 4.1324 from 4.1242 yuan. \nNZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T00:35:27.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
