Bollore said he expected to know the result of the Sears contract in September. \nThe group posted second-quarter revenue of 565 million euros ($635 million) as growth accelerated in Europe, its biggest market. \nHavas, which is majority owned by French tycoon Vincent Bollore's eponymous group, has also benefited from the weaker euro, with exchange rates helping boost sales by 85.6 million euros in the first half. \nFor the first half, operating profit rose 22 percent to 128 million euros, lifting the operating margin to 12.3 percent from 12 percent a year earlier. \nHavas shares are up 7.4 percent this year, compared with a 9.6 percent rise in the European media stock index and a rise of 5.2 percent for larger rival Publicis. \n($1 = 0.8899 euros) (Additional reporting by Joseph Sotinel; Editing by Laurence Frost and Susan Fenton) Havas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T23:46:57.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
