Daniel Munoz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Greg Earl ANZ chief executive Mike Smith says the bank's $3 billion capital raising has provided more breathing space to recover the much larger amount of capital the bank has invested in its Asian bank investments.\nBut he has conceded the bank underestimated the reaction to its $3 billion raising – including a $500 million share purchase plan for retail investors – because it was not large for the bank, but is large by the standards of most Australian companies.\n\"For most companies in Australia that would have been a big offering, so perhaps that's why there was such a big reaction,\" Mr Smith told The Australian Financial Review in Papua New Guinea, where he is on a visit.\nMr Smith maintained that the raising was structured the way it was to be both efficient and provide a fair deal to the full range of shareholders.\nHe said the ANZ had tried to anticipate what the Commonwealth Bank would do with its own capital raising on Wednesday , and that when the dust had settled on the week's events, the ANZ approach would be seen as the right approach.\nHe said the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority requirement for more capital to be held against the ANZ's minority shareholdings in several Asian banks had raised extra questions for the ANZ amid general new pressure for more efficient capital management.\n\"I felt it was very important to get certainty into the market because there was so much uncertainty about it,\" he said.\nAsian sale will be 'considered' Mr Smith said the weakening growth outlook in much of Asia did not make the sale of the Asian partnership equity stakes any easier.\nBut he said the bank was \"not really worried too much because we are not seeking a market price but a strategic price\" stake deal for investments valued at about $5 billion.\nHe said the capital raising last week provided a more stable environment to unlock the Asian capital, but since they were all making good money, the ANZ was not going to get forced into a fire sale situation.\nStrategically they don't fit and we need to do something about them. But we will do it in a considered way.\"\nYuan devaluation not surprising Mr Smith said China's decision to devalue its currency was not surprising, given the way it had been dragged up relative to most other developing countries due to the rise of the United States dollar.\n\"This would have been uncomfortable for the Chinese,\" he said.\nHe said that as global liquidity tightened, many emerging market economy currencies would be under pressure and China would have been watching this carefully from a competitive point of view.\nHe added he was still confident the yuan would be fully convertible within three years but the precise timing would depend on how China dealt with non-performing loans in the banking system.\nGreg Earl was a guest of the ANZ in Port Moresby.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/100440329083596928444/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Greg__Earl"], "published": "2015-08-12T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:09:15.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
