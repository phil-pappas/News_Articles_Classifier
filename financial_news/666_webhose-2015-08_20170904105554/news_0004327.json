The introductory 2015 report supplies the industry’s first source of precise, data-driven residual values. Additionally, EquipmentWatch has launched a new consultative service to provide residual values solutions for large-scale customers, also a first in the industry.The premium report is included in the subscriptions of current EquipmentWatch Values subscribers, but is also purchasable by non-subscribers for $750. Residual values for construction, lift truck and agricultural equipment are estimated out to five years, and represent a percentage of current resale (FMV) and auction (FLV) value. The report also sets benchmarks and highlights the top three models by sales in 10 product categories (wheel loaders, crawler excavators, skid steers, crawler dozers, backhoes, pneumatic tire lift trucks, telescoping boom rough terrain lift trucks, balers, combines and mowers/shredders). Leading brands represented in the data include Caterpillar, Deere, Komatsu, Case, Clark, Toyota, JCB, Massey Ferguson, New Holland and Kubota. “With this report, EquipmentWatch builds on its 50-year history as the leading valuation supplier in the construction and lift equipment markets,” says Garrett Schemmel, managing director, EquipmentWatch. “Powered by the largest sales transaction database in the world, we process nearly $20 billion in transactions each month, supported by the industry’s largest team of analysts. The Residual Value report is our launching point into a deeper set of solutions for those needing reliable, future asset valuations, including the equipment finance, inland marine insurance, OEM remarketing and contractor (equipment manager) segments.” While the report covers 10 core equipment categories, EquipmentWatch also tracks more than 1,400 types of equipment and can create custom reports based on its proprietary database and ValueTrend Engine™.
