It's been a tough week for media stocks .Buffeted by more evidence of declining advertising revenue, New York-based Fox was plummeting 12% to $28.15 on Thursday, extending the company's 2015 decline to 27%.Eager for some good news, or at least some positive attention, Murdoch will turn to the first major Republican presidential debate Thursday evening, and a most unlikely source of salvation: Donald Trump. \nFox News, part of 21 st Century Fox's largest division, its cable television network segment, stands to gain ratings and exposure from viewers eager to see the lightning rod candidate. The real estate mogul has skyrocketed to the top of national GOP voter polls in just over a month, as media outlets have clamored to cover his every word. Fox News is the U.S. 24-hour cable news leader, ahead of Comcast's ( CMCSA ) MSNBC and Time Warner's ( TWX ) CNN. \n\"The fact that Donald Trump is involved in the debate is a boon for Fox News, with a much larger than average number of viewers expected,\" said Paul Sweeney, a senior media analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. \nOn Wednesday, 21 st Century Fox's quarterly report - coincidentally released the day before the debate - painted a sundry picture . While the company cited earnings per share of 39 cents, exceeding the 37 cents per share analysts had estimated, it raked in $6.21 billion in revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter compared to $8.42 billion in the same quarter a year ago. \nImportantly, though Fox's broadcast segment's revenue fell 4% to $987 million because of lower ratings for shows such as American Idol , and the filmed entertainment segment's revenue declined 32% to $1.91 billion, the cable TV segment home to Fox News posted a 7% increase in revenue to $3.57 billion. \n\"Fox News is a significant player in the news business,\" said Sweeney. \"This is a good time, with the debate, to promote their brand and on-air talent.\" Sweeney added that with media stocks down dramatically on Wednesday, \"Unfortunately, the whole media sector is under pressure these days.\" \nThat pressure stems partially from fear of \"cord-cutting\" cable subscribers dropping their traditional pay-TV services, enticed by online streaming options, or buying slimmer packages. Shares of Discovery Communications ( DISCA ) , Time Warner, CBS ( CBS ) and normally armor-clad Disney ( DIS ) on Wednesday tumbled following mixed earnings results and skittishness among investors. \nFox, CNN and MSNBC have all felt the blow of declining audience numbers, leaving room for outspoken Trump's involvement in Thursday's presidential debate in Ohio to bring new, younger and more diverse viewers to Fox News. A spokeswoman for Trump's campaign declined to comment and multiple calls to a publicist for Fox News weren't returned. \n\"For Fox, and for any cable news network, if they can exclusively own an event that's going to draw a lot of viewers, and they've had the opportunity to sell advertising time in advance, that's the golden ticket,\" said professor Gabriel Kahn , co-director of the media, economics and entrepreneurship program at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School. \nAccording to an April analysis by the Pew Research Center , the total median primetime audience for Fox News, CNN and MSNBC fell 8% in 2014 to 2.8 million viewers, and the three networks have dived 26% in primetime viewership since 2009. Fox News, however, lost only 1% of its primetime viewers in 2014, with 1.7 million tuning in. \nSince Trump announced his candidacy on June 16 in a speech calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and \"bringing crime\" to the U.S, leading to Univision, Comcast's ( CMCSA ) NBCUniversal and other companies cutting ties with him, media coverage of the former host of TV's long-running The Apprentice has been constant and dominant, coinciding with his surge in GOP voter polls. \nA July analysis of news coverage of presidential hopefuls by John Sides, an associate political science professor at George Washington University, and Lynn Vavreck, a University of California Los Angeles political science professor, found that Trump has continued to attract 20 to 30% of news coverage of candidates including Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Ted Cruz. Those five, plus Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul and John Kasich, make up Thursday's primetime debate roster. \n\"The entire Republican presidential field would be boring and staid if there wasn't such an iconoclast as Trump in the middle of it,\" said Kahn. \"His strategy has been to dominate media headlines by saying preposterous things, and it's worked beautifully. The media also has been complicit in it.\" \nVavreck pointed out that the debate itself could elicit \"aha!\" and \"oops\" moments from other candidates, potentially switching attention away from Trump. \"Will someone else emerge as the leader?\" she asked. \"If so, you'll see Trump's coverage go down, and poll numbers will reflect that.\" \nKahn's take possibly reflects those tuning in Thursday night not for politics, but for sheer Trump-ed up entertainment. \n\"I plan on watching the debate not as a political event, but as spectacle, because of Trump,\" said Kahn. \"Nobody expects him to be the actual candidate, and do anything more than keep this entertaining and possibly screw it up for the rest of the pack.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
