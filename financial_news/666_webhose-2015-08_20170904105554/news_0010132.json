Bloomberg Stephen Wong, senior portfolio manager at Mutual Trust, which runs family offices for some of Australia's wealthiest individuals and families, says the firm's clients have been increasing their weightings of international equities for the past five years.\n\"We feel that the combination of the best quality companies, acquired at reasonable valuations and diversified across markets, is likely to generate stronger risk adjusted returns,\" Wong says.\n\"Most sophisticated investors are familiar with the shortcomings of the Australian market, such as the significant index concentration towards a small number of industries and stocks; the lack of widespread access to attractive industries such as technology and healthcare, and the valuation premiums that Australian stocks command compared to their international peers.\"\n30 per cent returns Mutual Trust's model international portfolio has produced Australian-dollar-based returns of over 30 per cent a year for the past three years.\nWong notes that the Australian share market represents only 3 per cent of global equity market capitalisation, and says limiting equity investments to the ASX alone is like playing golf with only a driver and a putter. \"Whilst it is possible to score well, it is much more likely that consistent, strong out-performance will be achieved with a full set of clubs,\" he says.\nWith a heavy weighting towards resources and financial stocks, the Australian market does not offer the same sorts of opportunities as other markets to invest in other sectors, such as technology and manufacturing.\nNor does it offer opportunities in economies with better growth prospects than Australia's.\nMark Newman, executive director and chief investment officer at K2 Asset Management, expects a modest performance from local equities as weaker commodity prices, and potentially weaker commodity export volumes in the future, put pressure on the economy.\n\"With the economy and earnings growth slowing and the interest rates cycle somewhere near a low point, the Australian equity market is looking somewhat tired and without obvious positive catalysts,\" he says. Global equities offer exposure to parts of the world which are growing more quickly than Australia, he says.\nWhile he is a little cautious about the US stocks in the short-term ahead of the US Federal Reserve resuming interest rate hikes, Newman is a \"long-term believer\" in the US market relative to the other major developed economies of Europe and Japan. K2 will take advantage of dips and corrections in the market to increase its US positions.\nBull markets \"We still think the American economy is in a secular up-phase. It's going to be a long period of economic expansion in America in our view, but generally you'll get 10 per cent corrections in equity bull markets. We haven't seen a 10 per cent correction in America for more than six years, which is unusual,\" he says.\nOn specific stocks, Newman says that as a content producer and theme park owner, Walt Disney will benefit from the recovery in US consumers' disposable incomes and the wealth effect of rising property and share prices, and it is also tapped into opportunities outside of America through its theme parks in China and France.\nNewman is also positive on China, which despite the slowdown from the stratospheric growth of a few years ago, remains the world's second-largest economy. He has taken advantage of the sell off in Chinese stocks as a result of the recent currency devaluation to increase holdings, particularly into Air China, China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, which will benefit from lower fuel prices and the increasing numbers of Chinese travelling abroad.\nGreg Smith, head of research at Fat Prophets, says that European markets could outperform the United States because the region is a couple of years behind the US in terms of monetary stimulus. \"Economies that are a bit behind the eight ball in terms of their stimulus programs and their economy is at ironically can probably enjoy better equity market returns over the next 12 months,\" he says. \"I think you should see some pretty decent returns coming through from Europe.\"\nInvestors can buy quality companies such as Louis Vuitton-maker LVMH, BMW and Volkswagen. \"The key point is obviously diversification, which enables to you to reduce risk but doesn't necessarily reduce your return outlook. In fact, it can arguably improve it,\" Smith says.\nMutual Trust's Stephen Wong says the firm invests in international equities based on global megatrends. One such trend is the global shift away from cash-based payments. Even in developed markets over 50 per cent of payments are still made in cash and the corresponding figure is 90 per cent in emerging markets. The best risk-adjusted way to take advantage of the trend is by investing in payments companies Visa and Mastercard, which are both US-listed, he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T04:03:15.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
