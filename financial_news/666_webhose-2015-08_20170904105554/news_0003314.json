It's a real pity,\" he said.\nMr O'Hoy also said he had some misgivings about APU's corporate strategy as it started expanding into dairy products.\nBut one area where he has the utmost confidence is the craft beer market, which continues to accelerate and is causing serious headaches for the company he used to run. Foster's Group, which makes Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught, was acquired in 2011 for $11 billion by SABMiller, which along with Japanese firm Kirin's Lion beer business is battling a mainstream beer market which is shrinking as drinkers turn more toward premium and craft beers.\nMr O'Hoy has a small shareholding in Byron Bay-based craft brewer Stone & Wood, where he is also a director, and says it is thriving as the craft beer market booms.\n\"People are drinking less and they're drinking better,\" he says.\nHe says Stone & Wood has been able to lift both sales revenue and profits by more than 100 per cent over each of the past three years. The broader craft beer market would continue to grow at a rate of more than 10 to 15 per cent.\n\"It's a real issue for the big commercial brewers,\" he says. \"There's been a huge shift under way and it's getting faster.\"\nMr O'Hoy, who was chief executive of Foster's from 2004 to 2008, says consumer confidence in Australia seems to be subdued. \"It's very fragile,\" he says.\nTaking the healthy option But parts of the market, such as health and well-being, are still strong since people are prepared to spend money on their health and fitness.\nMr O'Hoy is executive chairman in Australia of vitamins group Swisse Wellness and says there is solid momentum in the business. One of the over-arching trends driving sales in the vitamins market at a retail level is large volumes of vitamins being purchased by Chinese expatriates in Australia, who send them to relatives and friends in China.\n\"People in the vitamins space have been the beneficiaries of it.\"\nThis has come about because of a lack of confidence in the quality and manufacturing practices of some China-based health food and vitamin supplement makers. Some people in China prefer the vitamins made by companies in the Western world. Those perceptions had been fuelled in part by scandals involving contaminated milk powder in China.\nASX-listed Blackmores, one of Australia's biggest vitamin and natural health foods groups, has experienced an extraordinary rise in its share price in the past 12 months from $27 to $87, giving it a market capitalisation of $1.5 billion. Analysts have pointed to Chinese expatriates' buying vitamins in Australia as a major reason.\nSwisse has recruited a number of Australian sporting stars and celebrities to front its marketing campaigns including former Test cricket captain Ricky Ponting, actor Nicole Kidman, and restaurant owner and judge on Network Ten's Master Chef program, George Calombaris.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:00:43.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
