The eastern European nation’s bonds fell for a third day.\nThe comments suggest the gap between the two sides remains wide as time runs out to reach a deal before the first bond matures on Sept. 23. Ukraine’s Finance Ministry said yesterday it wants bondholders represented at the “highest level” at a meeting in London on Thursday, calling this week “decisive” in reaching a $19 billion restructuring deal.\nAccording to the person, holding a high-level direct meeting would be premature with just 48 hours notice given the geographically disperse nature of the committee’s membership. Franklin Templeton, Ukraine’s biggest bondholder, is based in San Mateo, California.\nThe other members of the group, which owns about $8.9 billion of Ukraine’s Eurobonds, are BTG Pactual Europe LLP, TCW Investment Management Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.\nUkraine’s finance ministry wasn’t immediately available for comment.\nWhile the two sides have held direct meetings since signing confidentiality agreements last month, they still need to bridge their differences on the size of a principal reduction needed to meet the country’s restructuring targets under a $17.5 billion International Monetary Fund loan.\nUkraine asked creditors for a 40 percent principal reduction in June, a person with knowledge of the offer said at the time. Last week, the bondholder group proposed a 5 percent so-called haircut, the first time it’s accepted to take losses on its holdings, a separate person said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:45:24.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
