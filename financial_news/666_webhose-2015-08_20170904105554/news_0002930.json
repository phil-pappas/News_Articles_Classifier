Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent contraction. \nAccording to the new figures, the Greek economy posted zero growth in the first quarter of the year after having contracted 0.2 percent in the last quarter of 2014 -- thus averting two periods of decline that would constitute a recession. \nThe figures showed second quarter growth up 1.4 percent compared with the same period the previous year. \n\"Greece's GDP figures for Q2 brought some rare good news, but they relate to an entirely different economy than the one currently being strangled by capital controls,\" said economist Jonathan Loynes at research firm Capital Economics. \n\"But the figures do not change our view that the economic assumptions built into the bailout plan are likely to prove far too optimistic,\" he said. \nThe data comes as Greek lawmakers hold an emergency parliament session Thursday for a crucial vote on ratifying a hurriedly concluded bailout deal, but Germany -- Europe's de facto paymaster -- has cast doubt on the agreement. \nGreece and its creditors are under pressure to finalise the 85 billion euro ($94.8 billion) deal by August 20 when Athens must repay some 3.4 billion euros to the European Central Bank. \nIn New York, Wall Street stocks wobbled on Thursday after US data showed a solid gain in retail sales and a modest uptick in jobless claims. \nAfter earlier falling US shares rallied around mid-day in New York, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.16 percent at 17,431.14 points. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 edged up 0.05 percent to 2,087.01 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.20 percent to 5,054.35. \n\"This market continues to find difficulty in knowing what to think with so many mixed-up signals from the economic data, central banks, earnings, and the market behaviour itself,\" said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. \nOverall US retail sales rose 0.6 percent in July from June to $446.5 billion, a slightly bigger increase than the 0.5 percent gain projected by analysts, according to the Commerce Department. \nThe US Department of Labor reported that jobless claims rose by 5,000 to 274,000 in the week ending August 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:52:43.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
