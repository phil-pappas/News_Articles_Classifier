The regulation is primarily focused on reducing outdoor irrigation by residents and does not apply to industrial or agricultural operations.\n\"Californians' response to the severity of the drought this summer is now in high gear and shows that they get that we are in the drought of our lives,\" said Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board.\n\"This isn't your mother's drought or your grandmother's drought, this is the drought of the century,\" she said.\nDozens of communities reduced water use more than 15 percent beyond their conservation standards in July, while just four missed their target. The four were the cities of Livingston, Hanford, Blythe and the Phelan Pinon Hills Community Services District.\nThe State Water Board has sent compliance orders to nine suppliers that missed their targets in either June or July. The board has not yet levied fines for non-compliance, preferring to work with those communities to help enhance their performance, officials said during a conference call with reporters.
