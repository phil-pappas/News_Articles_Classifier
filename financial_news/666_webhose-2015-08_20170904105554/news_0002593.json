It also halted a drop in viewership across the networks owned by Discovery Communications Inc. DISCA, +2.45% according to Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente.\nThis year’s edition of “Shark Week” attracted an average 1.27 million viewers, according to data from Nielsen. That broke the 2013 record of an average 1.20 million per program.\n“Shark Week” first aired in 1988 and has been so successful that Discovery pronounced 2015 the “Summer of the Shark.” and is adding a weekend edition in August for the first time.\n“The question is always: How do you keep ‘Shark Week’ fresh and new after 27 years?,” said Howard Swartz, vice president of production and development at Discovery Channel. “As tech and science keeps improving, it begs new questions of the researchers and scientists and allows us to follow them as they find those answers. I think the more we learn about sharks, the more interested people become in them.”\nTotal daytime ratings for Discovery Channel jumped 61% in July from a year earlier, thanks in part to “Shark Week,” DiClemente said.\nIn addition to Discovery Channel, Discovery Communications also owns TLC, Animal Planet, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, Science Channel, among others. TLC’s hits have included the recently canceled “19 Kids and Counting” as well as reality shows like “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,” “Jon and Kate Plus Eight” and “Say Yes to the Dress.”\n“Though TLC ratings remain down,” DiClemente wrote in a note, “positive underlying trends at several of [Discovery’s] networks contributed to 15% and 11% year-over-year ratings growth at [Discovery’s] portfolio of networks in prime-time and total day, respectively.”\nWhile Discovery Channel saw its ratings improve in July, cable ratings across the board fell 11% year-over-year in total daytime and prime-time viewership. DiClemente said the second half of 2015 should yield lighter year-over-year comparisons for the cable industry.\n“The pace of declines has moderated slightly and we are hopeful that upcoming easier year-over-year comparables will produce more encouraging ratings trends going forward,” he wrote. Though if ratings don’t improve, he said domestic ad revenue growth could be at risk.\nShares of Nasdaq-listed Discovery Communications are down 4% so far this year. The Nasdaq Composite is up 8.5%.\nMore shark news on MarketWatch: Watch Australian surfer Mick Fanning’s escape from shark attack during South Africa competition How ‘Jaws’ went viral in the 1970s", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:41:42.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
