He added, 'This time round the Authority has adopted the face-to-face method of education to ensure more understanding and compliance'. \nHe appealed to participants to be more interactive through asking questions and sharing of ideas to increase their understanding and sense of responsibility, as well as moral obligation towards tax payment. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:09:05.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
