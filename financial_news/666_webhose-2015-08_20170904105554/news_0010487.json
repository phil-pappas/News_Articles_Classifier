The fibro-and-iron house last sold for $1.3 million in 2011.\nSelling agent Jim Henneberryâ€‹, from Jan Ford Real Estate, said the offer was in the \"asking range\" and was subject to finance.\nThe property at 18 Edgar Street, Port Hedland, became synonymous with the mining investment downturn after agents struggled to offload it. Once valued at $1.3 million , its asking price was revised several times and it was even passed in at auction at $360,000 earlier in 2015.\nBut just four years ago the property was in hot demand. It is near port operations in one of the world's busiest export hubs and has long been earmarked for commercial redevelopment.\nThe formerly tremendous price rises and yields were caused largely by a shortage of housing stock in mining and port towns across the country that were suddenly inundated by resources project workers employed to make the most of a commodity price boom.\nBut as demand for workers subsided in line with falling commodity prices and resources companies got their worker camps up and running demand for housing in the former boom mining towns evaporated.\nThere are 97 houses, apartments and parcels of land listed for sale in Port Hedland and 107 listed for rent.\n Advertised weekly rents had dropped from more than $2500 in the port town in 2012 to less than $700, the Pilbara Development Commission said.\nThe resources investment downturn has engulfed towns near large iron ore and gas projects, such as Newman and Karratha respectively, at export centres such as Port Hedland, and coal towns in Queensland's Galilee Basin such as Moranbah and Dysart .\nThe advertised weekly rent in Newman was just more than $600 now, compared to a high of $2200 three years ago, the Pilbara Development Commission's June quarter housing report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:09:18.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
