Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jacob Greber The Abbott government's budget challenge is more urgent and more severe than people think given many proposals for economic reform are likely to take many years to generate dividends, say two of the country's leading economists.\nRoss Garnaut, from Melbourne University, and former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson both cautioned that time is running out for action, with the nation looking down the barrel of real falls in living standards and the equivalent of losing a recession's worth of growth.\nSlamming complacency among unions and businesses buoyed by improving labour productivity data, Professor Garnaut warned that even modest productivity growth won't be enough to fire-proof the budget.\nCiting research by Victoria University's Centre of Policy Studies economist Janine Dixon – which anticipates productivity growth may average just 0.5 per cent in coming years – Professor Garnaut said no other advanced economy has suffered as long and large a drop in multi-factor productivity growth, a broad measure of how capital and labour is utilised across the economy and gauge of living standards.\nFormer Treasury head Martin Parkinson: \"Unless we actually grab this challenge by the horns and really get concrete about what are the priority issues, we are actually going to find ourselves sleepwalking into a real mess.\" Louie Douvis \"If you substitute Janine's view on productivity growth in the forward estimates, we don't have a miraculous budget surplus in 2020s, we just get ever increasing budget deficits,\" he told the National Reform Summit in Sydney on Wednesday .\nThe remarks are the latest challenge to the federal government's core budget assumptions, which anticipate growth will rebound strongly in the later part of this decade, pushing the budget to surplus early next decade.\nSpeaking at a session alongside Professor Garnaut on the national productivity challenge, Dr Parkinson called for an urgent review of the nation's main fiscal and economic reform priorities, given that many of the pay offs from any changes will take a long time to emerge.\n\"Unless we grab this challenge by the horns and really get concrete about what are the issues … we're going to find ourselves sleep-walking into a real mess,\" he said.\n Ross Garnaut warned Australians \"don't be fooled\" by recent improvements in labour productivity, which have been boosted by hundreds of billions in capital investments, largely across the resources sector. Louie Douvis The former Treasury secretary estimates that if the nation's potential growth has fallen to 2.5 per cent from just over three – a possibility canvassed in recent months by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens – Australia's economy will be around 5 per cent smaller than otherwise.\n\"It's akin to us willingly accepting the impact of a recession over a decade,\" he said.\nProfessor Garnaut warned Australians \"don't be fooled\" by recent improvements in labour productivity, which have been boosted by hundreds of billions in capital investments, largely across the resources sector.\n\"The problem is more urgent and more severe, and all the [proposed] solutions are long-term solutions,\" he said.\n'More urgent and more severe' Both sets of remarks sought to underscore the magnitude of the looming fiscal challenge, with the falling terms of trade refocusing debate on the need to restore productivity growth as a way of boosting both household and government incomes.\nAged Discrimination Commissioner Susan Ryan called for a fresh emphasis on increasing workforce participation among older Australians, given research shows even a 3 per cent increase could boost gross domestic product by more than $30 billion.\n\"Clearly we can manage a lot of the issues by looking at the barriers to increasing mature-age employment,\" she said.\nBusiness Council of Australia chairman Catherine Livingstone suggested mobilising Australia's PHD students to create small businesses as a way of accelerating innovation – something that has occurred overseas.\nChifley Research Centre executive director Michael Cooney challenged the notion that without additional incentives for workers, labour productivity was unlikely to improve further.\n\"If wages fall as productivity rises, that won't work,\" he said.\nEconomist Henry Ergas said how Australia uses its capital stock – which has grown 75 per cent over the past 15 years – would be the most important determinant of living standards going forward.\nThis would involve squeezing as much out of labour productivity as possible and reversing the boom-era trend of companies using rising commodity prices to \"buy their way out of trouble\" with the industrial relations system.\n\"Addressing the distortions the IR system creates to allow the efficient use of our capital stock will be the greatest single challenge that we face,\" he said.\nJournalist at The Australian , Paul Kelly, who chaired the productivity session, said the discussion had highlighted the \"sheer magnitude\" of the nation's productivity task.\n\"Because there's no silver bullet with productivity and it's essentially about an economy-wide culture and debate, perhaps we should be looking more at the decision making process and building in more of a productivity test\" for governments.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-26T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:08:44.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
