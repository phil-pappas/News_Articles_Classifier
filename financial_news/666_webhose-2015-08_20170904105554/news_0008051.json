AP Share on twitter by John McDuling It was another seismic week in global business.\nIn possibly the only exciting bond market story ever, Apple raised money in Australia's corporate debt market .\nChina's stockmarket tumbled. Vietnam's Dong got dinged . So did other emerging market currencies. Qantas actually made a profit and Ashley Madison was hacked .\nBut if you look at only one chart to sum up what's happened in the world economy this week, make it this one.\nOil prices are tanking Oil. Black gold, Texas Tea, whatever you want to call it, has been sinking .\nAt the time of writing on Friday afternoon (AEST), the oil price was hovering just above the $US40 a mark. It has fallen nearly 60 per cent over the past year, and hasn't been this low since 2009.\nOil is such a crucial component of the global economy.\nThere is plenty of good literature on the internet explaining its slide. The simplest an easiest explanation is that there is much more supply than demand.\n OPEC, the cartel that dominates the global oil market, hasn't been willing to cut production for fear of losing market share to countries like Russia, Canada and the US. Meanwhile, demand is actually waning in developed economies, which broadly speaking, are becoming more energy efficient, as well as in China, the world's largest importer of oil, whose economy just keeps looking weaker .\nWhat the net effect of a weak oil price is on the global economy is less clear. In theory it is good news for consumers and anyone who drives a car, but it's not good news for the oil industry, which is a big employer and a big spender on things like machinery and equipment.\nIn a local context, the weak oil price has claimed at least one major scalp, with the resignation of Santos CEO David Knox on Friday at least tangentially related.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-soars-to-975m-profit-on-back-of-cost-cutting-cheaper-fuel-20150819-gj2evv.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/china/china-august-factory-activity-shrinks-to-6year-low-as-orders-tumble-20150821-gj4jeb.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/oneyear-oil-at-10year-low-with-no-respite-in-sight-20150819-gj399g.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/business/energy-environment/oil-prices.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/apple-kangaroo-bond-orders-exceed-3b-20150820-gj4cnq.html", "https://twitter.com/@jmcduling", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/vietnam-s-central-bank-devalues-dong-for-third-time-this-year", "http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/consumer-security/ashley-madison-hack-top-cheating-suburbs-in-melbourne-and-sydney-revealed-20150821-gj4iud.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/energy/santos-firsthalf-profit-drops-82pc-as-lower-oil-lng-prices-bite-20150820-gj42yn.html"], "published": "2015-08-21T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T12:52:57.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
