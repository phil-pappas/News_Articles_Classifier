Bloomberg Share on twitter by Ruth Liew The Australian Securities Exchange has granted billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway poll position in any future capital raisings by Insurance Australia Group, which has raised the hackles of some investors, and proxy adviser group Ownership Matters.\nIAG, which has one of the biggest shareholder bases of companies listed on the local exchange, was granted a waiver that would permit Berkshire anti-dilution rights for its shares in the insurer.\nThe initial deal between IAG and Berkshire, which saw the insurance giant sign away 20 per cent of its business to the US group, was announced in June but not many investors were aware of the waiver. Information about the anti-dilution rights were buried in an appendix 3B notice and the ASX revealed information about the conditions on its waiver register in August.\nIn a note to clients, proxy adviser group Ownership Matters argued, \"The subscription agreement also reveals that IAG has agreed to give NICO [a Berkshire Hathaway business] a privileged 'insider' position on any future capital raisings, including consultation in relation to NICO's participation in any issue and sub-underwriting and cornerstone opportunities.\"\n\"ASX has granted the waiver on the basis that its policy 'permits listed entities to enter into agreements of this nature with shareholders with whom the entity has a strategic relationship provided that the shareholder pays the same price as other offerees in an issue of securities',\" the document said.\nDean Paatsch, director at Ownership Matters, said it highlighted the issue of proper company disclosure, and he questioned the basis of the ASX's processes in the granting of \"special waivers\" to companies.\n\"It's a great concern that the ASX itself assesses whether a strategic agreement will render benefits to the business in perpetuity,\" he said.\n'Not good enough' \"The ASX subsequently disclosed the waiver they've given but that is really not good enough â€“ this is clearly material that is of value to investors and ought to be disclosed at the time [of the deal's announcement],\" he added.\nOne institutional investor, who declined to be named, said he was only recently made aware of the waiver and he was unhappy with the arrangement.\n\"It would annoy me. There was a lot of discussions asking does this put them in an inside position, and this adds to the cosiness of the deal,\" he said.\nBut another institutional investor said he was unfazed by the deal. \"As long as Berkshire Hathaway bought shares at the same price as other investors, I'm not too worried about it,\" he said.\nUnder the 10-year quota share arrangement, IAG would enjoy a $700 million reduction in its capital requirements, and $500 million that it could use for further expansion, among others. Berkshire in turn would get access to revenue from IAG, a 3.7 per cent stake in the company, about $2.3 billion of reinsurance placed each year, and funds to redeploy into the market.\nASX spokesman Matthew Gibbs said the waiver register's policy permitted \"listed entities to enter into agreements of this nature with shareholders with whom the entity has a strategic relationship, provided that the shareholder pays the same price as other offerees in an issue of securities. The strategic relationship must encompass more than the investor simply being a major shareholder or source of equity capital.\"\n12 waivers granted The ASX had granted 12 waivers in the past 12 months, including recently to Aurelia Metals, Clancy Exploration and Ensogo Limited.\nBerkshire bought into IAG through a share placement. The company is permitted to request a waiver under the rules.\nIt is also standard practice at IAG to contact all of its institutional investors during a capital raising to give them the opportunity to participate. If Berkshire Hathaway wanted to buy IAG shares, they would have to do so at the same price as its investor peers.\nA spokeswoman from IAG said, \"With any large shareholders or institutions, they would be given an opportunity to participate in any future capital raising which they can choose to take up or choose not to. This is standard procedure.\"\nNo other investor on IAG's shareholder list has been granted the waiver.\nIAG shares have lost 6 per cent in the past year, compared with a 4 per cent fall in the S&P/ASX200 index. The stock closed at $5.83 on Friday, down from a 12-month high of $6.59 hit in May.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-08-16T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:09:20.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
