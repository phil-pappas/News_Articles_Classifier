The club, which boasts two 18-hole golf courses designed by Tony Cashmore and Jack Nicklaus is also undergoing management troubles.\nAdvertisement The Alter family's Austpac Group of Companies took over the 96-room Yarra Valley Lodge after its previous owner, the Golden Heritage Golf, went into receivership in January 2014. The Lodge's hotel rooms are owned by individual investors in the Heritage Lodge Investment Scheme, set up in 2002. APIC is one of the room owners and Austpac was appointed the responsible entity for the scheme in July 2011.\nMr Boerkamp, who has launched the legal action, was also a shareholder and director of Austpac Group of Companies until late last year. He had worked for the Alter family since the 1990s but resigned from a host of related companies last August.\nIn a recent court hearing, counsel for APIC, Suresh Senathirajah​, alleged a settlement deed between Austpac Funds Management and the room owners required AFM to terminate the current hotel management agreement and sell the management lot to the owners. The moment when Golden Heritage Golf went into receivership is alleged to be the tipping point which triggered the sale.\nWhile AFM had offered to sell the room owners the management lot for $2 million in March, it was still attached to the hotel management agreement and was only worth $1.7 million, Mr Senathirajah said.\nPeter Collinson QC, representing Austpac Funds Management, said the sale to Mantra was in the interests of the room owners.\nThe Austpac Group of Companies flagged a winding up of its property portfolio late last year. Its websites are inactive and many of its assets sold. The management rights to the Ballarat Lodge, part of its hotels and resorts arm, has been sold the Bentley Property Group.\nJustice Jennifer Davies is expected to make a decision on the matter later in the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:35:06.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
