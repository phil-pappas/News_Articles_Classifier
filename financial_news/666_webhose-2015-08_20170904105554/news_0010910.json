These devices are designed to prompt the setting of personal health goals, then track your progress and keep you motivated.\nSubscribe to Money’s weekly newsletter , delivered to your inbox every Wednesday Behaviours encouraged by your Fitbit can also be applied to your financial life.\nThe combination of goal setting, supervision and reward have proved very successful in encouraging sustained behavioral change and improved health.\nAdvertisement Importantly, it's not the big things which have most impact — a herculean effort of 40,000 steps today followed by many days of inactivity achieves very little. It's the small, regular actions integrated into daily life where the power lies.\nUsing the stairs instead of taking the lift, getting off one stop early and walking the rest of the way, standing up for some of the work day may seem trivial but sustained over time deliver big health benefits.\nBehaviours encouraged by your Fitbit can also be applied to your financial life and developing positive money habits is the cornerstone of financial success. As with health, you can waste a lot of time and take on lots of risk looking for the financial 'silver bullet' — the one investment or windfall which will make you rich.\nThe reality is that doing small things regularly over a long period of time it is much more powerful. The boring things such as spending less than you earn, paying off all your credit card every month, making extra mortgage repayments or salary sacrificing into super will ultimately be more rewarding than endlessly searching for the next Apple to invest in.\nThis is not only because the boring approach harnesses the amazing power of compounding, but it also build positive money behaviours. Self-regulation becomes even more important when you have lots of money, demonstrated by the multitude of lottery winners who squander it all.\nSo building effective money management habits, particularly if you start early in life, not only helps you create wealth, but also gives you the tools to keep it.\nJust like health, staying on track financially can be hard and we don't yet have a financial equivalent to a Fitbit. However your spouse, a friend, accountant or financial planner can be just as effective in helping you articulate your goals and keep you accountable to achieving them.\nWho you choose is less important than ensuring your goals are clear, measurable and prompts you pause to celebrate successes along the way to keep you motivated.\nSo remember:\nIt's the small, repeated actions rather than the big one offs which get you to your money goals. Break down big financial goals to sustainable daily, weekly, monthly actions. Share your goals with someone who will hold you accountable and celebrate the achievement of milestones along the way.
