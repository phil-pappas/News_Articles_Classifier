Revenue declined 33.4 percent to USD74.1 billion.\n\nThe results reflected the impact of a big drop in oil prices in the April-June period to a range of about USD45-USD60 per barrel, compared to over USD90 a barrel for the same period a year ago.\n\nEarnings in the upstream business dived about 75 percent to USD2 billion.
