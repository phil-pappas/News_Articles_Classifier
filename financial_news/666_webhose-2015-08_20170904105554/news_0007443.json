Now, the international data is really scary, and therefore the Fed has lost the opportunity when it had some alignment.\"\nChina, the world's second-biggest economy, showed weaker-than-expected growth in factory output, investment and retail sales in July. Economic growth in the euro zone slowed in the second quarter as France stagnated and Italy lost momentum, data released Aug. 14 showed.\nFed officials widely agreed last month the economy was nearing the point where interest rates should move higher, but worried that lagging inflation and a weak global economy posed too big a risk to commit to \"lift-off,\" according to minutes of the Fed's July policy meeting released on Wednesday.\nTraders scaled back bets the Fed would raise rates in September after the minutes.
