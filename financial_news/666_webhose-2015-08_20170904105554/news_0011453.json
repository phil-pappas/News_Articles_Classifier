Since Moments is optimised for syncing speed, it doesn't upload the full-res version, but rather a high-res version around the same size as a photo you would upload to Facebook.\" \nAudience \nThough the Moments app will run parallel to Facebook, it sports a number of features that makes it easy to share galleries with friends. \n\"Because Moments leverages the same facial recognition technology that's available on Facebook today, Moments lets you easily choose the right friends with whom to give and get photos, in a way that only Facebook can. Now you can effortlessly sync multiple photos with friends and the photos you didn't take,\" said Ruben. \nA Pew Centre report found that in the US, 72% of online adults use Facebook, with 70% of those classified as \"highly engaged\" because they log on daily. \nThe social media website reported in July that its audience has grown to 1.49 billion users, dwarfing rivals Pinterest (31%) and Twitter (23%). \nRuben said that the lessons learnt from Moments would impact in future Facebook features. \n\"Moments is a Facebook Creative Labs app that we developed to solve a particular problem: making it easier to give and get photos from friends.
