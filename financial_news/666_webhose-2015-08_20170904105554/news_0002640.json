How to shop for a student account \nGiven that most students will spend much of their degree courses 'in the red', the first thing to look for in a student bank account is a generous interest-free overdraft. \nThe best accounts offer fee-free, interest-free overdrafts of up to £3,000. However, this upper limit usually only applies to year three (or year four if your degree's a year longer), so it starts off lower and then rises with each academic year. \nAlso, you must understand that you may not get the maximum overdraft advertised, as your individual limit will be based on your credit score. However, some banks do guarantee to give you this upper limit, so always check whether the overdraft limit on offer with the student bank account is 'guaranteed' or only 'up to'. \nDon't be tempted to exceed your overdraft limit without permission. Remember, it's a limit , not a target – and you must pay back all this borrowed money one day. If you do go overdrawn without permission, then you could be charged sky-high rates of interest, plus painful penalties of up to £30 per transaction on top. \nAfter 0% overdrafts, the next features to consider are credit interest rates (how much you'll be paid when your balance is above zero) and freebies, gifts and other incentives. \nConvenience does also play a part, with many students signing up to banks which have branches or cashpoints on campus. The latest student bank account deals \nHere's what's on offer to students today. \nWe've ranked them based on a combination of any credit interest rate, free overdraft limit and incentives offered, but bear in mind that these may not be the most important factors for you.
