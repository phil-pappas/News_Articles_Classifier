That caused a spike in the number of cancellations of trips by Chinese and Japanese tourists.”\nThe MERS outbreak is estimated to have brought an 80% drop in international tourist bookings to Korea, worth over $90 million in travel sales.\nAsiana’s second-quarter revenue was down 8% to KRW1.3 trillion from KRW1.4 trillion, resulting in an operating loss of KRW 61.4 billion, reversed from an operating profit of KRW3 billion a year ago.\nPassenger revenue also fell 7.7% from the corresponding period in 2014, while cargo revenue fell 13.5%. The airline attributed poor cargo sales mainly to a slump in European business.\nIn the first half, the South Korean carrier reported a net loss of KRW25.8 billion, narrowed from a 2014 first-half net loss of KRW 58.3 billion.\nThe airline recently committed to a 25-strong $2.83 billion A320neo order from Airbus, to be used to expand its domestic network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:39:39.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
