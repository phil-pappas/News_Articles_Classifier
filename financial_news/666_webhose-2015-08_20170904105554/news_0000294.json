This highlights the need for leasing agents to maintain strong occupier relations.\nLandlords are increasingly demanding more from their agents, and rightly so.\nAgents cannot simply rely on reactive deals or inquiries. They must be active in the market on all fronts, including the provision of detailed financial analysis and having a deep understanding of market trends and occupier drivers (such as the emergence of activity-based working environments and the calling for more efficient interactive space), while providing the highest level of customer care and attention.\nIn any negotiation, if the agent doesn't have a win-win approach, it will affect not just his or her future business, but also that of the client. In a property market the size of Sydney, news travels fast, so a positive start with a no surprises and total transparency in all dealings are crucial.\nThe level of attention given to occupiers is also being elevated as landlords, agents and tenant representatives compete for their business. Even though agents are instructed by owners, it is imperative to foster strong bonds with occupiers: without the occupier; there can be no transaction.\nAgents are also increasingly competing with property portals as the offering becomes more sophisticated and intuitive. Therefore, demonstrating the added value an agent can bring to the leasing process is vital.\nThe question is, will our industry step up and deliver the new breed of leasing agent required to meet the market demands of the profession?\nRobin Brinkman is an associate director of office leasing at Knight Frank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:10:37.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
