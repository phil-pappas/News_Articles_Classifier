Long Lake produces around 50,000 bpd of bitumen, which is upgraded on site into refinery-ready synthetic crude.\nLight synthetic crude from the oil sands for September delivery jumped to a one-month high of $1 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, rallying hard from $4.50 per barrel below WTI on Friday.\nVolumes in the Canadian crude market were thin, adding to volatility, as the market is outside the nearly three-week-long trading window - from the first of each month until the day before pipelines nominations are due - in which the bulk of activity takes place.\nCanadian Oil Sands said the fire damaged equipment at its processing facility. It occurred in the interconnecting piping between the hydrotreating units and environmental units at Syncrude's Mildred Lake upgrader.\nThe main coker conversion units were not damaged and Syncrude continues to operate. However, the company suspended synthetic crude oil production and is developing a recovery plan, COS said in a statement late on Sunday.\nSyncrude produced 326,000 bpd in July but has averaged 261,500 bpd so far this year following a major turnaround in the second quarter.\nNexen was ordered to shut in pipelines on Friday at its Long Lake project because of safety issues identified following a large bitumen emulsion spill in July.\nNexen said on Saturday it will provide more information about the impact of the suspension as it becomes available.\nNexen is also a partner in the Syncrude joint venture. Other partners are Suncor Energy Inc, Imperial Oil Ltd , Nippon Oil subsidiary Mocal Energy Ltd, Murphy Oil Corp and China's Sinopec.
