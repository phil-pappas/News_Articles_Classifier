He said that Oshkosh Corp. is “going to come back.” \nOlstein warned against investing in exchange-traded funds. \n“Unless you’re doing the research on the stocks within them, you’re taking a risk,” he said. \nWhile the overall market isn’t in a bubble, certain market segments including social media, biotechnology and some of the technology sector are in bubbles, Olstein said. Valuations for Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are too high, he said. \n“Wall Street Week” is produced by SkyBridge Media, an affiliate of SkyBridge Capital, the fund-of-funds business founded by Anthony Scaramucci. SkyBridge, which sometimes has other business relationships with the show’s participants, advertisers and sponsors, pays Fox stations in key markets to broadcast the show and also streams it online every Sunday at 11 a.m. in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T23:02:36.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
