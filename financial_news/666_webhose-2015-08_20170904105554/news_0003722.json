Whether you’re rooming with someone you already know or, like me, you arrive at the residence hall to discover you’re in a forced triple with two people you’ve never met, all parties involved do what they can to make the dorm room reflect a little bit of themselves. \nI’m not going to tell a freshman girl that her plan to hang a tapestry is totally clichéd or that the Entourage poster the freshman guy already bought is currently in every other room in the hall. There are some things that every dorm room needs, and then there are the things that every dorm occupant should have. From the necessary to the inessential, the accessories of a dorm don't as much reflect the people that live there but rather where they are in their lives: finally out of the parents’ house.

But, there are some things that everyone—including your parents—would recommend for the dorm room, so let’s get straight to those. \nThe Essentials \nMost people would agree that the number one item on the list of dorm supplies is a mattress topper . Whether you go to Harvard or South Harmon, chances are the mattress the res hall gives you is not like the one at home. A good mattress topper can be the difference between a good dorm experience and a bad one. \nNext, bring your stuff in duffel bags . Don’t wait until you arrive at orientation to realize that your 100 square-foot dorm room doesn’t have the space to hold a travel set of suitcases. Duffel bags are easy to store under your bed or at the back of your closet and are perfect to pack up for a weekend trip off campus.See the Best Luggage for the College-Bound \nLet’s face it: either you or your roommate will have to bring a mini fridge . The mini fridge is as integral to college as the Che Guevara T-shirt or the hacky sack (not that I recommend either). Whether you fill it with beer from Costco or food you took from the dining commons, the mini fridge will never become obsolete. Just don’t be surprised if your roommate takes it as his own. \nBring a hamper (for obvious reasons) and a clamp-on lamp to clip to your bed. If your roommate decides to go to bed at 9:30 p.m. and you’re wide awake, there’s no need to drain your smartphone battery by using it as a flashlight. \nWhich brings me to the next item: power strips . With all the chargers and devices college kids bring to their dorms, those two outlets the residence halls give you just won’t cut it. You don’t want to be constantly plugging and unplugging your chargers and electronics, so bring a few to plug in wherever you can. \nOn to the res hall bathrooms. If there’s one game all freshman take seriously, it’s \"the floor is lava\" in the dorm showers. If you want to go your freshman year without a foot infection, you better bring some flip flops . Also, don’t drop the soap. Carry it in a shower caddy instead. \nFreshman year is a time where it’s hard to leave the dorm room for classes—let alone water. If the sink water in the bathroom doesn’t meet your standards, which it probably won’t, do yourself a favor and get a Brita water filter . \nWhen you finally decide to go to class, you’re going to need a backpack that you preferably haven’t been using since you were a freshman in high school. Ditch the Jansport—go with a North Face or Herschel bag instead. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T22:57:11.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
