The company remains on track to report data later this year at ASH and if all goes well, KTE-C19 could reach the market in 2017 (Read more: Kite Pharma Provides Update, Death Not Related to KTE-C19). \n2. AbbVie’s experimental leukemia treatment, venetoclax, hit the primary endpoint in a phase II study. AbbVie and partner Roche will be using data from this study for the filing of regulatory applications in the U.S., EU and other territories. Relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia in patients who have 17p deletion has historically been difficult to treat. Venetoclax has Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. for this indication (Read more: AbbVie/Roche's Leukemia Drug Hits Phase II Primary Endpoint). \n3. AVEO Oncology’s shares received a boost with the company signing an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Novartis for the development and commercialization of AV-380 (cachexia) and related antibodies. The agreement will see AVEO receiving up to $326 million in the form of upfront and milestone payments as well as tiered royalties ranging from high single digits to a low double-digit on product sales. \nNovartis will conduct as well as fund all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities related to the candidates covered by the agreement (Read more: AVEO Up on Novartis Collaboration for Cachexia Candidate). \n4. Omeros’ shares shot up more than 72% on additional positive data from the company's mid-stage study on OMS721 for the treatment of thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Given the encouraging data, the company said that it expects to enter into discussions with the FDA later this year regarding the phase III study design. \n5.
