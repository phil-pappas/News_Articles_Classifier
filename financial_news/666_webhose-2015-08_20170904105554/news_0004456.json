Photo: Janie Barrett\nThe head of Queensland's biggest insurer, Suncorp Group, has warned the federal government to stop meddling in the disaster-prone Far North Queensland's insurance market or risk wasting taxpayers' money by entering the insurance sector.\nPatrick Snowball, chief executive of Suncorp Group, lambasted the idea of making the Commonwealth an insurer of last resort, arguing that it opens up the door to losing taxpayer funds.\nThe government's insurance taskforce is contemplating a range of options to reduce premiums in cyclone-prone North Queensland, including a government mutual pool in the far north.\n\"There is a danger that the government is about to set a precedent where other parts of Queensland say, 'why shouldn't we have that help, why shouldn't we have a bushfire pool?',\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"Simply creating this pool which has unlimited liability behind it … I don't think is the right thing to do.\"\nThe government should instead been pouring more funds into disaster mitigation measures such as building dams and buildings that better withstood cyclones, the outgoing chief of the $18.5 billion insurer said.\n\"Money spent in preventing [disaster damage] gives you a far better return than money spent repairing the damages,\" he said. \"The answer is no – we're not doing enough [on mitigation].\"\nSuncorp posted a net profit of $1.13 billion for the year to June – an increase from last year's $730 million despite the insurance giant recording its worst year for natural disaster events.\n​Suncorp, which owns insurance brands such as AAMI and GIO, will pay investors a special dividend of 12¢ a share and a final dividend of 38¢ a share. This brings the group's total dividend for the year to 76¢ a share compared with FY14's 75¢.\nThe result came despite the big year of natural disaster claims, which had a net effect of $1.068 billion, nearly double the group's allowance of $595 million for the year.\nTens of thousands of claims weathered Suncorp weathered tens of thousands of claims from the Brisbane hailstorm, NSW storms, Cyclone Marcia and Sydney's Anzac Day hailstorm, which triggered the company's reinsurance cover.\nThe rise in Suncorp's net profits comes after the group's 2014 earnings were affected by a $496 million after-tax write-down of goodwill and intangible assets in the group's underperforming life insurance arm.\nThe group's biggest division, general insurance, posted a net profit of $756 million for the year – down from last year's $1.01 billion.\nTuesday's earnings will mark the last time Mr Snowball will deliver his last profits results. Mr Snowball, who is retiring and returning to his native England, will be succeeded by former GPT Group boss, Michael Cameron.\nPaul Taylor, head of Australian equities at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said Mr Snowball became CEO of the business in \"very different circumstances\" compared to where the company is today.\n\"He's really turned the group from a tough position to one of strength,\" he said.\n\"To me it's about pursuing the same strategy going forward [for incoming CEO Michael Cameron]. There's no need for major changes or major acquistions.\" Fidelity is one of Suncorp's largest shareholders.\nAndrew Martin, portfolio manager at Alphinity Investment Management, said Suncorp's results were largely ahead of consensus expectations.\n\"The shape of the business he'd inherited and the environment that he'd inherited it in … it's pretty remarkable where the business is now,\" Mr Martin said.\nThe insurance group, which has been on a cost savings drive under Mr Snowball's leadership for the past six years, flagged further savings this new financial year. The company netted $225 million in savings in fiscal 2015 and this will increase to $265 million this new year.\nCLSA insurance analyst Jan van der Schalk said Suncorp's decision not to reward investors with an even bigger special dividend was a smart move because it reflected the company's prudent handover to Mr Cameron.\n\"It's a sign of maturity at the organisation that they haven't raided the cookie jar with a big special div,\" he said.\nMr Snowball said his biggest achievements were the people aspects of the business during his efforts to turn around the business.\n\"This was a very splintered organisation. Now … we've got very good people doing a great job and we back them with good technology. That's what I'm most proud of,\" he said.\nSuncorp's shares have risen 5.34 per cent to $14.55 the past 12 months, compared with the 2.3 per cent rise of the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:31:33.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
