It's time to pull in the reins and turn to some less sexy but more predictable health care stocks, especially those benefiting from the changing landscape of medical services, both at home and abroad.Here are three small-cap growth ideas without the binary risk or cult popularity of biotech.The Affordable Care Act was designed to decrease emergency room visits, but a recent study from the American College of Emergency Physicians suggests exactly the opposite: ER visits have spiked. Based in Lewisville, Tex., Adeptus Health (ADPT, 113) is the largest operator of freestanding emergency rooms, with 69 facilities in Texas, Colorado and Arizona, some branded under the name First Choice Emergency Room and others in partnership with hospitals.Adeptus' ERs have the same capabilities as traditional hospital emergency rooms, including CT scans, ultrasound, X-rays and labs, and are typically located conveniently at major intersections in affluent suburbs. A declining supply of hospital ERs and increasing patient visits have created a supply-demand imbalance that Adeptus is attempting to leverage. By the company's estimations, Adeptus visits cost less than those at the typical hospital ER, averaging $1,865 per patient versus $2,200 to $2,400 at a hospital.Adeptus is opening new centers in existing markets, and I expect it to enter new markets by partnering with hospital systems, as it did in joint ventures with Dignity Health in Arizona and UCHealth in Colorado. As with early-stage retail concepts, valuation based on near-term earnings looks pricey but is quite reasonable based on earnings a couple years out. Shares trade for 61 times my forward estimate of $1.80, with 50% growth in revenues and even faster growth in earnings.San Diego's AMN Healthcare Services (AHS, 35) is a leading provider of temporarystaffing of traveling nurses and physicians. Health care visits are on the upswing in a cycle that tends to mirror the economy on a lagging basis and in this case is exacerbated by increased insurance coverage, thanks to ObamaCare, and, more subtly, aging demographics.The net effect has been an increase in insured patients and a decrease in uncompensated care, so hospitals need more nurses and have the extra money to get them. Over the longer term aging baby boomers will need more medical care, while aging nurses will exit the workforce faster than they can be replaced. Taken all together, there's a shortage of doctors and nurses that isn't going to end quickly.AMN is also benefiting from a migration of health care providers to its industry-leading managed services platform and vendor management systems, under which AMN provides turnkey management of the provider's staffing needs. The company is expected to increase sales by 35% to $1.4 billion this year, with double-digit organic growth and the balance from acquisitions. Shares trade for 29 times my forward estimate of $1.15 in earnings per share.Headquartered in Beijing, IKang Healthcare Group (KANG, 17) is the largest private provider of medical checkups in China. There the market for annual physicals is still in its infancy but growing rapidly, driven by increased health awareness, government policy and rising disposable income.IKang competes with public hospitals through advantageous pricing and better-tailored services. The market for preventive medicine is fragmented, with Frost & Sullivan ranking iKang as the market leader with just 13.6% market share. With an established national network of exam centers and a recognizable brand name, iKang is positioned to be the consolidator.In 2014 it serviced 3.6 million people and counts 81 of the 100 largest companies in China as clients. IKang operates 70 centers in 18 cities and is planning to add 20 to 25 new centers this year. Over time, expect to see iKang expand its offerings in China's second- and third-tier cities, and to cross-sell other offerings, including disease screening and dental services. Shares trade for 21 times my forward estimate of 80 cents. Revenue this year should increase 33% to $387 million, and earnings are forecast to surge 56%.--- Jim Oberweis is editor of The Oberweis Report and president of Oberweis Asset Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:42:31.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
