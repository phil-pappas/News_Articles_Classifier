Analysts surveyed by Platts were looking for a decline of 1.4 million barrels for gasoline supplies and an increase of 700,000 barrels for distillates, which include heating oil.\nSeptember heating oil RBU5, -4.80% fell 1.2 cents, or 0.9%, to $1.383 a gallon on Nymex, while September gasoline RBU5, -4.80% dropped 5.9 cents, or 4.8%, to $1.369 a gallon.\nAdding pressure to gasoline prices, BP BP, -0.05% said late Tuesday that it has restarted a large crude distillation unit at its Whiting, Ind., refinery that had been shut down since Aug. 8 for repair work and that the restart is gradually increasing the refinery’s fuel production.\nRead: $2 gas?
