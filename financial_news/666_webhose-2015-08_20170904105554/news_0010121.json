Rob Homer This is a remarkable shift in commentary given he said in June he had no immediate plans to step down from the board, saying at the time \"we do not think in the middle of this process to have further change is beneficial for this company,\" according to Fairfax Media.\nThere will not be any opposition to changes at board level though. Cairns is well qualified for the job although his load looks heavy in the new role. The former chief executive of Lion Nathan is chairman of Origin Energy and he sits on the board of Macquarie Group. He is developing a reputation as the director you call when you are in dire straits after he was appointed David Jones chairman last year when Peter Mason was forced to step down.\nThere had also been speculation that former Woolworths chief and current Fairfax Media chairman Roger Corbett might have been a candidate, but he told me this week he had not been approached by the board and would not be interested if he had.\n\"I've had my go,\" he said.\n Woolworths full-year results. Woolworths needs all the help it can get. This is highlighted in the supermarket group's 12.5 per cent fall in annual earnings to $2.15 billion reported this morning. These poor numbers have already been flagged and will not move the market alone, but June-half declines in food, liquor and petrol illustrate the deteriorating situation.\nThe strategy to focus on margins and earnings growth rather than volumes, which predates O'Brien's reign, has now caught up with the supermarket group. A reinvigorated Coles and new competition from Aldi have also proved challenging, while its hardware strategy with the Masters chain has been a mess .\nWaters defended the Masters strategy, saying he personally believed that it will be a thriving business in years to come. But he also noted the decision to push into hardfware was made before his time.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:07:36.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
