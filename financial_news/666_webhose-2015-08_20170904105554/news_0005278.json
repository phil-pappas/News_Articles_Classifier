Such credits, however, will have to adapt to higher new issue concessions in a market still uncertain about the commodity space.\nWith the region's primary markets all but dead, bankers are eyeing the US high-grade market as a leading indicator for the types of concession LatAm corporates might have to pay.\n\"If high-grade corporates are paying 15bp, that is the minimum (commodity credits) like Pemex and Codelco will have to pay,\" said another banker.\n\"Non-commodity names could get back into the 10bp or below range. That is the space where people are looking to add, as they can't do it in the secondary.\" (Reporting by Paul Kilby; Editing by Marc Carnegie)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:54:53.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
