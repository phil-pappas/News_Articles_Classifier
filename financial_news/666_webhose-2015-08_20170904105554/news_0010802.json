Denise Meridith \nLike many NFL players, when an injury ended his four Pro Bowl career, Simeon Rice was dazed, confused, and unsure of what to do next. But, instead of surrendering to depression, as so many do, he applied himself to achieving another long-term dream. This weekend, August 28-30, 2015, people in his current hometown will get to see the results of that perseverance, when his new movie— Unsullied —premieres in Phoenix, Arizona. \nRice was born on the south side of Chicago. While earning a degree in communications from the University of Illinois, he received many awards, such as All-American and Big Ten Rookie of the Year. \nRice’s relationship with Arizona began in 1996, when he was the #3 draft pick overall. Despite being challenged by a poorly-performing team and a culture very different from the diverse one in which he grew up, the defensive end had a successful five-year tenure, which included being chosen NFL Rookie of the Year. Rice went on to be part of a Super Bowl-winning team in Tampa. After seven years in Tampa Bay, he played for Denver, and, ultimately, Indianapolis where his career ended. \nFootball had been his first love, his passion, his life. “I wasn’t prepared to leave the NFL,” Rice said. “I missed the intense euphoria of the crowds, the cheers, the victories. I was in a haze for two years.” \nFinally, Rice resolved to pursue another passion, and graduated from the New York Film Academy in 2009. Rice developed a strong portfolio of scripts, but, like many film school graduates, had difficulty getting hired. \nRice said, “I learned you have to invest in yourself first.” After he began to finance his own work, other investors, like distributors Don Barry and Thomas Boney, started to take him seriously. \n“I wanted to make my first film compelling,” Rice said about his 18-month quest to create Unsullied , “I want to make people feel .” \nThere was a star-studded preview of the film in St Petersburg, Florida on August 22. But Rice is most excited about opening weekend in Arizona. “I hope everyone turns out to enjoy the film at the many theaters throughout the Valley.” Rice is an inspiration to professional athletes, who need to be prepared for life after sports; to new artists, whom he encourages to never give up; and to Phoenicians, who are proud to see a local athlete recognized for doing something positive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T01:19:24.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
