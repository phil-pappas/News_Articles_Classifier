The federal government is stepping up moves to revamp a WET tax rebate scheme where some unscrupulous operators are claiming rebates they shouldn't. Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans Jack, Jill and John are all friends with a keen interest in wine and they've been rorting loopholes in the complex wine tax rebate scheme, which costs taxpayers $311 million a year.\nThey bought a truckload of grapes via four corporate entities, and had them processed under contract by a winery. Because the trio don't control any of the entities in their own right, they are able to claim up to $500,000 in tax rebates on the resulting wine, and a whopping $2 million in total.\nThe names are fictitious but this unscrupulous practice is rife in the $4 billion wine industry and one of several outlined in a paper to be released on Friday by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.\n\"The amount of WET rebates claimed has increased, and the circumstances in which the rebate is claimed have extended beyond what was originally intended,\" Mr Frydenberg said.\nTreasury estimates the rorts could cost taxpayers $350 million-plus by 2016. Solutions proposed include abolishing the rebate, replacing it with a grant scheme and transitional arrangements, banning those making bulk wine and unbranded wine from accessing the scheme, and tightening eligibility so that it includes only legitimate producers.\nOther options being canvassed include reducing the rebate cap from the maximum level of $500,000 each financial year, and removing $25 million of rebates now being claimed annually by New Zealand wine producers.\nMr Frydenberg is annoyed the original intention of the rebate, implemented in 2004 and expanded in 2006 to help small wine producers in regional areas, has been twisted by some unscrupulous operators, and \"extended beyond\" why it was initially set up.\nThe number of entities claiming wine equalisation tax credits in the grape growing and wine industries in 2013-14 was 1967, about 100 higher than in 2006-07, and tax credit claims have risen every year from an original $199 million in 2006-07.\n The WET Rebate Consultative Group includes Robert Hill-Smith of Yalumba Wines in South Australia. David Mariuz Seizing opportunity The discussion paper also outlines other instances such as the operation of \"virtual\" winemakers, some of whom are basically sole operators who seize an opportunity to become part of the industry because of an oversupply of grapes.\nIt gives the example of \"Frank\", who via his contacts in the wine trade knows about some excess grapes from a local vineyard, and organises to buy them and have them processed by a friend who owns a nearby winery and has a buyer in mind for the finished product.\nFrank registers for the GST, officially buys the grapes and has them crushed at his contact's winery for a fee. Frank then sells the bulk wine and is able to claim a wine tax rebate.\nOther rorts Mr Frydenberg wants to iron out include specially established bulk wine arrangements where a winery might change the contracts it has with a grape grower so that the grower retains ownership of the grapes throughout the manufacturing process.\nBut the winery charges an inflated processing fee, meaning the rebate is now payable to the grape grower and they use part of that rebate to pay the winery the inflated processing fee in a two-edged arrangement where they both gain a benefit they shouldn't be entitled to.\nMr Frydenberg has set up a panel of industry representatives to help examine the industry submissions and provide expert advice to the federal government later this year on \"options for reform\".\nThose representatives include Darren de Bortoli , the managing director of De Bortoli Wines, Robert Hill-Smith of Yalumba Wines in South Australia, Nigel Gallop of Fraser Gallop Estate in Western Australia and Tony D'Aloisio, chairman of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, who is also a former chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nThe WET Rebate Consultative Group, as it is known, will be chaired by Russell Campbell of Federal Treasury.\nMr Frydenberg wants submissions over the next three weeks.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-08-20T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:12:02.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
