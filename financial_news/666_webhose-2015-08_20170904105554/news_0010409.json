We haven’t been looking for long, maybe a few weeks,” Ms McLachlan said.\n“We liked the look of the building and the town centre that’s going to be built there. We are excited to move in.”\nSisters Sherly and Brenda Lie, from Maroubra, also bought an apartment with their father.\n“We bought it as an investment. The location is pretty good and it’s close to the station,” Miss Lie said. Neil Xian, Cecilia McLachlan, with their son Louis, 5, relax on the showroom bed while waiting to sign their contract.
