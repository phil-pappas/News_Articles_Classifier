In the 1970s, they rented for an average of 2.6 years. They're also spending a bigger chunk of their incomes to buy: In the 1970s, first-time homebuyers bought homes that cost about 1.7 times their annual income. Now they're buying homes that cost 2.6 times their annual income. \nPart of that can be attributed to the housing markets where millennials are moving: more expensive cities on the coasts, where there are growing job markets. \nThe average first-time homebuyer is about 33, at the front end of the millennial generation. Their median income is $54,340, which is about the same as what first-time homebuyers made in the 1970s, when adjusted for inflation. \nIn the late 1980s, 52 percent of first-time homebuyers were married. Today, only 40% were married. \n\"Millennials are delaying all kinds of major life decisions, like getting married and having kids, so it makes sense that they would also delay buying a home,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Dr. Svenja Gudell. \"We know millennials value home-ownership and want to buy. The next challenge will be figuring out how they can save for a down payment and qualify for a mortgage, especially while the rental market is so unaffordable all over the country. The last hurdle will be finding a home they like amidst very tight inventory, especially among starter homes.\" Years Median Income (in 2011 dollars) Median Home Price (in 2011 dollars) Price-to-Income", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T23:41:03.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
