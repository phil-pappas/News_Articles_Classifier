This is negative for gold as it would lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar. Spot gold was down one per cent at $US1,114.26 an ounce, while US gold futures GCv1 for December delivery settled down 0.7 per cent at $US1,115.60 an ounce. Earlier it hit its highest since mid July at $US1,126.30. \"US retail sales should help keep pressure on the gold price, unless there is any further unexpected depreciation of the yuan and more risk-off turmoil,\" said Mike Dragosits, senior commodity strategist for TD Securities in Toronto. \"Accordingly, we should eventually trend back toward that $US1,000/oz level as rate hikes near and inflation remains muted.\" Shares revived and bond yields rose in major markets after China's central bank reassured investors there was no reason for its currency to keep falling. While the devaluation of the yuan appears positive for gold in the longer term, if it stimulates demand for the metal as a haven from currency volatility, Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said, the metal remains vulnerable to dollar strength. \"Today the dollar is (strengthening), and the set of data from the US was quite good, which again probably increases somewhat the probability of a (near term) rate hike,\" he said.
