However, the premier still enjoys high levels of support among voters - and there is speculation he will call early elections once the bailout deal is finalised. \nYesterday, an unnamed Greek delegate had said both sides had \"started the final stretch\" of the talks - \"combing through the final text sentence by sentence, word by word\". \nTalks on this international bailout - Greece's third - had begun on 20 July. \nDuring Monday's negotiations, a senior ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested any bailout should be offered in smaller chunks. \nRalph Brinkhaus told a German radio station: \"The more money is handed out in one stroke, the less leverage one has to stop payments if the reform process in Greece does not pan out as planned and promised. \n\"A lot of trust has been lost in recent months (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T14:34:31.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
