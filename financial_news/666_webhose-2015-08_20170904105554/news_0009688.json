PUBLISHED: 09:49, Mon, Aug 31, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:57, Mon, Aug 31, 2015 GETTY The growing thirst for craft beer has seen as 24 per cent rise in new microbreweries \nA study by accountancy group UHY Hacker Young showed the number jumped from 291 in 2013-2014 to 361 in 2014-2015. \nThe number of applications to HMRC to launch breweries has nearly trebled in the past five years, up from 101 in 2009-10, said the report. \nJames Simmonds, partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \"This dynamic sector of the drinks industry is booming as new start-up breweries are attracted by the growing consumer appetite for their products. \n\"Craft beer is viewed as an increasingly aspirational leisure accessory - so the profit margins available can be very attractive. The recent success of small brewers across the UK also offers encouragement to budding entrepreneurs and investors James Simmonds, partner at UHY Hacker Young \n\"The recent success of small brewers across the UK also offers encouragement to budding entrepreneurs and investors.\" \nPubs group Punch Taverns is also enjoying an upturn in fortunes. \nIt is expected to report a profits jump when it posts its full-year results tomorrow, as the group continues to cut its portfolio of outlets. \nBrokers at Numis expect the Burton-upon-Trent-based group to see its pre-tax profit lift by 46 per cent to Â£56.6million, just after an agreed sale recently of 158 pubs to property firm NewRiver Retail.

Last year annual like-for-like sales rose 1.3 per cent. \nPunch, the UK's second biggest landlord, said that after the sale the group will be left with around 2,900 pubs in its core estate, and 550 pubs in its non-core estate. \nChief executive Duncan Garrood said: \"This transaction is in line with our stated strategy of disposing of pubs within the non-core estate, reducing the overall level of our debt, whilst focusing on our higher quality core pub estate.\" \nNumis said Punch will have sold around 210 pubs this year, and it expects the firm to sell a further 300 in the new financial year. This includes the 158 pubs sold to NewRiver, as the deal is expected to complete on September 11, after its new year begins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T15:42:47.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
