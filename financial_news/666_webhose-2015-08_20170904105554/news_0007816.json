(\"Company\") (OTCBB: SCYT ), the holding company for Security Federal Savings Bank of McMinnville, Tennessee, today announced consolidated earnings for the second quarter of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. \nNet income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $268,000, or $0.69 per share, compared to $350,000, or $0.91 per share, for the same quarter last year. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company's net income was $628,000, or $1.63 per share, compared to $642,000, or $1.66 per share, for the same period in 2014. \nFor   2014, net interest income was $1.4 million.

The decreases during the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to a decrease in the income from financial services and deposit service charges. \nNon-interest expense for   2015 remained relatively unchanged for the same periods in 2014. For   expense was $1.3 million, reflecting an increase of $7,000, or 0.6%, from the same period in 2014.
