GSK sells cancer and multiple sclerosis drug to Novartis in $1bn deal By Julia Bradshaw | Telegraph – 1 hour 32 minutes ago GO8.AS 0.00 \nNovartis (Xetra: 904278 - news ) has acquired all the remaining rights to GSK's Ofatumumab drug to develop treatments for MS and other auto-immune conditions \nSwiss drugs maker Novartis has bought the rights to a medication that could treat multiple sclerosis from British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) in a deal worth up to $1bn (£637m). \nNovartis will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialisation of the drug - Ofatumumab - for use in multiple sclerosis and other auto-immune disorders. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) says it is ready to push ahead with all-important phase III clinic trials - the final hurdle before gaining regulatory approval. \nOfatumumab is already widely available from Novartis, but as a cancer drug marketed under the brand name Arzerra, rather than as a treatment for MS. \nEarlier this year, Novartis acquired the rights from GSK to sell Ofatumumab as a medication to treat chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . \nThis latest deal effectivey gives Novartis the right to use Ofatumumab to treat any medical conditions. \nBoth transactions were part of a wider deal between GSK and Novartis , completed in March, in which the two companies have swapped billions of pounds worth of assets to reshape and bolster their respective businesses by focusing on their strengths. \nIt comes during a difficult time for big pharma, as the drugs industry contends with healthcare spending cuts and increased competition from cheaper, generic drugs. \nAs part of the asset-swap, GSK formed a consumer health joint venture with Novartis, while at the same buying the Swiss company's vaccines business. \nIn turn, Novartis, which already boasts a substantial oncology portfolio, has bought GSK's cancer drugs. \nFor GSK, the complex deal is part of a strategy by chief executive Sir Andrew Witty to return the business to growth and reverse the trend of the past few years of falling revenues and profits. \nIt also comes as GSK struggles to recover from a corruption scandal in China last September , for which it was fined £297m. The group's share price has fallen 18pc since April. \nDavid Redfern, chief strategy officer at GSK, said the sale of Ofatumumab had \"crystalised\" significant value for GSK shareholders. \n\"We continue to focus on progressing our pipeline in core therapy areas including HIV, oncology, vaccines, cardiovascular, immuno-inflammation and respiratory diseasesm,\" he added. \nUnder the terms of the agreement, Novartis will make an initial upfront payment of $300m to GSK for the acquisition of the compound and a further payment of $200m when the phase III study begins. \nFurther milestone payments could total $534m. Novartis will also pay royalties of up to 12pc to GSK on any future net sales of Ofatumumab in auto-immune conditions, such as MS. \nOfatumumab works as a cancer drug by targeting specific proteins on the oustide of cancer cells. It then stick to the cells until the body's own immune system picks them out and kills them. \nBut Ofatumumab is also being tested as a potential treatment for people with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain and spinal cord through inflammation and tissue loss, affecting more than 2.3 million people worldwide. \nPatients with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) have relapses or attacks of symptoms that occur for a period of time days, weeks or months and then improve, either partially or completely. Around 85pc of people with MS are diagnosed with this form of the disease. \nThe proteins and cells to which Ofatumumab are designed to stick to in cancer patients are also thought to be the ones that can cause RRMS. \nPhase II trials conducted by GSK have already shown that the therapy can reduce new brain lesions in patients with MS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T17:36:23.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
