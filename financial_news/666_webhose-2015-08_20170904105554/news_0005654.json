Andrew Quilty Share on twitter by Shaun Drummond\nThe original online bank disrupter, ING Direct, has never offered a credit card in Australia. But it is working on one, as it tries to become its customers' \"main bank\" – the one their salary goes to.\nIt knows that, unlike punters in its European headquarters, Australians have a credit card habit encouraged by a vast array of rewards and mortgage offset accounts, and will remember the bank that serves up the sweetest offer. So ING has to make sure it not only offers one – but that its credit card is pulled out first.\nHowever, it is building its card offer to be as simple as possible. So no slow cookers, holidays or frequent flyer points. It will give a few percentage points off other bank products, such as a home or personal loan, or cash back every time you use it.\nAFR graphic ING's first foray into the hyper-competitive card market is unlikely to be a favourite of the well heeled, according to rankings of premium cards compiled by RateCity for The Australian Financial Review . However, its model of automatically granting discounted products directly linked to increasing its products per customer, rather than points based on spending, might be the future of rewards programs.\nThe lesson now, however, from our analysis of more than 100 cards, is that the more you pay in fees and and the more you buy, the higher the rewards. About 10 cards stand out when fees are deducted and extras examined.\nOne of the best-value cards is a brand that is rarely seen these days, Diners Club, as well as Westpac's Altitude Black, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Diamond Rewards, ANZ Black and American Express.\nCitibank has the most cards across the various rankings, with two it issues directly and two it issues for Bank of Queensland and Suncorp, which use Citi for their credit card business.\n But all appear in at least two of the top 10 cards based on three categories: best-value rewards, most flights earned per dollar spent and extra perks such as limousines and golf course memberships, which are being added as competition for big spenders heats up.\nCostly companions It should be noted that interest rates are high on all these cards. There is some indication that higher-rate cards offer superior rewards, but interest rates across the high-end cards sit in a narrow band between 18 per cent and slightly more than 21 per cent.\nApart from fees by the cardholder, another important reason card issuers can offer all of these goodies is that businesses pay banks an \"interchange fee\" every time they accept a card – and fees on the high-end cards cost up to 10 times more to accept than standard cards, ranging from nothing to 2.2 per cent.\nWhile they are meant to compensate for issuing cards, to cover fraud costs and interest-free periods, most of the $2 billion or so that card issuers get from interchange fees every year are used to buy your rewards.\nAmerican Express \"companion cards\", issued by banks alongside MasterCard and Visa cards, directly pay the banks 1.75 per cent per transaction and usually offer at least 1.5 rewards points per dollar spent.\nThe cards from Amex's bigger rivals only pay the banks about 0.83 per cent on average, and consumers usually get between 0.5 points and 1 point per dollar spent when they use them.\nSo, of course, the Amex is pulled out first, much to the chagrin of MasterCard and Visa, not to mention the business paying it. As one senior banker put it: \"When a merchant accepts a card from a customer, they're usually helping to pay for their next holiday.\"\nProposed fee cap The economics of card rewards, however, could all be upended if the Reserve Bank of Australia caps interchange fees at a \"hard cap\" of 0.3 per cent, as recommended by the financial system inquiry. The cap is now 0.5 per cent, but averaged over three years.\nThis has led to a huge number of fees that are much higher and lower than this cap so that more can be earned from fees in between when they are checked every three years. A less severe option under consideration is to average the present cap one year, which would bring the actual fees paid much closer to 0.5 per cent.\nThe RBA may also regulate Amex's companion cards, which will likely lead to these being scrapped if they have to adhere to the same rules.\nAn industry-wide cap of 0.3 per cent has been introduced in Europe and issuers there are already scrapping rewards programs. Capital One UK, a major card issuer, cited the change as the reason it cancelled much of its cash-back rewards on purchases at retailers in June.\nIn anticipation of rule changes, HSBC and Woolworths in Australia have already begun offering less generous Qantas Airways frequent flyer points per dollar spent.\nOne way or another, it seems the income banks earn from fees paid by merchants will fall. Given the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry into credit card interest rates, the banks may lose some of that income as well.\nThe likely outcomes are that annual fees will rise and you will have to spend even more to get your flights or hotel rewards.\nAnother possibility is that banks will offer more rewards that are directly linked to getting people to buy more of the bank's products. That way they don't have to buy rewards from external vendors that rack up according to how much people spend.\nNo-frills future So is ING's new credit card looking like the sort of no-frills offer that we can expect to see more of in the near future?\nING's head of customer delivery, Lisa Claes, says the bank's model is unrelated to regulatory changes. She believes most customers can't be bothered to get their card out for yet another crockpot or to get a few more cents off their next holiday. But it is based on its European cards and Australia appears to be headed in that direction.\nOthers argue that sort of card just doesn't work for the rich. They are still going to be pampered, but the most expensive rewards, such as flights, will likely go or get much harder to earn. The extra perks, however, will grow – as long as you are buying more bank product.\nCiti's head of cards, Alan Machet, says its rewards are increasingly based on the total value of the customer to the bank. \"We look at the card and the customer and ask how broad might that relationship be,\" he says.\n\"We are willing to give more value to customers that bring more of that relationship across, who earn the most and those who take more products with us.\"\nCiti offers its customers rewards that are captured by the RateCity survey, including free concierge services to organise travel and accommodation, free limousines across Asia and free wine, as well as the free use of 20 golf courses throughout the region.\n\"You may see less points but the demand to find other ways to recognise customer value. I don't see any of the limo rides, golf courses, wines – none of that I am expecting to be impacted,\" Machet says.\nGrant Halverson, a former Diner's Club chief executive who now consults to banks, is convinced banks will maintain the rewards for their rich and most profitable customers and will find the revenue to fund them by raising fees elsewhere.\nHe argues Australian banks still don't have good data on all the products a customer has with them. As a result, they have a habit of treating those that take up premium cards as a simple proxy for a rich customer in the absence of detailed customer data.\n\"The Australian approach is, because they don't have great data analytics, they don't understand which super accounts you have with them or what other business you have with them. It is a way for them to try to plug the hole in the dike,\" Halverson says.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DrummondShaun"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:04:17.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
