A second container port would be banned until Melbourne reaches its capacity. \nLogistics businesses have called on the government to provide more protection against excessive rent increases in the sale legislation. \n\"The draft legislation falls short of effective regulation, creating uncertainty and putting at risk future investment and trade volumes through the port,\" Shipping Australia chief executive Rod Nairn said on Monday. \nPrivate stevedore DP World said it has reached an agreement with the Port of Melbourne for a new lease granting it 50-year tenure and agreed rent increases over the next 13 years. \n\"Everyone wins - our customers, service providers and the Victorian freight industry will benefit from long-term lease and price certainty which comes with DP World's commitment to operating in the Port of Melbourne,\" chief executive Paul Scurrah said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:46:18.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
