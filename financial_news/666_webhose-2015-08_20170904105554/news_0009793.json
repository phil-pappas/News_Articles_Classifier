No specific details were given. \nA current CSRC employee who worked on public offerings and one former employee involved with market regulation are suspected of insider trading and forging official documents, the reports said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:11:24.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
