The approval has been pending since October of last year.\nPetroperu would control a 75 percent stake in block 64, which holds some 55 million barrels of proven and probable light crude reserves. GeoPark Limited, would own 25 percent.\n(Reporting By Mitra Taj; Editing by Bernard Orr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T02:32:03.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
