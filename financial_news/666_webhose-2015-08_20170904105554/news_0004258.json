The dollar index fell against a basket of currencies in early Asian trade although it was still near one-week highs.\nIt touched those highs after data overnight showed U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 2.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter. First-quarter data was revised to show 0.6 percent growth rather than a 0.2 percent contraction.\nInvestors were also digesting a decision by the U.S. Senate Energy Committee to approve a bill to lift a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports, although it still faces an uphill battle in getting passed by the full Senate.\n 31, 2015 9:10 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:25:03.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
