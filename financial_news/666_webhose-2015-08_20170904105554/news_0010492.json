Since the start of July 2015 a total of 37 operators are now licensed to rent out holiday homes in Dubai with close to 800 units registered in the holiday homes system. The increase is a result of His Highness Shaikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai issuing Decree No.41 in December 2013. As a result of the decree visitors booking their accommodation through licensed operators can be confident that the accommodation they have chosen has been classified in line with the best global practices. They can also rest assured that the property they are booking is of a certain quality has the appropriate insurances and is managed by a qualified party. Khaled bin Touq executive director of the licensing and classification sector at Dubai Tourism said: \"We have made great progress in setting up regulations for holiday homes. These are designed to benefit both home owners and guests by ensuring the holiday homes market is aligned with the rest of Dubai's tourism industry and maintains the high standards for which the emirate is known. \"With the ultimate goal of contributing to the growth of Dubai's tourism industry by broadening the range of accommodations available to visitors the holiday homes market plays an important role in realising the emirate's Tourism Vision for 2020 which aims to welcome 20 million visitors per year by the start of the next decade. Holiday homes also benefit Dubai's real estate market by providing a potential revenue stream for property owners wishing to rent out on a short term basis. By being part of Dubai's wider Hotel Classification Scheme home owners can expect to profit from the targeted growth in visitor numbers over the coming years. -", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T14:24:54.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
