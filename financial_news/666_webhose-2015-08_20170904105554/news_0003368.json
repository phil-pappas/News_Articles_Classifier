We compliment the Supreme Court for going out of its way to consider the mercy petition of Memon (the 1993 Mumbai blasts case convict),” Singh said here.\nBut on the other hand the NIA had asked a senior lawyer to “go slow” on the terror cases involving Hindu extremists, Singh said, referring to special public prosecutor Rohini Salian’s allegations.\n“The urgency which has been shown in the hanging of Yakub Memon…why this urgency has not been shown in the case of Rajiv Gandhi’s assassins and also against Bhullar, the Sikh terror accused who was heard thrice by the SC and his death sentence was commuted to life sentence?” he asked.\n“For five long years his hanging was delayed. We would like to say strongly that terror should not be linked with any religion, caste or creed,” Singh said, adding, “Congress has always been opposing all the political parties which use fundamentalism to polarise the voters.”\nAbout the controversy surrounding his tweet on former President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam and Yakub Memon, Singh denied that he was supporting Memon, who was executed on July 30.\nHe had tweeted about the coincidence of Kalam’s funeral and Memon’s hanging, saying while one (Kalam) made every Indian proud the other brought shame to his community.\n“I have said what I wanted to. It is unnecessarily being projected that I am supporting Memon which is wrong,” the senior Congress leader said.\n“I have praised the SC for showing urgency in Memon’s case and has also said that similar urgency should be shown where Sangh (RSS) activists are involved,” he added.\nFirst Published on August 02, 2015 3:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T21:24:09.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
