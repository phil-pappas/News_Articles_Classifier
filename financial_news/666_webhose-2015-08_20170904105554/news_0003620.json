Easy, given Sydney is an early-morning, watery sort of town. But how to play that the other way around when landing in London has long been a problem. Thus, over the past six months, I made it my mission to sample London’s leading five-star hotel lap pools.\nBefore plunging in, a few lines on the assessment criteria. By Australian standards, I’m what you’d call a keen beginner. In order to get an expert rating, I took along a mate who’s an excellent swimmer. We assessed water feel (chlorine, temperature etc); lighting; suitability for swimming laps, including tumble-turn possibility; and level of public exposure when swimming (one hotel pool is smack bang in the middle of a bar; definitely not for the faint-hearted).\nWhere relevant, complimentary poolside shower and spa facilities for swimmers were rated, along with other wow factors. Changing rooms were not included, because in-house guests would most likely change in their rooms. The hotel pools mentioned are for hotel guests and/or members only, unless day access is stated.\nOur third place-getter, Mandarin Oriental at Hyde Park. Pools designed more for splashing than swimming were eliminated, except for honourable mentions we couldn’t resist. Ratings were not influenced by other attractions (although one hotel gave us a post-swim dinner; two gave us unexpected spa treatments and one laid on cakes so pretty my co-swimmer Instagrammed them). Of all these pools, only the Berkeley and Le Bristol’s are rooftop ones. Shangri-La’s is halfway up the Shard but has by far the most impressive view.\nSo, with the formalities out of the way, take your marks, get set, go.\nWinners are swimmers\n Not quite the Riviera with a glass of chilled Chablis; but the cafe is out from its cocoon of scaffolding at last and our lido looks rather splendid. #NottheRiviera #notHotelduCap #HappyAnyway #londonswimming #outdoorswimming #parliamenthilllido #swim\nA photo posted by Marion Hume (@marion.hume) on Jun 8, 2015 at 1:03pm PDT\n1st place\nOne Aldwych Hotel, Covent Garden\n18 metres The pool at One Aldwych, down a grand industrial staircase as if descending into the lower deck of an ocean liner, is long enough for laps and deep enough for tumble turns, with great water quality and visibility. My experienced swim mate – very quick – gives it a swift 50 lengths, pops her head up and declares it perfect. A screen at the end of the pool shows scenes of aquatic life. There’s a small but suitable steam room and sauna poolside. Downside: rather a long walk to the ladies’. onealdwych.com\n2nd place\nHotel Cafe Royal, Piccadilly\n18 metres A real beauty, as are those lounging around the pool. Cafe Royal is open to anyone happy to pay for its pricey spa memberships and day passes (£95). Super-stylish facilities include a jacuzzi, hamam and sauna. The pool is very blue, very clear and the distance swimmer likes doing her laps so much it’s hard to drag her out. It came in one point behind the winner because the water felt slightly too warm – first-world problems. Same could be said of the disgruntled client complaining loudly of no hair straighteners in the changing room. hotelcaferoyal.com\n3rd place\nMandarin Oriental, Hyde Park\n17 metres This one is decked out in arty grey slate. But the triathlete reports the grey palette combined with dim lighting leads to low visibility underwater and to difficulty judging distances for tumble turns. In the pool’s defence, most users won’t be slugging out 60 laps at breakneck speed. On the upside, water quality is superb. Poolside spa facilities include a great steam room and an ice facial; three to 12-month memberships available. Triathlete declares herself spoilt forever and now snubs the pea-soup-green reservoir where she used to train. mandarinoriental.com\nHonourable mentions Shangri-La at The Shard, London Bridge\n11 metres Enjoy spotting a helicopter at eye level when you turn to breathe? Like an aerial view of the dome of St Paul’s? For wow factor, you can’t beat Shangri-La’s pool on the 52nd floor of The Shard, which is strictly for hotel guests only. Gets busy morning and evening, and during the mid-afternoon family slot. Not long enough for my co-swimmer and rather warm. This pool is, however, perfect for selfies. It lost a point for lack of length but gained another in a most unusual manner: for the artfully concealed floor mops (behind a subtle screen). shangri-la.com\nThe Langham, West End\n16 metres The friendliest welcome we got anywhere and day access is available. But the pool is crammed: a kids’ swimming class plus other adults mean my speed queen has to rein it in. The staircase cantilevered over the pool is off-putting for serious swimmers. A balmy 28 degrees, yet not over-chlorinated. Underwater lighting affects visibility. Post-swim facilities include a fabulous rock salt sauna. langhamhotels.com\nHaymarket Hotel, Piccadilly Circus\n18 metres My squad swimmer is in great shape but even she finds the walk from the lifts and the loo past the public poolside bar a tad daunting. Also, the screen at the end of the pool showing terrestrial TV may work in the gym but not so much when you come up for air to catch a few very weird seconds of random adverts. Strange pull to one side underwater. This is a fantastic-looking pool for people confident they look fantastic. grandluxuryhotels.com\nBerkeley Hotel, Knightsbridge\n10 metres This one slipped through our strict “swimming not splashing” net simply because it’s too divine to miss. A rooftop pool with terrific views across Knightsbridge and day passes are possible. The water is super warm at 30 degrees. It’s for what the ocean swimmer terms “lady breaststroke”. Low on swimability. For everything else, a pure joy. the-berkeley.co.uk\nLe Bristol, Paris\nThe honourable eighth mention isn’t technically a London pool but, given the Eurostar has effectively created a two-hub mega city, I figure I can sneak it in. Near Place de la Concorde, Le Bristol comes with the ultimate Parisian rooftop pool, with views to the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Coeur. This teeny enclosed pool is styled up with teak to resemble the deck of a Riviera yacht. It was designed by architect Professor Pinnau, who did the Onassis family’s yachts. Heavenly water quality and temperature. Zero tumble-turn potential but who cares? As you’d expect of Le Bristol, the pool sports the world’s most desirable poolside robes. lebristolparis.com\nPublic bathing Thanks to those democratic do‑gooders of the 19th century, London has great public pools – for now (I’m looking at you, developers who perpetually threaten these Victorian-era gems on prime land). No membership necessary here, just show up with your togs, a fiver (you’ll even get change), and dive on in.\nMarshall Street Baths\n32 metres Handily located off Regent Street, this pool wins the top slot because it’s lined in white Sicilian marble. The steep dip as you move from shallow water to the deep end feels like flying. Built in 1850, it was last refurbished in 2010. Avoid office lunchtime when it gets busy. better.org.uk\nLondon Aquatics Centre\n50 metres Out east at Stratford, London Aquatics Centre was built for the 2012 Olympics and claims to be the most technologically advanced competition pool in the world. Australians can combine it with a trip to the world’s largest Westfield and feel right at home. Just check online before you go that it’s not closed due to a carnival. londonaquaticscentre.org\nGiven the weather, the number of outdoor pools in London may surprise you. A word on translation – the British refer to an open-air public swimming pool as a “lido”, adopted from the Italian word for beach.\nParliament Hill Lido, Hampstead Heath\n61 metres This is literally London’s coolest public pool – open year-round, it’s one of quite a few unheated swimming venues in London and the water dips to 3 degrees. Swimming at under 10 degrees takes practice, while under 5 degrees is for acclimatised ice swimmers only. The best months for London’s lidos are June to September; it’s standing room only in August. Pros for Parliament Hill include no membership required and it’s open from 7am, with a late close three nights a week in summer. Cons: basic changing rooms; while the cute cafe looks like it belongs to an art deco pool on the Cote d’Azur, the coffee is reliably awful. cityoflondon.gov.uk\nLondon Fields Lido, Hackney\n50 metres A close contender for the top slot, London Fields is heated year-round to a balmy 26 degrees, (proof that East Enders aren’t so hardcore after all). This affords the amazing experience of sprinting from the changing rooms in the arctic chill of a bleak midwinter night in order to swim outdoors. hackney.gov.uk\nTooting Bec Lido, South London\n91.5 metres Well, they say size isn’t everything. It might be England’s largest open-air swimming pool but the unheated Tooting Bec slips down the ratings because it’s members-only in the winter months, as is the Serpentine. wandsworth.gov.uk\nWorth diving in once King’s Cross Pond Club\nAn innovative piece of land art, this installation, titled Of Soil and Water, doubles as a freshwater public bathing pond. The pool is chemical-free and filtered through wetland and water plants. Numbers are strictly limited (no walk-ins). Summer only, dawn until dusk. Has changing rooms and showers. Located at 20 Canal Reach, entrance on Tapper Walk. Tickets available online. kingscrosspond.club\nSwim Dem Crew\nSwim in public pools all over Greater London with @swimdemcrew (on Instagram). “Youngers and Olders” can just turn up and the vibe is warm encouragement. The core team comprises athletes and distance runners, so there’s the added thrill of exercising with the fittest. (Aussie squad swimmers tend to race ahead, but relish the camaraderie.) Ask them at lunch afterwards how they take young Londoners from non-swimmers through to experienced enough to compete in open water swims. #SwimDemChallenge swimdemcrew.co.uk\nLast lap Thames Baths\nThe crazy idea to build a pool within sight of Tower Bridge in the heavily polluted River Thames, one of the world’s busiest waterways, is close to becoming a reality thanks to Thames Baths’ Kickstarter campaign. The water will be filtered, the views amazing. Let’s hope it happens. thamesbaths.com", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/swimdemcrew/", "http://londonaquaticscentre.org/", "https://instagram.com/p/3rk7vEnzy9/", "http://hackney.gov.uk/", "http://www.mandarinoriental.com/", "http://wandsworth.gov.uk/", "http://shangri-la.com/", "http://kingscrosspond.club/", "http://www.swimdemcrew.co.uk/", "http://www.hotelcaferoyal.com/", "http://www.onealdwych.com/home"], "published": "2015-08-06T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T16:11:06.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
