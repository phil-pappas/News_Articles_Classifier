Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Education Minister Christopher Pyne has said increasing scrutiny of politicians use of expenses has become a Salem witch trial as allegations emerge that Labor's finance spokesman Tony Burke took a family holiday to Uluru on the taxpayer purse.\nHe also said he hoped former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, stood down over alleged entitlements misuse would be re-elected in her Mackellar seat , blasting coalition ministers who attacked her as \"cowardly\".\nMr Burke, who was strident in attacking Bronwyn Bishop, has defended taking his family to Uluru on business class during school holidays costing the taxpayer $6492.36, saying the claim was within the rules.\nInstead of attacking his opponent Mr Burke on Wednesday, Mr Pyne said questions over individual politicians expenses had become a witch hunt.\n\"I'm not going to get into the is Salem witch trial situation over members' entitlements, all of my taxpayer expenditure has been entirely correct over 22 years,\" he said.\nMr Pyne has also gone against the tide calling for Bronwyn Bishop to retire from politics, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying Bronwyn Bishop's time in Parliament is likely at an end and some Liberal MPs saying she should go within weeks.\n\"If the people of Mackellar want to re-elect Bronwyn Bishop then they should and I hope they will. If she is to run as the candidate and if she has indicated she will run I hope she wins the preselection,\" he said.\nHe slammed his colleagues for not putting their name to criticism.\n \"I think my colleagues who want to give free advice, if they want to do it they should put their names to it. I think its particularly cowardly to say things like that off the record to brief the press attacking a great women in politics,\" he said.\nHe said Mrs Bishop had made a mistake by \"we've all made our mistakes over the the years\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-05T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:07:36.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
