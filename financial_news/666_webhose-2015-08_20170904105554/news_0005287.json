A level below 100 percent indicates a profit. \nAdmiral competes with UK rivals including RSA, Direct Line and esure Group. \nAdmiral owns UK price comparison site Confused.com and U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . site compare.com. Its other brands include Elephant, Diamond and Bell. \nJones said Admiral would be looking to expand price comparison sites into international markets, adding that the price comparison model was \"quicker to get off the ground\" than conventional motor insurance. \nAdmiral announced earlier this year that chief executive and founder Henry Engelhardt would step down next year, to be replaced by co-founder and current Chief Operating Officer, David Stevens. \nEngelhardt will continue to have a role in the company though the exact position was still being worked out, Jones said. \nAdmiral said it would pay an interim dividend of 51 pence per share, against analyst forecasts of 45.6 pence.
