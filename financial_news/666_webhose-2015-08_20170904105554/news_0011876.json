Mikhail, who lives in Guwahati, and Sheena were Indrani’s children with Das.\nThere were emotional scenes in the court when Indrani hugged Vidhie, her daughter with Khanna, in the court and was seen crying. Indrani felt uneasy during the proceedings after which she was given water and allowed to sit.\nTheir faces covered in black veil, all the three accused were produced before the magisterial court amid tight security shortly before 3 pm. Their veils were briefly lifted when the Magistrate asked them whether they had any complaint (against the police), to which they replied in the negative.\nAfter their police remand was extended, they were taken to the Khar police station where Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, who himself is keenly supervising the probe, also arrived for interrogating them. What transpired during the interrogation was not immediately known.\nEarlier, Chandgade rejected the contention of defence lawyers Gunjan Mangla and Hrishikesh Mundergi, appearing for Indrani and Khanna, that as the two were in police custody for sufficient time the remand should not be extended.\nAccording to the investigators, during their interrogation on Saturday Indrani accused Khanna of committing the murder and dragging her into the crime, while the latter claimed he only assisted her as she had promised to help him financially.\nIndrani’s lawyer Gunjan Mangala argued that there was no need for further police custody as police had interrogated her for almost 90 hours. Police were not investigating but trying to fabricate the case, she alleged.\nMangala also claimed that she was allowed to meet Indrani at the police station but wasn’t allowed to speak in private.\nKhanna’s lawyer Hrishikesh Mundergi argued that since the police were only awaiting the forensic reports now there was no need for extending their custody.\nDriver Shyam Rai was not represented by any lawyer today.\nAccording to Mikhail’s allegations, hours before Sheena was taken out by Indrani and Khanna on April 24, 2012 on what turned out to be the last drive of her life, his mother had drugged him. He managed to escape from the spot and averted becoming the second victim, he said.\nThe case had yesterday taken a fresh turn when police seized a suitcase from the residential premises of Indrani and Peter Mukerjea in Mumbai’s upscale Worli neighbourhood. The suitcase was to be allegedly used to stuff Mikhail’s body.\nA village official in Raigad district, who helped the Mumbai police locate the spot where Sheena Bora was allegedly buried, yesterday said when he first spotted the remains in 2012, they were just skeleton.\n“It was all skeleton. There was no flesh. The local government doctor took it for postmortem, after which it was buried,” Police Patil Ganesh Dhene of Hetevne village said.\nThe blood and hair samples of Indrani and Mikhail Bora have also been collected and sent to the Kalina-based Forensic Science Laboratory and the report is expected in the next couple of days.\n 31, 2015 10:51 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-01T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:27:05.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
