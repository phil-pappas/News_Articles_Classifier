The firm was formed as an offshoot of US giant Reed Smith. As part of the contract the firm will be implementing the Linetime system throughout the practice. One of the key criteria in selecting the Linetime system was its advanced billing options as this is a key requirement in servicing the firm’s blue chip clients. \nColtman’s Darren Davoile stated “I have worked with Linetime for many years and have found their software provided the flexibility we require to improve our business process. When we reviewed practice management systems the Linetime Liberate system was the clear winner”. \nShare:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:59:45.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
