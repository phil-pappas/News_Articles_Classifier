One must consider resident status and the nature of foreign income or asset before reporting it in India. Post your opinion here Preeti Khurana If you are ‘Resident’ in India as per the rules of the Income Tax Act, and if you have ever been abroad, all the brouhaha about foreign income & assets and its disclosure must be worrying for you. Let’s understand this in greater detail.As per the Income Tax Act if you have spent more than 182 days in India, you are resident in India. If you have been in India for less than 182 days but more than 60 days, you can still be resident if you meet the second condition. The second condition is you must have also spent a total of 365 or more in the previous four years. This is not applicable for an Indian citizen who left India for a job outside or as crew of an Indian ship or for an Indian citizen on a visit to India. They can only be considered resident if they have spent more than 182 days in India. The disclosure of foreign income & assets is applicable only to tax payers, whose status is ‘Resident’ as per these rules. To understand the nature of income or assets which have to be disclosed, consider the following - • Did you work outside India for some period of time and opened a bank account at such place? (Bank account)• Hold stocks or stock options, ESOPs, ownership rights, shares, or debentures (by whatever name called) or have investments in a mutual fund, pension fund or even a financial interest in an intellectual property right? (Financial interests or rights)• Possibly own a property outside India? (Assets)• Have income from foreign royalties, or earn rent from a property owned outside India, or earned capital gains from assets outside India? (Income sources)These are all examples of income or assets held outside India and if you are a resident you must disclose these in your income tax return. In summary, if at any time during the year, you have• Held an asset located outside India as beneficial owner or otherwise • Held a financial interest in any entity located outside India• Have signing authority in any account located outside India • Have income from any source outside IndiaYou need to disclose these in your tax return. You’ll have to fill schedule FA in your tax return and make the relevant disclosures. Now let’s look at the following situations –• Abhay is a freelancer and resident in India. He has earned some google AdSense income which was transferred directly to his savings bank account. Abhay is not sure if this is foreign income and whether he should fill Schedule FA.• Anu is a professor in Delhi University and she was paid for delivering a lecture in a university in Atlanta. Anu wants to know if this is considered as foreign income.• Rohan worked in the US for a few months, he is a resident in India in financial year 2014-15 as per the income tax act. He earned some salary in US dollars. Is Rohan’s income considered foreign income?• Prateek is a citizen of USA and moved to India 10 years ago. Prateek has bank accounts, mutual funds and IRA (retirement accounts) in US. Is Prateek required to disclose these in his return?In the first 3 cases above the incomes do not qualify as foreign income and schedule FA is not applicable. However, in Prateek’s case, his stay in India will make him as a resident for income tax purposes and he will have to disclose all his foreign holdings and offer them for tax in India. Based on the above, all residents as per the income tax act have to disclose their foreign assets & earnings. However, there is an exception for expatriates or non-Indian citizens. An expatriate or non-Indian citizen on a business, employment or student visa to India is not mandatorily required to disclose foreign assets if –Their status as per Indian tax laws was ‘non-resident’ when these assets were acquired, ANDThese foreign assets did not generate any income in the financial year 2014-15Therefore, income earning foreign assets, even though these may have been acquired when you were a non-resident, have to be reported in your income tax return. Those who have foreign income or assets can file their return in ITR-2 or ITR-4. Both these income tax return forms have Schedule FA. ITR-1, ITR-2A and ITR-4S cannot be filed by those who have such income or assets.
