Employment has increased by 57,100 (3.0%) in twelve months– the 11th successive quarter of annual employment growth. Employment growth was driven by gains in full-time employment and was broadly based – employment gains recorded in 11 of the 14 sectors. \n\nThe Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) published today (26th August) by the CSO shows that over 126,000 jobs have now been created since the launch of the Action Plan for Jobs in early 2012. Reacting to the positive employment data, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan T.D. stated: \n“The labour market remains a core indicator of economic progress and today’s data shows continued strength of this recovery. Getting people back to work is the key priority of this Government. Employment has now increased by 126,000 since this Government launched the Action Plan for Jobs in the first quarter of 2012. The unemployment rate has fallen for eight consecutive quarters and now stands at 9.6 per cent. \nThis Government’s policies are working with over 1,000 jobs a week were created over the past twelve months. In the upcoming Budget we will continue to support job creation and introduce measures which will continue to boost employment growth. \nToday’s figures provide further evidence that our economic recovery is broad based. We have seen an increase in employment across 11 out of 14 sectors in the economy and we have now had eleven consecutive quarters of annual employment expansion” \nEnds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:32:59.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
