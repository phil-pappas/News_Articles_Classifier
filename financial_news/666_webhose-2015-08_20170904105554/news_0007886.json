But the bankruptcy push is starting to draw flak, and it’s easy to see why. Fixing multiple public entities through bankruptcy will be costly, time-consuming and unpredictable, said Jorge San Miguel , a Puerto-Rico based government relations attorney.At a congressional hearing in February, Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (GDB) President Melba Acosta was lauding Chapter 9 as an “orderly and consensus-based process” open to both local stakeholders and onshore creditors.It may be orderly, but it’s hardly predictable. No one knows if Puerto Rico’s public entities could prove insolvency, as required under Chapter 9, or if their bond debts, most of which are secured by special revenue streams, could even be adjusted. San Miguel is involved with a private sector coalition on the island that he said wants to move beyond the Chapter 9 debate that has been sucking “all the oxygen out of the room.” The focus would return to long-term structural reforms that will restore the confidence of the capital markets.The small number of Chapter 9 filings overall mean that precedent is sparse. The only certainty is sky-high legal bills.Another problem: Bankruptcy judges cannot do much to correct the dysfunctional municipal governance that allowed debt problems to fester. The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution forbids them from interfering with how a city, school district or utility wants to run itself — they can’t order taxes raised, assets sold or governments reorganized.“The only thing you get in Chapter 9 is the ability to impair contracts,” answered William Brandt , a former Illinois Finance Authority president who is pushing an alternative to letting the state’s troubled cities and school districts go bankrupt. “All you can do is adjust debt — you can’t do anything to develop the entity.”Chapter 9 may be useful to bring people to the negotiating table, but it functions as a blunt debt-cutting instrument. Nothing in Chapter 9 can help Puerto Rico tax an underground economy pegged at roughly a quarter of gross national product .Nor can it reduce the rampant power theft that has kept the island’s electric utility in the red for years. Bankruptcy can free up money that would otherwise go to creditors, but it can’t determine where that money is spent.Like Puerto Rico’s corporations, cities in Illinois cannot file for bankruptcy, but C hicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is dead-set against a bankruptcy escape hatch being offered by the Illinois governor, who has made Chapter 9 access a pillar of his agenda.Puerto Rico’s leaders appear to see Chapter 9 as a magic wand for trimming its $96 billion total debt pile. Pedro Pierluisi , the island’s congressional delegate, is leading the charge for Chapter 9 access, but his legislation has run into Republican opposition as the investment community furiously lobbies against it.In the short run, offering Puerto Rico a bankruptcy solution may let the commonwealth transfer some financial pain to its onshore creditors. But preventing another crisis on the island takes more than bankruptcy can offer.
