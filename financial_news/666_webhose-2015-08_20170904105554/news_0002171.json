Glen McCurtayne by Ben Smythe You've finally made the decision to retire and your new \"employer\" in retirement is your self-managed superannuation fund pension. What happens if you don't like your new employer, or the daily grind of retirement starts to get you down?\nIf you are fortunate enough to secure a new job and decide to re-enter the workforce, can you simply start contributing back in to your SMSF and build up the fund balance again? What happens to your existing SMSF pension?\nThe practicalities of working again after you have retired are quite important when it comes to your SMSF and you need to make sure you do things in the correct order.\nFirstly, can you contribute again back into your SMSF, or do you need to open a new fund? In terms of contributions, provided you are under 65 there are no issues. If you are over age 65, then you must work at least 40 hours in a period of no longer than 30 days before you can start contributing back into your SMSF.\nNote that this work test must be met prior to making a contribution, which is an important timing issue if you are doing part-time work with variable hours. There is also an important distinction with respect to the work you perform, as it must be for \"gain or reward\"; you must be paid a salary and cannot simply do volunteer work.\nThe work test requirement doesn't affect your employer contributions (that is, 9.5 per cent of your salary), and simply relates to you making additional contributions either by way of salary sacrifice or after-tax contributions. At age 75, all contributions apart from the mandatory employer contributions must cease, so you won't be able to make any further personal contributions after this date.\nBehind the scenes There is also no need for you to open a new fund. Your SMSF should accommodate your new accumulation account as well as your existing pension account. Note that you can't add any new contributions to your existing pension account, hence the need to have a separate accumulation account. However, there is no need to have separate bank accounts, as the accounting for the accumulation and pension accounts will simply happen for you behind the scenes.\n What about the existing pension in a SMSF, do I keep it going now that I am receiving a salary?\nThis is not a straight forward \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, as it will really depend on your personal circumstances, and whether there are cash flow and/or tax advantages for you in switching the pension off and converting the balance back to your accumulation account. Best to seek advice with respect to this question but importantly there is no requirement for you to stop your pension. Once you start it you can keep it going even if you start working again. You just need to make sure you draw out the minimum pension each year.\nIn a couple of years, if you decide that retirement wasn't all that bad and you want to stop working again, your accumulation account will be built up from your recent work. You can simply choose to start a new pension with your accumulation account, so you effectively are drawing two separate pensions from your SMSF. Alternatively, you could stop your existing pension and add it to your accumulation account and simply have one pension going forward.\nThe decision as to whether to have one or multiple pensions will be dictated by your circumstances as it may be advantageous for you to maintain separate pensions, or even leave the accumulation account as it is and simply rely on the existing pension account.\nThere are a number of different issues and practicalities to consider for your SMSF should you decide to re-enter the workforce. However, the flexible nature of a SMSF really comes to the fore in these circumstances, and importantly will accommodate your varying work and retirement patterns in the one fund.\nBen Smythe is principal of Smythe Financial Management and a founder of Eviser.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T11:01:58.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
