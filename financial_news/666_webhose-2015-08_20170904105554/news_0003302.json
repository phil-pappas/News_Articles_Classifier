PUBLISHED: 09:57, Sun, Aug 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 10:03, Sun, Aug 2, 2015 GETTY A LITT LE AND OFTEN: Build up your cash \nAccording to comparison site MoneyFacts. co.uk , while rates on cash have been “obliterated”, regular savings accounts, where savers pay in a set amount every month, have stood firm. \nThere are benefits to going regular but watch out, there is a catch. REGULAR GUYS \nThe average fixed-rate regular savings account pays 3.68 per cent, almost exactly the same as two years ago, while the average variable rate pays 1.82 per cent. \nThat easily beats the meagre 0.67 per cent paid by the average easy access account. \nRachel Springall, finance expert at MoneyFacts, says: “Regular savings accounts continue to offer great returns for downtrodden savers, paying more than any other standard savings account, including long-term fixed rate bonds.” \nYou can even find best buy rates of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent, but they come with restrictions. \nFor example, Kent Reliance’s Regular Savings Account pays a variable 4 per cent on regular monthly payments of up to £500. \nThis allows you to put away up to £6,000 over a 12-month period, with unlimited withdrawals, but to open the account you have to visit one of the society’s branches in Kent and parts of southern England. \nSimilarly, Saffron Building Society pays a fixed rate of 3.5 per cent on up to £200 deposited every month for a year (£2,400 in total). \nThis is only available to new members who visit its branches in Hertfordshire, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. \nOther top building society regular savings rates available only in branch include West Brom, which pays 3.3 per cent, Nottingham at 3.1 per cent, Leeds at 3.05 per cent and Penrith at 3 per cent. \nIt is worth checking what your regional building society offers. BANK BALANCES \nOne bank figures highly in the regular savings best-buy tables: First Direct’s Regular Saver Account pays 6 per cent on up to £300 a month (£3,600 a year). \nThis is available nationally but only if you hold the bank’s 1st Account, a current account. \nThe HSBC Regular Saver and M&S Bank Monthly Saver also offer fixed rates of 6 per cent on £250 a month but, again, you must also open a current account. \nDavid Black, banking specialist at DJB research, says: “These are all teaser rates designed to lure new customers rather than long-term savings deals. \nAfter 12 months, your money will be shifted into an account paying a much lower rate, which may be as low as 0.25 per cent. \nRead the terms and conditions carefully as you may lose the interest if you fail to keep up with your monthly payments or make withdrawals.” CURRENT WINNERS \nMany current accounts actually pay far better interest rates than are available on your savings. \nNationwide’s FlexDirect pays a fixed rate of 5 per cent on balances up to £2,500 but only for the first 12 months. \nTSB’s Classic Plus pays 5 per cent on the first £2,000 on your account with no time limit. \nBlack says: “To get these rates you have to pay a minimum sum into the account every month, £1,000 with Nationwide and £500 with Lloyds. \nThey can still make great savings accounts, just make sure you stay in credit as overdrafts are expensive.” \nAmong standard savings accounts, Renault-owned RCI Bank, the latest challenger bank to enter the savings market, has launched a best buy two-year savings bond paying a fixed rate of 2.35 per cent. \nIt also offers a one-year fix at 2.06 per cent. \nIf you are reluctant to lock your money away, its Freedom Savings Account pays a variable 1.65 per cent. \nSavingsChampion.co.uk director Anna Bowes says savers should also consider their tax-free cash Isa allowance. \n“Shawbrook Bank has launched a one-year fixed-rate Isa paying 1.75 per cent and a two-year fixed rate at 2 per cent, matching market leaders Halifax and Virgin Money.” \nLife remains a regular struggle for savers but there are signs of hope if you look hard enough.
