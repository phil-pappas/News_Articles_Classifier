And, if oil stays low and wholesale diesel remains abundant, we could even have a chance of seeing £1 a litre diesel.\" \nAlthough diesel cars only comprise 37% of all cars in the UK, half of all new cars sold here are diesel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-08T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T07:33:35.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
