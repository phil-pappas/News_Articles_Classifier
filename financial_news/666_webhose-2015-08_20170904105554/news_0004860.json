Motorola Solutions has a market value of about $13 billion. \nGregory Brown, Motorola Solutions' chief executive, however said the company was not thinking of going private and would continue to focus on growth. \nBloomberg reported earlier this year that Motorola Solutions had shopped itself around but failed to find a buyer. \n\"Within the next 5 years, do I think Motorola Solutions will be sold? I'd give that an at least 50 percent chance, if not higher,\" Northcoast Research analyst Keith Housum said. \nHousum said the buyer would most likely be a private equity firm. \nMotorola Solutions is focussing on its faster-growing services business, which includes video monitoring and data analytics, as sales of its two-way radios stagnate. \nThe company said it plans to use Silver Lake's funds for acquisitions to boost the services business and to buy back stock. \nSilver Lake was part of a management-led team that took Dell Inc private in 2013 and was part of a consortium that acquired financial software maker SunGard in 2005. \nThe private equity firm has also invested in many technology companies including Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), chipmaker Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) and web-hosting company GoDaddy Inc (GDDY.N). \nMotorola Solutions' shares, which rose as much as 8 percent on Wednesday, had fallen 10 percent this year up to Tuesday's close. In contrast, the S&P 500 Communications Equipment index (.SPLRCCOEQ) has dropped 5 percent in the same period. \n(Additional reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T01:04:07.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
