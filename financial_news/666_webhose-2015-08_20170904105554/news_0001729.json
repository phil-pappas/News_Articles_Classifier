I've made a bunch of mistakes, but in a business sense, I've had a go more than anyone else I've known,\" Mr Packer said.\nMr Packer and Mr Gyngell have remained friends since the incident last May, which they have said was sparked by a misunderstanding. Both met for breakfast at Sydney's Park Hyatt hotel on Tuesday morning during a visit to Australia by Mr Packer\nJames Packer says he \"should never have punched Gyngell\". Brendan Beirne/Sione Chown, Media Mode In a meeting with journalists in Sydney, Mr Packer outlined his ambitious plan to build a global tourism and gaming brand from his half-owned Crown Resorts, which owns casinos in Australia, Asia, the United States and elsewhere.\nMr Packer, who now spends a lot of his time in the United States and Israel, also discussed plans to extend his business interests into the technology sector in Israel and elsewhere with a focus on cyber security, data storage and online gaming.\nGoing global Mr Packer made it clear that he sold out of the Australian free-to-air television industry because he could not take it global in the same way as gaming.\n \"I've spent an enormous amount of capex over recent years, but I am trying to build a global network of iconic resorts to show the world the quality of our luxury brand,\" he said.\n\"In 2007, I spent a shitload of money, but despite my foray into Vegas being a disaster, my investment in Macau has paid off.\n\"The plan is to create an iconic global business, unfortunately my old media portfolio just wasn't scalable globally.\"\nCPH, the Packer family investment vehicle that owns 50.01 per cent of Crown Resorts, is also exploring new opportunities in the technology sector in Australia, Israel, the United States and Asia involving its partnership with SEEK founder Paul Bassat.\n\"We are working on a number of investments in the technology sector, mostly in the data storage, social gaming and information security areas,\" Mr Packer said.\nOpportunities in the Middle East Mr Packer is increasingly focused on the opportunities from cyber security and start-ups in Israel, and has taken a strong interest in Middle Eastern politics. He owns a house next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.\nHe said the United States' recent nuclear deal with Iran was the \"stupidest thing I've seen in my life.\"\nFormer investment banker Robert Rankin, who last year became Mr Packer's co-chair of CPH, joined Mr Packer in Australia this week.\nHe said: \"I am very keen to keep growing our technology portfolio. James has had success in the past being at the forefront of innovation in the technology space and we will continue to pursue that strategy internationally.\"\nMr Packer is increasingly focusing his personal business interests outside Australia. He said Prime Minister Tony Abbott was \"doing a very good job\". He went on to describe his performance as a \"super job\".\nCPH is looking at investments in Australia, Israel, the US and Asia involving its partnership with SEEK founder Paul Bassett – through its Square Peg investment vehicle.\n\"Paul Bassett and Square Peg recently undertook a tour of Israel with Australian investors and the trip went extremely well, everyone was impressed. These efforts will build on our online investments in Zhaopin in China, which is the country's leading online job classifieds business and in the US with real estate market place Zillow.\" Mr Packer said\n\"The IT sector in Israel has emerged as a hub for innovation and start-ups in technology related services. Israel now has the highest start-ups per capita in the world and this will provide major opportunities in the future. These are relatively small investments, but they have tremendous potential given how quick the IT sector is developing globally.\"\nFlying visit Mr Packer made a flying visit to Australia over the past three days, meeting senior politicians and business leaders. He is expected to open Crown's newest casino resort in Macau in October. Last week Crown unveiled further details of its $2 billion casino hotel proposed for Sydney's Barangaroo.\n​Mr Packer won a bid to operate a second casino in Sydney from 2019 last year, knocking out Echo Entertainment's casino monopoly in the city. But Echo won the tender process for a new casino development at Brisbane's Queen's Wharf last month.\nMr Packer last week said he was \"ashamed\" to see football fans booing Adam Goodes. He was in Melbourne to support Crown's Indigenous employment programs, and said Australia needed to hold a referendum to show its commitment to reconciliation.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\ntony.boyd@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:41:15.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
