All of them are having a really good day,\" said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities. \"We've had two really good days here now, and I think that means maybe the panic has subsided, at least for now.\"\nAll 10 of the index's main groups were on higher ground, with the three most influential sectors, energy, materials and financials climbing 6.6, 4.5 and 2.2 percent respectively. Those groups make up roughly two-thirds of the index's weight.\nSuncor Energy Inc was the most influential gainer on the index, jumping 5.5 percent to C$36.43. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd soared 8.6 percent to C$28.23.\nCanada's biggest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, jumped 2.6 percent to C$73.99.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended 385.08 points higher, or 2.88 percent, at 13,766.67.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 229 to 18, for a 12.72-to-1 ratio on the upside.\nThe utilities group jumped 4 percent, while industrials rose 2.7 percent.\nOn the earnings front, both Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported higher third-quarter profits that topped estimates. The results helped TD rise 1.5 percent to C$52.60, while CIBC rose 5.9 percent to C$95.60.\nKevin Headland, director at Manulife Asset Management's Portfolio Advisory Group, cautioned that the impact of cheap energy prices was starting to hit banks, noting that it will become tougher for Canadian banks to maintain their margins.\nHe also warned of tougher days ahead in general for the TSX.\n\"Demand for commodities is definitely not improving. The slowing growth in China, the slowing growth around the world, I think that's really going to keep a lid on the TSX for the next little while,\" he said.
