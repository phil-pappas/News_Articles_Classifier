AMZN, -1.41% , companies like Walmart WMT, -0.98% Target TGT, -0.62% and Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY, -1.36% have been rolling out new services to increase the convenience of in-store shopping, pick-up and delivery.\n“Amazon has been the biggest disrupter to the retail landscape since Walmart,” says Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. “The Walmarts and Targets of the world are beginning to realize that they need to have solid offerings in store and online.” Big retailers have been able to invest in new technology systems and services, increasing their competitiveness in a changing market, he adds. “Everybody is testing all kinds of different things. They need to offer these to maintain customers.”\nOn Wednesday, Target announced its new in-store “beacon” shopping feature, which is currently being tested in 50 locations. Beacon technology uses small devices placed throughout the store to alert customers via the Target iPhone app about product recommendations and current deals as they shop.\n“The goal is to enhance the store experience by serving up relevant offers and relevant content,” Target spokesman Eddie Baeb says. Of course, for those customers who come to the store for just one or two items, it encourages them to spend more, too. Other retailers such as Macy’s M, -2.12% and Gamestop GME, -2.24% have also been testing the technology.\nThe store also offers free shipping and a 5% discount on essential items like diapers and toiletries for REDCard — Target’s credit and debit card service — holders.\nSome say a combination of new and old world retail services works best. In-store pick up is the most effective way for brick-and-mortar retailers to compete with online retail, says Lee Peterson, executive vice president of brand, strategy and design at company research firm WD Partners.\n“Customers just want to drive to the store [after ordering an item online] and have you put it in their trunk,” Peterson says. “It’s better than shopping online [and waiting for home delivery] because you can do it on the way home from work.” Plus, customers also get to see and touch what they are buying.\nThere is one exception to this rule, however: Younger people increasingly prefer to shop online rather than in-store, he adds. In a 2014 WD Partners retail consumer study, the majority of millennial respondents ranked “unlimited options” and “customer reviews” as their top two shopping ideals — both primary features of online shopping.\nRetailers are taking note — from subscription services to in-store shopping apps.\nSimilar to Amazon’s Prime membership — which costs $99 a year for unlimited free two-day shipping — Walmart began testing an unlimited free shipping membership program on a trial basis to a select group of customers by invitation only this summer. For $50 a year, customers have access to free shipping with delivery times of three days or less.\n“Our customers want predictable shipping,” says Walmart spokesman Ravi Jariwala.\nWalmart is also testing an online grocery service in five cities — San Jose, Calif., Denver, Bentonville, Ark., Phoenix and Huntsville, Ala. Customers can order groceries online, then schedule a pick-up time. They can then park in a designated spot and a Walmart employee will load their pre-ordered groceries into their vehicles. (Jariwala said Walmart has been receiving positive feedback from customers in the trial locations.)\nSome big-box retailers are bringing their own version of drive-thru shopping, once the preserve of fast-food restaurants, to their stores. In October 2014, Target began a partnership with Curbside, a mobile app that delivers ordered items to a customer’s vehicle. The service is currently available in the San Francisco area, New York and New Jersey locations.\n“For some customers, every second, every minute counts,” Baeb says.\nTips on throwing the perfect summer soiree (4:46) White House party planner Bryan Rafanelli dishes to Lunch Break’s Tanya Rivero on the best things to do when planning that perfect summer party.\nBed Bath & Beyond and Sears SHLD, +9.37% have also begun to provide specialized shipping and curbside pickup services. Bed Bath & Beyond’s “Pack & Hold” service allows customers to buy items at one store, and pick them up at another location. With Sears’ Shop’In app, online purchases are delivered curbside within five minutes.\nDespite the growing variety of shopping options, Yarbrough says in-store shopping at brick-and-mortar retailers will still be a strong component of the retail market. “There will always be a need for physical retail locations,” Yarbrough says.\nThe convenience of services like returning products for free in-store and being able to physically handle items will continually trump online retail, he adds. “Most customers still feel the need to go to the store,” Yarbrough says. “There are going to be some retailers that go away, but we’ll still need them.”\n“Consumers want to use stores in ways that are better than online,” Peterson says. As Amazon continues to expand and innovate its delivery system, he adds, brick-and-mortar stores face the choice between finding new channels of convenience or falling behind.\n : Why teens love texting Read this before posting pictures of your kids on Facebook Why Netflix’s ‘unlimited’ maternity leave policy won’t work", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:12:28.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
