Not only was growth lackluster through June, salaries have largely been flat since the late 1970s, according to data pulled from Pew Research . \nJuly did little to change that: Wages grew a modest 0.2% from the month before, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Hiring was largely in line with analysts' estimates, with 215,000 jobs added, while the unemployment rate was flat at 5.3%.

The rate of wage gains can can be an indicator of underlying economic challenges, including what the Fed terms \"slack,\" or the gap between current performance level and potential. \nA large number of underemployed workers or discouraged workers who have stopped seeking work would indicate a large amount of slack in the economy which could push wages down. As underemployed and discouraged workers don't figure into the headline unemployment number, it's possible for an unemployment rate to make the economy look stronger than it is. Indeed, Friday's report said the rate that accounts for discouraged workers is 10.4%, significantly higher than the overall unemployment figure. \n\"The relationship between wage and price inflation is tenuous at best in the short term,\" Dawsey wrote. \"However, we think that Fed officials view wage growth as a useful cross-check on the amount of slack remaining in the labor market, which is difficult to observe directly. In the past, we demonstrated that focusing on wage growth could help the Fed better meet its objectives in terms of inflation and unemployment over time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T20:55:20.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
