This seemingly simple service requires professionals with the requisite expertise and the right tools. 24 Hour Collision Center is a major hub for collision repair and other automotive services in Vancouver.\n“Window replacement may seem like a simple process but it’s not” reveals DB Bath who now manages the Vancouver auto body repair company 24 Hour Collision Center that his father founded. “If the replacement windshield isn’t set properly it can pop out during a collision and it can even cause the roof to collapse.”\nA cracked or chipped windshield is more than just a blemish in the appearance of a vehicle. It’s also a safety hazard because the blemish can increase the probability that a driver will get into an accident. The windshield also provides structural integrity for the vehicle.\n“The windshield protects people during an accident especially when it involves a rollover incident” declares specialist DB Bath. “A chip or a crack reduces that protection considerably and so does an improperly glued windshield.”\nIn windshield replacement the old windshield must first be cut from the vehicle and then the body and the glass are cleaned and prepared properly. The new windshield and the moldings if they are required are then installed with urethane-type glue. The glue is then allowed to cure for a while before the vehicle can be driven away.”\nThe process is exacting and the professional must be trained in the process. “That’s why we make sure that all the people who work in windshield replacement are properly trained and accredited” states DB Bath.\nDB Bath himself holds several trade certifications including the Red Seal Qualification in both Auto Body Repair and Auto Body Refinishing. The service teams are headed by master technicians with many years of training and experience.\nWindshields may also be damaged when the vehicle is involved in a car accident. 24 Hour Collision Center the Richmond windscreen replacement company provides a simple process for customers to deal with such events. They offer a computerized estimate help the customer handle the insurance paperwork arrange for a rental vehicle when possible and then they repair the damage.\n24 Hour Collision Center can be contacted at any time of the day and on any day of the week. They can also offer advice as to whether a windshield can be repaired or if it needs to be replaced.\n“No one cuts corners here at 24 Hour Collision Center because that puts people in danger” asserts DB Bath. “A windshield that’s not installed properly can fall off and then the occupants of the car can be ejected. Our goal is to provide superior service and we continue that tradition started by my father when he founded this company.”\nAbout 24 Hour Collision Center:\n24 Hour Collision Center provides expert auto body repair services for the people in the Richmond area.
