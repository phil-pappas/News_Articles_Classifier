Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe US presidential candidate Donald Trump has lashed Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for lobbying politicians to boost the immigration of foreign technology workers.\nMr Trump, whose popularity among conservative voters has surged to a fresh high according to new polls, said he would force employers to pay visa holders higher wages to deter \"flying in cheaper workers from overseas\" and to \"put Americans first\".\n\"This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favour of the H-1B [visa] program,\" Mr Trump said in his immigration policy document released this week.\nThe outspoken real estate tycoon, who has also sparred with high profile identities like media mogul Rupert Murdoch, TV personality Jon Stewart and actor Robert DeNiro, took aim at Mr Zuckerberg on his pro-immigration stance.\nTechnology companies such as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, Apple and Google say they are grappling with a skills shortage of software engineers and computer programmers. Bloomberg 'Personal Senator' The Facebook boss has set up a lobby group, FWD.us , to push the case for multiplying the number of H-1B visas that allow US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations like architecture, engineering, finance, medicine and technology.\n\"Mark Zuckerberg's personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities,\" Mr Trump said.\nSenator Rubio, the American-born son of Cuban immigrants, is running for president for the Republican Party. He visited Facebook's San Francisco headquarters two years ago to talk to Mr Zuckerberg about the US immigration system.\n Facebook and its staff donated $US1500 to Senator Rubio last year and up to $US10,000 to other influential congress members who are in favour of immigration reform.\nTechnology companies such as Facebook, Apple and Google say they are grappling with a skills shortage of software engineers and computer programmers.\nSilicon Valley has pressed Washington to make it easier to hire skilled foreigners and international students who have studied in the US.\nThe annual cap of 65,000 H-1B visas, issued via a lottery, was almost four times oversubscribed last year.\nDespite the strong demand, American voters are worried about low-cost foreign labour stealing local jobs.\nIn May, more than 30 technology employees at Disney/ABC Television were told they would be made redundant and were required to train their foreign replacements. After a backlash, the job cuts were cancelled .\nBuying Washington Angel investor Jason Calacanis said the H-1B program does have \"some abuses\" where firms use the visa to hire immigrants on lower wages.\n\"But we need skilled labour here and want all the smart people in the room in our country,\" Mr Calacanis said on CNBC on Tuesday.\n\"Have Zuckerberg and the rest of the tech industry got super involved and bought a lot of politicians? Of course they have.\"\n\"The tech industry is catching up with other industries which have bought Washington.\"\nMr Calacanis said an easy solution to stop the wage arbitrage would be would be to auction the H-1B visas to compel employers to pay a free market rate.\nMr Trump's latest outburst adds to a string of populist policies, including his plan to build a wall on the southern border to shut out illegal Mexican immigrants, ending automatic citizenship for babies born in the US and opposition to free trade deals. The billionaire has also called Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists, earning the wrath of Mr Murdoch but the support of many voters.\nA new CNN/ORC poll finds Mr Trump leading the Republican presidential race with 24 per cent support, followed by former Florida governor Jeb Bush at 13 per cent, African-American neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 9 per cent, Senator Rubio at 8 per cent and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker at 8 per cent.\nA separate Morning Consult survey on Monday had Mr Trump surging to 32 per cent.\nA Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr Trump's remarks.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/in-turnabout-disney-cancels-tech-worker-layoffs.html", "http://www.fwd.us/", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-08-19T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:13:24.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
