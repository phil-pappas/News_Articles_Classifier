Jim Rice Share on twitter by Lucille Keen The head of the building industry's drug and alcohol charity claims a union leader told him to keep quiet about a deal that siphoned employer contributions to the charity to the union.\nTrevor Sharp said then Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union NSW state secretary Andrew Ferguson told him to keep quiet about the deal that would benefit the union.\n\"Mr Ferguson instructed me to remain quiet about the new clause because employers would not be happy if they realised they were funding the union,\" Mr Sharp said in his witness statement to the union royal commission.\n\"They've (the union) made me a stooge to their wishes and desires.\"\nThe head of the construction industry's drug and alcohol chairty claims the then CFMEU NSW state secretary Andrew Ferguson told him to keep quiet about changes that would see money meant for the charity diverted to the union. Wayne Venables WVZ Mr Sharp told the hearing in Sydney on Tuesday that following his meeting with Mr Ferguson in regards to the changes, he claims as the pair where standing at the door to the office, CFMEU official Brian Fitzpatrick joined in the conversation.\n\"F---'em, give them 25 per cent or better still give 'em nothing,\" Mr Sharp claimed Mr Fitzpatrick said.\n\"They are our EBAs and we should decide where the money goes to.\"\nMr Sharp, who was on the Construction Industry Drug & Alcohol Foundation management committee, claims Mr Ferguson's response was \"no we can't do that, we need them (the charity) to hide behind\".\n The CFMEU has been accused of siphoning more than half the money raised from the Construction Industry Drug & Alcohol Foundation charity which was meant to go towards Foundation House, rehabilitation centre, for its own use .\nThe charity was funded with a clause in workplace agreements that requires companies to pay a mandatory levy, which started at $1 a week for each employee and is now up to $3 a week.\nMr Sharp said when he learnt in 2004 that the CFMEU amended the drug and alcohol levy clause in its EBAs to include a payment to the union, \"it had done so without any discussion or consultation with me\".\nUnion took 80pc of Thiess donation On Monday, the hearing heard claims construction company Thiess wanted to donate $100,000 to the charity following the death of a worker on the Epping to Chatswood rail project site.\nUnion official Michael Knott labelled the donation a \"kickback\" that would amount to corruption.\nMr Sharp told the hearing on Tuesday Mr Ferguson told him about the Thiess donation and asked him to ​put the money into the charity account and then transfer it over to the union.\nMr Sharp claims Mr Ferguson told him the union would take 80 per cent of the donation and the charity could take 20 per cent.\nHe claims this occurred but the $80,000 the CFMEU held had to be moved back into the charity following an investigation by the Australian Building and Construction Commission.​ ﻿\nIn its submission to the Royal Commission, to be lodged this week, the Institute of Public Affairs recommends a new, specialised appeals body, that is separate to and independent of the Fair Work Commission, should be established.\nIt claims it would \"put an end to partisan arguments about 'employer versus union' influence on Commission appointments and decisions as well as ensure more consistent decision making\".\nThe submission also calls for duties imposed on unions and employer organisations and penalties for non-compliance should be the same as those that apply to companies under the Corporations Act and that penalties for unions officials and unions that abuse 'right of entry permits' should be increased.\nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/lucillekeen"], "published": "2015-08-11T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T20:53:30.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
