But this manufacturing giant has ensured its products \"were not involved in these (new) export controls\", according to a statement reported by Chinese media (Shanghai: 600373.SS - news ) , suggesting the government was mainly interested in restricting exports of military technology. \nThe tightening of regulations comes two weeks after an incident in disputed Kashmir in which the Pakistani army claimed to have shot down an Indian \"spy drone\", reportedly Chinese-made. \nChina is also likely tightening controls on exports of powerful computers as it looks to maintain its edge in the global supercomputer battle long dominated by US-Japanese rivalry. \nSince June 2013 China's Tianhe-2 has headed the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful computers, with the machine capable of 33.86 petaflops (quadrillions of calculations per second).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T18:49:33.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
