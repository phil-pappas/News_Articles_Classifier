The gig economy has been a darling of Silicon Valley and Wall Street. And why not? An explosion of Internet companies have matched consumers and companies that want something done with individuals willing to do the work, meaning a great solution, in part, to income inequality.\nSome people apparently do well, like Brian Schrier, a 45-year-old handyman who reportedly earns between $6,000 and $7,000 per month through TaskRabbit. The promise of profitable independence has lured millions to do business through the likes of Uber Technologies and Lyft (car services), TaskRabbit and Gigwalk (odd jobs), DogVacay and Rover (pet sitting), Airbnb and HomeAway (vacation rentals), and many others.\nFILE – In this March 12, 2014 file photo, Katie Baranyuk gets out of a car driven by Dara Jenkins, a driver for the ride-sharing service Lyft, after getting a ride to downtown Seattle. The Labor Department on Wednesday, July 15, 2015 issued new guidance intended to help companies answer whether a worker is an employee or a contractor. The issue has taken on greater urgency with the growth of sharing-economy firms such as Lyft, Uber and TaskRabbit, which increasingly rely on independent workers, often for short-term projects. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File)\nOnly, the reality for many falls far short of the hype and the great solution has significant complications. According to a combination of third-party reports, information from the Department of Labor, and interviews with service providers, money typically falls far short of the promoted lofty heights. And because matchmakers treat them as independent contractors, service providers are on the hook for tax withholding, financial risk from being hurt on the job, and liability coverage. Forget such worker protections as workers comp insurance, minimum wage payments, and overtime.\nWall Street good doesn’t necessarily trickle down\nThe delight of high tech investors is due in large part to the basic business model. The matchmakers effectively satisfy customers without having to bear the real cost of providing the services. By insisting on using only independent contractors, not only have they isolated themselves from many financial responsibilities, but they have been able to scale up their operations quickly. Billions of dollars have been poured into the sector. Uber and Airbnb in particular have made the Fortune Unicorn list of startups that have valuations of $1 billion or more based on fund raising.\nThe great deal for the companies and their investors doesn’t trickle down to the masses on mobile phones, checking to see when the next “opportunity” presents itself.\nSara Doughty told me that she has worked through TaskRabbit in Portland, Oregon for three years, even though she has a full-time job as a database administrator. She finds that the pay for furniture assembly, moving, hauling, and garage organizing averages about $25 an hour. “It depends on how much time I have to dedicate to it and how many jobs are out there,” she said. “Apparently I’m in a smaller market and I don’t know how much advertising [TaskRabbit has] done up here.”\nPage 1 / 4 Continue", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/a05dac7213f0480a9f62bc3cd82abf2f/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://www.taskrabbit.com/become-a-tasker", "https://get.uber.com/cl/", "http://time.com/money/3714829/working-for-taskrabbit/", "http://fortune.com/unicorns/"], "published": "2015-08-04T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T13:26:19.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
