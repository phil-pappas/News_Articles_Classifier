They have allowed the managers more flexibility and reduced the number of positions they need to hold. \n• Calculator: How your investments might grow with monthly saving \n“Performance had been disappointing”, according to Ewan Lovett-Turner, director of investment trust research at Numis. \n“The trust had the same approach as now but required the manger hold 100 or so stocks. JP Morgan was rebalancing each month according to a quantitative process. \n“The change allowed the managers more flexibility and to hold onto stocks only if they were doing well. It has meant they could run their winners, and performance has improved.” \nMr Lovett-Turner said the three-year anniversary of the change has put the Claverhouse Trust on the radar of more investors who want at least that length of comparable performance. That could mean a rerating and a jump in the share price. \nThe £451m trust is currently trading at a discount of 5.6pc, which is wider than its peer group. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas \nWillliam Meadon began co-managing the Claverhouse Trust with existing manager Sarah Emly in 2012, when the changes to its mandate were introduced. \n“It has allowed us to be more focused and hold 60 to 80 stocks instead of 100. Its one of the few equity income trusts that is trading at a discount and I expect that to change,” he said. \nClaverhouse Trust can boast 42 consecutive years of rising dividends, it currently yields 3.4pc, and Mr Meadon expects this to continue. Most of its holdings are well-known FTSE 100 stocks, with the biggest holding - a position worth £20m - being Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) . \nHe said: “The trust holds dividend reserves to cover 12 months and the recent the interim dividend was up more than 11pc on a year ago. The dividend environment in the UK looks good .” \nNumis said the Claverhouse Trust was a core holding for those wanting exposure to the UK market. Its mandate means it can only under or overweight the market by 2pc for stocks and 3pc for sectors. \nDespite this, Numis said, its stock-picking had added value. It has a target of beating the FTSE All Share by 2pc a year, but is managing to beat it by 5pc at present. A favourite holding is ITV (LSE: ITV.L - news ) , the broadcaster, Mr Meadon said, while recent additions include Greggs (Stuttgart: 41G1.SG - news ) the baker. \nOver three years the Claverhouse Trust has produced net asset value total returns of 56.7pc compared with 34.1ppc for the All Share and 51.2 per cent in the equity income sector. \nIt has an ongoing charge of 0.78pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:03:06.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
