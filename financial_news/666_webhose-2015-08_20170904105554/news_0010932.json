PUBLISHED: 17:47, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:07, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 PA Wire Contactless payments are phasing out cash \nOver the past year the use of tap-to-pay technology has surged, largely replacing cash transactions of a smaller value. Next week the contactless payment card limit is to be raised from £20 to £30, taking effect on September 1, in a bid to further encourage use of the technology. At the same time Mastercard and Visa are requiring that all retailer payment terminals be updated to accept contactless. The change means that consumers are less likely to be faced with £5 or £10 minimum spend rules that are often found in bars or small shops. Four out of ten people now believe they won't need cash in the future, found a survey carried out by Lloyds Bank.

Aidene Walsh, director of commercial cards at Lloyds Banking Group said: “Industry and our own data shows use of contactless is on the up and consumers are demonstrating a preference to use it to pay for low-value items. \"Whilst certain consumers have currently said that they do not mind shopping with businesses that do not offer this facility, we would anticipate that, as more and more people become comfortable with paying through contactless, and appreciate the ease of it, expectations around retailers offering it will increase. \"Therefore, we would encourage businesses to consider whether they have the right payment terminals to meet changing consumer preferences.”Fears over the risk of fraud and contactless payments initially plagued the introduction of contactlee technology in Britain. In recent years, providers have been experimenting with new and innovative ways to secure payments and banking, including using fingers prints and heartbeats as a means of identification. The use of wearable technology, such as the Apple Watch, is also expected to change the way payment are made. However, the increased reliance upon technology leaves consumers high and dry when it goes wrong. Today HSBC is just the latest bank to suffer a glitch that has left thousands of people without expected payday cash ahead of the Bank Holiday weekend. Last month, RBS and NatWest websites went down after the provider was targeted by a cyber attack. Mr Koch said: \"Contactless payments use the same robust technology as Chip and PIN, and contactless cards have a range of additional security features built in to keep customers protected. \"Fraud on contactless cards is extremely low, at less than one penny in every hundred pounds spent, and anyone who is a victim of fraud will get their money back.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T16:29:29.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
