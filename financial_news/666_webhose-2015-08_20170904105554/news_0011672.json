The gauge rallied 3.2 per cent at 9:34 a.m. in London. Syngenta AG jumped 9.5 per cent as people familiar with the situation said Monsanto Co. has made an increased takeover offer to the Swiss pesticide producer. RSA Insurance Group Plc climbed 4.8 per cent after Zurich Insurance Group AG proposed to buy it.\nGermany's DAX Index rose 3.1 per cent after closing on Monday 22 per cent below its peak, and the UK's FTSE 100 Index added 2.6 per cent, rebounding from its lowest level since 2012. All western-European markets rallied on Tuesday.\n\"What happened yesterday was purely panic,\" said Peter Dixon, a global economist at Commerzbank AG in London. \"Investors realised it was overdone and that it may represent a decent buying opportunity. What's supportive for European markets is the ECB still pumping money into the system. And let's not forget that the European economy is an economy which is recovering from a crisis rather than going into one.\"\nGerman business confidence unexpectedly climbed in August as companies brushed off concerns that China's slowing economy will drag on global growth.\nStock Rebound Shares are rebounding after the rout started in China spread across markets, sending all but three companies in the Stoxx 600 down on Monday. The benchmark gauge of European equities plunged as much as 8.1 per cent before paring losses to 5.3 per cent.??It finished the day 17 per cent below its April record, erasing gains for the year. As of yesterday's close, 17 out of 18 western-European markets had lost 10 per cent or more from their high.\nWith the Stoxx 600 at its lowest level since January on Monday, the gauge traded at 14.6 times estimated profit, down from 17.4 times in April, after the European Central Bank began quantitative easing to support the economy. Now a technical level indicates the losses might have been too extreme and equities may snap back. That's probably what investors who poured $90 billion in European equity funds this year are hoping for.\n BHP Billiton Ltd. rallied 5.8 per cent after the the world's biggest mining company said it will increase its dividend, even with commodities near their lowest levels since 1999. Abengoa SA jumped 8.5 per cent after a report that 10 per cent of its capital increase will be in Class A shares, while the previous one was only with Class B shares. Royal DSM NV added 3.3 per cent after the??Dutch maker of nutritional products said it will cut jobs.\nRandgold Resources lost 2.1 per cent as gold fell.
