I would need to contact Treasury on this. It is an issue that falls both under our ministry and Treasury and it would only be fair that we respond to an issue where we have gathered enough details,\" Mosonik told the committee. \nThe PS said they would also wish to get more information from Kenya Airways management on its future plans. \nThe committee issued the summons to the officials even as a Senate select committee already probing the airline blamed the management for the woes that face KQ. \nKisumu Senator Anyang' Nyong'o, who chairs the committee, said poor investment decisions by the management and the high cost of its tickets had driven away passengers and eaten into the airline's revenue, skyrocketing KQ's indebtedness. \nThe national carrier last week reported a net loss of Sh25.7billion in the financial year ending March 15, 2015. \nNyong'o said the preliminary findings of the select committee had established the airline's liquidity was severely affected by the decision by management to hedge on fuel under arrangements that are not profitable for the company. \nEstablished in May, the committee has held several meetings, including two public hearings, but Nyong'o says the work is not yet complete. \n\"The prima facie evidence so far gathered shows that the airline faces major problems which the committee is looking deeply into with management as well as other stakeholders,\" Nyong'o said. \nHe summarised the challenges as expensive ticketing, which is non-competitive in the market and led to loss of passengers as well as revenue. \nRouting arrangements and partnerships also account for massive losses of revenue, particularly for lack of expansion of KQ flights on African routes.
