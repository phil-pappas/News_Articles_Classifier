Athens wants to set up a \"bad bank\" to take on the problem loans, while creditors want NPLs bundled and sold to distressed debt funds.\nOfficials also said the two sides had yet to agree on setting up a sovereign wealth fund in Greece designed to raise 50 billion euros from privatisations, three-quarters of which would be used to recapitalise banks and to decrease the debt.\nBoth sides had agreed to deregulate the country's natural gas market, sources said.\nGreek banks could get an initial capital injection soon after a bailout deal is closed of as much as 10 billion euros, even before the ECB completes stress tests, a euro zone official said on Monday.\nThe official said such tests may not be finished before October, but that it was recognised that Greek banks urgently need capital to normalise their operations.\nPopular misgivings run deep in Germany, the euro zone country that has already contributed most to Greece's two bailouts since 2010, about funnelling yet more money to Athens.\nBerlin wants a deal that includes an ambitious budget plan, a credible privatisation strategy and a sustainable pension reform, Finance Ministry spokesman Juerg Weissgerber said.\nGreek officials have said they expect the bailout accord to be approved by Greece's parliament on Wednesday or Thursday and then be vetted by euro zone finance ministers on Friday, paving the way for aid disbursements.\nThe bailout pact will be voted on in parliament as one bill with two articles - one on the loan agreement and memorandum of understanding and the second on the so-called prior actions that must be completed for aid to be released, another Greek official said. The negotiations began on July 20.\n($1 = 0.9076 euro) (Additional reporting by Karolina Tagaris and Lefteris Papadimas, writing By Michele Kambas, editing by G Crosse and Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T07:21:10.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
