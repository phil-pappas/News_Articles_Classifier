Peter Braig Share on twitter by Michael Smith Flight Centre continues to defy sceptics of its business model after upbeat outlook commentary helped the travel group claw back some of the company's heavy market losses when it downgraded earnings in June .\nFounder Graham Turner 's forecast for a better-than-expected 4-8 per cent increase in profit this year left some analysts scratching their heads as the tone of the commentary was a lot more positive than in June.\nBut Flight Centre management believes the market overreacted to the company's decision to inform the market it expected to come in at the lower end of guidance, which wiped 21 per cent of its share price.\n\"Our personal in-house view was the market reaction to that was over-egged,\" finance chief Andrew Flannery (\"Flanno\" told analysts on Thursday.\nInvestors were jittery because of management comments at the time about market share losses to low-cost carriers and online players on destinations such as Bali and the impact of Airbnb on accommodation bookings, but Flannery says these are not markets it has been focused on to date.\nSubdued trading in retail and corporate travel since the May 2014 budget meant it was one of Flight Centre's tougher years in its 20-year history.\nBut founder Graham Turner is now forecasting a 4-8 per cent increase in underlying pretax profit to $380 million to $395 million this year, which was higher than the market expected, prompting a relief rally in its shares. At 12:15pm AEDT, Flight Centre's shares were up 14.9 per cent at $37.09.\nFlight Centre's underlying profit before tax fell 3.4 per cent to $363.7 million, which was flagged in June. The market has high expectations around Flight Centre but the company continues to deliver growth despite the impact of digital technology on the traditional travel agent model.\n Fewer Australians travelling overseas during the year hit earnings although Flight Centre attributes this more to weak consumer confidence rather than the fall in the Australian dollar. Currency impacts can take months to flow through as people tend to plan holidays well ahead of time.\nTravel consultants were forced to lower commissions to stimulate demand during the year. Turner says Australian consumer confidence remans relatively subdued, but there is \"positive momentum\" in leisure travel which it calculates by the number of inquiries it receives.\nTurner has just returned from the UK where Flight Centre is expanding rapidly. He says he is also wary of a company of its size becoming a \"one-trick pony\" which he hopes to avoid by growing further into expanding markets such as corporate travel, which generated about 34 per cent of the company's turnover in the year.\nTurner likes to talk about the \"golden era of travel\" which is being driven by cheap airfares, more choice, less flying time and more luxurious experiences in the air. This was a theme in Qantas and Virgin's results this month, with both carriers pouring capital into better products and new planes.\nThere is no doubt demand for travel is going to increase but Flight Centre's challenge is fending off the new digital competitors on the scene. So far it has managed to ride out the disruption and rack up record earnings growth year-on-year. Its model is based around digital technology but combining this with the advantages of dealing with a person.\nFlight Centre is also upgrading and opening new stores and investing in IT. The company usually spends about $60 million in capex, but that will increase this year as it pours an extra $20 million into shops, head offices and an IT rollout platform.\nIn the US, sales rose 18 per cent to $2.5 billion with strong growth in corporate market. It is opening new corporate stores in Austin, Texas and Silicon Valley near San Jose, California, and new megastores in New York and Chicago. The Canadian business was disappointing in the year, though.\nThe earnings forecast includes the $11 million returned to the company after winning a case against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) .\nFlight Centre still makes most of its money from the Australian leisure market.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-27T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:02:47.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
