It is far better than developing our country based on party manifestos'. \nHe said the government must bring the citizenry on board by providing a desk at the secretariat of the NDPC where contributions from the general public would be received. \nProf. Omane-Antwi proposed that the final document should be voted upon in a referendum for it to be accepted as national in character.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T12:09:07.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
