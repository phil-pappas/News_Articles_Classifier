Penney Co. are being charged with growing the company’s online sales, which Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said Friday had “accelerated sequentially from the first quarter” and drove business to the company’s brick-and-mortar locations.\nJ.C. Penney JCP, +5.58% announced on Aug. 3 that it had hired Michael Amend to serve as executive vice president of omnichannel. He was formerly vice president of online, mobile and omnichannel for Home Depot Inc. HD, +0.61%\nIn addition, the company brought on Mike Robbins to serve as senior vice president of supply chain, starting August 10.

Penney loss narrowers and sales beat\n“They have successful track records of creating enterprise inventory networks that enabled brick and mortar and e-commerce to merge to one seamless shopping experience,” said Ellison, according to a transcript provided by FactSet. “And their backgrounds perfectly align with our long-term growth plans to become a world class omnichannel retailer.”\nEllison credited sales on JCPenney.com, which had ““accelerated sequentially from the first quarter,” with driving traffic to stores.\n“For example, over one period of our dotcom orders, customers took advantage of the ability to buy online and ship to any store they desire,” Ellison said. “This results in more physical trips to our brick and mortar locations with add-on purchases. This continues to present sales growth opportunities and is an important part of our omnichannel strategy.”\nThe retailer’s stock climbed 5.6% in afternoon trade. It has soared 31% year to date, while the S&P 500 Index has edged up 1.4%.\nIn-store pickup is becoming an increasingly important offering for retailers. Ellison said he believes it has an edge in this area because of its vast network of locations.\n“For [a retailer] with over 1,000 brick and mortar locations, leveraging enterprise inventory provides us with a great opportunity for stores to act as fulfillment centers,” Ellison said. “With stores located around the entire U.S., enterprise fulfillment increases the strategic significance of many of our brick and mortar locations.”\nAdmitting that the company is behind in the online game, Ellison focused on the company’s efforts to build its omnichannel capabilities saying that adjustments to the business model and leadership team are underway in order to better face the competition.\nRobbins will also be charged with taking a more strategic look at the company’s merchandise levels to ensure that there are fewer markdowns and inventory is at appropriate levels. Inventory for the quarter was up 5.5% year-over-year. Sterne Agee CRT analysts attributed the “heavy” inventory to the shift in the sales-tax holiday that pushed the event from July to August in some states. But that shouldn’t have much of an impact on the company for the remainder of the year.\n“Most of these tax-free [shifts] have now played out in the first two weeks of August, and we are pleased with our strong start to the third quarter,” said CFO Ed Record.\nHe said he’s confident that the company will reach its goal of 4% to 5% comparable sales growth for the year.\nSterne Agee CRT analysts said that while the company is “on the sidelines given our top-line uncertainties at JCPenney,” the company “continues to exhibit top-line momentum, and along with solid gross margin/SGA gains, JCP’s 2Q performance deserves some praise in a choppy environment for department stores.”\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T23:57:40.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
