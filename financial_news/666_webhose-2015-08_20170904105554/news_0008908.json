I was the rising star,\" jailed trader Nick Leeson said in his autobiography. Reuters Share on twitter by Philip Baker It was very early one morning more than 20 years ago. As the traders filed into the dealing room they were greeted by the unmistakable smell of smoke.\nSome were half asleep, some were probably nursing a hangover, but the smell was strong enough to prompt a few of the more responsible members of the team to ring security to raise the alarm.\nThey soon worked out the smoke was coming from the admin room out the back, where members of the dealing desk rarely bothered to go.\nIt was the sort of room that had the basics like a telex machine and a couple of photocopiers. But it also housed the accounts, with client details and all of the latest trades.\nAnd, to those in the know, it was also the room where the shredding machine was kept. It didn't take long to figure out that the source of the smell was an epic all-night session, which had left the shredding machine smouldering.\nIt all sounds like something from a Michael Lewis book and is just one of the many tall tales told about life in Sydney on a dealing desk in the 1980s and 1990s, including how one financial player was so keen to leave the country that he abandoned his Ferrari at the airport with the keys in the ignition and the motor running.\nTraders and behaviour in dealing rooms has been back in the spotlight following a landmark settlement in New York that means global banks are once again staring down the barrel of billions of dollars in fines.\nRigging of currency markets Just more than a week ago Barclays, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to pay $US2 billion ($2.73 billion) to thousands of investors affected by the rigging of currency markets.\nThere are another seven banks in this New York case who have been accused of plotting to control prices in the global foreign exchange market going back to 2003.\nThe fine is tipped to lead to more claims in London, the largest hub for trading in foreign exchange, as well Hong Kong and Singapore.\nIt all comes just six months after a record $US5.6 billion fine for manipulating the currency markets for banks including UBS, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Bank of America.\nIn July dealing rooms were also put on notice when Tom Hayes, the former star trader at UBS and Citigroup in London, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in manipulating the benchmark interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR).\nIt's a decision that would have sent shock waves through dealing rooms around the world.\nBillions of dollars in record amounts for fines against a raft of major banks since the financial crisis is one thing, but someone going to jail – with the threat of more heading that same way – is another.\nDespite the financial crisis almost causing another Great Depression no one has gone to jail for manipulating LIBOR, until now.\nThe real question many ask is how a foot soldier like Hayes gets done when other more senior executives appear to sidestep the whole issue.\nAnother cost of business Banks have spent so much money on legal costs and fines since the crisis that these days it has just become another cost of doing business.\nThere have been other high-profile cases where traders have ended up doing time for various dealings.\nIt has been more than 20 years since Nick Leeson operated a fraud account and lost £827 million ($1.77 billion), which brought about the collapse of Barings and resulted in a sentence of six and a half years in jail.\nWhen he got around to writing his autobiography, Rogue Trader , Leeson explained that life at Barings was simple: \"We were all driven to make profits, profits, and more profits ... I was the rising star.\"\nSociete Generale's rogue trader Jerome Kerviel is another who has done jail time, although he was released early after agreeing to wear an electric tag, while Kweku Adoboli, from UBS, was freed halfway through his seven-year sentence.\nAnother public face of the financial crisis was Fabrice Tourre, from Goldman Sachs, who was found guilty of securities fraud and had to pay a fine of $US825,000.\nEarlier in August Navinder Singh Sarao, the trader who regulators in the United States believe was responsible for the so-called \"flash crash\" in 2010, was released from jail after a judge granted him a reduction in his bail conditions.\nIn Australia, it has been more than 10 years since four rogue traders on the NAB's derivatives desk left a hole in the accounts, while ANZ Banking Group terminated recently the employment of one of the seven traders it stood down as part of a regulatory investigation into interest rate manipulation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-21T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T08:47:30.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
