The company said two of its so-called crash trucks, autonomously capable of following a lead car, will be on Florida roads later this year as part of a pilot program with the state’s Department of Transportation.\nThe trucks, with heavy-duty crash bars on the back and strobe lights up on top, are designed to provide a safety barrier between roadside construction crews and traffic whizzing dangerously close past them.\nThe technology used on the driverless trucks is similar to unmanned vehicle technology used by the U.S. military, said Samantha Schwartz, marketing and business development manager at Royal Truck and Equipment.\nSee also: Truck of future weds hybrid and solar technologies\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions Inc.’s KTOS, +7.71% Micro Systems Inc. powers the driverless truck’s technology, she said.\nSeveral technology and car-making heavyweights are working or are reportedly working on driverless vehicles, including Apple Inc. AAPL, +2.94% and Tesla Motors Inc. TSLA, +8.07% Most experts believe, however, that true driverless cars are at least a couple of decades away despite the advances in technology and in driver-assistance features.\nSee also: Elon Musk: Tesla ‘almost ready’ to go driverless\nAfter the end of the Florida pilot program, Royal will gather data and approach transportation departments in other states to find more work for its autonomous “crash” trucks. Such a truck, depending on its age and accessories, can cost anywhere from $60,000 to $100,000, a price range Schwartz said Royal roughly is trying to match with its autonomous vehicles.\n“Crash” trucks protect road workers, but nothing protects the drivers of such trucks. Royal is “taking the person out of the truck meant to be hit,” Schwartz said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T23:47:24.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
