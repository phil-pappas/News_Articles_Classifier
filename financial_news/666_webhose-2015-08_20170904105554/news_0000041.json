That number is expected to reach 200 billion yuan for the full year.\n\"The domestic corporate bond market for developers has a short history and issuer ratings are either double A or triple A, so there is not much difference in prices,\" said Wang Zhenhua, the chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-listed Future Holdings.\nHe said the spread was only 2 percentage points on the coupon rates paid by developers onshore, while the difference in their offshore debts was almost 10 percentage points.\nTake these two issuers as an example. Country Garden Holdings, China's No 6 developer with contracted sales of 54.5 billion yuan in the first half, was rated triple A by domestic ratings agency Dagong Global and priced its three-year three billion yuan onshore bond at 4.2 per cent per annum last week.\nChina Aoyuan Property Group, with contracted sales of 6.1 billion yuan in the January-June period, was rated double A and raised 2.4 billion yuan during the same time by issuing three-year corporate bonds paying 5.8 per cent.\nOffshore, Aoyuan paid 10.875 per cent in May on US$250 million of three-year notes, rated B-plus by Fitch. Country Garden priced its five-year US$900 million notes at 7.5 per cent, rated BB-plus by Fitch.\nEvergrande Real Estate, China's second-largest developer in terms of sales in the first seven months, is regarded as highly leveraged by offshore investors but was given a triple-A rating by domestic agency CCXR, citing its strong debt-servicing capability, large business scale, strong branding and diversification.\n\"Benchmarks for pricing are different,\" said Fitch senior analyst Wang Ying. \"There is little overlap in the investors of the two markets.\"\nChina's loosening policy and three interest rate cuts so far this year are pushing down funding costs onshore.\nBut global investors are asking for higher yields on expectations of an interest rate rise in the United States. Developers and analysts said with Beijing now allowing more debt defaults in the onshore market, pricing in the future would better reflect risk profiles of different issuers.\nIn April, Baoding Tianwei Group, a power equipment maker, failed to make an 85.5 million yuan payment on a bond issued in 2011, becoming the country's first state-owned issuer to have defaulted in more than a decade. The first defaulter was Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science & Technology in March last year.\nOffshore, Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings became the first mainland Chinese developer to miss a repayment earlier this year, although its impact to the whole sector has been offset by improving property sales in the past few months.\n Home advantage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:51:00.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
