It previously forecast stable profit. \n\"Thanks to a good commercial performance, and tight control of marketing and operating costs, the outlook for Bouygues Telecom has been revised upwards,\" Bouygues said in a statement. \nBouygues Telecom will also \"significantly\" exceed its target for 300 million euros of cost savings in 2016 versus the end of 2013, the company added. \nIn June, Bouygues head Martin Bouygues rebuffed a 10 billion euro bid for Bouygues Telecom, France's third-largest mobile operator, by Altice (ATCE.AS), the holding company of tycoon Patrick Drahi. \nHe said the unit could thrive on its own and that a sale would threaten jobs and face antitrust hurdles. \nBouygues kept its full-year targets for its construction business and private broadcaster TF1 on Thursday. \nThe family-controlled group said first-half current operating profit rose to 119 million euros from 79 million a year earlier as income more than doubled at TF1 and Bouygues Telecom pared its losses, offsetting a profit decline at its construction business. \nSales slipped 1 percent to 15.098 billion euros. \n(Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Dominique Vidalon and William Hardy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T12:26:05.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
