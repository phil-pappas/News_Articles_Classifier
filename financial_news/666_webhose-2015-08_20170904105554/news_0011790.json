Alex Ellinghausen by Alan Mitchell What can a National Reform Summit of business, unions and welfare community advocates, hope to achieve?\nIt can help alert the public to the problem, which the two newspapers hosting the summit – The Australian Financial Review and The Australian – undoubtedly will do.\nAnd it can begin to forge a working consensus about how the problem should be addressed and how the costs and benefits of reform should be shared. In doing so, it can create the political environment in which governments can act.\nThe problem, as Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said, is growth: in jobs, in incomes, in their standard of living, wealth and prosperity.\n\"Growth is important. And for a while now, there has not been quite enough growth,\" he said.\nAnd what's more, the Productivity Commission's chairman Peter Harris went on to explain, there is unlikely to be enough of it in the coming decade of weak export prices and subdued productivity growth.\nLess growth possible Indeed, added Victoria University's Janine Dixon, and the Australian National University's Ross Garnaut, there could be substantially less growth than the official projections have led us to believe.\n Dixon, a senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies, argued that the Treasury's 2015 Intergenerational Report paints a rosy picture of the future with its projected real growth of per-capita incomes of 1.4 per cent over the next 40 years.\n\"Modelling at Victoria University's Centre of Policy Studies is somewhat less optimistic, judging it more likely that real per-capita incomes will grow at slightly below 1 per cent in the future,\" she said.\n\"At this rate … it will take an additional 20 years to reach the incomes forecast by the Intergenerational Report .\"\nThe difference in the results, she explained, have come from less optimistic assumptions about productivity growth.\nWhile the Intergenerational Report assumes the average productivity growth of the last 40 years will be repeated in the next 40 years, Dixon has discounted the abnormally high productivity growth rates of the 1990s, which she says include the one-off gains from economic reform.\nGarnaut argued that mining investment based on the old Chinese growth model and electricity investment based on superseded estimates of demand growth, will yield low rates of return.\nVulnerable to shocks He also warned of Australia's increased vulnerability to external shocks if lower productivity growth undermines fiscal consolidation.\nSo there is a growth problem, and there is a well understood solution.\nThere are underlying factors that influence the strength of productivity growth, including competition and the openness of the economy.\nCompetition forces businesses to innovate and improve productivity in order to survive and increase market share. Opening the economy to trade and foreign investment increases competitive pressures and access to new technologies.\nThe Abbott government has a raft of policy recommendations from the Harper review of competition policy that would help create the environment for stronger productivity growth.\nIts anti-dumping measures should be recognised as a mistake, as should any restriction on political grounds of foreign investment in agriculture.\nThere seemed little enough overlap in the specific solutions canvassed by the main business and union participants in the National Reform Summit. But that doesn't prevent them reaching a consensus on both the need for action and on the measures that would make reform more broadly acceptable.\nFor example, reforms that increase competition in the product markets can achieve the same objectives as some industrial relations reforms, but might be more acceptable to the unions.\nAt the same time, the decline of an uneconomic industry can be made more acceptable by the provision of generous adjustment assistance, which can be justified when the adjust falls heavily on an entire region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:04:20.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
