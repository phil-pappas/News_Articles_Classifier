They said they were working without protective clothing and adequate equipment and were not being paid most of the times. \n\"We are now using bushes to relieve ourselves. The toilets are filled up and the new farmers are not building new ones,\" one farm worker said. \n\"White farmers used to treat solid human waste with acidic soda so the toilets would not fill up, but our new employers are not doing the same and they have almost ignored the development of farm infrastructure,\" added the worker. \nDr. Charlton Tsodzo, who carried out the research on the conditions of farm workers in the sugar plantations of Chiredzi and farms in Hurungwe last year, said over 20 families were sharing one pit latrine. \nHe added that most farm workers had no access to good houses, education and health facilities. \n\"The situation is bad in most farms.
