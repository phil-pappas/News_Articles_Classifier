Barclays has an \"overweight\" rating on FCA shares and a 16-euro price target on a stock currently trading around 14 euros.\nBehind the one-off boosts to FCA shares, there is a budding recovery story: Marchionne has steered Fiat and Chrysler away from the edge of bankruptcy, FCA has returned to profit in Europe and narrowed the margin gap with U.S. rivals, and new launches in popular segments have helped it to win market share.\nThe market environment in Europe is getting better too, with sales rising again after six years of declines, and the first new Alfa Romeo unveiled in June lifted some analysts' hopes that Marchionne might finally succeed in his bid to create a global brand to take on German rivals in high-margin premium cars.\nRACE AGAINST TIME\nHowever, Marchionne himself said the market should \"not fall in love\" with FCA's second-quarter numbers, adding the road to catch up with its bigger U.S. competitors was still steep.\nIn particular, FCA may have a race against time to strengthen its model line-up and finances before the U.S. car market comes off its peak. More than half of its profits were made in North America last year.\nAlthough FCA has an attractive portfolio, churning out cars from nippy Fiat 500s and rugged Jeeps to luxury Maseratis, investments in new models have only significantly picked up recently and some products promised for the U.S. market have been delayed, sources have said.\n\"The U.S. market is definitely closer and closer to a peak in volume terms and transaction prices continue to rise,\" said George Galliers, an analyst at Evercore ISI. Current margin levels were probably sustainable for another 12 to 18 months, he said, but \"if we look to 2017 and 2018, the jury is out\".\nWhile FCA's market valuation has recently been higher than most of its European peers, Galliers said the stock could justifiably trade at a similar level to other European mass-market players after the Ferrari spin-off, though at a discount to U.S. market leaders Ford and General Motors .\nFCA's enterprise value (debt plus equity) is currently about 3.9 times 2015 core earnings forecasts (EV/EBITDA) compared with 2.6 for Volkswagen and 1.8 for Peugeot, he said. Adjusting for U.S. accounting standards, he said FCA has ratio of 5.5 against 5.8 for Ford and 4.1 for GM.\nAnother challenge facing FCA is money.\nIt is the only major carmaker without positive cash flow, according to analysts, and it faces a huge cash outlay for its 48 billion euro ($53 billion) investment plan. It also has net debt of 8 billion euros, more than any of its major rivals.\nBut proceeds from the Ferrari listing will help, and the group may also be able to raise more from asset sales.\n\"FCA should sell all of its parts-making operations,\" said Richard Hilgert, an analyst at Morningstar, adding all three components businesses could yield up to 4 billion euros.\nFCA has already been approached with an offer for one of the units, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.\nMarchionne said last month there were \"no immediate plans\" to sell the unit but did not rule out this could change.\nAny improvement in its finances would help Marchionne in his attempts to find a partner to help FCA grow and share costs after a rebuff from GM, his preferred ally.\n($1 = 0.8967 euros) (Editing by Mark Potter )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:03:34.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
