However, courts have ordered state money to continue to flow for human services covered under existing consent decrees and for state payroll.\nIn their motion, attorneys for the disabled residents said Illinois failed to pay for expenses incurred in July by an Aug. 21 deadline set by the judge.\nRich Carter, a spokesman for the Illinois Comptroller's office, which pays the state's bills, said $71 million in expedited payments were made on Tuesday and that more bills will be paid \"as soon as agencies submit vouchers and revenue allows.\"\n\"We are prepared to explain to the court that we simply do not have the funds to immediately pay all organizations covered under the existing order and still meet legally required debt and payroll payments,\" Carter said. \"But we are prioritizing all payments to the best of our ability, with precedence being given to those serving our elderly, children and most vulnerable.\"\nThe disabled are not the only ones facing funding problems. Robert Thieman, executive director of the Illinois Association of Community Care Program Homecare Providers, told reporters in the state capitol in Springfield that despite a court order, providers of services for the elderly have been informed they can submit fiscal 2016 bills but those bills will not be paid until a budget is enacted.\nAlissandra Calder√≥n, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department on Aging, said the department lacks the authority to make payments without a budget, but is \"committed to helping seniors throughout the state and we are dedicated to our cause during this budget impasse.\"\nAbout $467 million in annual state funding for human services programs is covered by court consent decrees, according to Illinois Senate President John Cullerton's office.\nThe civil contempt of court motion is aimed at Illinois' comptroller and two state department heads.\n(Reporting by Karen Pierog )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T00:46:47.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
