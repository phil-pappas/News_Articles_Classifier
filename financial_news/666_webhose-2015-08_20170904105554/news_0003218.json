Indeed, as the 2014 report from BIA/Kelsey and Manta revealed, the majority of annual revenue for a small business owner is generated from loyal customers, who in turn spend 67 percent more than new customers. So how can small business owners really go the extra mile to nurture that precious (and lucrative) relationship? Read below for some best practices. \n1. Loyalty Programs \nThe most effective way to keep a customer coming back is to incentive them. And according to our most recent survey , most customers think that loyalty programs through online offers are the biggest differentiators, setting your small business apart from the competition. Not only are offers easy to create, but you can distribute them in seconds . And the best part? Retaining customers with online offers is way less costly than acquiring new ones. Lastly, not only do online offers make customers return, they also create customers who are true brand ambassadors. \n2. Follow-Up \nCommunication is key, and this is particularly true after a service is rendered and the customer has moved on.
