The campaign started from August 20, 2015 and will continue until December 31, 2015.\nBy joining the event, participants will be able to have their name engraved on Sang Sang Gil (meaning Imagination Road), located in Changwon city and take the first step towards making their imagination about Korea come to life.\nThe city of Changwon has become one of the upcoming hot spots for the artists. The Chang-dong Art Village has over 250 years of history.\nThe campaign consists of two major promotions. The first promotion runs for six weeks from August 20 to September 30, 2015. The first 23,000 applicants who successfully submit their entries will be selected to have their names displayed on the Imagination Road.\nAmong the applicants, one person per week and a total of six people, will be randomly selected and awarded with an opportunity to visit Korea for four days. The winner and one accompanying person will be given round-trip tickets to Korea, three nights’ accommodation, and a one day tour of Sang Sang Gil in Changwon and free ride on the Changwon City Tour Bus.\nAccording to Byungsun Lee, director, Korea Tourism Organization, “I would like to invite participation from all Indian travelers who love Korea and wish to visit Korea one day. I am sure that the visitors will enjoy the experience of unique cultural charms that Changwon has to offer.”\n 27, 2015 4:03 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:30:00.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
