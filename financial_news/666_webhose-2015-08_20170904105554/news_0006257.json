The IPO timetable is being finalised but it's understood marketing will start shortly.\nThe company is majority-owned by private equity firm Affinity, with Tegel management also on the shareholder register with a less than 10 per cent stake.\nStreet Talk revealed last month that Affinity had contacted investment banks, seeking pitches for the company's float.\nThe private equity investor took face-to-face pitches last week, sources said, interviewing those investment banks with a strong Australian and New Zealand equities business.\nGoldman and Deutsche, which has a partnership with one of New Zealand's biggest retail brokers Craigs Investment Partners, fit the bill.\nAffinity bought the company from Pacific Equity Partners in 2011 for $NZ605 million, trumping bids from US fund Paine & Partners and Thailand's largest private company, The Charoen Pokphand Group. Macquarie Capital advised on this deal.\nA Tegel divestment would cap a something of a purple patch for the Asia-based Affinity.\n The team, led by Brett Sutton, has closed $3 billion of Australian deals in the past 12-months, including two proprietary transactions. It identified the protein theme early and has moved on to scooping up unloved corporate spin-offs - acquiring a 35 per cent stake in Virgin Australia Holding's Velocity frequent flyer division for $336 million in October 2014, followed by the purchase of Nine Entertainment Co's Live division in April for about $640 million.\nAffinity also sold Primo Smallgoods to Brazilian meat processing giant JBS for a blockbuster $1.45 billion in November 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T10:12:16.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
