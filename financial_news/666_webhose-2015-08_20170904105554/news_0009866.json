They made the same mistake when they questioned my ‘gotra’ and the voters gave them a befitting reply in the Delhi elections,” he said.\nKejriwal was earlier today shown black flags by the protestors, who claimed to be the supporters of veteran social activist Anna Hazare, on his arrival at the Patna airport.\nThe protestors alleged that Kejriwal has betrayed Hazare.\n 27, 2015 2:54 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:58:18.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
