They are positively falling over themselves in the rush to gain a piece of land that can be converted into predominantly residential.\nSome have opted to buy old office towers and convert them into flats, whereas others buy the commercial sites and bulldoze them for housing with some retail or office underneath.\nThis is not new news, but the fact that it is spreading away from capital cities, is making an impact.\nIn the past few week sites from the inner-city areas of Green Square out to Penrith and up the coast to Gosford have been ear-marked for redevelopment and apartments are flying off the plan.\nAdvertisement As evidenced by the latest Office Market Report by the Property Council of Australia for the six months to the end of July, the office vacancy rates in capital cities and suburbs has shrunk as the older properties are converted to housing.\nAt Green Square, Crown Group launched its latest $575 million project, called Infinity by Crown Group, during a star-studded event at Sydney's Carriageworks.\nThe 20-storey, 401-apartment Infinity by Crown Group challenges conventional residential apartment design with a unique looped shape and 1180-square-metre open-air garden plaza surrounded by retail outlets, restaurants and cafes.\nCrown Group chief executive Iwan Sunitoâ€‹ said the major project was \"something completely new, something which has never been built before\".\nDesigned by Koichi Takada Architects, Infinity by Crown Group features an infinity-edge pool, spa, gym, music rooms, theatre, concierge, a roof-top terrace and sky lounge.\n On the central coast, demand is just as high.\nA Europe-based investor has snapped up a Terrigal development site for $9.5 million, representing $147,000 per unit site and the area's highest value residential development site sale in more than 15 years.\nLocated at 156-160 Terrigal Drive, the 10,059-square-metre site has been occupied by the Country Comfort Motel since the 1980s and given the high level of buyer interest in the Terrigal area recently, it was deemed an ideal time to divest.\nCBRE's Anthony Bray negotiated the sale and said the Gosford vacancy rate currently sat at only 1 per cent, according to SQM Research and had been at that level since 2010. \"This is 58 per cent lower than the Sydney CBD vacancy rate which is currently 2.3 per cent. A vacancy rate of 1 per cent, represents a significant undersupply of housing in the area and this will be exacerbated in coming years as there is currently a lack of cranes in the skyline of the Gosford CBD,\" Mr Bray said.\n\"In comparison, the vacancy rate of the Melbourne CBD is 4.2 per cent and the Brisbane CBD is 4.8 per cent.\"\nMr Bray said CBRE was also preparing to bring to the market a luxury residential development site at the highest point along the Point Frederick peninsula, with development approval for 54 apartments. Further boosting the area has been the announcement t last year that the Australia Taxation Office would pre-lease a new 6000-square-metre commercial building in Gosford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:26:47.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
