Photo: AFR\nBusiness stock remained flat in the June quarter, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, prompting some economists to revise down their estimates for gross domestic product (GDP) growth.\nThe ABS said on Monday that seasonally adjusted non-farm inventories for the three months were unchanged from those at the end of the March quarter, which had been revised up.\n Year-on-year, stock climbed 1 per cent.\nInventories feed into the expenditure measure of GDP growth, which also takes in consumer and government spending and exports. A surprising build-up of inventories helped push GDP growth in the March quarter to 0.9 per cent.\nAdvertisement Monday's inventory figures were slightly below expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise, and are likely to have a small impact on calculations for June-quarter GDP, released on Wednesday. The final figure will now depend on net exports and public sector demand, which are both published on Tuesday.\nEconomists expect quarterly growth in output of around 0.4 per cent, on average, giving year-on-year growth of 2.2 per cent. However, the spectrum of forecasts is wide, ranging from no growth to more than 0.6 per cent.\nSome already-bearish economists said after Monday's business data release that GDP growth could be flat or even negative.\n\"Ahead of Monday's news, we forecast a 0.1 to 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in second-quarter GDP,\" said Nomura rates strategist for Australia Andrew Ticehurst.\n\"We now estimate that second-quarter GDP growth was essentially flat in the second quarter,\" he said.\nUBS economist for Australia George Tharenou agreed Monday's unchanged inventory reading, coupled with the first quarter's upward revision, could translate to zero GDP growth or even contraction.\n \"Overall, our real GDP forecast is below consensus at 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter, but with the risk of a negative,\" he said.\nWestpac economist Andrew Hanlan, meanwhile, estimated the inventory drag at 0.2 percentage points. While sticking to a forecast of 0.4 per cent for June-quarter GDP growth, he said on Monday this was now \"tilted to the downside, given the unanticipated subtraction from inventories\".\nThe ABS also published sales and profits figures on Monday. Sales in manufacturing were down 0.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted, for the quarter and 5.8 per cent for the year. Wholesale sales dropped 0.4 per cent on the quarter, but rose 1.6 per cent on the year.\nCompany gross operating profits, meanwhile, dropped 1.9 per cent on the quarter and 3.9 per cent on the year â€“ in line with market expectations. The biggest drag here came from mining industries, which have been hit by falling commodity prices. Gross wages rose 1.1 per cent for the quarter, reflecting labour market growth rather than inflationary pressures.\nJP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy noted a 33 per cent cumulative decline in mining profits in the last six quarters. Profits from the remaining business segments was mixed, and in line with expectations, with wholesale trade ahead 14 per cent for the quarter, retail up 3 per cent and utilities ahead 4 per cent.\n\"The weakness in [Monday's] profits data was well telegraphed, with Australia's terms of trade moving sharply lower during the June quarter,\" he said.\nThe sales data feed into the production measure of GDP growth, which reflects output in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade and other business segments.\nThe profits data feeds into the income-based measure of growth, because they accrue to companies and investors in the form of dividends. Wednesday's final figure will be the average of the three GDP measurements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:18:55.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
