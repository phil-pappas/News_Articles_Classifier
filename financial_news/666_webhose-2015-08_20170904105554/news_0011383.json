The recent stock-market meltdown only made things worse.\nJanney Montgomery Scott In the past five years, August has sean widening spreads for high-yield (blue) and, to a lesser degree, corporate bonds (red). The high-yield market’s woes started in late June in the energy and commodities sector, as the this market consists of companies with weak credit ratings, around 13% or 14% of which are energy companies. As oil prices plunged in July, investors had already been unloading positions in companies directly affected by low commodity prices.\nBut declining global growth and the recent stock market selloff had implications on noncommodity bonds as well, according to a Bank of America report released Wednesday.\n“Although most problems for high-yield in the last year have been commodity driven, we don’t think the recent selloff presents a buying opportunity for non-commodity paper,” B. of A. analysts said.\nBank of America Spreads have been widening in all high-yield-bond sectors. The spread or yield differential between high-yield bonds and similar Treasury maturities has been climbing since mid-July to currently trade near its highest levels since the beginning of 2013.\nThe Barclays U.S. Corporate High Yield index saw its yield gain more than 100 basis points to 7.42% on Wednesday, from its lowest point this year at 6.37% on April 27. When bond yields rise, prices fall, and vice versa. Rising yields indicate that investors have been selling high-yield bonds.\nThey also indicate that “investors are demanding a higher risk premium to get involved in this asset class. ... At this yield level, high-yield, excluding energy, still looks very attractive ” said Jim Caron, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\nThe index’s total returns, which include interest payments and bond prices, was down 0.54% as of Tuesday’s close.\nHere is how the August curse has affected high-yield bonds in the previous years:\n• August 2014: Lipper recorded the largest fund outflows for a single week from high-yield corporate bonds. A total of $7.1 billion exited this asset class for the week ending Aug. 6, and the following three weeks’ inflows only partially offset this outflow.\n• August 2013: August carried over the market illiquidity that carried over the summer, following the so-called taper tantrum that sent the 10-year. Treasury yield on a nearly 100-basis-point jump.\n• August 2011: Banks came under pressure from a combination of factors, including S&P’s downgrade of U.S. debt.\nSpreads widened to their highest levels after the financial crisis.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T20:30:14.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
