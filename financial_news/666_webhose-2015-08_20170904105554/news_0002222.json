(NASDAQ:RGLD; TSX:RGL) (together with its subsidiaries, “Royal Gold” or the “Company”) reports net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders (“net income”) of $52.0 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted share, on annual revenue of $278.0 million in fiscal 2015 (ended June 30), compared with net income of $62.6 million, or $0.96 per basic and diluted share, on revenue of $237.2 million in fiscal 2014. The Company also reports record operating cash flow of $192.1 million for fiscal 2015 compared with $147.2 million in fiscal 2014. The average gold price in fiscal 2015 was $1,224 per ounce, down 6% from $1,296 per ounce in fiscal 2014. \nFiscal 2015 Financial Highlights: Revenue of $278 million, an increase of 17% over fiscal 2014 Record operating cash flow of $192.1 million, an increase of 31% over fiscal 2014 Record volume of 227,100 Gold Equivalent Ounces (“GEO’s”) 1 Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $3.33 per basic share, or 78% of revenue Cash dividends of $56.1 million, 14consecutive years of increasing dividends \nFourth Fiscal Quarter 2015 Highlights Compared with the Prior Year Quarter: Revenue of $73.6 million, an increase of 5% Operating cash flow of $43.9 million, an increase of 37% Record volume of 61,700 GEO’s, an increase of 13% Reported net income of $0.23 per share, a decrease of 12% due to a non-cash $4.1 million ($0.06/share) remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities Adjusted EBITDA of $55.2 million, a decrease of 3% \nTony Jensen, President and CEO, commented, “It is gratifying to report record operating cash flow and record volume today as our portfolio continues to deliver growth, despite a contraction in the gold price. We feel this is an excellent time in the commodities cycle to be reinvesting in our business and we’ve been opportunistic, adding several new pieces of business over the last few months, including transactions with Barrick, Golden Star Resources, Teck Resources, and New Gold, that will build on this platform of growth.” \nThe increase in total fiscal 2015 revenue compared with fiscal 2014 resulted primarily from higher stream revenue at Mount Milligan and higher royalty revenue from Cortez. Our royalty revenue decreased during the same period due to lower average gold, silver and copper prices and due to production decreases primarily at Andacollo and estimated production decreases at Voisey’s Bay. \nThe decrease in our fiscal 2015 earnings per share compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to impairment charges of approximately $31.3 million (including a royalty receivable allowance of $3.0 million) on certain non-principal royalty interests, mostly related to Wolverine, during our quarter ended December 31, 2014. The effect of the impairment charges on our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 earnings was $0.37 per basic share, after taxes. \nAdjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2015 was $216.5 million ($3.33 per basic share), representing 78% of revenue, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $202.1 million ($3.11 per basic share), or 85% of revenue, for fiscal 2014. The lower percentage of revenue reporting to EBITDA is a function of greater contributions from our streaming business, where we record our ongoing metal purchases in cost of sales. \nAs of June 30, 2015, the Company had a working capital surplus of $765.8 million. Current assets were $790.8 million compared to current liabilities of $25.0 million, for a current ratio of 32 to 1. Working capital, combined with the Company’s undrawn revolving credit facility, totaled approximately $1.4 billion in liquidity at June 30, 2015. The Company entered into several new significant transactions that, when added to existing firm commitments, totaled approximately $1.1 billion in anticipated capital expenditures thus far in fiscal year 2016. The Company plans to fund these commitments with its existing $1.4 billion in liquidity plus cash flow from operations. Before considering our expected cash flow from operations, at June 30, 2016, we would have approximately $350 million in available liquidity after all of these commitments are funded. Cash flow from operations was $192.2 million in fiscal year 2015, and is expected to increase in fiscal year 2016 (assuming similar gold prices) as three of the new transactions are expected to deliver incremental operating cash flow in fiscal year 2016. \nFor the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015, net income was $14.8 million, or $0.23 per basic share, compared with net income of $16.6 million, or $0.26 per basic share, for the prior year quarter. Revenue was $73.6 million, compared with revenue of $70.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2014. Adjusted EBITDA was $55.2 million ($0.85 per basic share), or 75% of revenue, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $57.1 million ($0.88 per basic share), or 81% of revenue, for the prior year quarter. The reduction in the revenue to EBITDA margin was due to a higher cost of sales from our streaming business. \nResults for the fourth quarter fiscal 2015 were impacted by a lower average gold price of $1,192 per ounce, representing a 7% decrease from the prior year quarter of $1,288, and higher income tax expense, partially offset by higher production at Mount Milligan and Peñasquito. Absent the higher tax expense, net income for the quarter would have been approximately $0.29 per share. \nThe Company reported an effective tax rate of 30% for the fourth quarter. In June 2015, the province of Alberta, Canada increased its corporate tax rate from 10% to 12%, resulting in the remeasurement of certain deferred tax liabilities to reflect the higher rate. The remeasurement resulted in a $4.1 million ($0.06 per share) non-cash charge to the tax expense in the fourth quarter. Absent this change in the tax law, our Q4 2015 effective tax rate would have been 10.7%. \nFISCAL 2015 AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS \nAcquisition of Gold and Silver Stream at Pueblo Viejo \nOn August 5, 2015, RGLD Gold AG (“RGLD Gold”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Precious Metals Purchase and Sale Agreement with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, BGC Holdings Ltd., (“Barrick”), to purchase a percentage of the gold and silver production attributable to Barrick’s 60% interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine located in the Dominican Republic. Pursuant to the Precious Metals Purchase and Sale Agreement, RGLD Gold will make one advance payment of $610 million to Barrick at closing of the transaction, which remains subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. Closing and funding of the transaction is anticipated within 90 days. \nBarrick will deliver gold to RGLD Gold in amounts equal to 7.50% of Barrick’s interest in the gold produced at the Pueblo Viejo mine from July 1, 2015 until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% of Barrick’s interest in gold produced thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay Barrick 30% of the spot price per ounce of gold delivered until 550,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price per ounce delivered thereafter. \nBarrick will deliver silver to RGLD Gold in amounts equal to 75% of Barrick’s interest in the silver produced at the Pueblo Viejo mine beginning on January 1, 2016 until 50.00 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 37.50% of Barrick’s interest in silver produced thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay Barrick 30% of the spot price per ounce of silver delivered until 23.10 million ounces of silver have been delivered, and 60% of the spot price per ounce of silver delivered thereafter. \nPueblo Viejo is an open-pit mining operation located 100 kilometers northwest of Santo Domingo. It is managed by a joint venture between two of the world’s largest gold producers, with Barrick owning 60% and responsible for operations and Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”) owning the remaining 40%. The mine began production in 2013, and is the only primary gold mine in the world with annual production of more than one million ounces of gold (100% basis), at all-in sustaining costs below $700 per ounce. On a 100% basis, 2014 gold production was approximately 1.11 million ounces, silver production was 3.85 million ounces, and all-in sustaining costs were $588 per ounce. Total mine proven and probable reserves 3 were 15.50 million ounces of gold and 97.20 million ounces of silver, while measured and indicated resources 4 were 10.50 million ounces of gold and 61.20 million ounces of silver as of December 31, 2014. \nAcquisition of Gold and Silver Stream at Rainy River \nOn July 20, 2015, RGLD Gold entered into a $175 million Purchase and Sale Agreement with New Gold, Inc. (“New Gold”), for a percentage of the gold and silver production from the Rainy River Project located in Ontario, Canada (“Rainy River”). Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, RGLD Gold will make two advance payments to New Gold, consisting of $100 million, which was paid at closing on July 20, 2015, and $75 million once capital spending at Rainy River is 60% complete (currently expected by mid-calendar 2016). Also under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, New Gold will deliver to RGLD Gold 6.50% of the gold produced at Rainy River until 230,000 gold ounces have been delivered, and 3.25% thereafter. New Gold also will deliver 60% of the silver produced at Rainy River until 3.10 million silver ounces have been delivered, and 30% thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay New Gold 25% of the spot price per ounce of gold and silver at the time of delivery. \nThe Rainy River Project is located approximately 40 miles northwest of Fort Frances in western Ontario, Canada. Over its first nine years of full production, the 21,000 tonne per day, combined open pit-underground operation is scheduled to produce an average of 325,000 ounces of gold per year. Permits to begin major earthworks construction are in place, and, as of mid-calendar 2015, detailed engineering is 95% complete and 14% of the total development capital estimate of $877 million has been spent. Rainy River has an estimated fourteen year mine life based on current reserves and is projected by New Gold to start-up in mid-calendar 2017. \nAcquisition of Gold Stream at Andacollo \nOn July 9, 2015, RGLD Gold entered into a Long Term Offtake Agreement (the “Andacollo Agreement”) with Compañía Minera Teck Carmen de Andacollo (“CMCA”), a 90% owned subsidiary of Teck Resources Limited (“Teck”). Pursuant to the Andacollo Agreement, CMCA will sell and deliver to RGLD Gold 100% of payable gold from the Carmen de Andacollo copper-gold mine until 900,000 ounces have been delivered, and 50% thereafter, subject to a fixed payable percentage of 89%. RGLD Gold made a $525 million advance payment in cash to CMCA upon entry into the Andacollo Agreement, and RGLD Gold will also pay CMCA 15% of the monthly average gold price for the month preceding the delivery date for all gold purchased under the Andacollo Agreement. \nThe transaction will encompass CMCA’s presently owned mining concessions on the Carmen de Andacollo mine, as well as any other mining concessions presently owned or acquired by CMCA or any of its affiliates within a 1.5 kilometer area of interest, and certain other mining concessions that CMCA or its affiliates may acquire. The Andacollo Agreement is effective July 1, 2015, and applies to all final settlements of gold received on or after that date. Deliveries to RGLD Gold will be made monthly, and RGLD Gold expects to begin receiving gold deliveries in its first fiscal quarter of 2016, ending September 30, 2015. \nTermination of Royalty Interest at Carmen de Andacollo \nOn July 9, 2015, Royal Gold Chile Limitada (“RG Chile”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into an agreement (the “Royalty Termination Agreement”) with CMCA. The Royalty Termination Agreement terminated an agreement originally dated January 12, 2010, which provided RG Chile with a royalty equivalent to 75% of the gold produced from the sulfide portion of the Carmen de Andacollo mine until 910,000 payable ounces have been produced, and 50% of the gold produced thereafter (the “Royalty Agreement”). Approximately 259,000 ounces of payable gold subject to the royalty were produced through June 30, 2015, resulting in approximately 651,000 payable ounces remaining as of that date, before the step down to the 50% royalty rate. \nCMCA paid total consideration of $345 million to RG Chile in connection with the Royalty Termination Agreement. The transaction will be taxable in Chile and the United States, with net proceeds estimated at approximately $300 million. In addition to the $345 million termination payment, a post-closing final royalty payment of approximately $9.7 million was received in July 2015, which finalized all outstanding shipments for which final settlements had not been received as of July 1, 2015. \nAcquisition of Gold Streams on Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea \nOn May 7, 2015, RGLD Gold announced signing a $130 million gold stream transaction with a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Star Resources Ltd. (together “Golden Star”), pursuant to which RGLD Gold will advance financing to Golden Star, subject to certain conditions, for development projects at certain mines in Ghana, and in return for which Golden Star will sell and deliver gold to RGLD Gold. Separate from the stream transaction, the Company provided a $20 million, four-year term loan to Golden Star and received warrants to purchase 5 million shares of Golden Star Resources Ltd. common stock. Closing of the gold stream and term loan transactions occurred on July 28, 2015, when the conditions to closing were satisfied. RGLD Gold expects to receive stream deliveries from Golden Star in the current quarter related to production from and after April 1, 2015. \nPursuant to the stream transaction and subject to certain conditions, RGLD Gold will make $130 million in advance payments to Golden Star in stages, including the $40 million upfront payment made in connection with closing, and the balance on a pro rata basis with spending on the Wassa and Prestea underground projects, which RGLD Gold expects to make over the next five quarters. Golden Star will deliver to RGLD Gold 8.5% of gold produced from the Wassa, Bogoso and Prestea projects, until 185,000 ounces have been delivered, 5.0% until an additional 22,500 have been delivered, and 3.0% thereafter. RGLD Gold will pay Golden Star a cash price equal to 20% of the spot price for each ounce delivered at the time of delivery until 207,500 ounces have been delivered, and 30% of the spot price for each ounce delivered thereafter. \nThe Wassa mine is located approximately 90 miles west of Accra and has operated continuously since 2005. Golden Star forecasts calendar 2015 production of 110,000 to 115,000 ounces of gold from the single Wassa open pit. Open pit proven and probable reserves are 831,000 ounces at 1.39 grams per tonne. RGLD Gold’s investment will fund development of the Wassa underground deposit, which has 746,000 ounces of proven and probable gold reserves at 4.27 grams per tonne. Once the underground deposit is in production, Golden Star expects average annual gold production of 150,000 ounces over the life of mine from the combined open pit and underground at Wassa. \nBogoso and Prestea are located approximately 125 miles west of Accra and have produced over 9 million ounces from both open pit and underground sources over the last 100 years. Development on the Prestea underground is already well advanced, given the advantage of existing infrastructure. Once in full production, Golden Star expects annual production of approximately 75,000 ounces from Prestea, with estimated life of mine production of 620,000 ounces. \nPROPERTY HIGHLIGHTS \nHighlights at certain of the Company’s principal producing and development properties during fiscal 2015, compared with the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, are listed below. Production for our producing properties reflects the actual production subject to our interests reported to us by the various operators or from the operator’s publicly available information. \nPrincipal Producing Properties \nAndacollo – Production attributable to our royalty interest at Andacollo decreased approximately 21%. The decrease in production is primarily due to reduced mill throughput associated with unplanned maintenance activities during the September 2015 quarter and planned maintenance activities during the March 2015 quarter. Teck expects higher mill throughput rates during the remainder of calendar 2015. \nSubsequent to quarter end, RG Chile received a post-closing final payment of approximately $9.7 million, which finalized all outstanding shipments associated with the terminated royalty agreement. \nAndacollo production resulting from RGLD Gold’s new streaming interest will be calculated on metal sales completed in the quarter (instead of provisional estimated ounces in concentrate and true-ups based upon final smelter settlements). The eleven concentrate shipments (approximately 22,900 ounces of contained gold based on provisional weights and assays) that were not final settled as of June 30, 2015 will be subject to the Andacollo Agreement. Andacollo will deliver gold to RGLD Gold within five business days following the end of the month in which final smelter settlement occurs. RGLD Gold typically sells gold over a three week period following physical receipt. Andacollo final settlements generally take 5-6 months from the bill-of-lading date. The difference in timing between Andacollo quarterly production and final smelter settlements may result in divergences of ounces between Teck’s figures and those reported by Royal Gold for future quarters. \nCortez – Production increased 140% as surface mining activity increased at the Pipeline and Gap pits, where our royalty applies, while no significant activity occurred in these areas during the prior fiscal year. Barrick has indicated that mining during the remainder of calendar 2015 will include Cortez Hills which is not subject to our interest, and Crossroads pre-stripping. As a result, production subject to our interests is expected to be lower during the remainder of calendar 2015. \nHolt – Production decreased approximately 1% as St Andrew’s reported higher tonnes milled was more than offset by lower grades during the period. \nMount Milligan – During the fiscal year, RGLD Gold purchased approximately 74,300 ounces of physical gold. RGLD Gold sold approximately 76,900 ounces of gold during the period at an average price of $1,223.77 per ounce, and had approximately 5,300 ounces of gold in inventory as of June 30, 2015. Mill performance improved in June as Thompson Creek addressed operational challenges at Mount Milligan and reported average daily mill throughput of nearly 50,000 tonnes per day, or over 80% of design capacity, in May and June. \nMulatos – Production attributable to our royalty interest at Mulatos decreased approximately 6% during our fiscal year, when compared to the prior period. Lower than plan throughput and recovery associated with milling operations negatively impacted production. Alamos expects that a new grinding circuit in the mill will reduce grind size and improve gold recovery, allowing the mill to ramp up to targeted recoveries in mid-calendar 2015. \nPeñasquito – Production increased approximately 39% as Goldcorp experienced higher sulfide ore gold grades but lower recoveries. Reported production for silver and lead decreased approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, while reported zinc production increased approximately 10%. \nIn April 2015, Goldcorp reported that it integrated its Concentrate Enrichment Process and Pyrite Leach Process into a single Metallurgical Enhancement Project (“MEP”). The MEP entered the feasibility study phase, which Goldcorp expects to complete in early calendar 2016. Goldcorp anticipates the study will form the basis of a new life-of-mine plan for Peñasquito, which could extend mine life by more than five years through increased gold and silver recoveries, result in production of higher quality concentrates, and lower mining costs through minimization of re-handling and simplified mining of complex ores. \nRobinson – Copper and gold production increased approximately 45% and 24%, respectively. The production increase was due to higher copper grade and recovery as mining returned to the Ruth pit during the second half of calendar 2014, whereas mining primarily came from the lower grade Kimbley pit during the prior fiscal year. KGHM stated that mining will continue in the Ruth pit until the December 2015 quarter, when it is expected that ore deliveries will primarily come from the lower grade stockpiled ores. \nVoisey’s Bay – Nickel and copper production decreased approximately 49% and 16%, respectively. Historically, Vale supplied us with Voisey’s Bay nickel concentrate shipment data on a monthly basis, and copper concentrate shipment data on a quarterly basis. This data allowed us to estimate our Voisey’s Bay quarterly royalty revenue for financial reporting purposes. We did not receive all of this data for the months relevant to the royalty payments due for the December 2014 and March 2015 quarters, and in April 2015 we announced our intention to recognize Voisey’s Bay royalty revenue on a cash basis, or in the period in which actual payment information is received from Vale, beginning with the June 2015 quarter. Accordingly, the revenue recognized for the Voisey’s Bay royalty for the June 2015 quarter only included positive adjustments from the estimated March 2015 quarterly revenue (approximately $3.0 million). \nWe received the first quarterly royalty payment relating to processing Voisey’s Bay nickel concentrates at Vale’s new Long Harbour hydrometallurgical plant. In response to questions concerning Vale’s determination of the Long Harbour smelter and refining charges deducted from actual proceeds to calculate the net smelter return royalty payable, Vale recently stated that the charges included “the cost of product sold, pre-operating costs, depreciation, and cost of capital,” a calculation methodology that the Company estimates could result in a substantial reduction or elimination of royalty payable on Voisey’s Bay nickel concentrates processed at Long Harbour. The Company strongly disagrees with Vale’s determination that these changes are permissible deductions pursuant to the royalty agreement and is requesting further clarification of the basis for these charges while aggressively pursuing its legal remedies. \nFull year and fourth quarter fiscal 2015 production and revenue for the Company’s principal royalty and stream interests are shown in Tables 1 and 2, historical production data is shown in Table 3, and a comparison of operators’ 2015 production estimates to actual production is shown in Table 4. For more detailed information about each of our principal royalty and stream properties, please refer to the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC and available on the SEC’s website located at www.sec.gov , or our website located at www.royalgold.com . \nCORPORATE PROFILE \nRoyal Gold is a precious metals royalty and stream company engaged in the acquisition and management of precious metal royalties, streams, and similar production based interests.
