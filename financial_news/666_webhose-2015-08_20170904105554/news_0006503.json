Sasha Wooley by Jamie Freed The release of Virgin Australia's full-year results has confirmed its domestic division has accrued significant financial benefits from the end of the capacity war with Qantas Airways. But there are signs of some thorny strategic issues on the horizon at the more budget end of the market, whether or not Virgin chief executive John Borghetti will admit to it.\nVirgin's domestic division has rapidly returned to profitability, even though it no longer includes its highly-profitable frequent flyer division within those results. Yield growth â€“ a proxy for the rise in airfares, was up 5.2 per cent for the full-year, but an even stronger 7 per cent in the second half.\nMost of that is a result of gaining more corporate and government travel and a new revenue management system, but Virgin has also raised its base fares and eliminated entirely the lowest category of fares which did not include checked baggage. Doing the latter at a time of weak leisure demand may have cost it some customers, however, as Virgin filled fewer seats and carried fewer passengers in the fourth quarter at a time when rival Jetstar's April and May domestic figures were improving on both counts.\nJetstar is also reporting record yields from sales at off-peak times of day, which indicates that price-sensitive Virgin travellers could be making a switch. For its part, Virgin argues it can afford to lose those customers and that in any case, Jetstar has been reporting yield gains as a result of Tigerair assisting by raising its fares.\nBut notably, Tigerair Australia's passenger numbers fell in the fourth quarter and it only managed to fill an increased percentage of seats by cutting its capacity, so it doesn't appear to be gaining share from Jetstar.\nPassions aside, yields demonstrate that for Australian passengers, the order of preference for airlines is as follows: 1. Qantas, 2. Virgin, 3. Jetstar, 4. Tigerair\nQantas for a long time made the mistake of assuming its customers would prefer Jetstar to Virgin when Qantas mainline was not an option. But network changes involving Qantas flying more on routes like the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast shows it realises customers had been defecting to Virgin on those routes and it is trying to win them back.\nSimilarly, Virgin now risks losing customers that would have travelled on it to Bali from Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth defecting to Jetstar on those routes rather than the Tigerair option, even if the latter is cheaper. Virgin will need to try to ensure those flyers continue the majority of their flying on Virgin even if they take the odd Bali flight with Jetstar (or in some cases, AirAsia or Garuda Indonesia).\n But in Melbourne, Virgin has also cut its direct flights to Los Angeles in the last year. Combined with the Bali move, some Melbourne frequent flyers might be re-examining whether they should switch back to Qantas. Virgin has taken a calculated risk and says it wouldn't have made these changes if it thought they would be too damaging. Only time will tell if that call is right.", "external_links": ["http://m.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-steps-up-challenge-to-virgin-on-queensland-routes-20150721-gihpe1.html"], "published": "2015-08-07T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:04:10.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
