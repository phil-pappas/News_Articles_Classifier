Unfortunately, the analysis is poor, riddled with problems, and ignores another major metropolitan region in which restaurant jobs increased in number after a recent hike in the minimum wage — data, again, from the St. Louis Fed.\nI suspect that the AEI’s apparently general opposition to minimum wage caused someone’s work to go off the rails. I’ll approach this in three stages:\nshow how the analysis of data itself was done poorly; look at the other factors hitting the restaurant industry; and examine data from the other city, San Francisco, with a different outcome To start, recognize the concern, at least, that the number of jobs could decrease under a higher minimum wage is potentially valid. It’s basic economics, really. Labor prices go up and, in theory, it might be that companies cut back on help to lower costs or they might even go out of business. That is certainly a possibility when companies have, as part of their business model, a dependence on paying people wage rates too low to reasonably live on.\nFILE – In this July 27, 2015 file photo, cook Bulmaro Sosa, right, goes over a food order with server Zachary DeYoung at an Ivar’s restaurant in Seattle.

Or both could happen, with some companies being crushed by the new conditions while others thrive. If you’re actually interested in income inequality and a sustainable economy for all, lending blind allegiance to some political philosophy or other can be a mistake. You might end up interpreting data to best support your view.\nAEI’s poor initial analysis The St. Louis Fed published data about the number of all employees at food service and drinking places in Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue. The full data runs from January 1, 1990 to June 1, 2015. AEI specifically looked at January 2002 up to June 2015 combined with the first regional minimum wage increase to $11, a step toward an eventually $15, took effect on April 1, 2015.\nThe analysis said that the decline started around the first of the year, when the state minimum wage went to $9.47. As the city minimum wage rose to $11, things got worse, with “the 1,300 job loss between January and June is the largest decline over that period since 2009 during the Great Recession.” Furthermore, national restaurant employment supposedly increased by 1.2 percent during the same period. Seattle employment overall increased by 1.2 percent, or 21,800 jobs. Non-Seattle region restaurant employment was up by 3.2 percent, or 2,800 jobs.\nIt sounds convincing on the surface. But now look at a full chart, from 1990 to June 2015, from the St. Louis Fed:\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SMU53426607072200001SA", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6a7c372d6348411792d78f9e65bfc770/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://www.aei.org/publication/minimum-wage-effect-january-to-june-job-losses-for-seattle-area-restaurants-1300-largest-since-great-recession/"], "published": "2015-08-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T09:28:51.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
