Pete Marovich by Keri Geiger The email from Kiev offered a tantalising prize: the formula for a new kind of Wall Street crime.\n\"Log-in data will be sent to the email you leave,\" the attached video said in Russian.\nSo began what authorities are calling an unprecedented scheme combining digital-age cybercrime with old-fashioned insider trading.\nFive traders in the US were arrested early on Tuesday in connection with the alleged plot, which federal officials characterised as one of the most sophisticated trading rings ever seen. The supposed take: as much as $US100 million ($137 million).\nAs authorities tell it, how the suspects pulled off their crimes seems at once mind-bogglingly complex and fiendishly simple. In essence, the overseas hackers behind the scheme stole information and built an entire online business around it - a sort of Amazon of insider trading. They even went so far as to create a video tutorial for using their illicit products.\nWorking from Ukraine, the hackers infiltrated several widely used US newswire systems and over five years purloined tens of thousands of corporate press releases before the news was made public. They then sold that market-sensitive information to a league of traders on both sides of the Atlantic, authorities say.\nIn a season of high-profile computer breaches at big corporations, the case further underscores the technological vulnerabilities of systems at the heart of the 21st-century economy. For Wall Street and the authorities who police it, the development also sends a sobering message: insider-trading schemes, as old as markets themselves, have entered a new era.\n\"This international scheme is unprecedented in terms of the scope of the hacking, the number of traders, the number of securities traded and the profits generated,\" Mary Jo White, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said on Tuesday at a press conference. The agency sued 17 individuals in a civil complaint, and prosecutors brought criminal charges against nine of them. The hackers and some defendants remain at large.\n The story begins just as another era of insider trading was reaching its climax. The email from Ukraine was allegedly sent by a young hacker there in October 2010, as billionaire Raj Rajaratnam was facing trial in the US in one of the most watched insider-trading cases since the days of Ivan Boesky. What that hacker, identified by authorities as Ivan Tuchynov, was offering was a high-tech version of the same scheme. Tuchynov, who was criminally charged, is believed to be in Ukraine.\nHackers targeted earnings reports According to authorities, the hackers used a variety of common tactics to infiltrate the computer servers of three systems used by many corporations to release news such as earnings reports, mergers and acquisitions and executive changes. They phished, installed malware, stole passwords - all to gain secret access to PR Newswire Association LLC, Marketwired and Business Wire, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, which together are used to issue thousands of corporate releases every day.\nThe information in those press releases proved highly valuable - so valuable that the hackers quickly built an online business around it. They were brazen enough that they created a video tutorial on how to access the pilfered data, according to prosecutors. The Russian-language video, which was shared by email, showed the desktop of a computer screen as a user took steps to retrieve the stolen files.\nBusiness Wire and PR Newswire said they were co-operating with prosecutors and examining their security systems. Marketwired said it also co-operated and fixed \"the issue at the heart of this matter\".\nProsecutors described lucrative trades made before quarterly earnings reports, including one, in 2012, in Caterpillar shares that netted $US1 million. The company's announcement - on a server for less than 24 hours - had been pilfered by the hackers and sold to traders. A spokeswoman for Caterpillar did not return a call and email seeking comment.\nThe 2010 email from Tuchynov was an invitation to would-be insider traders, prosecutors said. Other exchanges disclosed by prosecutors show the hackers and various co-conspirators discussing a \"proprietary trading business\" involving a \"special day trading strategy\".\nThe seemingly magical system, these people wrote, made money throughout 2012. The typical trader could expect to make up to $US50,000 a month, the emails said.\nAt one point, a would-be customer told one of the hackers that something must be wrong with his business model because he was selling information too cheaply. The hacker replied that the customer had to take whatever was offered - for now.\nThe traders developed a \"wish list\" of press releases for hackers to steal, and then quickly bought and sold shares based on what they learnt, said the indictment.\nThe hackers used middlemen to communicate with traders, said the indictment. As their business thrived, they sought to expand the operation by sharing tips on other fraud schemes and recruiting new traders and hackers through internet chats and emails.\n- with assistance from Erik Larson in New York and Chris Dolmetsch in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:14:02.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
