And it has also assigned diplomats in all our embassies for building a warm and constructive relationship between the Ethiopian Diaspora and its country of origin. \nApart from such institutional measures, the government has also taken encouraging legislative measures. Among these, the promulgation of proclamation No.270/2002, which provides Foreign Nationals of Ethiopian origin with rights and privileges to be exercised in their country of origin, directive which allows Ethiopian Diaspora to open foreign currency account in local banks, tax and custom free privileges for returnees and issuance of urban land for the construction of residential buildings are some of the measures to be mentioned. Over the last couple of years, in part due to these measures, the participation of the Ethiopian Diaspora in the socio-economic activities in Ethiopia has been steadily increasing. \nEthiopian Diaspora can play a wide and varied role in promoting sustainable development and social advancement in Ethiopia, covering different areas and social networks.

If Ethiopia is to become a major agricultural, industrial and manufacturing nation competitive to not only with its neighbors but internationally, tens of thousands and even millions of its citizens need to be better educated, better trained with international standard and more competitive in the international or global market. \nIn general, Ethiopian Diaspora occupies an indispensable strategic position that links Ethiopia with the rest of the world. With access to opportunists in the West places them in a better position to impact positively on the overall development in Ethiopia. From overseas, they are able to supply and transmit many benefits to Ethiopia. The benefits that Ethiopia now gains from its Diaspora should not restricted to the remittance but it should be broaden into active participation in the national development process. Such as, in human capital, transfer of knowledge, technology, skills and expertise as well as other benefits that can be generated from cooperation between government and the Diaspora in financial, cultural and political areas.
