Consolidated revenues of the 728 companies fell 0.95% year-on-year (y-o-y) to Rs8.19 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 2015. Lower raw material costs, mainly due to the fall in crude oil prices led to improved operating profit margins. The 700-odd companies reported a consolidated operating profit of Rs1.47 lakh crore in Q1FY16 up 10.60% from Rs1.33 lakh crore reported in the same quarter last year. The operating profit margin improved to 17.95% from 16.08% over the same period. However, net profit for Q1FY16 declined by 1.18% to Rs79,365 crore from Rs80,313 crore. Valuations defined by market-cap to sales soared by 24% to 2.36 times as on 10 August 2015from 1.90 times as on 11 August 2014. Mega-caps Of the 119 mega-caps (market-cap above Rs10,000 crore) present in our list as many as 92 companies reported a growth in revenues. As many as 53 mega-cap reported a double digit growth. This included pharma companies like Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals and banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank. Many financial services firms too reported a significant growth in revenues. On top of the list were Bajaj Finserv, L&T Finance Holdings, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Bajaj Finance. Consolidated revenues of the 119 mega-caps went down 2.65% to Rs5.55 lakh crore in Q1FY16 from Rs5.70 crore in Q1FY15. Operating profit margins improved to 19.98% from 17.54% over the same period. This led to a y-o-y operating profit growth of 10.92% in the June 2015 quarter. Had you invested an equal amount in each stock one year back your investment would have grown by 22%. This price rise was supported by improved investor sentiment. The overall price-to-earnings (PE) of the mega-caps rose by nearly 26% over the year to 23.4 times from 18.5 times a year ago. Large-caps The set of 206 large-caps (market-cap of Rs2,000-Rs10,000 crore) reported a growth of 4% in revenues. Revenues grew to Rs1.87 lakh crore in Q1FY16 from Rs1.80 lakh crore in Q1FY15. As many as 147 of the 206 large-caps, reported a growth in revenues. As many as 51 companies reported a revenue growth of over 20%. Sun Pharma Advanced Research, Gruh Finance, Welspun India, Hexaware Technologies and Gujarat Fluorochemicals are a few of the top companies on the list which reported a revenue growth in excess of 20%. Companies like Balkrishna Industries, EID-Parry, Clariant Chemicals and Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals would have disappointed investors with a decline in revenue. Consolidated operating profit of the 206 mid-caps rose 14% y-o-y to Rs28,950 crore in Q1FY16 from Rs25,432 crore a year ago. Unlike mega-caps, the consolidated net profit of the large-caps rose 14% to Rs11,111 crore from Rs9,752 crore over the same period.

The consolidated revenues increased to Rs53,028 crore from Rs51,156 crore a year ago. Operating profit increased by 2% to Rs6,184 crore in Q1FY16 from Rs6,044 crore in Q1FY15. Net profit declined by 8% to Rs1,708 crore from Rs1,851 crore over the same period. Despite the lacklustre results, over the year these mid-caps would have returned around 25%. Investors seem very optimistic as PE valuations have risen by nearly 38% to 25.3 times as on 10 August 2015 from 18.4 times a year ago. Just about 69 companies reported a revenue growth in excess of 10%. As many as 56 companies reported a decline in their top-line.

Revenues fell by 2% to Rs19,946 crore and operating profits too, declined by 9% to Rs1,563 crore. Profit margins fell as well. Operating profit margin fell to 7.84% as compared to 8.50% a year ago.
