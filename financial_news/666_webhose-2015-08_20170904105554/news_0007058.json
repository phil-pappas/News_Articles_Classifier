Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson If there is one thing to learn from Thursday's question time, it is never to open an invitation for a Liberal Party fundraiser, for only bad things can come of it.\nThe recipient of such an invitation should immediately curse it, burn it and bury the ashes, given the trouble the union corruption royal commissioner Dyson Heydon has found himself in.\nThe biggest concerns attending a political fundraiser used to be the seating plan and the threat of falling asleep during the speeches. Now attendees risk their careers and reputations.\nThe week started with the dumping of Bronwyn Bishop as Speaker because she hired a helicopter to attend a Liberal Party fundraiser.\nThen the brawling began over the Coalition's stance on a free vote on gay marriage and – even after the six-hour joint party room meeting in which the backbench majority won the day to keep the status quo for now – Abbott's most senior ministers continued to snipe at each other publicly for the rest of the week.\nWhen news broke on Thursday morning that the umpire of the government's union royal commission had agreed to give the $80-a-head Sir Garfield Barwick address in Sydney later this month, Prime Minister Tony Abbott looked like he'd rather have another marathon debate about gay marriage.\nResignation call Labor members were remarkably prepared and almost immediately flooded into the House of Representatives chamber, calling for Justice Heydon's resignation.\n By question time, Labor had worked itself up into a lather of righteousness given the fact two of its leaders, Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten, had been compelled to appear before the $80 million inquiry.\nLabor's Tony Burke attempted to censure Abbott for \"failing to immediately sack his royal commissioner and establishing a royal commission that was biased from the start\".\nBurke, using the dubious cover of parliamentary privilege, delivered a scathing assessment of Heydon himself, that few would dare utter outside parliament and risk a defamation.\n\"He is biased and he is conflicted,\" Burke said. \"Secondly, if we are to take into account the argument he has put out in his own defence and that others have put into his defence, that maybe he was unaware that it was a fundraiser, then he is incompetent.\"\nBurke reminded Parliament that former competition inquiry commission Ian Harper had also attended a fundraiser for Treasurer Joe Hockey when Harper was still finishing his own inquiry.\nStep too far Labor's shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, his lawyer's antennae a-quiver, seemed to realise Burke may have taken the trashing of a former High Court judge's reputation a step too far, and argued Justice Heydon's actions \"created the appearance of bias\".\nQuestion time became a free-for-all of shouting from both sides, with Labor's Jason Clare ill-advisedly calling Justice Heydon a \"bagman\" which he later withdrew. New Speaker Tony Smith struggled to impose his authority and was forced to eject his first MPs, all three of them Labor.\nThe Coalition's first parliamentary week back from the winter break has not been a success. It's hydra-headed problems, ranging from Liberal Party fundraisers to internal brawls over same-sex marriage, will have to be defeated to regain Abbott's goal of achieving \"good government\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-13T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:00:16.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
