Heinz, whose Heinz brand ketchup is an icon of American culture, Buffett's holding company joined forces with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , the owner of fast-food chain Burger King (EUREX: 18860462.EX - news ) . \nThe transaction was valued at $28 billion, with $12 billion coming from Buffett, known as the \"Sage of Omaha\" for his investment savvy. Omaha, the largest city in the Midwestern state of Nebraska, is Buffett's birthplace and home and where his holding company is based. \nThat transaction closed in July 2015, leaving Berkshire with about a 27 percent stake in Heinz Holding, renamed The Kraft Heinz Company (NasdaqGS: KHC - news ) after its merger with Kraft Foods (NasdaqGS: KRFT - news ) . \nChemical company Lubrizol \nIn March 2011, Buffett put $9.7 billion in cash on the table to buy Lubrizol, a specialty chemical company that notably makes lubricant additives for engine oils and additives for personal care products and pharmaceuticals. \n\"Lubrizol is exactly the sort of company with which we love to partner -- the global leader in several market applications,\" Buffett said. The transaction was completed in September that year. \nRailroad operator Burlington Northern \nBefore the Precision Castparts deal, Buffett's largest acquisition was rail operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe. The deal, announced in November 2009, was valued at about $36.5 billion, including debt. Berkshire, which owned about 23 percent of the firm's shares, bought the rest in the transaction that closed in February 2010. \n\"Our country's future prosperity depends on its having an efficient and well-maintained rail system,\" Buffett said at the time. \n\"Most important of all, however, it's an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States,\" he said. \"I love these bets.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T21:39:45.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
