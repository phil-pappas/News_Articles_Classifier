Drugs to treat male sexual dysfunction have become ubiquitous since Pfizer's Viagra was approved in 1998. Viagra generated $US1.69 billion in sales last year.\nA sexual awakening? Sprout Pharmaceuticals will sell the drug, flibanserin, under the name Addyi for women who haven't yet gone through menopause and suffer from low libido. Fairfax \"This is a transformational moment, hopefully across all of women's health care, certainly in women's sexual health,\" Cindy Whitehead, chief executive officer of Sprout, said in a phone interview. \"Our breaking through, I hope, opens the door for a variety of treatments to come forward.\"\nFlibanserin is approved for women diagnosed with a condition called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, which is low libido that causes stress. Sprout wants to make the drug available by October 17. The company will price it similarly to a month's supply of Viagra, which is about $US350 to $US400, Ms Whitehead said.\nBefore the FDA ruling on Addyi, some women's health experts had argued that the drug's associated risks of fainting and extreme sleepiness outweighed any benefit. Studies found the risks are exacerbated by alcohol and birth-control medicine.\nAddyi targets neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine that the brain uses to transmit information and can affect mood. Antidepressant drugs use similar mechanisms.\n Only small benefits In clinical trials, women who took Addyi recorded a median increase of 0.5 to one more satisfying sexual events each month than those who got a placebo. Women began the trials experiencing two to three satisfying sexual events a month. Some women experienced as many as six to eight more satisfying sexual events each month, Ms Whitehead said.\nAddyi's label will advise women to stop taking the pill if they don't respond after eight weeks, Ms Whitehead said.\nIn June, FDA advisers recommended in an 18-6 vote that the FDA approve the drug. While advisers said the pill's effect isn't as strong as they'd like, they said they voted in favour to get the first female sexual desire drug on the market and boost awareness to get better treatments on pharmacy shelves in the future.\nAbout 2 million women are currently seeking treatment for the disorder and more are expected to come forward once Addyi is on the market, said Carl Spana, CEO of Palatin Technologies, which is developing its own female sex-drive treatment.\nPalatin is in the final stages of testing its drug bremelanotide for use as needed, like Viagra, while Addyi is taken every night before bed. Palatin estimates the market for low female sexual desire treatments could total $US1.3 billion a year, based on the 2 million women known to be affected.\nPalatin could bring bremelanotide to market in early 2018, Mr Spana said. The company has had talks with larger drugmakers, which he declined to name, that would likely license bremelanotide for sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:08:49.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
