Kohl's said a delay in tax-free sales by a number of states had a larger than expected negative impact on its results. \nMerck —The drug maker's stock was upgraded to \"outperform\" from \"market perform\" at BMO Capital Markets, on increased optimism about Merck's product pipeline. \nCoty —The cosmetics and perfume maker reported adjusted quarterly profit of 8 cents per share, a penny above estimates, and revenue also beat consensus. Sales did fall for a third straight quarter, but not as much as anticipated. \nTesla —Tesla filed to offer 2.1 million common shares, to raise at least $500 million in new capital. CEO Elon Musk has indicated preliminary interest in buying up to 83,974 of those shares. \nMonster Beverage —Morgan Stanley upgraded the beverage maker's stock to \"overweight\" from \"equal weight,\" on the expectation of eventual share repurchases, and the idea that conditions leading to recent earnings weakness are temporary. \nGoPro —Cowen & Co. began coverage of the high definition camera maker's shares with an \"outperform\" rating, based on an expanding product line and new software which will increase ease of use. \nYahoo —Bernstein upgraded Yahoo to \"outperform\" from \"market perform,\" saying the current share price already reflects the worst case scenario for Yahoo's prospects. \nDillard's —The retailer earned 75 cents per share for its latest quarter, 3 cents above estimates. However, revenue missed estimates in what the company calls a \"disappointing\" performance. Dillard's pointed to weakness in the home and furniture categories, but said shoes and juniors/children's apparel were strong. \nCisco Systems —Cisco reported quarterly profit of 59 cents per share, 3 cents above estimates, with the networking equipment maker's revenue also coming in above consensus. CEO Chuck Robbins said he was particularly pleased with \"strong growth\" of deferred revenue. \nNews Corp —News Corp beat estimates by 2 cents with quarterly profit of 7 cents per share, with revenue essentially in line. However, the media company's revenue did fall below year ago levels, hurt by a strong dollar and a decline in ad sales at its Wall Street Journal and New York Post newspapers. \nComcast —Comcast invested $200 million in Vox Media, increasing its prior 14 percent stake. The NBCUniversal parent's latest investment gives Vox a valuation of about $1 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal . ( Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent of CNBC. ) \nSprint —Sprint got an additional investment from Japan's Softbank, which bought 22.9 million shares worth about $87 million. Softbank did not indicate whether it would be more shares, but plans to keep its stake below 85 percent. \nCoca-Cola , Exxon Mobil —The two Dow components are among the increased investments reported by Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates in that firm's latest 13F filing. Dalio also started new positions in Fossil , Foot Locker , and Comcast , while selling stakes in Potash , Nvidia , and Southwest Airlines , among others. \nVerizon —Verizon implements its new pricing plan as of today, in which new customers won't get discounted phones but won't have to sign two-year contracts. Current customers, however, can continue to upgrade when they sign new commitments. \nQuestions? Comments?
