Photo: Andrew Quilty\nIt's time for the half time score in this year's Australian company reporting season. Using a scale of one (atrocious) to 10 (spectacular), in aggregate those that have delivered earnings so far would come in at about 4.5 (a little below average).\nWhile we are barely at the halfway mark of reporting 2015 earnings, already there are trends emerging that don't augur well for an improvement in the broader stock market.\nThe good news is that the earnings released to date don't contain many real disasters and companies are generally increasing dividend payments by a greater percentage than they have grown their earnings.\nIf you are a shareholder looking for dividend income you would rate this reporting season to date around a seven. Photo: Dominic Lorrimer\nThe bad news is that taken in aggregate the earnings reported to date in 2015 are modestly disappointing.\nWorse still, there isn't a lot of evidence of much top line growth in sales and revenue, which has been softer than the experts had anticipated. So revenue might score only a four out of 10.\nThe weaker revenue growth clearly reflects the broader softness in the economy. Thus, it is more a reflection of the environment than poor management.\nIn recent reporting seasons (where macro-economic conditions have also been pretty sluggish) companies have been more able to take a knife to costs to boost earnings.\nThis cost out has been a theme for several years now but there comes a point when the low-hanging fruit has been plucked.\nHaving said that, one area of reduction has been in finance costs where there has been a clear trend to re-negotiating loans and in some cases whittling down debt through cash flow or equity raisings.\nCredit Suisse has noted that recent cost-out trends appear to have now dried up with cost growth exceeding revenue growth and, as a result, margins have (modestly) contracted.\nOn cost (and margins) the results to date would probably only rate four out of 10.\nHowever, dividends have been the bright spot in the reporting season for shareholders with companies increasing their dividend payout ratios enabled in part by reducing their capital expenditure.\nOn Monday Aurizon provided a perfect example of dividend largesse by increasing its underlying profit by 15 per cent and raising its dividend payout ratio to push dividends from 8.5¢ to 13.9¢ per share\nHowever, too much paring of capital expenditure can lead to longer term growth concerns.\nThe large mining companies are the most obvious examples of this trend with big cuts to capex and costs, which are being passed back to shareholders in dividends.\nIf you are a shareholder looking for dividend income you would rate this reporting season to date around a seven.\nOne of the most important features of profit presentations is the outlook statement. And in general many analysts have been a bit disappointed with what is ahead.\nUBS said \"downbeat guidance\" had been the clearest negative trend to date.\nGoldman Sachs said earnings (excluding mining) had been largely in line with its expectations but outlook commentary had disappointed with a number of material downgrades to consensus earnings per share in the new financial year. It nominated Navitas, Ansell, Downer EDI, Computershare, Primary Healthcare and CSL as falling into the bigger downgrade category\nIn a note on Monday, Goldman said that in aggregate, earnings per share growth for the 2015-16 financial year for industrial stocks had been cut by 1.5 per cent to 8.2 per cent, driven mostly by cuts to margins.\n\"We expect this trend to be on-going for the balance of the season given our view that consensus expectations of margin expansion are too aggressive,\" it said.\nThe folk at UBS were also a little underwhelmed with Australian earnings season to date, noting it was off to a somewhat inauspicious start with a clear skew toward disappointment for large-caps that have reported so far, when measured in terms of either share price reactions or consensus earnings revisions.\nUBS highlighted a few disappointments including Carsales.com (slowing second-half momentum), Crown Limited (higher corporate costs) and Telstra (soft guidance).\nBut it also nominated some good profit performances from domestic-earnings-focused companies including casino group Echo Entertainment, JB Hi-Fi, Mirvac and Fairfax Media.\nBut if there was one worrisome stand out sector it would be the banks whose earnings were now under pressure and whose challenges were more apparent. According to Citi, this was creating doubts about medium-term market earnings growth.\nBut we are only half way and there is an opportunity for some improvements as several large companies including Wesfarmers, BHP Billiton, AMP and Qantas will reveal their 2015 performance in the coming weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T09:53:24.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
