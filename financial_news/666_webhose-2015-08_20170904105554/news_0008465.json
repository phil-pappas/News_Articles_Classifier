Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd Latest NAPLAN results for 2015, released on Wednesday, show a disturbing long-term trend. Unlike primary schools, where students are achieving more in key areas, high schools are not improving.\nThe full data set from 2008, when NAPLAN was introduced, shows promising gains at primary level where there have been statistically significant improvements, including in year 3 reading and year 5 numeracy.\nBut in high school, which is where students graduate into the workforce, there has been no national improvement since 2008.\n\"The overall trend is no trend. Not much is happening,\" says Jennifer Buckingham, research fellow in the education program at the Centre for Independent Studies.\n\"If anything there's been an early year focus in our schools,\" said Ms Buckingham, lamenting that problems in literacy, in particularly, are harder to address once students are in high school.\nNAPLAN – the National Assessment Program: Literacy and Numeracy which tests children in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 – is not alone in showing Australian high schools have a problem.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's international test of 15-year-old skills, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), shows that Australian high schools have been going backwards for over a decade in maths, reading and science.\n\"Australia is falling behind in absolute and relative terms,\" said Ricky Campbell-Allen, managing director of Learning First, a social enterprise for education reform.\n And a n ew report on schooling last week from the Grattan Institute said that students entering year 7 in Australian high schools have up to a seven-year spread in achievement level, some as low as year 1 and others up to year 8.\nHowever, there is a beacon of light.\nWhile most states are making no progress in improving high school standards, Western Australia and Queensland are bucking the trend. Unlike other states they have shown statistically significant improvement since 2008 in high school NAPLAN.\nIn Queensland, year 7 results have improved in reading, spelling, and punctuation and grammar. Year 9 has improved in numeracy.\nWA has even better results with year 7 improved in two areas – reading, and grammar and punctuation – and year 9 up in three areas – reading, spelling, grammar and punctuation, and numeracy.\nRaising the standard Over the seven years since NAPLAN was introduced Queensland and WA schools have also raised the proportion of students who meet national minimum standards in reading and numeracy. In 2008 they were behind most other states but are now comparable.\nPrincipal of Mount Gravatt State High School in Brisbane, Richard Usher, said his school has achieved improved outcomes by tailoring support to each student \"clearly explaining the goals of each lesson to students, checking understanding and providing effective feedback in a consistent way across the school\".\nWA Education Minister Peter Collier attributed his state's improved high school NAPLAN results to reforms introduced last year which require students to pass the Online Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (OLNA) in year 10 in order to complete school. WA students have an incentive to do well in the year 9 NAPLAN test because if they score band 8 or higher they can skip the OLNA.\n​\"There has been a lift in year 9 NAPLAN results this year, and early indications are that the introduction of the OLNA has helped with this, by emphasising the importance of literacy and numeracy,\" Mr Collier said.\n\"The results are very encouraging, and while it may be a bit soon to attribute the improved performance entirely to the OLNA, I hope to see the trend continue.\"\nMs Campbell-Allen said Australian high schools needed to follow countries with high-performing education systems and encourage teachers to collaborate to improve their practice and their use of student performance data.\nIn these countries \"you also see a focus on high-quality initial teacher education and intensive mentoring in the early years\", she said.\nShe pointed out that the OECD's PISA data shows that, compared with some countries, there is a greater difference in how Australian high school students perform within a school, than between schools.\n\"That tells you that it matters more, not what school you go to, but which teacher you get. It suggests that a good lever to pull is to focus on teacher collaboration within a school to improve performance of teachers,\" Ms Campbell-Allen said.", "external_links": ["http://grattan.edu.au/report/targeted-teaching-how-better-use-of-data-can-improve-student-learning/", "https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "http://www.acer.edu.au/files/z-aus-x-43.png", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney"], "published": "2015-08-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:09:47.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
