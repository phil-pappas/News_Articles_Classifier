Carla Gottgens Share on twitter by Angela Macdonald-Smith Explosives maker Orica has shocked the market with a write-down of as much as $1.65 billion and a warning on profits that one analyst described as \"downgrading two years' worth of earnings in one fell swoop.\"\nChief executive Alberto Calderon blamed the write-down on \"extremely challenging\" market conditions, with depressed conditions in the mining sector and a glut of supply in the ammonium nitrate market.\nOrica shares slumped 13.5 per cent to a low of $16.29 in early trading on Friday as the market absorbed the news.\nThe news follows the gloomy profit forecast from mining services provider Downer EDI on Thursday, which sent its shares down 11 per cent. Investment throughout the mining sector is tanking amid a prolonged weakness in several key commodity markets.\nThe company, which supplies chemicals and explosives to the mining and other industries, noted that the mean estimate among analysts for Orica's 2014-15 profits of $490 million was too high, advising that the figure would fall short of that by 10-15 per cent.\nThe forecast implies a second-half loss of about $279 million, according to Shaw and Partners.\nIt also advised that profit for 2015-16 would be flat on the previous year, marking a major downgrade from the current market consensus of $559 million.\nNew culture The announcement from Orica marks a new transparency at the company that was introduced by Mr Calderon when he was appointed as chief executive to follow Ian Smith, who suddenly exited in March after incidents involving aggressive behaviour.\n\"When I was appointed CEO, the Board asked me to undertake a thorough analysis of every part of the business in the context of the challenging operating conditions facing the mining sector,\" Mr Calderon said in the statement on Thursday.\n\"This followed a commitment I made at our interim financial results to provide greater transparency to the market and bring a different style of leadership to Orica.\"\nHe said the weak market meant there was an increased need for further cost cuts and efficiency improvements and that the business review he has been carrying out was \"the first step in this process.\"\nThe slump in the market has also caused Orica to review the on-market share buyback announced only in March, which has seen $53.5 million of stock bought back so far.\nOversupply concerns Mr Calderon said the issue of oversupply in ammonium nitrate had been well flagged and the company had shown its willingness to take action, including last month's advice that production would be curtailed at the Yarwun plant in Queensland.\n\"Additionally, we are assessing a range of strategic options for how we manage our Bontang ammonium nitrate manufacturing facility in Indonesia for the medium and longer term,\" he said.\n\"While there are several options, each implies a lower asset valuation.\"\nChairman Russell Caplan described the impairment as \"disappointing\" but said it didn't reflect on the quality of Orica's broader business.\nDanny Younis, an analyst at Shaw and Partners, said that despite moves by Mr Calderon to swiftly respond to the weak market and cut costs, he \"remained concerned about the looming oversupply of explosives\" through global markets as Orica, Wesfarmers, Incitec Pivot and Chinese producers ramp up capacity.\n\"We expect the resulting pricing pressure is likely to offset most, if not all, of the targeted cost savings,\" Mr Younis said.\nOrica said it was on track to deliver about 3.75 million tonnes of explosives in the 2014-15 financial year, while volumes of sodium cyanide would rise by about 7 per cent compared to last year, slightly below the guidance given at the interim results.\nSavings from cost cutting would be above the target range of $140 million-$170 million for 2014-15, but one-off cash costs would also be higher than anticipated as the restructuring program is accelerated, the company said.\nKeeps credit rating Standard & Poor's maintained its credit rating for Orica at BBB/A-2, despite the write-down.\nIt said the company's sale of Chemstralia in March for $750 million, combined with \"the benefits of its transformation program, provide some buffer at the current rating\".\n\"Although this headroom will be reduced by the lower earnings,\" Standard & Poor's said in a statement.\nThe rating agency also welcomed Orica's decision to review its on-market share buyback of up to $400 million.\nMr Calderon said the buyback review didn't mean the company had abandoned the plan.\n\"We will talk to all stakeholders. We will talk to the rating agencies...and the board will make a decision,\" he said.\n\"We want to protect our credit rating and want to protect our dividend.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/angelamacd"], "published": "2015-08-07T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:04:58.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
