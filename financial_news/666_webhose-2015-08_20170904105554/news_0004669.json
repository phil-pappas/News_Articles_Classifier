The 10-year yields have tumbled off highs around 19 percent hit in early July when a standoff in talks between Greece and its international creditors took the country to the brink of financial ruin.\nThe optimism around Greece had little impact on other southern European bond markets, with Italian and Spanish 10-year yields edging 1.5 basis points up to 1.85 percent and 1.999 percent on some profit-taking after the market's sharp rally on Friday on falling oil prices.\n\"There's lots of positive noises coming from the Greek talks but generally most of the good news is now priced into the market,\" said Rabobank strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor.\nNegotiations on the bailout began on July 20 after Athens agreed to European institutions and the International Monetary Fund's austerity demands. A senior Greek finance official told Reuters the aim was for euro zone finance ministers to review the accord on Friday, Aug. 14.\nGerman 10-year yields were a touch higher at 0.66 percent, as were yields on other top-rated euro zone bonds.\nFalling oil prices have revived concerns about subdued inflation in the euro zone that could see the European Central Bank extend its trillion euro asset purchase programme due to end in September 2016.\nThat overshadowed a steady July U.S. labour market report on Friday that suggested the Federal Reserve could hike interest rates as soon as next month, driving all euro zone bond yields sharply lower.
