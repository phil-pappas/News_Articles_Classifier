While some progress is being made, it's clear from our research that Lord Davies is right to target the executive pipeline\". \n\"Having more women in senior executive roles will pave the way for others and ensure they're paid the same as their male colleagues at every stage of their careers.\" \nMark Crail of XpertHR, added: \"An entire generation has now worked its way through from school leaver to retirement since the first equal pay legislation came into effect in 1970, yet the gender pay gap persists, and many employers still prefer not to know just how bad it is in their organisation rather than getting to grips with the data and doing something about it\". \n\"HR and reward specialists in larger companies have a special responsibility to get this firmly on to the senior management agenda and to develop the plans needed to close the gap.\" \nThe report said pay transparency was a \"powerful driver\" for closing the gender gap. \nBritain's Minister for Women, Equalities and Family Justice Caroline Dinenage, said: \"We have more women in work than ever before, 25 per cent of boards are now made of women and the gender pay gap is the lowest on record - and whilst I am proud of the progress made, we must go much further\". \n\"This is why we will be requiring companies with 250 or more employees to publish their gender pay gap, to ensure the economy fully benefits from women's talents and fairly rewards them. \n\"I would encourage all companies to have their say on the consultation to help us eliminate the gender pay gap in a generation.\" \nTUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: \"The UK will never really address the problem of unequal pay until there are systems in place to expose and tackle the huge gap between what men and women doing similar jobs in the same workplaces are paid\". \n\"The government's move to require companies to publish pay gap information is positive, but it doesn't go far enough. We need pay transparency and equal pay audits, and a requirement on companies to act on the data to close the gap.\" \nShadow minister for women and equalities Gloria De Piero said: \"We've tolerated this inequality for too long\". \n\"We're pleased that the government has finally accepted Labour's proposals for pay transparency but they must also ensure that all the information published leads to action by tasking the independent Equality and Human Rights Commission with the job of compiling and analysing the data each year in an 'Annual Equal Pay Check' that monitors progress to end the pay gap this generation.\" \nSam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"This report reveals the worrying extent of the gender pay gap in management and senior levels. Employers need to look at how many women are at the top of their organisations and how they get there. We need to identify and address the barriers that prevent women from progressing and maintain the pipeline of talent\". \n\"One way forward would be to ensure that senior roles are advertised on a part-time basis or as a job-share unless there is a good business case for not doing so.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Abbott backs national reform summit AAP \nTony Abbott has thrown his support behind a national reform summit, admitting that not all wisdom sits with politicians. …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T04:49:24.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
