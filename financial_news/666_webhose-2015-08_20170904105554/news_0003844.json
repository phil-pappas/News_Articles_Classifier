The one place in WA where nobody complains about flight noise, the estate has two runways of 1200m and 900m.\nNoel Willing, 71, was part of a syndicate group of five farming families who pushed to have the 117ha estate approved as an airpark in the 1990s.

Real estate agent John Ricketts is selling the final four lots for $170,000 each and said the blocks were the most unusual properties of his career.\n“It’s been buyers from every walk of life, Denmark locals, retirees, Perth professionals and even a bloke from Silicon Valley,” Mr Ricketts said.\n“They haven’t necessarily been the super-elite, just ordinary people who love to fly.”\nOriginally published as WA’s first residential airpark takes off Increase ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=WA%26%238217%3Bs+first+residential+airpark+takes+off&c=MOST+neighbours+compete+over+who+has+the+flashiest+car+on+the+street.+But+at+the+Myrup+Fly-In+Estate%2C+residents+compare+notes+on+their+aircraft.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d&h=WA%26%238217%3Bs+first+residential+airpark+takes+off", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d&title=WA%26%238217%3Bs+first+residential+airpark+takes+off", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fnhocxo3-1227476467710", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/was-first-residential-airpark-takes-off-with-aviation-enthusiasts/story-fndbaln9-1227476467710?sv=ebf04f61d07e8b758cc1222306f7543d&title=WA%26%238217%3Bs+first+residential+airpark+takes+off"], "published": "2015-08-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:27:53.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
