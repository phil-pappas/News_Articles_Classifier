Jim Rice by Sarah Thompson James Chessell One of the country's most successful private equity executives, TPG managing partner Ben Gray, is preparing to set up his own firm focused on investment opportunities in an already crowded Australian market, industry sources told The Australian Financial Review .\nMr Gray, who has been joint head of TPG's Asian operations since November 2013, is expected to leave TPG once the current Asian fund is fully invested and start an Australian and New Zealand-focused private equity firm in mid-to-late 2017, sources said.\nThe Harvard-educated son of former Tasmanian Liberal premier Robin Gray, Mr Gray joined TPG in 2004 and has been a key player in some of Australia's highest-profile private equity deals, including the $3 billion purchase of hospital group Healthscope, the profitable $1.4 billion acquisition of department store chain Myer in 2006 and the failed $11 billion tilt at national carrier Qantas in 2007.\nMr Gray's probable departure from TPG would represent a significant change for the Texas-based investment giant and the Australian private equity industry.\nHis promotion to head TPG in Asia, along with the appointment of former Goldman Sachs banker Tim Dattels as co-head, helped the firm – which has $US75 billion ($101.7 billion) in capital under management – close its sixth Asia-focused fund at $US3.3 billion in May 2014. Under Mr Gray's leadership, TPG had achieved an annualised rate of return on Australian realised investments of more than 50 per cent and had been responsible for $US3 billion worth of investments, one investor said.\nMr Gray and his family had been based in Singapore since 2011 but he moved back to Melbourne in early 2014.\nIndustry sources suggested Simon Harle, who has been a key part of the Australian TPG team for the past decade and a long-term business and personal associate of My Gray's, would probably be part of a new firm.\nConsistent track record While other large offshore private equity houses that flocked to Australia in the early 2000s were stung by outright disasters, such as CVC's acquisition of Kerry Packer's PBL Media (now Nine Entertainment Co), or questionable deals like KKR's investment in Kerry Stokes' Seven Media Group, TPG established a consistent track record.\nUnder My Gray's leadership, TPG's deals have included debt-laden utility Alinta Energy, chicken group Ingham Enterprises, pet care chain Petbarn, Healthscope, commercial property services company DTZ and, most recently, DTZ's acquisition of Cushman & Wakefield, all of which have generated solid or strong returns for TPG.\nMr Gray is best known for Myer, which was a successful deal for TPG investors, returning a $1.4 billion profit in three years.\nHowever, the deal was also controversial because of the poor performance of Myer shares after the retailer's 2009 listing and the Australian Tax ation Office's unsuccessful Federal Court legal action to recover a $452 million tax bill it alleged TPG owed.\nTPG, which transferred the proceeds from the Myer deal to shelf companies in the Luxembourg and Cayman Islands tax havens, argued throughout the case that it had \"met all of its Australian tax obligations\" and \"at all times has complied with Australian taxation laws and will continue to do so in the future\".\nIt's unlikely Mr Gray's new firm would compete with the likes of TPG and KKR & Co for the huge transactions like Qantas or the Coles privatisation, also in 2007.\nSolid competition Mr Gray's track record means he would probably attract strong backing from investors if and when he sets up his own independent private equity house. There is already solid competition among Australian private equity firms such as PEP, Anchorage Capital Partners and Quadrant Private Equity.\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed in April that former Archer Capital partner Andrew Gray and former CVC managing partner Adrian MacKenzie were using the acquisition of a payroll outsourcing business from Talent2 International to set up a new private investment firm focused on healthcare, technology and technology-related companies.\nMr Gray is also a member of a power set of investment bankers that emerged from Melbourne University's Ormond College in the early 1990s, which includes Goldman Sachs' Australian head of investment banking Christian Johnston, Macquarie Capital's Australian head Robin Bishop and Credit Suisse Australian chief executive John Knox .\nMr Gray could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:05:07.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
