The slowdown in growth of M3 was attributed to a decline in the growth of Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of the banking system. \nFor banks, during June, 2015, lending and deposit rates generally decreased. The overall lending rate eased to an average of 16.07% in June, 2015 from 16.10% in May, 2015. \nThe overall time deposit rate averaged 8.89% compared with 9.01%. \nIn June, 2015 the Tanzanian Shilling (TZS) depreciated against the US dollar by 6.4% to an average exchange rate of TZS 2,082.5 per US dollar from TZS 1,957.6 per US dollar in May, 2015. \nDuring the year ending June, 2015, current account balance narrowed to a deficit of $4,091.8 million, being 22.5% lower than the deficit in the corresponding period in 2014. \"This development was largely driven by an increase in export of goods and services as well as a decrease in goods import bill,' the BoT review says. \nThe value of goods and services export increased by 9.4% to $9,398.5 million in the year ending June, 2015 from the amount recorded in the corresponding period in 2014. \nThis development was largely explained by increase in travel receipts (tourism), traditional exports (coffee, cashew nuts and tobacco) and export of manufactured goods. \nDuring the year ending June, 2015, the value of import of goods and services was $13,370.1 million compared with $13,966.2 million in the corresponding period in 2014. \nThe decrease in imports was mostly driven by decrease in intermediate goods, particularly oil and fertilizers. \nOil imports declined by 27.2% to $ 3,062.8 million, following a fall in oil prices in the world market and relatively lower import volume than in the corresponding period in 2014. \nLikewise, the share of oil import to the value of goods import declined to about 29% from 37% in the corresponding period in 2014.
