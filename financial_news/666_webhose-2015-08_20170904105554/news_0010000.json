More companies are opting for web-based software as they are easier to update, maintain and customize.\nWorkday's revenue rose to $282.7 million in the quarter ended July 31, from $186.8 million a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average had expected revenue of $274.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet loss widened to $69.4 million from $69.2 million. However, loss per share fell to 37 cents from 38 cents due to a higher share count.\nAccording to Reuters calculation -- which excludes share-based compensation, other operating expenses, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs -- the company reported an adjusted profit of 2 cents per share.\nAnalysts on average had expected a loss of 6 cents per share.\nThrough Wednesday's close, Workday's shares had fallen 11.3 percent this year.
