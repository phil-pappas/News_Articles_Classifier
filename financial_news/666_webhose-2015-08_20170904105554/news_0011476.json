The software was approved for BREEAM with the record score of 97,5 %, and helps BREEAM projects achieve 6 credits and an Exemplary level innovation credit by performing a straight forward Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). The software also supports the LCA requirements of LEED, worth up to 3 credits and an Exemplary credit in LEED v4.\n\nLCA is a process which evaluates a construction project's environmental impacts over its whole life-cycle, from materials via operating phase, including repairs and maintenance, to deconstruction. The LCA approach helps avoid sub-optimization, which may lead to an overall negative impact. This makes it also a very attractive solution to measure and reduce impacts in public construction.\n\n\"We are very proud of this recognition of our software's quality\", says Panu Pasanen, CEO of Bionova Ltd. \"The importance of LCA is growing fast in both certification schemes and regulation. This makes the usability and accessibility of LCA all the more important â€œ factors we've always emphasized. And as this recognition and others show, this does not come at the expense of quality.\"\n\nWith 360optimi, doing an LCA is easier than ever and only needs the building key components. The process can be further automated by using Building Information Model (BIM) with the One Click LCA module. This module takes the materials data from the BIM and transforms it into valid LCA results in just a few clicks. The process can be taught any applied material encoding vocabulary.\n\nThe software also supports LCA requirements and other credits for several other BREEAM schemes. Besides BREEAM and LEED, the 360optimi platform has dedicated applications for a range of other certification schemes and LCA standards. Support for DGNB is also coming soon. \n\nAbout Bionova \nBionova is the developer of 360optimi and One Click LCA, the leading easy-to-use cloud-based sustainability metrics solutions.
