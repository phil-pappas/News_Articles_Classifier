We want them to succeed,\" she said. \n\"But there are processes that we need to be going through and I guess we have to wait for that.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Home price rises slowed in August AAP \nWinter has slightly cooled the Australian property market, with the pace of growth in housing prices across the …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T12:51:13.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
