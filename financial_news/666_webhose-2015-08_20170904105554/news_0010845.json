It's not actually based on facts,\" Montana said. \n\"I think [as] South Africans, we've got to look at the issue. If someone doesn't agree, the Public Protector may not agree with the way in which Prasa has done certain things but it doesn't mean that the way they've done them is corruption, or is irregular, or is maladministration. \n\"That is very important and I think that is also another principle that I want to test in a court of law.\" \nIf that principle was not defended, the country was going to have a problem, Montana said. \n\"...People who run companies, who make choices, who make trade-offs... then would be accused because somebody is not happy with them, with the way in which it's done. \nMontana widely implicated in report \n\"I was the CEO of the company. In some instances, you'll remember we've seen the framework of law, on policy and the Constitution. You must make the choices that are there. \n\"I found that in fact in real terms there's nothing other than the drama that she has created and I want to demonstrate that in a court of law so that is tested properly.\" \nOn Monday, Montana was widely implicated in Madonsela's report on maladministration at Prasa. \nIn 2012 the SA Transport and Allied Workers union reported allegations of corruption and tender irregularities at Prasa to the public protector. \n\"About 17 tenders and contracts collectively exceeding R2.8bn were specifically identified by the complainant for investigation of supply chain irregularities, including non-competitive processes, cronyism, scope creep, cost overruns, overpayment and fruitless and wasteful expenditure,\" Madonsela said at the release of the report on Monday. \nMadonsela said she held numerous meetings with Montana and his lawyers which were chronologically outlined in the report titled \"Derailed\". \nThe report directly implicated Montana on eight charges. \nMontana was dismissed as CEO on July 16 amid allegations the state-owned entity put millions of rands into new diesel locomotives which did not conform to South African rail line standards. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T14:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T15:31:17.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
