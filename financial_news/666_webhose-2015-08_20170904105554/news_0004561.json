A few months later, Shin's younger son, Dong-bin, who runs the much larger South Korean operations, was promoted to co-CEO of Lotte Holdings, the group's Tokyo-based holding company, Lotte Group said. \nAt the time, analysts and the media said Dong-bin's promotion was a sign that he would succeed his father. But on July 27, the patriarch flew to Tokyo with elder son Dong-joo, and fired his younger son and five other board members, Lotte Group said. A Lotte Holdings spokeswoman declined to comment on any aspect of the dispute. \nDays later, Dong-bin's Seoul-based Lotte Group issued a statement questioning the independence of the patriarch's actions. \"Former vice chairman Shin Dong-joo and some family members arbitrarily took the general chairman, who is aged and has difficulty in movement and judgement, and induced a verbal dismissal announcement,\" the statement said. \nSince then, both sons and their supporters have continued to challenge each other's claims to the empire. \nThe succession spectacle has fueled the resentment of many Koreans over the grip the chaebol hold over the economy. Some have also criticized Lotte's ties to Japan, Korea's former colonial ruler. \nThe office of Lotte founder Shin did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Shin Dong-joo could not be reached for comment while a spokeswoman for Lotte Group declined to comment on Dong-bin's behalf. \n(Additional reporting by Se Young Lee in SEOUL and Tom Wilson in TOKYO; Editing by Tony Munroe and Miral Fahmy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T19:04:02.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
