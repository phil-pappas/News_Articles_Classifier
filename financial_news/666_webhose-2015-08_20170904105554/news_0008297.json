All times in ET/GMT) The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its July policy-setting session, which will be parsed for clues on the interest rate debate. The Fed may well hike rates in September, and changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S. economy, and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels.

Brain Cornell, who took over as CEO in August last year, has focused on core categories such as baby, kids and wellness products and exited the money-losing Canada business.

While strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States are likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies.

Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly above analysts' average estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems.

Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.
