We plan to open 150 kidswear stores or outlets over the next five years,\" he said. \nTrading space grew by 7.7% as the store network was increased to 747 following the opening of a net 44 new stores and the addition of 62 stores from the Earthchild and Naartjie acquisitions. \nThe store footprint in the rest of Africa was increased to 44, with four outlets opened in Namibia and two each in Ghana and Zambia while two stores were closed in Nigeria. Retail sales outside South Africa increased by 13% and now comprise 3.8% of the group's retail sales. \nOn the outlook for the 2016 financial year, Mark said: \"We feel that the credit environment is steadily improving despite the current tough economic climate.\" \nCapital expenditure of R767 million is planned, with the majority to be invested in buildings and distribution facilities, as well as store development and renovation. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:21:54.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
