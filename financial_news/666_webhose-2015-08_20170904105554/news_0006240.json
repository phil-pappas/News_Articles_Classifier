Inflation is very low this year. For the most part, the limits in 2016 will stay the same as in 2015. 401k/403b/457 Elective Deferral Limit \n401k/403b/457 contribution limit will stay the same at $18,000 in 2016. If you are age 50 or over, the catch-up contribution limit will also stay the same at $6,000 . \nIf you are self-employed, the total employer plus employee contributions to all defined contribution plans by the same employer will stay in the same at $53,000 in 2016. SIMPLE 401k and SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limit \nSIMPLE 401k and SIMPLE IRA plans have a lower limit than 401k plans. It will also stay the same at $12,500 in 2016. If you are age 50 or over, the catch-up contribution limit will also stay the same at $3,000 . Traditional and Roth IRA Contribution Limit \nTraditional and Roth IRA contribution limit will stay the same at $5,500 in 2016. The age 50 catch up limit is fixed by law at $1,000 . Deductible IRA Income Limit \nThe income limit for taking a full deduction for your contribution to a traditional IRA while participating in a workplace retirement will stay the same in 2016 at $61,000 for singles and $98,000 for married filing jointly. The deduction completely phases out when your income goes above $71,000 for singles and $118,000 for married filing jointly, the same as in 2015. \nThe income limit for taking a full deduction for your contribution to a traditional IRA when you are not covered in a workplace retirement but your spouse is will go up by $1,000 in 2016 to $117,000 for singles and $184,000 for married filing jointly. The deduction completely phases out when your income goes above $132,000 for singles and $194,000 for married filing jointly, both up by $1,000 in 2016. Roth IRA Income Limit \nThe income limit for contributing the maximum to a Roth IRA will go up by $1,000 in 2016 to $117,000 for singles and $184,000 for married filing jointly. You canâ€™t contribute anything directly to a Roth IRA when your income goes above $132,000 for singles and $194,000 for married filing jointly, both up by $1,000 in 2016. You can still do a backdoor Roth IRA in such case. All Together", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:32:43.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
