The agency expects growth to slow to 6pc a year by the end of the decade and that the slowdown will only be managed “thanks to significant policy support”. \nAn unexpected move last week by the People’s Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) (PBoC) to devalue the yuan - also known as the renminbi - unnerved financial markets and analysts alike, some of whom have suggested that policymakers are hoping to stabilise growth with an export-led push . \nAlready the range and size of measures introduced by Beijing “has been broader and larger than we expected”, Moody’s said, suggesting that China “is weaker than we previously assessed”. \nThe ratings agency said that the central bank’s actions had “added concerns about what it may portend for China’s economic growth”. \nActing as the global stabiliser had left China “battered and bruised”, claimed Mr King, formerly HSBC's chief economist. Despite faltering global demand and the weakness for exports which that entailed, China allowed its currency to appreciate tremendously after the crisis. \nChina acted a “shock absorber for the global economy, a punch bag seemingly able to soak up the recessionary blows that would otherwise have totally derailed global growth”, Mr King said. China’s stabilising actions have led to an overheated property market, a build-up in debt, and a roller coaster ride for the stock market. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) it appears to have abandoned its role and taken tentative steps into the arena of “currency wars”. \nAs Japanese and European central banks have weakened their own currencies, they have raised the cost of imports and fended off damaging deflation . \nMr King said: “To the extent that a weaker yen and euro imply a stronger renminbi, it looks as though the world economy has been engaged in a game of deflationary pass-the-parcel. \n“The country that finally gets to unwrap the prize is the loser, not the winner.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T04:13:10.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
