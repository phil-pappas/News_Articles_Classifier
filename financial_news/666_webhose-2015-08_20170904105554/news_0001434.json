Advantage Funding serves commercial and vocational vehicle operators, dealers and manufacturers nationwide. Macquarie's complementary leasing and financing expertise is conducive to the strategic growth plans of both companies, according to Al Damiani, Advantage Funding's president and CEO. Advantage Funding, founded in 1997, got its start by providing financing for commercial vehicles, such as ambulances, limousines and motor coach buses. In recent years, however, Damiani said, the firm has rapidly expanded to meet the needs of operators and dealers of vocational trucks typically used in municipal, industrial and construction operations. The acquisition by Macquarie will enable Advantage Funding to build on the strength of its streamlined operations to provide a broader spectrum of products and services to our customers. Advantage Funding also has a robust inventory of refurbished vehicles and consignments. The vehicles are maintained and sold at an Advantage Funding-owned facility in Brookhaven, NY.Macquarie Group is a global financial services provider with offices in 28 countries.
