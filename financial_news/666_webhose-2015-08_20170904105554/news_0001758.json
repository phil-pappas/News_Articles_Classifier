Participants also answered a series of questions about their relationships and how committed they felt to their partners.\nShe followed up six months later to find out if they were still together.\nResults showed that certain Facebook self-presentational elements were positively linked to participants’ relationship commitment and their likelihood of staying together with their partner: being listed as “in a relationship,” posting photos with their partner, and writing on their partner’s wall.\n“The claims people make about themselves in public are likely to be very influential in how they think about themselves,” said Toma.\n“Now we’re finding that these public self-presentations performed on Facebook also affect how people feel about a relationship partner,” Toma said.\nThe reason why public self-presentations on Facebook are linked with how couples think about themselves might be the same as why people engage in public declarations of love via weddings, Toma said.\n“People declare their love, they make vows in front of friends and family, they take photographs, and they exchange rings,” she said.\n“Online claims are very meaningful psychologically, and I think a big reason for that is the access to this diverse and wide audience,” she added.\nToma also found that having more mutual friends on Facebook was negatively associated with relationship commitment.\n“We think that having more mutual friends signals having a greater social network, and this greater network might include more alternative romantic partners,” Toma said.\nThe study was published in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 11:03 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T18:29:07.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
