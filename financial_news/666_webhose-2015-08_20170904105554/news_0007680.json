Thank you for your help. This column is a fantastic resource for people like me who are trying to understand the ins and outs of superannuation.\nA: The simple answer is yes, a 64-year-old can make a $540,000 non-concessional (after-tax) contribution to super by triggering the three-year bring forward rule. If you are not working, that will be the last non-concessional contribution you will be eligible to make as you will need to meet the work test for all contributions over 65.\nNotwithstanding, if you or other readers want to turbo-charge things a little, consider this exciting example (I know, I get truly excited abut this stuff!). I had a client turning 65 on July 15 this year who is still working and thus meets the work test rules for those over 65 (working 40 hours in 30 consecutive days).\nIn my client's case, we recommended she make a $180,000 non-concessional contribution in the financial year to June 30, 2015 and then another $540,000 after July 1, 2015. Because she is still working, the contribution may be received in the financial year in which she turns 65 rather than before she turns 65 so she had the rest of the financial year to raise the funds, although she'd sold a property and had the cash available. Had she not been working, the contribution would have to have been received before her birthday on July 15.\nNot only were we able to ensure a maximum non-concessional contribution of $720,000 but we also squeezed in the $35,000 concessional (pre-tax) contributions across both financial years. The $35,000 concessional contributions reduce taxable income by the same amount, thus reducing capital gains tax or taxable income from the sale of a property.\nAll these funds will now be able to be invested free of capital gains tax, earnings tax and income tax inside an account-based pensions structure, thus saving tens of thousands in tax and providing her with an income stream for life.\nPerhaps you're in a similar position, but seek advice is my advice.\n Q: I understand that the pre-tax contribution to super is tax-reportable at the end of financial year. But how about the after tax contribution to an SMSF, is it tax-reportable too?\nA: The pre-tax contribution – or concessional contribution (15 per cent tax is deducted within your super fund) – is reportable in your tax return. The non-concessional contributions are not.\nThe non-concessional contributions are free of tax and therefore do not effect your taxable income.\nThe concessional contributions, however, will affect your taxable income. If you're self-employed, they will reduce your taxable income. If you're employed, the amounts over your 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee also may be counted towards your social security assessable income or other benefit arrangements as relevant to the Australian Taxation Office, Department of Human Services or other departments that may need to track your taxable income.\nQ: I am 55 and have a self-managed super fund with about $150,000. I would like to transfer one of my investment properties from my own name to the fund. I am the only member of the fund. Some people say it is fine, as I am the only member of the fund, while others say it is not allowed. Could you advise if it is workable to transfer my existing investment property from my name to my SMSF?\nA: A very popular question indeed in the middle of a property boom. Unfortunately, I may have bad news for you. The only properties that can be transferred into a self-managed super fund are properties that are classified as \"business real property\".\nBusiness real property is defined in Section 66 of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act (SIS Act) as being a property used \"wholly and exclusively in one or more businesses\". This may be ideal for small or medium businesses to buy their premises and operate their businesses and own the premises in their SMSF.\nBut it precludes the ability to transfer residential properties. However, if you are professional property investor with multiple properties and your job is to manage those properties, there may be a case for classifying those properties as business real property. Although the cost of transferring a multitude of properties would probably be prohibitive in terms of contributions caps, capital gains and stamp duty.\nFor other readers interested in summary points on property in DIY super funds:\nYou can buy a new residential property in an SMSF. You can borrow money to buy a residential property. You may not use borrowed money to renovate the property You may not use borrowed money to subdivide or develop a property You may transfer a residential property out of your fund to pay a retirement benefit but not to pay a pension. Property transferred to an SMSF must be valued at commercial levels. If you are transferring a business real property, you must meet the super contribution laws and not exceed your contribution caps.
