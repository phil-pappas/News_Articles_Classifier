The bank believes the group is “well-positioned to deliver strong earnings growth and value over the medium term, assuming a sustained macro recovery and employment in the US”. \nHowever, as the US remains the best-performing business in the group, Ami Galla, of Citigroup, warned “the shares may pause in the near term, held back by worries around slowing construction growth in the US and impact of interest rate hikes on US households”. Analysts reckon the group’s healthy balance sheet and market share gains, through network expansion and extensions to product lines, will boost medium-term value. \nIn June, Wolseley, the world’s biggest supplier of plumbing and heating equipment, posted a 12.3pc rise in revenues from ongoing business for the third-quarter to £3.3bn, boosted by robust performances in the US and UK. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) jumped by 93p, or 2.2pc, to £43. \nIn the broader market, Britain’s benchmark index was relatively flat, off 0.4 points at 6,550.30, despite a continued slump in commodity prices which weighed heavily on the index. As copper prices came under further pressure, mining companies slid to a six-year low in early trade, before recouping some losses. \nAhead of full-year results next week, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) slipped 16.5p, or 1.4pc, to £11.34 after Deutsche Bank (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) revised its target price down from £14.60 to £14.40. Liberum also slashed its target price to reflect the falling oil price, as analysts expect further aggressive capital cuts amid concerns the miner will fall “well short” of covering its dividend. \n“With oil and copper prices down 29pc and 10pc since July, the key takeaway from full-year earnings will be how it prioritises its capital expenditure plans, credit rating and progressive dividend,” Richard Knights, of Liberum, said. \nMeanwhile, Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) hit a fresh low as two brokers lowered its target price ahead of Wednesday's half-year results. Exane BNP Paribas cut its target price by 24pc to 260p, while Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) also reduced it to 260p. \nLast week, six brokers targeted the troubled miner slashing target prices or downgrading the stock , after China devalued its currency and fears intensified about the miner’s ability to maintain its 'BBB’ credit rating. \nNick Hatch, of Canaccord Genuity, said “one of the biggest challenges at present is retaining its credit rating and servicing the large debt position required for the trading business”. The stock closed 1.6pc lower at 170p. \n* US activist builds Glencore stake Elsewhere, reports tour operator TUI AG (LSE: TUI.L - news ) is considering spinning off non-core assets with a turnover of about $3.3bn, helped the stock creep 19p higher to £11.81. Separately, following robust half-year results last week, Deutsche Bank raised the stock’s target price to £13.85 from £12.35. \nShipbroker Clarkson sank 195p, or 7.1pc, to £25.56 despite delivering a strong set of interim results, which saw revenues grow 30pc to £145.3m . However, Andi Case, chief executive, said the “sudden shift in oil and commodity prices” had created both opportunities and challenges across the broking and banking businesses. Panmure Gordon responded by prudently trimming forecasts on the back of capital markets weakness. \nBovis Homes (LSE: BVS.L - news ) also found itself among the laggards, down 38p at £11.63, as half-year results showed a modest level of progress . Pre (Shanghai: 600048.SS - news ) -tax profit jumped 9pc to £53.8m, while average sales price 10pc higher than last year. \nHowever, Rebecca O’Keeffe, of Interactive Investor, questioned whether the lure of property will wane: “With UK interest rates set to move higher in the coming months and the buy-to-let budget changes making the sector slightly less attractive, the big question for investors is whether the UK property market will continue to prove as attractive”. \nOver on Aim, despite the board of Cellcast (LSE: CLTV.L - news ) confirming “there is no truth” in speculation that it is in talks with Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) , shares leapt 45.5pc to 1.6p. The UK-based broadcasting company became the subject of an internet blog which suggested Google was looking to use it for an online gaming platform. However, the company quickly denied the rumour, saying they knew “no reason for the share price rise”. \nRed Emperor Resources nosedived 64.6pc to 1.2p after it announced its Hawkeye-1 exploration well, offshore in the Philippines, had failed. Finally, troubled insurance outsourcer Quindell (Xetra: M6FA.DE - news ) crept 3.2pc higher to 96p following the appointment of Indro Mukerjee as chief executive .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:11:12.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
