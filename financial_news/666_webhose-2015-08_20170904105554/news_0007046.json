The People's Bank of China on Monday , set the yuan's midpoint at 6.3969, a touch firmer than the previous session's fix of 6.3975.\nOil prices fell to near six-year lows, keeping inflation expectations subdued and adding downward pressure on yields.\nSpanish 10-year bond yields fell 5 basis points to 1.97 percent. Italian and Portuguese yields were down by a similar amount at 1.77 percent and 2.38 percent, respectively.\n\"The eurogroup agreement ... for Greece has helped sentiment and risk markets have stabilised somewhat,\" said Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets.\nGerman 10-year Bund yields were a touch higher at 0.66 percent.\nCommerzbank rate strategist Michael Leister expected them to climb towards 0.75 percent, given the relative stabilisation in Chinese markets and the Greek bailout being on track.
