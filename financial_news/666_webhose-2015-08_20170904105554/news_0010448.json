Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan The ACTU has urged Treasurer Joe Hockey to consider increasing the number of tax brackets as part of a measures to reduce bracket creep and increase workforce participation.\nIn a 20-page policy blueprint arising from the National Reform Summit, the ACTU has also urged the government to take a leading role in the productivity debate by devising a program to lift the the skills of nation's managers.\nOutlining broad-ranging proposal to change the tax system, the ACTU's draft document says any review of the personal income tax base should include consideration of the impact on workforce participation, incentives of bracket creep and additional tax brackets.\n﻿ ACTU president Ged Kearney told The Australian Financial Review on Thursday that the government should not be \"relying on bracket creep to fix its budget woes\".\n\"We know the average worker, including teachers, nurses, police and fire fighters, can ill afford an extra $1200 in tax a year because of bracket creep,\" she said.\n\"But Joe Hockey's proposal to deal with bracket creep by cutting income tax rates is an attempt to buy votes – not good policy. The summit clearly identified the need to tackle tax reform as a whole of system package, not just piecemeal policy that has little or no effect on growth.\"\nUnions argue the personal income tax system has become \"less progressive\" in recent decades due to cuts to the top marginal tax rate from 65 cents in the dollar to 45 cents, while the bottom tax rate has increased from 15 to 19 per cent and the number of tax brackets has been reduced from seven to four.\n\"Instead of trying to buy votes with populist tax cuts, the Abbott Government could consider increasing the number of tax brackets as a way of making income tax more equitable while still generating the public revenue we need,\" Ms Kearney said.\n \"This is the sort of sensible debate we need to have on tax but unfortunately the government can't seem to produce anything beyond three-word slogans.\"\nThe ACTU blueprint argues productivity must be addressed by improving management skills and business systems and processes.\n\"Australian management is relatively unqualified compared to other OECD countries, despite leadership and management capability being widely recognised as critical to productivity in the workplace,\" it says.\nIt recommends the government work with unions and employers on pilot programs \"that make clear the leadership, culture and management practices required for high performance practices to succeed\".\nMs Kearney welcomed the summit's focus on productivity.\n\"For years we have had employers arguing that we need to cut wages to improve productivity when labour is not the cause of slowing productivity growth,\" she said.\n\"So I was glad to see the discussion move beyond that at the summit to look at management capability and business processes.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-27T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:49:40.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
