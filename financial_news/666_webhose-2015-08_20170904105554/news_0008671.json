Now, however, the company is branching out – it is capitalising on the data it holds on its merchant customers by offering them short-term loans.The move follows the successful completion of a €60m funding round for the company, led by Intel Capital and Zouk Capital, which already have stakes in iZettle. The idea is to offer its small business customers the opportunity to borrow relatively small sums against their future sales, with the debt then repaid automatically via deductions when those sales are made using iZettle’s equipment.It’s a smart idea. iZettle already knows a huge amount about its customer base, courtesy of the trading data generated by sales going through its systems for every client that uses them. That enables the business to pre-assess acceptable lending limits for individual customers – and to offer them the funding without any application or assessment process.The company has also built safeguards into the system. By asking for repayments calculated as a percentage of future sales, borrowers should only be paying back what they can afford – if sales fall back, so will the size of their repayments.The model is a variation on the revenue loan theme – relatively new to Europe, this form of finance is a much more established feature of the funding ecosystem for US small and medium-sized enterprises. The concept works best where businesses have relatively stable and predictable revenues, but iZettle’s window into its customers’ trading activities gives it a major advantage over other lenders, which need to source data on prospective borrowers’ revenues before deciding whether and how much to lend.The company has yet to unveil full details of its offer, which it is pitching as iZettle Advance. The loans have already been trialled in Sweden and the company says it will roll the service out across its European markets “gradually”. But information on pricing is sketchy and the company says only that the typical merchant would be able to borrow one to two times their average monthly sales.The loans won’t require collateral and there won’t be a fixed repayment term, since the amount borrowers will repay each month will depend on the sales.There’s no doubt iAdvance offers something new to European small businesses – and demand is likely to be strong. In the US, payments business Square launched a similar offer last year and the company says take-up has been rapid.The company is pitching the loans as a solution to businesses’ cashflow problems, offering finance to help small firms expand their stock, for example. It is also tapping into the increasing willingness of small businesses to look beyond traditional bank lenders for finance, with take-up of alternative funding solutions such as peer-to-peer loans and crowdfunding now soaring.\"We have aimed to build a financing service that's completely tailored to the needs of small businesses,” says Carl-Richard Häggman, iZettle's Chief Risk Officer. “The service allows for small businesses to make the necessary investments in their operations, on their own terms and with minimal administration.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T21:32:26.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
