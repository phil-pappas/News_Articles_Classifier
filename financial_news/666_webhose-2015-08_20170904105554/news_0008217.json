Production of the mid-size Regal sedan is likely to shift from Canada to either China or Europe in 2017, they added. \nBuick is also planning to add two new U.S. models from overseas plants: The compact Cascada convertible, which will be imported early next year from Europe, and the compact Envision crossover, which will be imported from China in late 2016. \nNews of the U.S. arrival of the Envision, which went into production last year in China, was reported on Monday by Automotive News. Buick unveiled the Cascada earlier this year at the Detroit auto show. \nOne other Buick model, the subcompact Encore crossover, is currently imported from Korea. Production is eventually expected to shift to China, the sources said. \nBuick is planning these production shifts as GM begins contract talks in Detroit with the United Auto Workers. \nIn Detroit, Cindy Estrada, head of the UAW's GM department, said the automaker would be \"tone deaf\" to import vehicles from overseas \"after the sacrifices by U.S. taxpayers,\" as well as union concessions, to create a profitable GM after a government-funded bailout in 2009. \nThe LaCrosse is being redesigned next spring, with production moving to Hamtramck outside Detroit. \nThe Enclave is slated to be redesigned in early 2017. Production is expected to remain in Lansing, Michigan. \nChina is the largest market for the Buick brand, with sales last year of 919,582 vehicles, more than four times the 228,963 vehicles that Buick sold in the United States. \n(Editing by Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T23:37:10.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
