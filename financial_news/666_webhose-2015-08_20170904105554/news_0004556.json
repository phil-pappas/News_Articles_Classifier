The company did not name any underwriters in the prospectus it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe deal will mark at least a partial exit for its owners, private-equity firm Ares Management and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which bought the company in 2013 for $6 billion. The sellers were private-equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus LLC, which had taken the company private in 2005 in a $4.9 billion deal.\nThe company includes the namesake Neiman Marcus stores, 41 of them across the U.S., 43 Last Call outlets and online channels; the upscale clothing store Bergdorf Goodman, which has two outlets on New York City’s Fifth Avenue and a website; MyTheresa.com, which has a flagship store in Munich, Germany and “appeals to younger, fashion-forward, luxury customers, primarily from Europe, Asia and the Middle East”; according to the prospectus; Horchow, a luxury home furnishings brand; and CUSP, a luxury brand targeting a younger consumer with five stores and a website.\nStocked with well-known labels like Chanel, Gucci and Prada alongside up-and-coming designers, the company touts its special position among the high-fashion set.\nHere are seven things to know about Neiman Marcus ahead of the IPO:\n“Our customers are educated, affluent and digitally connected.” Neiman Marcus IPO prospectus It is operating in a fickle world As TV show “Project Runway” tells us, in fashion, one day you are in, the next you’re out. Neiman Marcus cautions that just as the economy can be unpredictable, so too is the cutthroat world of fashion.\nMore than being on trend, Neiman Marcus needs to be ahead of the curve to keep customers from shopping elsewhere, according to its prospectus. Maintaining strong partnerships with designers and using those relationships to create marketing opportunities is critical.\nSo is having a good eye for where fashion is headed. Apparel is ordered six to nine months in advance of sale; jewelry and other merchandise, three to six months. If items don’t move, they are marked down, which can impact the company’s profit margins.\nNeiman Marcus had $4.8 billion in revenue for fiscal 2014, up from $4.6 billion in fiscal 2013 and from $3.7 billion in 2010. Its 43 full-line stores generated $589 in sales per square foot for the year ending May 2, 2015.\nIt’s not planning to pay dividends any time soon For now, the company has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock.
