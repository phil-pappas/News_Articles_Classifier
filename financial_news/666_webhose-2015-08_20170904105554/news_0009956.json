The governor extended that deadline to Sept. 8 because government officials were focused last week on the possible impact of tropical storm Erika, which broke up before making land. The report’s been labeled as an economic recovery and fiscal adjustment plan crafted by top administration officials, known as the Working Group, and outside legal and financial experts from Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Millstein & Co. The commonwealth and the island’s power authority, known as Prepa, have already spent more than $60 million on law firms and consultants for guidance on ways to reduce their debt loads.\nThe administration, which has failed to win Congressional approval for the use of bankruptcy, hasn’t said when details will be released to the public.\n“I’m a little concerned that we still might not get a lot of answers,” said Mikhail Foux, a municipal-debt strategist at Barclays Plc in New York.\n“Maybe we’ll actually hear their thinking about what specific entities will be more affected.”\nPuerto Rico’s fiscal adjustment plan may include recommendations to reduce labor costs, boost revenue collections and inject $1.5 billion over five years into infrastructure improvements, according to local reports. Such changes may still require about $2.5 billion of debt relief each year, according to Daniel Hanson, an analyst at Height Securities, a Washington-based broker dealer.\nGarcia Padilla ordered the debt-adjustment plan in June and said the commonwealth was unable to repay all of its obligations. Prices on Puerto Rico bonds have sunk, with the securities losing 10.7 percent this year through Aug. 28, the worst for the period since at least 2013, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The broader municipal-bond market has returned about 1 percent in 2015. General obligations with an 8 percent coupon and maturing July 2035 traded Friday at an average price of 72.7 cents on the dollar, down from 77.3 cents on June 26, the last trading day before the governor said Puerto Rico can’t repay all its debt.\nPuerto Rico and its agencies owe $72 billion, including $13 billion of general-obligation debt. A restructuring would be the largest-ever in the $3.6 trillion municipal-bond market. The commonwealth defaulted Aug. 3 when one of its agencies failed to pay $58 million of principal and interest after lawmakers declined to allocate the money because of a budget crunch. The island’s economy has struggled to grow for 10 years and its 11.9 percent jobless rate is more than double the level on the U.S. mainland. It’s population of 3.5 million is projected to lose another 240,000 residents by 2025 after already shrinking by 7 percent in the past decade.\nHere are the important dates as Puerto Rico moves toward a unprecedented restructuring:\n* Aug. 31: A $90 million loan between the commonwealth’s Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, the island’s main water utility, and Banco Popular comes due. Prasa, as the agency is known, said last week it is in discussions with the bank regarding the deadline after the utility failed to sell $750 million of bonds in August. Proceeds would have repaid the loan.\n* Sept. 1: Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority, or Prepa, which supplies most of the electricity on the island, must reach an agreement with bondholders, insurance companies and banks on how to address nearly $9 billion of debt and modernize a system that relies mostly on oil to produce electricity. If not, a forbearance agreement that keeps negotiations out of court will expire. The parties first signed that accord a year ago and have extended it six times.\n* Sept. 8: The Working Group is set to give the governor an economic recovery and fiscal adjustment plan after missing an Aug. 30 deadline because of tropical storm Erika.\n* Sept. 15: Even if Prepa and its creditors agree to a debt-restructuring plan on Sept. 1, the forbearance contract ends unless the parties decide to extend it.\n* Oct. 1: The Working Group plans to send to the legislature portions of its economic recovery and debt adjustment plan that would require approval from lawmakers. While the governor and leaders in the legislature are all members of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, any potential changes in labor laws and benefits or reducing services may not be popular with voters.\n* Dec. 1: The Government Development Bank, which extends loans to the commonwealth and its localities, and other agencies owes $467 million of principal and interest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n* Jan. 1: The island faces $958 million of principal and interest payments due on general-obligation bonds, Prepa bonds & other securities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Puerto Rico in July began suspending monthly payments to a fund that repays general-obligation debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T17:06:09.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
