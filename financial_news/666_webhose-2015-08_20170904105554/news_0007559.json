From humble beginnings, founder Andrew Keene began his blog, KeeneOnTheMarket, as a blog for retail traders in 2011. Mr. Keene quickly expanded the site’s trading curriculum to better meet the needs of active traders in his audience. Media outlets quickly picked up on Andrew’s market insight, which led to numerous appearances on CNBC, Bloomberg and the Chicago Board Options Exchange.\nToday, what AlphaShark Trading is best known for is its flagship product, the Live Trading Room. Mr. Keene began the live trading room speaking for a few hours during each day’s trading hours to a small audience. Demand for live trading expertise quickly grew, and the Live Trading Room now features 8 full hours of live audio and visual commentary from 5 professional traders, each of whom is an expert in his own field. The AlphaShark Live Trading Room has over 500 paid members and subscribers from across the globe.\n“With a wealth of expert traders, we simply outgrew KeeneOnTheMarket,” stated founder Andrew Keene. “The AlphaShark brand will allow for our team to continue to grow, serving members worldwide with services for futures, stock, options, and even VIX Traders.\"\nThe Catalyst for AlphaShark Trading\nAlphaShark Trading offers 4 unique packages for trade and options updates and insights, and its audience base is continuously spreading across the globe.\nTo better reflect the site’s growth, KeeneOnTheMarket will henceforth officially be known as AlphaShark Trading. This rebranding initiative will convey AlphaShark Trading’s curated suite of services and the extensive knowledgeable background of its many contributors.\nAlphaShark Trading will continue to deliver the same precise, actionable trade ideas to its audience, and we look forward to members’ continued participation in the AlphaShark Trading community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:14:57.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
