Peter Rae by Ruth Liew Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia has reported a net profit of $113 million for the six months ended June 30 - a 25 per cent plunge from 2014, as it remains cautious about the outlook for housing markets impacted by the slowdown of the mining boom.\nThe lenders mortgage insurance giant, which has a market valuation of $2.3 billion, declared an interim dividend of 12.5c per share and a special payment of 18.5c per share for investors.\nThe group's underlying net profits hit $133 million, which was steady from the prior corresponding period.\n\"The business delivered a solid first-half performance in line with the prior period, demonstrating the continued resilience of the business in the face of a dynamic economic environment and mortgage market,\" Genworth chief executive Ellie Comerford said.\n\"The business is responding to these dynamics by focusing on risk management and the execution of our strategic priorities to deliver long-term returns to shareholders.\"\nGenworth suffered higher losses from delinquencies in Queensland and Western Australia - two states that have suffered from the slowdown of the mining boom. The group's reported net profit was affected largely by an unrealised mark to market loss on its bond portfolio.\nCLSA insurance analyst Jan van der Schalk argued the group's underlying earnings were impacted by the loss of a major contract with Westpac Banking Corp, and a lower mix of 90 to 95 per cent LVR loans written in the business.\nHe said there was also increasing pressure for Genworth's biggest client, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, to pull the plug on its contract with the group. CBA accounts for 41 per cent of Genworth's premium revenue.\n \"Special div of 18.5c reflects both capital release post losing WBC contract as well as lower LVR loans being written. Bottom line is that while they have maintained guidance as below, loss/slowing top line will affect future earnings growth,\" CLSA said.\nMs Comerford however said \"we certainly believe that the appetite to make sure that there is external coverage is still there\" from bank and lender customers.\n\"We still certainly do believe that's something that the lenders are being very vigilant about monitoring particularly in the face of the increased surveillance of all regulators,\" she said.\nGenworth controls around 41 per cent market share of the Australian LMI market, and renewed its contract with National Australia Bank in June for a further two years.\nOther than the unwelcome but \"not altogether surprising\" pick up in WA and Queensland delinquencies, Genworth's results were broadly in line with UBS' expectations.\nRoss Curran, insurance analyst at CBA said Genworth delivered a \"chunky\" special dividend.\nHe said the company remained in control of a strong capital position, and said that the fall in reported NPAT was due to bond weakness associated with the Grexit.\nRyan Fisher, analyst from Goldman Sachs, said Genworth still had around $300 - $500 million in surplus capital above its target range, suggesting there could be further opportunity for capital management initiatives for the rest of 2015.\nThe LMI provider remains cautious about its outlook for sectors that area affected by the slowdown in the mining boom.\nThe insurer reiterated its full-year guidance, and to post net earned premium growth of up to 5 per cent for 2015.\nGenworth shares have risen 6.5 per cent in the past 12 months to $3.58, compared with the benchmark S&P/ASX200's 2.9 per cent gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:13:57.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
