The workers have regretted their decision and are now demanding that their collective agreement should be restored since they are fed up with management's treatment,' he stated. \nThe regional officer of ICU also pointed out that management of the company had agreed to negotiate with the union for an increment in their existing salary before they would absorb other allowances due the workers. \nAs at the time of leaving the location, management and ICU were in a meeting to find a lasting solution to the problem. \nFrom Vincent Kubi, Tema", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:23:56.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
