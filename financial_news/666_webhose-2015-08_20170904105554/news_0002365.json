Photo: Bloomberg\nIt was supposed to be the year when big miners proved their worth as yield stocks, but despite a boost to shareholder returns in February, 2015 could be the year when shareholders fall out of love with the progressive dividend policies of BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.\nWhile neither company has shown signs of changing the way they calculate dividend payments, large shareholders have started to doubt the \"progressive\" approach, which guarantees that dividends will never be lower than the year before.\nWith commodity prices slumping badly, miners have been slashing their spend on projects and exploration in a bid to continue paying the dividend, but those efforts may no longer be enough.\nPhoto: Bloomberg\nMost analysts believe BHP cannot fund the dividend it will pay to shareholders in August, out of internal cashflow and will have to increase its debt to meet its commitments.\nAdvertisement Rio Tinto may be in a similar boat but BT Investment Management analyst Brenton Saunders said Rio could avoid using debt if it cut spending even further.\n\"We battle to model a scenario where BHP can internally fund its own dividend,\" he said.\n\"This is exactly the time when progressives don't make sense.\"\nBHP and Rio have reiterated in recent times that progressive dividends are their fundamental promise to investors, with all other spending considered discretionary and forced to fit around that promise.\nMr Saunders said the strategy limits the miners' ability to invest in new deposits or acquisitions when asset prices and labor costs are low, and instead tempts them into investment when prices are high.\n\"Arguably the companies are doing themselves a disservice by setting themselves up to be pro-cyclical in investing in the next cycle, by underinvesting now at a time when you might be looking to be a bit more opportunistic. It almost reinforces that whole notion that we have all been so critical of, which is pro-cyclical investing and investing in capacity at exactly the wrong times,\" he said.\nTheoretical debates stoked While analysts are expected to stoke such theoretical debates, what's more surprising is that a growing number of big shareholders are of a similar mind.\nAustralian Foundation Investment Company is a top 10 shareholder in both BHP and Rio, and managing director Ross Barker said buying assets for growth would be a better reason to increase debt than simply paying out higher dividends.\n\"We are not particularly keen on them increasing their levels of debt, particularly to pay a dividend. I think our view is they should have been more generous when the cash was coming in,\" he said.\n\"We are not against dividends by any stretch, it is just that it doesn't make sense at the bottom of the cycle to be increasing debt. We would rather see at this point of the cycle if they were going to increase debt to be buying distressed assets rather than just using it to pay dividends.\n\"We don't think the company should have any problems in being able to pare it [the dividend] back if the alternative is going into debt, particularly if they are committing to go into debt for a considerable time just to maintain the dividend.\"\nMr Barker is not the only shareholder with doubts; representatives of Nikko Asset Management and Aberdeen Asset Management have also raised doubts about using debt to pay a progressive dividend, particularly if the tactic is maintained over multiple years.\nCiti does not expect BHP and Rio to need debt for dividends long term, and predicts they can cover their shareholder returns from cashflow in the 2017 financial year.\nBut that will ultimately be determined by commodity prices.\nMore challenging for the less resilient The situation is even more challenging for scores of miners around the world, which are less resilient than BHP and Rio.\nPeabody Energy reluctantly announced this week it was suspending quarterly payments to shareholders, while Brazilian miner Vale said on Friday the size of its dividend was dependent on free cash flow generation, and many analysts are expecting a cut.\nWith the superannuation needs of Baby Boomers are still the dominant force in the market, dividends will remain an essential part of any company's appeal, particularly in the unfashionable resources sector.\nRio Tinto's highly volatile share price over the past 30 months demonstrates that fact, with the stock surging around February and August (when dividends are paid) before falling sharply in between those payments.\n\"While yield provides support, it does not create a floor,\" Citi analyst Clarke Wilkins said in a recent note.\nMr Saunders said a dividend payout ratio, where a certain percentage of annual profits are devoted to dividends, was more appropriate in such a cyclical industry.\n\"It gives you a chance to pay more when you can, it gives you a chance to pay a minimum when you can't really afford it, and the size of the dividend waxes and wanes quite predictably with the fortunes of the business,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:09:12.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
