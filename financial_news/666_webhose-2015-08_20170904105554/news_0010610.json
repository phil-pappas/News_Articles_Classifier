I have a well-thumbed paperback, and so does Woody Allen – one imagines.\nIn Allen's Irrational Man , Joaquin Phoenix plays Abe Lucas, a renowned professor of philosophy who has come to teach at the small campus of Braylin. We are told, time and again, how brilliant Abe is, but he is suffering from depression dressed up as \"an existential crisis\", brought about by the state of the world and his futile efforts to effect positive change. His only consolation is to keep swigging whiskey from a hip flask.\nAbe's Weltschmerz exerts a powerful, romantic appeal on science professor Rita Richards (Parker Posey), and grade-A student Jill Pollard (Emma Stone). Apparently there's nothing sexier than a brooding, swarthy, pot-bellied philosopher with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Rita is not even discouraged by the discovery that Abe has been impotent for the past year. She knows, as he says, that \"it's not a physical thing\" but a symptom of his self-torturing cogitations.\nRita is eager to escape a loveless marriage, while Jill's boyfriend, Roy, is one of those squeaky clean, super bland types that turn up regularly in Allen's movies, providing contrast for Abe's dark and dangerous persona. Although Jamie Blackley's Roy may be devoted to Jill, he is utterly boring. While protesting how much she loves her boyfriend, she is soon throwing herself at Abe, who stoically resists.\nMeryl Streep's portrayal of a veteran rocker in Ricki and the Flash is amazing – and so is the knowledge that she learnt to play guitar especially for the title role, writes film reviewer John McDonald. The resistance is all a bit of a tease, as Jill and Abe are inseparable. She makes little effort to disguise her infatuation to either Roy or her parents, who are both music professors.\nThe turning point comes when Jill and Abe are sitting in a cafe, and overhear a woman telling her friends how she is about to lose custody of her daughter because of a corrupt, unethical judge. Suddenly a switch is thrown in Abe's head. He realises he has a mission in life – an opportunity for action rather than reflection. His mission is to kill this Judge Spangler (an allusion to Spengler, who wrote The Decline of the West ) allowing the anonymous woman a fair hearing, and ridding the world of a villain.\nAlmost immediately, he cheers up. His impotence and gloominess vanish, and he begins the long-delayed affair with Jill, while also sleeping with Rita. His challenge now is to commit \"the perfect crime\" – an ambition more in keeping with a pulp criminal than a philosophy lecturer. His rationale is that he is acting in a highly moral way, to correct an injustice.\nThe rest of the story is concerned with Abe's plans for committing murder, and the consequences. I can't say any more without revealing the plot.\n Energising evil Naturally he turns to Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment for inspiration, sharing Raskolnikov's belief that murder may be justified if the purpose is a worthy one. He might have paused to reflect that matters didn't turn out well for Raskolnikov, but for Abe the idea of murder is linked with a joyous re-entry into the stream of life.\nBy this one act he feels he may bring meaning to his otherwise pointless existence. From considering the \"problem of evil\" in relation to Heidegger and the Nazis, he obtains firsthand experience of evil's energising qualities.\nBy Allen's up-and-down standards, Irrational Man ranks as one of his more engaging recent efforts, with enough suspense to hold us to the end. The problem, as usual, is the dialogue, which remains horribly stiff and contrived.\nI've often wondered how a director of such obvious intelligence manages to produce scripts that sound as if they were written in a second language. It may be that Allen is so eager to finish each project and move on to the next that he makes little attempt to refine the dialogue to make it sound more natural. By focusing on the ideas behind the story he allows every character to become a mere piece on the director's chessboard.\nThis has the secondary effect of rendering his characters \"thoroughly and completely problematic\" to the viewer. Whatever magnetism Abe exerts on Jill and Rita, he remains an unpleasant, self-obsessed bore. For a famous intellectual his philosophical allusions are painfully crass. The nadir is a conversation with Jill in which he begins: \"Simone de Beauvoir once posited, quite correctly ...\"\nAs for Jill, she comes across as a highly educated airhead, whose studies have made no impression on an immature, petit-bourgeois view of life. She is, incidentally, another of Allen's young heroines who feels an irresistible attraction to an older man. One sympathises with the actors trying to animate these roles.\nThe fact that the movie ends with a triumph of normality over Abe's Übermensch fantasies may be interpreted as a sign of Allen's pessimism, or simply cynicism. The disjunction is exacerbated by a score that continually beats out a few bars of \"I'm in with the in crowd\" on jazz piano. It's a peculiar soundtrack for an existential crisis.\nLife comes calling It often seems Woody Allen can't make up his mind whether he wants to make a feel-good film or a feel-bad one. No such indecision characterises Jonathan Demme who, in Ricki and the Flash , has created a movie to make middle-aged audiences believe all hope is not yet lost.\nIt is a film that owes everything to a daredevil performance by Meryl Streep, as a 60-ish rocker who keeps the dream alive every night, playing covers in a San Fernando Valley bar with her equally venerable band. There was a time when Ricki Rendazzo dreamt of rock stardom, but now she doesn't even cover costs, having to work in a supermarket to pay the rent. She is involved in a lukewarm affair with her lead guitarist, Greg (former Aussie Rick Springfield), but has been alone too long to give herself to any grand passion.\nRicki once had another life, which comes rushing back via a phone call from her ex-husband, Pete (Kevin Kline). Their daughter Julie (played by Streep's actual daughter, Mamie Gummer) has been dumped by her husband, and is entrenched in the family home in Indianapolis in a state of despair. The situation calls for a mother's love, even though Ricki – who formerly answered to the name Linda Brummell – was never much of a mother.\nShe will soon get confirmation that her children have yet to forgive her for running off to Los Angeles to pursue the rock'n'roll lifestyle, leaving them in the care of their workaholic father. Her replacement was Pete's second wife, the formidable Maureen (Audra McDonald), a homemaker from out of the textbook.\nJulie is now an angry, bitter mess. The older son, Adam, is gay, while the younger, Josh, is engaged to a snooty girl from a well-heeled Indianapolis family. Pete and Maureen's household is a mansion in a gated community – a bastion of middle-class affluence into which Ricki descends like a bomb, with a too-young hairdo, leathers, tattoos and guitar. In this milieu she is the ultimate embarrassing parent and house guest. Weirdly, she is also a Republican diehard, more right-wing than her uptight hosts.\nRock redemption This catastrophic clash of values provides the comedy, with Ricki being torn between the impulse to flee and the desire to disrupt this bastion of middle-class liberalism. Kline's Pete is far from one-dimensional. He retains his affection for Ricki after all these years, and is even prepared to get stoned with her and Julie, who is gradually rejoining the human race.\nMeanwhile Greg keeps pushing Ricki to give up her stubborn ways and move in with him. It is only after returning from Indianapolis and getting back on stage that she begins to take his proposals more seriously.\nThe last scenario sees Ricki and Greg as the odd ones out at Josh's wedding. Surrounded by disapproving faces they have to take matters in hand and steer the party in a new direction. I can't give too much away but, in this grand finale, Demme and writer Diablo Cody let go the delicate balance between drama and comedy and pump up the feel-good factor. It's supposed to be a triumphant ending but it is also a disappointingly banal way to resolve all the tensions and anxieties that have built up between characters in the course of the story.\nRicki and the Flash is, at best, a superior soap opera, exploring the tensions that arise when family values clash with personal dreams. Yet this is only one element of a film that spends much of its time wallowing in rock'n'roll nostalgia, with Ricki and her band belting out songs by Tom Petty, U2, Bruce Springsteen, one-hit wonder Dobie Gray; and (for the youngsters) Lady Gaga and Pink. The demographic – or should that be the Demmegraphic? – is an audience in their 40s, 50s and 60s.\nIt's amazing to watch Meryl Streep as a veteran rocker, and even more amazing to find out she learnt to play guitar for this role. Yet Ricki and the Flash is like one of those radio stations that keeps playing \"hits of the '80s\", or worse. If you believe in the redemptive power of rock'n'roll, are old enough to remember Dobie Gray and wish to be reminded of your age, this is the movie of your dreams.\nIrrational Man\nWritten & directed by Woody Allen\nStarring Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Parker Posey, Jamie Blackley, Betsy Aidem, Ethan Phillips\nUSA, rated M, 94 mins\nRicki and the Flash\nDirected by Jonathan Demme\nWritten by Diablo Cody\nStarring Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Mamie Gummer, Rick Springfield, Sebastian Stan, Nick Westrate\nUSA, rated PG, 87 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T00:08:00.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
