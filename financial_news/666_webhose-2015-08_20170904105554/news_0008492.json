PUBLISHED: 13:45, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 | UPDATED: 14:07, Fri, Aug 28, 2015 GETTY Solar panbel subsidies are set to be cut \nCuts to the feed-in tariff would slash payments for energy-generating homes down from as much as £495 a year to £64 a year from 2016. Existing installations would not be affected by the change, but future investment in solar panels is expected to plummet under the plans. Households wishing to beat the cut would have until the end of this year to install the energy generators. Payments from the tariff could even be closed off to new applicants altogether in January, if the changes are not deemed to save enough money for the Government.The popular scheme currently pays up to 12.9p per kWh of solar energy generated and used but this is not sustainable, according to the consultation from the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC).The suggested cuts would see tariff rates for domestic schemes drop to 1.63p/kWh.

Mike Landy, head of policy at the Solar Trade Association, said: \"A sudden cut combined with the threat of scheme closure is a particularly bad idea – it will create a huge boom and bust that is not only very damaging to solar businesses and jobs but does nothing to help budget constraints. \"We really are astonished at how self-defeating these proposals are.”Homes can currently receive payment and makes savings of up to £705 a year, estimates the Energy Saving Trust. But the proposals would dramatically reduce the sum to around £294, including bill savings - £135 without. Around 730,000 homes in Britain have solar panels, which cost between £5,000-8,000 to install. The consultation and proposed changes come after energy minister Amber Rudd last month announced a money-saving drive to control the cost of renewable energy. The Green Deal, which provided households with loans and cash-back to make efficiency changes, was also closed last month. The feed-in tariff was introduced in 2010, but since then solar panel popularity has soared beyond Government expectations. Technology has also become more efficient while the costs for installation have dropped, helping to increase the amount that homes can make from the scheme. As a result, the report said it has already met the objectives of the scheme. The consultation is open for opinions until October 23.
