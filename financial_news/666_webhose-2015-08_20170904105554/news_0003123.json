Nic Walker by Lucille Keen Property company Scentre Group will offer staff up to eight weeks' annual leave and 18 weeks' paid parental leave, as part of flexible work policies aimed at men and women.\nScentre Group chief executive Peter Allen admits he has missed enough important family events to know that workplace flexibility is not just a women's issue.\n\"When I look at my career, some of the things that I didn't do for fear of potentially negatively affecting my career path are probably not the right things I would personally believe society should accept,\" said Mr Allen, a father of four children aged between 14 and 24.\n\"I look at things like missing my kids' school events, birthdays and even births. To me, that's not that acceptable.\nRemoving stigma \"We're trying to facilitate that there is no stigma attached to people requesting to work flexibly or taking time off to be with their families. If it can be a win-win situation, then we are both going to get the benefit out of that.\"\nUnder the new scheme, primary carers receive 18 weeks paid parental leave after 12 months' service. Previously maximum benefit was 13 weeks after five years.\nThis can be taken any time within 12 months after a birth and staff will be given $2500 towards childcare when they return to work.\n Superannuation will also be paid to primary carers during paid and unpaid leave and they will get an additional five days' leave when they return to work. Non-primary carers receive two weeks' paid leave after 12 months' service.\nSuper paid The company has also implemented a scheme to let staff take an additional four weeks of annual leave a calendar year. The cost of leave can be spread across year, with a reduction in monthly pay by a given amount, rather than taking leave without pay.\nThe move comes after a report by Ernst and Young earlier this year found Australia's property industry had fallen behind other sectors in gender diversity.\nThe report found while the property sector had an equal number of female and male workers, the number of women in management was 25 per cent and at the leadership level, less than 10 per cent.\nAs a member of the Male Champions of Change for the property sector, Mr Allen said he hoped the policies would serve as a benchmark for other companies to follow.\nScentre Group owns and operates Westfield shopping centres in Australia and New Zealand. It was created when Westfield Group separated its United States and European businesses from local operations.\nMr Allen saw the restructuring as an opportunity to change the way things had been done.\nKeeping up with the times \"It was really important that we, in effect, come up with the times,\" he said.\n\"What we should be doing as a workforce is representing the community we work with. From a diversity point of view we should be representing society. I think that given we are a big part of society, given the scale of Scentre Group in Australia and New Zealand, it's important our staffing reflects that.\"\nMr Allen said to attract and retain the best employees companies must offer more than monetary rewards because people want non-financial benefits, such as flexibility, and this varies from individual to individual.\nHe believes all roles can accommodate some flexibility and the company is using technology to encourage worker mobility.\n\"I look at myself now and to really get the best out of myself in my role, I've got to be flexible. I want to be happy while I am at work, I want to devote the time that I can to that but that right time might not be nine-to-five.\"\nï»¿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:12:15.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
