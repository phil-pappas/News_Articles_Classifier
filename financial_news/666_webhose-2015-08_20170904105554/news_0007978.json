Tspiras is set to resign Thursday evening, paving the way for an election next month. \nElected in January, Tspiras was dealt a crucial blow by MPs within his Syriza party, as a large number of dissidents opposed the measures Greece agreed to in order to secure a third bailout programme. \nGreece made a €3.2bn repayment to the European Central Bank on Thursday as it received the first tranche of cash from its third bailout. The European Stability Mechanism approved Greece's €86bn bailout late on Wednesday and the first instalment comes to €13bn, €12bn of which will be used to pay off debt. \nBack on this side of the pond, the focus was on a batch of UK economic data including retail sales, manufacturing and mortgage lending. \nUK retail sales, including fuel, increased 4.2% in July compared to a year ago, missing analysts' expectations for a 4.4% gain, the Office for National Statistics revealed. Excluding fuel, sales rose 4.3% last month in line with estimates. \n\"Looking ahead, the prospects for retail spending remain bright,\" said Paul Holingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics . \n\"Real pay is rising strongly, unemployment is still low and the recent fall-back in the oil price and the forthcoming cut to gas prices should give households' discretionary spending power another healthy boost.\" A separate report showed UK manufacturing order books improved in August. The Confederation of British Industry's monthly total order book balance from its monthly industrial trends survey climbed to -1 from -10 in July. \nMeanwhile, UK mortgage lending rose 9% to an estimated £22bn in July from a month ago, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. \nIn the US, existing home sales reached a post-recession high in July, according to the national Association of Realtors. Sales rose 2%, the highest rate since February 2007, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.59m, compared with expectations for a 5.43m reading. \nUS jobless claims unexpectedly rose to 277,000 in the week to 15 August from 273,000 the previous week, the Labor Department revealed. The figure missed analysts' estimates for 272,000 jobless claims last week. \nThe data comes a day after the Federal Reserve's policy meeting minutes sent mixed signals on the timing of an interest rate hike. \nThe minutes of the 29 July meeting, indicated that the policymakers were still looking to have more confidence in the inflation outlook before raising rates, but saw conditions for a rate hike approaching. \nAmong companies, Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) gained despite swinging to a pre-tax loss in the first half, missing analysts' expectations as it took a hit from impairment charges and lower oil prices. However the company maintained its full-year production guidance at 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and said its Solan field was on track for first oil in the fourth quarter of 2015, while the Catcher field is on track for 2017. \nRank Group advanced as it posted a 19% rise in pre-tax profit for the 12 months ended 30 June, with a significant improvement across all the company's brands. \nBritish American Tobacco slumped following reports Australia's Cancer Council of Victoria will fight a freedom of information request by the company to access information from classroom surveys about young people's attitudes towards smoking. \nA batch of miners rallied including Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Randgold Resources and metal prices moved higher. \nCompass Group (Other OTC: CMPGF - news ) climbed after Jefferies upgraded to stock to 'buy' from 'hold' and lifted the price target to 1,200p from 1,100p. \nPetroceltic International (LSE: PCI.L - news ) slipped after Worldview Capital Management published an open letter alleging the company has committed \"fraud and corruption\". Worldview Capital, Petroceltic's largest shareholder with a 29% stake, had previously criticised the group over the management of its finances. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,106.48 -0.84% FTSE 100 6,367.89 -0.56% FTSE 250 17,239.37 -0.91% FTSE 100 - Risers Randgold Resources Ltd.
