Nor is there evidence that Rousseff herself could be implicated in the probe, even though she chaired Petrobras for much of the time when the graft occurred.\nBut the scandal, along with an ongoing review by an audit court of accounting tricks in the 2014 budget, are two factors that critics say could eventually justify impeaching Rousseff.\nMembers of Brazil's business elite have said her impeachment is unwarranted, for now, and the turmoil would be costly for the country, but their views could change as the recession deepens.\nBoth Rousseff and Calheiros have plenty to gain by cooperating, at least for the moment, political analysts say.\nWhen prosecutors in March disclosed he was being investigated for possibly receiving kickbacks from Petrobras contracts, Calheiros accused the government of plotting against him and tore up a Rousseff tax proposal.\nBut last week, newly reconciled, Calheiros won approval for a resubmitted version of the measure.\nHe also helped postpone the audit court's ruling on the 2014 accounting maneuvers and said a Senate vote on the court's finding, necessary for any punishment to follow, is \"not a priority.\"\nThe help is especially useful after Vice President Michel Temer, Rousseff's top PMDB ally and longtime head of the party, said last week he would no longer be Rousseff's go-between with coalition allies.\nThe move was widely seen as the first step toward an expected break between the parties before the 2018 presidential election.\nCalheiros and Rousseff have little in common.\nRousseff, 67, came from an urban middle class family and spent most of her adult life, save for a spell in her youth in an armed guerrilla group and in prison, as a career bureaucrat. Before she ran for office in 2010, most criticism had to do with her gruff manner and love of PowerPoint presentations.\nCalheiros, for his part, has long been controversial.\nLike many seasoned politicians from Brazil's historically poor northeast, electoral success for Calheiros led to outsized influence for his family.\nHis brother, Remi, is mayor of their hometown of 26,000 people and his 35-year-old son, also named Renan, last year was elected governor of their state, Alagoas.\nFirst elected to Congress in 1982, Calheiros quickly became a power broker, no matter which party actually held power.\nAnd he has survived corruption allegations before.\nIn 2007, a news magazine reported that a construction company lobbyist had paid child support for a daughter Calheiros conceived with a young journalist. Further muckraking, including allegations of tax fraud and improper business dealings, prompted a disciplinary inquiry by the Senate's ethics committee and calls for his impeachment as the chamber's president.\nCraftily, Calheiros resigned as Senate boss and gathered enough votes to dodge impeachment.\n\"He is the classic survivor,\" said Senator Jose Agripino, leader of the Democrats, a center-right opposition party, who voted for his ouster.\nIn 2011, Calheiros agreed to repay the Air Force about $11,500 after media reports that he took a flight to get hair implants in Recife, a coastal city far from Brasilia, the capital.\nFollowing re-election to the chamber for his third consecutive term, Calheiros secured the Senate presidency once more in 2013. Since then, his support for or opposition to Rousseff has depended largely upon circumstances.\n\"He is the kind of ally you need to keep an eye on 24/7,\" said a senior Worker's Party lawmaker who is close to Calheiros and directly involved in negotiations with coalition allies.
