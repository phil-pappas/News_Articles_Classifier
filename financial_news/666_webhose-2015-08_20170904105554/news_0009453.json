Its supporters have criticised it for lack of progress which it blames on painstaking negotiations with its European Union and International Monetary Fund lenders. \nThe party, which signed the bailout this month to stave off a debt default and the risk of a 'Grexit' from the euro zone, pledged to negotiate what it calls a \"grey zone\" of labour and pension reforms and privatisations, seeking to win over a big pool of undecided voters and to appease disgruntled members. \nPolls suggest Syriza will win the Sept. 20 vote. But its small lead over the conservative New Democracy party suggests Tsipras' gamble in calling early elections could backfire: most Greeks disapprove of his decision to seek a fresh mandate and of his handling of the talks with creditors. \nSyriza led the opposition conservative New Democracy party by as much as 15.2 percentage points in May. That gap has shrunk to 1.2-3.0 points in recent opinion polls. \nHours after Tsipras resigned 10 days ago, a group of far-left rebels broke off and formed Popular Unity, a new party which polls suggest will enter parliament. Underscoring his troubles, some members of Syriza's moderate factions have also resigned or said they will not run in the elections. \n\"We do not regret having fought nor having chosen at the end to avoid catastrophe,\" Tsipras told a gathering of the party's central committee. \"Whoever wants to escape has the right to do so but we are moving forward.\" \n($1 = 0.8946 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:23:04.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
