Comments ©iStock \nGeorge Osborne’s pensions revolution has given millions of retirement savers more choice than ever over how they gain access to their savings — but the chancellor might not stop there. \nFollowing the introduction in April of new pension freedoms for the over-55s, Mr Osborne has turned his attention to the billions of pounds in tax incentives given each year to encourage retirement saving. More Thousands of women lose on state pension \nAt the forefront of the Treasury’s thinking is the ballooning cost of upfront tax relief on pensions, estimated to be about £40bn a year. \nAt last month’s Budget, the chancellor said he was open to “radical change” and would not only restrict tax perks for those with adjusted incomes of more than £150,000, but consider an entirely new way of saving — dubbed the “pensions Isa”. \nThis stands to reverse the core principle underpinning the current pension tax framework — that contributions are not taxed on the way in, with funds growing tax-free, but on the way out. \nBy contrast, contributions to a “pensions Isa” would be made from taxed income, but would be tax-free when withdrawn. \nReformers argue that the current system — known as Exempt, Exempt, Taxation or EET — is most beneficial to high earners, and that incentives to save for a pension should be distributed more fairly to the low-paid. \nHowever, many in the pensions industry, which is already struggling to cope with the impact of April’s freedoms, argue that removing upfront tax breaks will be a huge disincentive to saving. \nThis week, the chief executive of Royal London, the UK’s largest mutual life, pensions and investment company, attacked the “pensions Isa” proposal , saying it could destroy the UK’s savings culture. Phil Loney said: “There is no evidence that the promise of tax-free income, 25-30 years into the future, would be believed by the public given the volume of changes to the pension system over the last 25 years.” Audio Future of retirement: How much do you need to save? With a pension savings crisis looming and sweeping changes affecting the rules on how we spend and deploy our retirement savings, it's becoming ever harder to avoid the issue.Judith Evans talks to savers and pensions experts about how best to plan for retirement. \nDownload \nA consultation was launched at the Budget to explore options including a new Isa-style approach, scrapping higher rate relief in favour of a flat rate or keeping the current system. \nThe move follows several years of tinkering with the annual allowance and lifetime allowance, which govern how much can be saved tax free into a pension. \nSummer Budget: Shake-up of pensions tax relief considered \nThe government will consider a radical overhaul of pensions tax relief in a move that would tackle the rising costs of encouraging people to save for retirement. On Wednesday, the chancellor announced the government would consult on whether there was a case for reforming pensions tax relief to “strengthen incentives to save, offering savers greater simplicity and transparency”. \nContinue reading \n“Simplicity” is a guiding principle of the reforms, according to a discussion paper issued by the Treasury as part of the consultation process, which will conclude at the end of September. \nAfter that, the big question is how far and how fast Mr Osborne is prepared to push his reforming agenda — not to mention his ultimate motivation for doing so. \nThe chancellor could nail his colours to the mast in the Autumn Statement, though industry figures say privately that they would be horrified if such a seismic change was forced through so fast, cautioning that implementing such “radical” reforms could take years. \nLaunching a white paper — a formal policy proposal — at the spring Budget in 2016 seems more likely, though others note wryly that Mr Osborne has some form when it comes to pension policy surprises. \n“Whether George Osborne wants to reform pensions because it’s the right thing to do, or because he wants to get his hands on several billion pounds of tax revenues per annum, he won’t have to worry [about the consequences] for the next 10 to 15 years,” says Colin Morton, UK Equity portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton. “Whichever it is, it’s still incredibly important for people to save towards a pension.” \nFT Money asked three pensions experts to set out the key options and arguments for each of the changes, and what this could mean for your pension in the future. Option 1: The Radical Route \nOne of the most radical ideas floated in the consultation launched at the Budget would see the creation of a “Pension Isa”, a reversal of the existing tax process for pensions so they are taxed more like individual savings accounts (Isas). This would reverse the current architecture for pensions taxation, known as EET (Exempt, Exempt, Taxation) where tax relief is offered on contributions and fund growth, with income taxed on the way out. The new system, TEE, would remove upfront tax relief. Instead, savers would make contributions out of their taxed income, with fund growth free, but income taken would be tax-free. \nThe government has floated the idea of adding a “top-up” payment, so that the incentives to save for retirement are not completely removed. A key driver for this option would be simplicity, as Isas are well understood and popular with the public. \nIndustry view: Michael Johnson \nLast year’s pensions liberating Budget (ending the requirement to annuitise) had profound consequences for private pensions. It reminded me of Michael Caine’s comment in The Italian Job: “You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!” \nIn July’s Budget, the chancellor launched a consultation into the whole future of the pensions tax regime. From the pension industry’s perspective, perhaps now “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” is a more appropriate quotation (a line from Hindu scripture, quoted by Robert Oppenheimer following the first test nuclear explosion). \nToday, the savings landscape is characterised by two disparate regimes: pensions and Isas. Pension savings attract tax relief on contributions, withdrawals being taxed, whereas subscriptions to Isas are made with post-tax income, but withdrawals are tax-free. The chancellor is hinting at a dramatic simplification: the end of the pensions framework, to leave us with an Isa-centric world. \nThis would be widely welcomed, particularly by Generation Y (the under-35s). Pension saving is from a bygone age, increasingly at odds with how people are living their lives. Indeed, a pure Isa arena feels inevitable, not least because pensions tax relief (including national insurance contribution relief on employer contributions) is wholly incompatible with pensions liberalisation, which shatters the historic unwritten contract between the Treasury and savers. \nNuts and bolts of the pensions revolution \nMuch-anticipated changes to pension rules — due to come into force in just a few months — promise to deliver freedom and choice for millions of retiring savers. Until now, hundreds of thousands of people each year exchanged their savings for a guaranteed income in the form of a lifetime annuity at age 65. From April, the requirement for most to do this will be lifted. \nContinue reading \nThe latter, having received tax relief on their contributions, were expected subsequently to secure a retirement income through annuitisation. But no more. This leads me to argue that all tax reliefs on pensions contributions should be scrapped, along with the Lifetime Allowance, as a simplification measure. \nSo, what should replace private and occupational pensions? We now have an opportunity to replace a ludicrously complex retirement savings vehicle with a fairer, more cost effective, simpler and transparent arrangement. Last year, I proposed a single Lifetime Isa for everyone, to be included in the auto-enrolment legislation. \nAllocated at birth, it would serve from cradle to grave, signalling the emergence of a lifetime savings agenda. Each post-tax £1 saved (irrespective of source, that is, including employers’ contributions) would attract 50p from the Treasury, up to an annual limit of, say, £4,000. This is double the rate of incentive that basic rate taxpayers currently receive via tax relief, and a total of £12,000 is more than adequate savings capacity for almost everyone. \nSavers would have ready access to their own contributions, crucial to retaining Generation Y’s engagement with saving anything at all. Already faced with unaffordable housing, college debts, fragmented careers, earnings stagnation, zero hours contracts, relatively thin occupational pension provision, a rapidly-retreating state pension age and, perhaps most challenging of all, faced with having to support an ageing population, this could be the first generation to experience a quality of life below that of their baby boomer parents. \nTreasury and post-tax employer contributions should be locked in until retirement (perhaps with income and capital growth); thereafter they could be accessed in the form of a tax-exempt Isa Pension. Yes, an annuity, perhaps for a minimum of ten years, fuelled by the 50p incentive which, being flat rate, would address today’s fundamental conundrum that because Income Tax is progressive, tax relief is regressive, which is grossly unfair. And it is patently failing the next generation. \nMichael Johnson is a research fellow at the Centre for Policy Studies Option 2: The flat-rate \nIndividuals currently receive upfront tax relief at their marginal rate on pension contributions. This means higher earners receive a more valuable subsidy than those on lower tax bands. After the tax-free lump sum has been taken, any income drawn from the fund during retirement is taxed at the individual’s marginal rate. Theoretically, savers could have received higher rate relief on their contributions, but manage their investments so they are taxed at a lower marginal rate when they move into drawdown. \nCurrently, the Treasury forgoes more in tax than it recoups from savers drawing down their income. \nA shift to a tax system where only one rate was offered to all savers would address the issue of fairness. Currently, higher rate taxpayers receive the lion’s share of tax relief, yet it is arguably the lower paid who need the greater incentive to save for retirement. \nIndustry view — John Ralfe \nThe UK should move to a flat rate tax top-up for all pension savings, fixed, at, say, 30 per cent. All other principles — tax free investment returns, a 25 per cent tax free lump sum, the maximum annual and lifetime allowances — should remain unchanged. \nA flat rate tax top-up is the best of the three potential proposals: it is fairer and more efficient than the current system, which gives a much bigger end-to-end benefit to higher rate than standard taxpayers; but is simpler and more efficient than an Isa-type system. \nPeople describe the current system as “EET” but in reality it is “EEPT” — Exempt, Exempt, Partially Taxed. Since 75 per cent of pensions in payment are taxed, the real saving is in the 25 per cent tax free lump sum. \nSavers favour new ‘pensions Isa’ in poll \nRetirement savers have signalled their support for radical government proposals to treat pensions more like individual savings accounts (Isas) in a new poll that shows strong appetite for a simplified tax relief system. When asked to choose the most appealing pensions tax system, only 27 per cent of working adults chose the current set-up, with the remainder choosing other options, according to the survey by PwC. \nContinue reading \nCurrently, the 40 per cent taxpayer gets a bigger top-up in the first place. Secondly, the tax saving when pensions are paid is also more generous. So, for every £100 saved from post-tax income, end-to-end, these benefits are worth £16 for a 40 per cent taxpayer, more than three times the amount they are worth for a basic rate taxpayer. \nThe Isa-type flat rate top-up would also be fairer. Michael Johnson’s idea of setting the top-up at 50p for every £1 saved, with no tax payable on pensions, looks appealing at first glance. But he also says he would limit this generous top-up to just £4,000, so the most anyone could save for their pension (and still receive the tax top-up) is just £12,000 a year, a huge reduction from the current annual allowance of £40,000. \nIf the annual allowance were to remain unchanged at £40,000, I calculate that the flat rate top-up for an Isa-style pension would be around 10p in the pound — not quite so eye-catching. \nA flat rate top-up within the current system is much simpler in practice than an Isa-style system, which would require the nightmare of both systems running in parallel for decades. Many people would have two pension pots, with different tax treatments. \nAnd any suggestion that future governments are less likely to tinker with Isa-type rules to raise money when it suits them is just wishful thinking. \nFlat rate top-up would be given through tweaking tax codes by company payroll or self assessment returns. It would also capture employer pension contributions, and defined benefit pension costs, as income. \nIt would be more efficient than the current system. A bigger tax top-up for standard rate taxpayers will encourage them to save proportionately more, while higher rate taxpayers would save almost as much even with a smaller tax top-up. For the same overall tax cost, each £100 tax top-up transferred from a higher rate to a standard rate taxpayer increases overall pension savings. \nEven the current system is more efficient than an Isa-style system. For the same end-to-end cost, the current system — with a large top-up, but 75 per cent clawed back by the Treasury as pensions are taxed — would encourage more pension savings than an Isa-style pension with a much lower top-up, but no tax clawed back. \nAll behavioural studies show people prefer a current reward over the promise of a future one, even if they have to give back the same value in the future and, in truth, are no better off. This suggests that people would save less under an Isa-style system, with a lower top-up, than the current system, with a larger top-up. \nThe current system is a straightforward “nudge” to pension saving, especially when tax claw back is many decades away, when the pension is paid. \nJohn Ralfe is an independent pension consultant Option 3: The no-change option \nThe consultation will consider some radical changes to pensions taxation, but the Treasury has said that keeping the current system is also an option. The current system of providing tax relief at the point at which contributions are paid in, then allowing those funds to grow tax-free, means that savers can build up their pension pots more quickly than a system that taxes contributions up front. Supporters argue this is a huge and tangible incentive, and fear that its removal could lead to people not saving enough to fund their retirement. \nWorries have also been expressed about how committed future governments would be to maintaining the principle of tax-free withdrawals. \nHowever, continual tinkering with pensions tax relief has made the current system complex, particularly for higher rate earners. The recent introduction of the annual allowance taper, or restrictions on tax relief for those with adjusted income of £150,000 or more, is said to be driving executives away from pension savings. \nIndustry view: David Robbins \nThe most important thing is that income saved in a pension is only taxed once, but there are good reasons to tax it on the way out rather than on the way in. \nFirst, if retirement savings are locked away to remove temptation, giving tax relief up front offers reassurance that they will not be taxed twice over. \nSecond, an ageing population will put pressure on the public finances. That would be exacerbated if the government chose to collect tomorrow’s taxes today. \nThird, high marginal tax rates will be better targeted at people with high standards of living across their lives if income can be deferred. Why should 40 per cent tax be charged on money that will meet someone’s living costs when their income is far below the higher rate threshold? \nUndeniably, taxing pensions in the same way as Isas and adding a government top-up would have plus-points. People could forget about tax when contemplating how long their pension savings might last. The financial benefits of pension saving would also be easier to understand — what you’d see (the top-up) would be what you’d get. \nBut how stable would these benefits be? The top-up would be easy to tweak, providing an irresistible plaything for future chancellors. Savers would have to guess whether they should pile into pensions before the top-up is cut, or wait for a better one. At least the infuriating tinkering with the current system has only affected high earners; most ordinary savers remain blissfully unaware. Ultimately, the top-up could go the same way as child benefit — originally a tax allowance, then recast as a handout, and finally withdrawn from people who do not “need” it. \nDespite its title, Strengthening the incentive to save , the government’s green paper hints that any overhaul would be used to tax pensions more heavily, at least on average. It hopes that greater transparency will outweigh any adverse effect on saving behaviour, but will it? \nTax relief adds 25p to each £1 that a basic rate taxpayer contributes from post-tax income. In some circumstances, any top-up above 6.25p should be more valuable end-to-end if withdrawals were made tax-free at the same time, but it may not look that way. Your opinion \nEmployer contributions to Pension Isas would be taxable benefits in kind for employees. Tax could be siphoned off before the money reached the pension pot, but how would that work with defined benefit pensions? Neither the tax nor any top-up alters the pension promised, so would take-home pay be adjusted instead? To head off public sector strikes, we could end up with a separate (and unequal) tax regime for final salary pension schemes. \nOthers propose continuing to give tax relief upfront, but not at the saver’s marginal tax rate. This would require similar operational upheaval to Pension Isas — employer contributions would incur a tax charge for higher rate taxpayers and would need topping up for basic rate taxpayers — but without making incentives clearer. \nEither change would be redistributive — indeed, some see this as the point. Whether the tax and benefit system should do more to redistribute income and wealth should be judged in the round. If you think it should, is taxing people earning over £42,385 to the extent that they save in pensions (and giving to people who earn less than this in proportion to their pension savings) the best way to achieve what you want? \nDavid Robbins is a senior consultant at Towers Watson Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
