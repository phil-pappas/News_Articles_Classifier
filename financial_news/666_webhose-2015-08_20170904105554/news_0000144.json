But so far I don't see that happening yet,\" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. \nHe added that automation of Japanese factories in China and steady U.S. growth have helped increase overseas demand for machinery, with orders jumping 20.3 percent in June helped by big items. Overseas orders are not counted as core orders. \nCompanies surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast that core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series seen as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, will rise 0.3 percent in July-September, slowing from the second quarter. \nCore orders, which exclude those of ships and electric power utilities, grew 2.9 percent in April-June from the prior three months, which was the fourth straight quarterly gain. \n\"June's decline was due to a big drop in manufacturers' orders, which came as reaction to gains in the prior month in sectors such as steel,\" said a Cabinet Office official, suggesting that the monthly decline may be a one-off. \nRecent signs indicate that firms may finally be shaking off their deflationary mindset, in which they hoarded cash long-term rather than investing in plant and equipment. \nThe BOJ's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey on July 1 showed that big Japanese firms plan to boost capital spending in the fiscal year to next March at the fastest pace in a decade. \nA Reuters poll also showed two in five Japanese firms plan to boost capital spending this business year. \n(Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Additional reporting by Danying Sun; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T06:42:32.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
