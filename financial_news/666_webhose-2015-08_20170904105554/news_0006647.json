The three partners debt is $66 billion and rising. The ATO must establish what is a fair price for that debt. Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell are facing a showdown with the Tax Office over tax-free profits of up to $3 billion a year they are making from the huge Gorgon project , even before they have shipped the first gas.\nThe key to understanding this ongoing battle over the $US54 billion ($73 billion) project lies in its long and colourful history. Its origins date back 14 years, when Chevron Corporation announced a takeover of rival Texaco.\nIn any corporate mega-deal, behind the billion-dollar headlines and bullish forecasts from the chief executive, the mergers and acquisition team is busy working out just how much tax the new, bigger company is going to save.\nSo it was only a matter of time before the Chevron finance team implementing the $US45 billion Texaco takeover turned its mind to the Australian earnings.\nChevron and Texaco's Australian arms would be merged into a single holding company. This was an opportunity to introduce a little more debt, Chevron execs noted in office memos. It would reduce Chevron Australia's taxable income.\nOngoing confrontation What followed has set the stage for the ongoing confrontation between the Tax Office and one of the world's largest LNG projects, developed by Chevron (47.3 per cent), ExxonMobil (25 per cent) and Shell (25 per cent).\nBack then, the result of all the office memos was that in mid-2003, Chevron Australia set up a subsidiary in the US called Chevron Finance Corporation (CFC). Within weeks, CFC had raised $US2.45 billion from issuing commercial paper, with an interest rate set at or below the London Interbank Offer Rate (known as Libor) for the US dollar.\n Over the next five years, that would work out as an average annual interest rate of 1.2 per cent.\nCFC immediately on-loaned the $US2.45 billion ($A3.7 billion) to its parent, Chevron Australia, but not on the same terms. The new interest rate would be based instead on the Australian-dollar Libor rate, which was around 5 per cent.\nMore mark-ups If that mark-up was not enough, CFC imposed a further mark-up of 4.14 per cent on top of this. The result was that in the next four years Chevron Australia was paying its subsidiary interest of between 8.8 per cent and 10.5 per cent.\nFor CFC, the profit this produced was a form of arbitrage, and it proved a nice little earner. And there was a pleasing twist.\nFor US tax purposes, CFC was owned by Chevron Australia, so it was a foreign company that didn't pay US tax.\nChevron Australia paid the interest to CFC, which paid out the 1.2 per cent due to the banks, and the rest was profit. CFC shipped this profit straight back to Chevron Australia as dividends – which in Australia were US earnings, so the profit was not taxable here either.\nBetween 2004 and 2011, CFC shipped $2.68 billion of profits from this arrangement to Chevron Australia – and none of it was taxable.\nIt was an arrangement that pleased everyone except the Australian Tax Office, which opened an audit on Chevron in 2006.\nWhen Chevron borrowed more money later that year, it was at a more modest mark-up. The new loans would be based on Australian bank bill rates, but the margin on top was cut from 4.16 per cent to 2.75 per cent.\nThe ATO rejected the original CFC arrangement and in 2010 slapped $258 million of new tax assessments on Chevron for the years 2004 to 2008, with penalties taking the total bill to $322 million.\nAppeal Chevron wound up CFC but appealed the tax bill, and the case ended up before Justice Richard Edmonds in the Federal Court last September. His judgment is yet to be finalised.\nThe case is merely a curtain-raiser, however. For in 2009, as the ATO audit was gathering steam, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell broke ground on one of the biggest resource projects in Australian history – and a monster of a tax fight.\nThe complex project to develop the Greater Gorgon gasfields off Barow Island in the northwest has a $US56 billion price tag, most of it funded by debt, which is where the Chevron ATO audit comes in.\nThe three Gorgon partners, which are each audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, all have tax-effective funding structures.\nChevron's CFC manoeuvre in 2003, streaming the tax-free profits from a US subsidiary back to Australia, was unusual, and charging up to 9 per cent on related-party loans has not been uncommon among Australian energy companies.\nThis produces similar levels of tax-profit for the other oil and gas majors, but these profits are kept offshore, rather than sent back to Australia.\nChevron Australia's new credit facility for Gorgon was in Australian dollars, priced at the local bank bill rate plus 2.63 per cent – which meant a total interest rate of 7 per cent in 2010, easing to 5.25 per cent last year as Australian rates eased.\nHow much money was involved? At December 2009 Chevron Australia had $1 billion of debt. By last December that had risen to $36.5 billion owing.\nWhat's surprising is that Chevron Corporation's accounts in the US show that the entire Chevron group had debt of only $US27.75 billion ($A34 billion). In fact since 2012, Chevron Australia has carried more debt than the entire group.\nGrand mismatch The reason for this mismatch is that Chevron Corp, like its Gorgon partners, is awash with money – it had $21 billion of cash in 2012, and $16 billion last year.\nA major part of the $35.5 billion of debt that Chevron Australia has raised in the last five years has come from the cash pile of the worldwide group, which means Chevron Corporation isn't paying any interest at all on the loan to Australia, though Chevron says it still has the right to be compensated for the money.\nMuch of the rest of the loans to Australia has been short-term credit lines obtained by Chevron Corp, with interest rates between 0.09 per cent and 0.4 per cent.\nLast year Chevron Australia paid $1.84 billion interest on its debt. At 0.3 per cent, Chevron Corporation's cost of those funds would have been $110 million, leaving an offshore profit of $1.73 billion.\nExxonMobil Australia holds $17 billion of related party loans, on which it paid $732 million last year. Shell Australia had $12.7 billion of related party debt and paid $534 million, though its cost of funds is harder to calculate.\nGorgon has yet to ship its first cargo, so with no income the interest payment was capitalised, adding to the overall debt total, which in turn attracts further interest costs and arbitrage opportunities\nTogether the Gorgon partners paid $3.1 billion in interest payments, of which up to $2.9 billion became untaxed profits for the total groups.\nAll of this is as it should be, the energy majors say.\n'Intra-group funding' model \"This 'intra-group funding' model is commonly used by many multinational companies and comes in the form of both debt and equity funding,\" Shell said in a written statement to The Australian Financial Review .\n\"Intra-group funding is undertaken in accordance with the 'arm's length principle' set out in local and international tax law, which means the terms and conditions of that funding should mirror those that would be available between independent parties.\"\nIn the bigger picture the issue is how to price the risk of such an enormous undertaking as Gorgon. The three partners are entitled to claim for the capital outlay. But how much is a fair figure?\nOverseas credit markets price that risk very low, given the Chevron group's strengths, though the cheap short-term money the partners are using is unlikely to last for the 40 years of production.\nBut even if US dollar rates rise, Australian debt will rise even higher, locking in that profit margin.\nThe reason for the margin is currency risk. If an Australian company like Wesfarmers borrows US dollars, the debt must be serviced and eventually paid back out of sales in the domestic economy – Australian shoppers paying Australian dollars.\nIf the Australian dollar falls, as it has this year, then it costs a lot more Australian dollars to pay back the US dollar debt.\nHigher Australian interest rates cover the cost of foreign exchange contracts to cover that currency risk.\nHalf of Gorgon's construction costs are in Australian dollars, and the rising Australian dollar is reported to have added $5 billion to the total cost, before the dollar dropped again.\nBut Gorgon is not an Australian domestic business. It will sell LNG to overseas markets at US dollar prices. Even Australian domestic oil and gas prices are determined by US dollar movements.\nNatural hedge As a result there is a natural hedge which minimises currency risk, the Tax Office has argued in the Federal Court. There is no \"arms length\" comparison possible because these are intra-group deals where currency movements are cancelled out.\nIf there is minimal currency risk, why should Gorgon debt be priced at Australian dollar rates when it is a US dollar business? The ATO concedes there should be a margin, but that it should be smaller.\nYet that is simply the way the Australian tax laws work, the Gorgon partners say. They have a right to be compensated for the risks they take – a principle which the courts have generally upheld.\nBoth Chevron and Shell stress that the debt levels comply with the \"thin capitalisation\" rules (ExxonMobil declined to comment). And while the interest payments are not subject to income tax, they do attract 10 per cent withholding tax on the way offshore.\nIn the last five years Chevron Australia has paid $5.2 billion in funding costs to related parties in the US, on which it paid $430 million in Australian withholding tax.\nShell Australia uses a different approach – it borrows Australian dollars from related companies in Bermuda and the Netherlands at Australian bank bill rates plus a margin.\nCross-currency interest-rate swaps But in the last four years it has managed its currency risk on the loans by paying $995 million to a related Shell company in Luxembourg for cross-currency interest-rate swaps.\nUnlike interest payments, the cost of the cross-currency interest-rate swaps is fully tax deductible here, without incurring withholding tax. This appears to have saved Shell almost $100 million in withholding tax.\nChevron Australia told the Senate committee investigating corporate tax avoidance that the ATO was auditing its funding arrangements, while ExxonMobil said the ATO \"is currently reviewing our international related-party financial dealings\".\nChevron declined to comment on its Federal Court case, as did the ATO. In a general discussion before the Senate tax inquiry in May, Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan highlighted the complexities of such cases.\n\"Not to oversimplify it, basically, there was a borrowing at 2 per cent by the United States parent and an on-lending at 9 per cent,\" Jordan said. \"As I understand it, there were something like over 30 expert reports. There were 11 barristers in the case. It took years to get up, and, in my view – maybe I am just too simple here – that looked like a pretty straightforward issue.\"\nThat was for a $US2.45 billion loan. The Gorgon partners' debt is $66 billion and still rising strongly. The Tax Office's fight here will be exponentially harder.\nJustice Edmonds is expected to bring down his judgment on the early Chevron case late this year. All eyes will be on him when he does.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/gorgon_project_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-16T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:55:50.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
