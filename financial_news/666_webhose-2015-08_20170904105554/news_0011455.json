Brent Pogue Collection for ultra-rare coins which will bring in millions. Several historically and monetarily significant coins will shine at the auction starting on September 30 in New York City. \nThe very first American dollar, the 1794 Flowing Hair Silver Dollar, ancestor to the $1 bill, is one such piece. It is “one of the most famous of all American coins,” says Stack’s Bowers Galleries numismatic expert John Kraljevich. “It's a numismatic triple threat,\" he adds. First, it’s the first dollar coin ever made. Second, of 135 known existing coins, this one is considered the “second finest” of all, he explains. Third, the coin has been completely “hidden from view” after being taken to England and remaining in private hands, finally emerging onto the public eye after being sold as part of a collection of Major the Lord St. Oswald, M.C., in 1964. \n“It is expected to sell for $3 million to $5 million, making it one of the most valuable coins in the world,” says Kraljevich.
