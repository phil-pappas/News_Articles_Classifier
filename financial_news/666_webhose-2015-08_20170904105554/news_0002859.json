Their main goal is to stop the economic growth.\n“He expressed his gratitude to those, especially Muyalayam Singh Yadavji, and all those parties who have felt that this is a conspiracy to stop the country’s progress. He hailed them and asked the party and members to do so as well,” Rudy said quoting Modi.\nThe SP supremo yesterday broke ranks with the opposition which has been agitating in Parliament over the Lalit Modi row and the Vyapam scam, saying, “Enough is enough… We will not back you if you keep protesting.”\nThis came as a surprise to Congress as Yadav had last week extended his party’s support to Congress after 25 of its members were suspended by the Speaker.\nCongress had sarcastically dubbed the SP supremo as ‘Khudai Khidmatgar’, which implies that a person is more loyal than the king himself.\n“If Yadav had any plan or was wanting to mediate, he should have talked to the Congress and should not have gone about the way he had gone,” a Congress leader had said.\nRudy said Modi also asked members to take up the promotion of social welfare and security schemes launched by his government as a campaign between Independence Day on August 15 and Rakshabandhan, which is later this month, as they can be of big help to the poor.\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley spoke about the GST bill, which the government is trying hard to pass in this session.\nModi said the pension and insurance schemes launched by the government and the Mudra bank can go a long way in helping the poor and asked members to promote these schemes in a big way among them.\nBJP has singled out Congress president Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi for the impasse in both the Houses, saying not many leaders in the opposition parties want to stall work but the top leaders have been “stubborn”.\n 11, 2015 1:14 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:47:42.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
