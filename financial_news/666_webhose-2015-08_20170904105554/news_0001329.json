This was due in part to a supply glut caused by the boom in US shale oil. \nBut OPEC, which has traditionally defended price levels by cutting output when necessary, dramatically switched strategy last November when it opted to leave its production target unchanged. \nOPEC has since stuck to this strategy, keeping its output target level at 30 million barrels per day. \nOn Monday, the World Bank warned that the lifting of sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme would have a \"significant impact\" on the world oil market in 2016. \nIran?s return to the global market would eventually add about a million barrels of oil a day, lowering prices by $10 per barrel, the bank said. \nOil markets have also been shaken by China's reduced economic growth and collapsing stock market. \nAs a result of losses \"triggered by China's stock market slump\" and global supply glut, US crude prices posted their biggest monthly drop since the 2008 financial crisis, with Texas light sweet declining to $47.12 per barrel on July 31. \nMeanwhile, general expectations for Europe's oil demand during 2015 have improved since OPEC's last monthly report, but remain \"coupled with large uncertainties\" over the region's economic developments, particularly in Greece, the cartel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T16:25:03.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
