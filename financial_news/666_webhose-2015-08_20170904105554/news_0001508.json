Protected by profits from the double-hull of Windows and Office software, the firm missed tech waves such as the smartphone and tablet computing, and its stock meandered for years in the $20s. \nLately, though, the ship has turned in the right direction with a new software licensing model, competitive cloud computing services and an energetic new CEO, Satya Nadella, who seems determined to remake Microsoft into a leaner and—dare we say it—innovative tech company. Nadella wants to push Microsoft more into cloud computing and mobile products, and the company is launching a new version of its Windows operating system that it hopes will catch on for mobile devices, as well as for personal computers. \nMicrosoft posted a net loss of $3.2 billion (40 cents a share) in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, mainly because of an $7.5 billion write-down related to its acquisition of Nokia’s mobile phone business. But analysts expect earnings to climb 10% in the current fiscal year, which ends next June 30. The stock, which has risen by two-thirds since early 2013, is no longer in the bargain bin, but with a P/E ratio about the same as the S&P 500, neither is it overpriced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T20:00:39.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
