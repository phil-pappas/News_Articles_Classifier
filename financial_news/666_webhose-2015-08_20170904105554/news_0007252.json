Sixty of the 311 conservative lawmakers voted `no' or abstained - fewer than some in her party had feared.\nThe results of the vote are expected at around 1200 local time (1000 GMT).\nIn the Netherlands, the government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte is expected to face a call for a no-confidence vote from euro-sceptic, right-wing rival Geert Wilders, when parliament debates the latest bailout program for Greece on Wednesday. . On Tuesday, the parliaments of Austria, Estonia and Spain voted to approve the bailout.\nSHIFTED GROUND\nSupport from parties including the Social Democrats, Merkel's junior coalition partner, and the opposition Greens means German approval of the bailout is not in doubt. But a rebellion by a large number of her allies would be a blow for Merkel, who remains highly popular after 10 years in office.\nSeveral conservatives were adamantly opposed to the deal. \"We are going further in the direction of a transfer union,\" said CDU lawmaker Wolfgang Bosbach, who has opposed previous Greek bailouts, before the vote.\nBut Schaeuble threw his weight behind the package and said Athens had clearly shifted ground in the last few weeks and was ready to reform.\nHe also reiterated the German view that it is imperative for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stay on board. The IMF, however, says it won't unless Greece gets debt relief, while Germany is against cutting Greek debt.\n\"I am fairly confident that we (international creditors including the IMF) will reach a joint assessment of (Greece's) debt sustainability in October,\" said Schaeuble, reiterating that a debt haircut is not possible.\nLast month, a record 65 lawmakers from the conservative camp broke ranks and refused to back the start of bailout talks.\n($1 = 0.9068 euros) (Writing by Paul Carrel and Madeline Chambers ; Additional reporting by Caroline Copley; Editing by Toby Chopra)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T12:23:57.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
