The company also expects China's economic reforms to contribute to volatility in commodity prices in the short term.\nMackenzie said, however, that if China moves \"successfully into the middle-income economy, it is good news for oil and it is good news for copper.\"\nPrices of copper, mostly used in power and construction, fell below $5,000 a tonne for the first time in six years this month, while crude oil dropped to 6-1/2 year lows near $40 a barrel.\nBHP expects the copper market to be in deficit at the end of this decade as grades decline and costs rise.\nOne major threat to copper would come from substitution by aluminium on underground wires in China, which could take a good chunk of production.\n\"That says a lot about commodities, that everything is substitutable. The risk is always there ... China has got enough aluminium and they are self-sufficient on that,\" Mackenzie said.\nChina accounts for about half of global consumption of industrial metals such as copper.
