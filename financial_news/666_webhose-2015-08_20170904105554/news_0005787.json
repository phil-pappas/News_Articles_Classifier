Sales in the international segment fell 9.6 percent to $30.64 billion. \nPartly due to the dollar, the company trimmed its full-year forecast for fiscal 2016 to $4.40-$4.70 per share, down from the previous range of $4.70-$5.05. \n\"We made continued progress towards our plan this quarter,\" said chief executive Doug McMillon. \n\"Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) if it's not as fast as we'd like, the fundamentals of serving our customers are consistently improving, and it's reflected in our comps and revenue growth.\" \nThe results translated into $1.08 per share, below the $1.12 projected by Wall Street analysts. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) of Dow member Walmart fell 2.9 percent to $69.85 in pre-market trade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:34:00.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
