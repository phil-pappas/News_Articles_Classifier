Photo: Artist's impression\nHere's a statistic that shows how far James Packer is prepared to go to establish his Crown Resorts group as a global casino brand. Last year, he spent about 1200 hours – more than seven weeks – in the air, travelling around the world.\nPacker's astonishing amount of air time came up on Tuesday in a meeting a small group of journalists had with him and Rob Rankin, the former Deutsche investment banker hired last year as chief executive of Packer family's private company, Consolidated Press Holdings.\nPacker is trying to establish Crown as THE high-end brand, by investing an unprecedented amount of money in the quality of the rooms Crown offers and the casino and resort services they connect to.\nCPH itself is very active. It is investing in cyber security and other information technology start-ups with Seek co-founder Paul Bassat's Square Peg venture capital outfit for example, and building its presence as a major player in Hollywood through its RatPac-Dune Entertainment movie production joint venture. Ratpac's movie credits include American Sniper, Gravity , and Mad Max:Fury Road .\nSix-star ultra-luxury Crown Towers hotels are a common anchor of the casinos Crown has built and is developing. Photo: Artist's impression\nWhat really struck me, however, was the scope and ambition of Packer's casino expansion plans. He is not just trying to position his 50.01 per cent controlled Crown group as a global high-roller casino brand. He is trying to establish Crown as THE high-end brand, by investing an unprecedented amount of money in the quality of the rooms Crown offers and the casino and resort services they connect to.\nCrown's Sydney Casino at Barangaroo will, for example, have cost about $2 billion to build by the time it opens in 2019. The cost per key, a basic measure of how much casinos are investing per room, is about $4.5 million. That is roughly twice as much per room as US casino mogul Steve Wynn spent on the Bellagio, a casino resort in Las Vegas that has been a benchmark for opulence since it opened in 1998.\nPacker and Crown are under pressure this year as China's crackdown on corruption and economic slowdown depresses revenue and earnings on Macau's casino strip, where Crown's 34 per cent-owned venture with Lawrence Ho, Melco Crown Entertainment, is an established operator.\nHe is nevertheless expanding on multiple fronts.\nCrown's wholly owned Melbourne and Perth Casinos are being upgraded. In Perth for example the group is building a six-star Crown Towers hotel at a cost of $645 million, and its Sydney Casino is in the pipeline.\nMelco Crown, meanwhile, is a 60 per cent investor in a new casino resort development project in Macau called Studio City (pictured below), and a partner through a 69 per cent-owned subsidiary in the City of Dreams casino resort in Manila, which opened in February this year.\nAfter failing with an earlier $2 billion invasion of the US, Crown has also announced plans to build and take majority ownership of a new, ultra high-end casino resort complex in Las Vegas. It will cost between $US1.6 billion and $US1.9 billion, and Crown's equity investment will be between $US400 million and $US500 million.\nSix-star ultra-luxury Crown Towers hotels are a common anchor of the casinos Crown has built and is developing, and Packer's high-end strategy creates both risk and opportunity.\nOne risk is that China's corruption crackdown and economic slowdown will lead to a long-term reduction in activity in Macau, which has become the centre of gravity for the high-roller market, accounting last year for for $29.5 billion, or more than three quarters of global VIP revenue of $37.9 billion.\nSingapore was a relatively late entrant to the casino race but still collected 8.7 per cent of VIP revenue last year. Las Vegas's share was $1.7 billion or just 4.4 per cent – Packer's entry to the strip (pictured below) will presumably lift that – and Australia had a VIP revenue share of 3.8 per cent.\nThe Australian developments will boost Crown's high-roller share and cement the local casinos into a network that aims to leverage revenue as high rollers can commute around it, chasing their luck.\nThe risks? A key question is to what extent the corruption crackdown in China is about cleaning up corruption, a huge task, and to what extent it is about consolidating Chinese President Xi Jinping's power, a job that is now pretty much done. There is no answer to that yet.\nAnother is the risk that China's slowdown poses. The Packer camp is confident, however, that China's government has the financial resources to deal with economic and financial shocks of the sort we have seen in China's sharemarket this year.\nA third is that Packer is expanding into a high-roller segment of the casino market that is less profitable per dollar of revenue collected than revenue collected on the main floor of a casino, where more dollars are dropped on bets such as slot machines that generate fixed returns for operators, and where development and operating costs are lower.\nThe average house take on high-roller gambling is 1.35 per cent, a pretty thin margin, and Packer is also setting new highs for casino development costs as he positions his casinos at the top of casino quality league table.\nThe opportunity? It is there because the high-roller end of the casino market is also where the biggest slice of casino revenue is.\nPacker is boosting margins in other ways as Crown expands. The Sydney casino development will for example have a residential element that will boost that project's overall yield.\nThe core of the high-end plan, however, sees Crown accept a thinner margin on casino revenue as it increases its high-roller market share, but boost earnings nevertheless as its revenue increases by more than enough to offset the margin compression.\nThat, of course, raises one final risk – what the competitive response is.\nThere will some kind of reaction, for sure. Crown wants a larger share of high-roller revenue. It is therefore a threat to incumbents such as Steve Wynn in Las Vegas and the Genting group in Singapore.\nThe only question is how big the response is: Packer and Crown will enjoy a battle. They won't want a war.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-QTX-oWYyE"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:19:18.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
