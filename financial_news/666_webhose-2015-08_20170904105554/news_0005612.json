Idk. Weird.”\n“This industry’s culture fosters an unconscious lack of sensitivity towards those who do not fit a certain mold,” Wenger said in a post on Medium. “The negative opinions about this ad that strangers feel so compelled to share illustrate solid examples of the sexism that plagues tech.”\nMedium/Isis Wenger The comments prompted Wenger to start a hashtag on Twitter called “#ILookLikeAnEngineer,” drawing participation from thousands of diverse engineers who posted pictures of themselves.\nAnd that hashtag prompted a campaign to put up a billboard in San Francisco.\nThe campaign initially aimed to raise $3,500 for a simple ad contract. Since the campaign has already raised nearly $10,000 in its first 30 days of crowdfunding, the money will go toward more advertising. Any additional funding will fund organizations that teach programming to under-represented groups.\nHow far does $10,000 go in advertising? Here’s how much the top advertisers spent in 2014:\nMarketer 2014 U.S. ad spending Procter & Gamble Co. $4.6 billion AT&T $3.3 billion General Motors Co. $3.1 billion Comcast Corp. $3.0 billion Verizon Communications $2.5 billion Ford Motor Co. $2.5 billion American Express Co. $2.4 billion Fiat Chrysler Automobiles $2.2 billion L’Oreal $2.2 billion Walt Disney Co. $2.1 billion Source: Ad Age But that doesn’t mean that the message isn’t already effective, even without raising $4.6 billion.\nSocial media is what’s really the driving factor of the cause — and it’s usually free. The hashtag ‘#ilooklikeanengineer’ has generated 75,000 tweets so far.\nFor nonprofits, social media far outranks paid advertising in terms of importance, according to Nonprofit Marketing Guide .\nMost marketers spend less than 20% of their marketing budget set aside for outreach on social media sites, according to the CMO Council , but social media often accounts for a huge portion of customer conversion. Using Twitter during fundraising events can result in 10 times more money raised online.\nAnd on day one of the #ILookLikeAnEngineer billboard funding campaign, of the 75,000 tweets, 137 people have donated. It looks like San Francisco will be getting that billboard, and other cities may get one, too.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://nonprofitmarketingguide.com/freemembers/2013npcommtrendsreport.pdf", "http://reverb.twitter.com/view/584757012055628926", "https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/you-may-have-seen-my-face-on-bart-8b9561003e0f", "https://www.cmocouncil.org/facts-stats-categories.php?view=all&category=marketing-spend"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T18:24:17.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
