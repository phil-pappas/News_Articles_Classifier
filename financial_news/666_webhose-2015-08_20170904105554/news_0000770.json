Without it, you can't be competitive since others will have that financing available,\" said the source.\nOrbital spokesman Barry Beneski declined comment on the specific competition, but said his company was pushing for reauthorization of the trade bank, which has financed a number of satellites built by Orbital for customers in other countries.\nHe said losing access to trade credits would be hard for the company, but the impact would be even greater on its suppliers, who account for 50 percent of every Orbital satellite built.\nOrbital could not finance the satellite deals itself, Beneski said. \"That's not that business we're in. It's not an efficient use of our capital.\"\nTea Party conservatives in the U.S. Congress have attacked the trade bank as a promoter of \"crony capitalism\" for multinationals such as Boeing and General Electric Co.\nThe bank's backers argue that it actually provides revenues for the U.S. government, and helps level the playing field for U.S. exporters given similar trade credits available for other manufacturers around the world, and supports U.S. jobs.\nEarlier this week, MDA Corp, the Canadian parent of U.S. based Space Systems/Loral, told investors the shutdown of the bank, the stronger U.S. dollar, and a series of rocket failures drove satellite orders across the industry in 2015.\nIt said it had already used some financing provided by the Canadian export control agency, but there was not enough funding available for the larger market without EXIM.
