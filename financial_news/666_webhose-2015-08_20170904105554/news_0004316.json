Photo: Wolter Peeters\nMore than 65 per cent of MySuper providers are too small to deliver benefits of scale for their account holders, charge unjustifiably high fees and should be merged, independent superannuation research firm Chant West says.\nUp to 80 super funds should be closed down, based on the firm's research, and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority needed to force \"sub-scale\" funds, defined as those with less than $5 billion in assets, to merge or fold.\n\"On average super funds with $10 billion or more under management are providing a better return and better service, while charging half the fees of funds under $5 billion in size,\" Chant West head of research Ian Fryer said.\n\"That's pretty compelling evidence for the advantages of scale,\" he said.\nAdvertisement \"With more than 120 MySuper funds there is almost too much choice given only about 40 of those funds are truly competitive.\"\nChant West data shows that over the past decade the 16 funds with more than $10 billion in assets have dominated performance league tables, while economies of scale have also enabled these biggest funds to charge some of the lowest fees.\nIndustry super funds that should be closed according to the analysis include: Transport Industry Super, Law Employees Super, Concept One and Club Super, which all have less than $500 million in assets and charge up to 1.78 per cent in fees.\nAmong the retail funds that could come in for scrutiny are Smartsave Super and AMG Universal, each with less than $300 million and charging more than 1.28 per cent in fees.\nFar more non-profit funds would face the chop than retail funds.\nNo need for tender Of the 89 funds with less than $5 billion in assets, the split by sector and type is as follows: 35 industry funds, 30 retail funds, 19 in-house corporate funds, and 5 public sector funds.\nChant West's analysis of how fees are charged across MySuper products follows last year's Financial System Inquiry, which targeted fees as too high.\n\"The biggest funds are generally providing good value, there is a long tail of smaller funds that are charging more for less,\" Mr Fryer said.\nAcross all MySuper products total fees average 93 basis points of annual investment returns.\nIndustry funds had average fees of 94 basis points, while actively managed retail funds charge an average of 1.11 per cent. Savers can get lower fees from passively managed retail funds, on average 88 basis points, but that buys less. Public sector funds had the lowest average total fees at 72 basis points.\nMr Murray's Financial System Inquiry also backed an idea put forward by think tank the Grattan Institute to strip the Fair Work Commission of responsibility for its oversight for default super selection and move to a market-based tender process.\nThe push for a revamp of the default MySuper selection process is to be a key topic for discussion at the Financial Services Council's annual conference on the Gold Coast from August 5-7, where Mr Fryer will present the latest Chant West research.\nHe rejects the FSC's push for the government to overhaul the default super selection process, arguing a crackdown on minnow funds would be a better way to improve effective competition.\nMr Fryer said there are rare exceptions of funds with less than $5 billion in assets that can justify continuing at a small scale because they provide a valuable service to a specific member base.\nHe highlighted Mine Wealth + Wellbeing (formerly Auscoal), which has excellent insurance coverage for high-risk workers in the coal-mining industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T12:34:25.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
