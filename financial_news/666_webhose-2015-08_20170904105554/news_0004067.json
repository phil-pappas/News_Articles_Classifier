In fact, they've pretty much doubled but from a historically low base of 177,025 tonnes at the start of January. \nThey currently stand at 354,125 tonnes with metal still arriving piece-meal across a wide range of locations, a normal pattern for this time of year, when northern hemisphere manufacturing activity slows during the summer holiday season. \nBut they're still a long way short of 2013 levels, when headline stocks peaked at over 660,000 tonnes, let alone 2002 levels, when LME stocks were close to one million tonnes. \nThere's currently more metal sitting in the Shanghai bonded zone than there is in the LME warehousing system. \nSPREADS QUIET... \nAnd that's partly because there is no compelling incentive to deliver surplus metal to the LME market. \nThe benchmark cash-to-three-months spread has been trading in contango since the middle of May. \nTom-next , the shortest-dated spread in the LME system and the best indicator of cash-date pressure, has also been becalmed of late. \nThe last time it flared into serious backwardation was during the January maelstrom, when activity exploded amid a mass adjustment of positioning, both by longs and shorts. \nAnd yet there is a strong sense that the current contango environment is at least partly a manufactured one. \nThe outright price seems to be telling us that copper's supply-demand profile right now is as bad as it's been since the dark days of Global Financial Crisis in 2009. \nYet the spreads are not. \nThe widest the cash-to-threes contango has flexed is $31 on June 15. Since then it's traded in a relatively narrow $5-25 range and closed last week valued at $7.00. \nNot tight, but not loose either. \n...TOO QUIET? \nShort positions, meanwhile, are accumulating. \nThe LME's latest COTR, covering the week up to Friday Aug. 3, showed money managers net short to the collective tune of 5,249 lots, or 131,225 tonnes. \nIt's the largest collective net copper shorts since the LME introduced the report at the end of July 2014. \nIt may also be an undercount due to the fact that some fund order flow may be over-the-counter in origin and netted off by LME members before execution. \nMarex Spectron, for example, publishes its own assessment of \"speculative positioning\" on the LME. Its take as of July 30 was that the net short on copper was 28,700 lots, or a much larger 717,500 tonnes. \nThe calculations may differ but the key takeaway doesn't. \nFunds are net short and increasing their short bets as the price extends its downwards path. \nThere has been no significant counter-move since the second week of July. Even then there was no discernible spread reaction. \nNor, for that matter, are any warning flights flashing from the LME's futures banding report . The next three big prompt dates show only clusters of relatively small short positions, the largest of which is in September and between 10 and 20 percent of open interest in size. \nYet it's hard to see how copper can avoid some sort of short-covering reaction at some stage, given it has been trending lower in almost a straight line. \nAnd it's hard to see how that reaction, when it comes, isn't going to cause spread volatility given the ever-present entity controlling so much of the exchange's available tonnage. \nBut until that day, the dominant long seems happy to keep gently rocking the spreads in a way that is unthreatening to the growing number of bears. \nJust as long as the bears don't get gently rocked to sleep. \n(Editing by David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:02:40.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
