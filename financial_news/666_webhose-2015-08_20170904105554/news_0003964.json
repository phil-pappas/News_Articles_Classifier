In the UK, Aga's Rangemaster brand of stoves and traditional Aga cookers finished the year strongly as greater consumer confidence and higher disposable incomes fed through into expenditure on the home and in the property market. \nRangemaster also did well with key business customers, including Dixons Carphone and AO World (Other OTC: AOWDF - news ) . Department store John Lewis is reported to be increasing its orders for Rangemaster lines, too. \nElsewhere in the business, Aga Marvel in North America reported strong sales growth in the first-half, following the launch of a new product range. The Michigan-based factory, in which Aga consolidated three facilities, is operating at its highest production level since it was opened in 2011. \nUpmarket tile business Fired Earth continued to perform well and is heading towards record sales this year. \nOverseas, international sales were ahead of last year, as Aga entered the Chinese market and made its first sales to consumers. \nAll of this contributed to the 1.5pc uptick in group revenues to £125.4m in the six months to the end of June, while operating profits jumped 17pc to £2.8m. \nHowever, £3.4m of one-off costs, of which £3m were associated with a planned take-over by US rival Middleby, saw the group dip into the red, with a pre-tax loss of £4m, compared with a £300,000 loss in 2014. \nThe traditional Aga stove has become such a staple in some family kitchens, that one young Great British Bake Off contestant forgot to turn her oven on in the first stage of the competition because she was so used to the cast-iron cooker, which usually remains switched on all the time. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , the British oven is set to find a new home stateside, after Aga's board gave its support to a £129m takeover by US company Middleby. \nMiddleby, an Illinois-based cooking and industrial process company, is buying the business to gain a foothold in Europe. \nThe deal, if approved by shareholders next month, will also help Aga tackle its sizeable pension deficit. \nMr McGrath said: \"Our product investment programmes have ensured we are ready to benefit from the improving trading backcloth. Working with Middleby should provide additional momentum to enable our operations to thrive.'' \nAga has spent the past few years diversifying its product ranges to broaden its appeal. That includes the launch of the City60 Aga , half the size of the conventional stove, more efficient, easily controlled and designed to take the Aga, long-associated with country living, into smaller, urban homes. \nAnd the investment appears to be paying off: three-quarters of Aga sales in the half-year were of models launched in the past four years. \nThe company expects sales and profits in the core UK business to continue to increase in the second-half, thanks to “an economic and political backdrop that is likely to be conducive to increased levels of consumer spending on household goods”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T13:11:22.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
