The system is designed to protect U.S. farmers from an influx of cheap imports.\nThe fall in Australia's beef shipments will come as U.S. consumption rises during the winter, piling further pressure on supplies.\nThe U.S. cattle population dropped to a 63-year low in 2014 after years of reduction in herd size, cutting meat supplies to supermarkets and boosting the need for imports.\nSTEAMED DUMPLINGS\nIn China, where pork can be used in everything from savoury porridge to steamed dumplings, imports of the meat are forecast to climb 54 percent this year to 2 million tonnes, with the supply squeeze expected to last well into next year.\nRabobank says China's hog supplies have dropped to 384 million head from an all-time high of 468 million at the end of 2013.\nAs well as investing directly in pork markets, investors also have the option of buying shares in companies that produce the meat such as Hormel Foods, whose shares hit a record high this week.\nMike Zuzolo, president of U.S.-based Global Commodity Analytics, whose clients include hog farmers, said that European producers would likely reap the greatest reward from climbing shipments to China. But he added that the outlook for pork imports by China would also help producers in other regions.\n\"It's ... a rising tide that lifts all boats scenario when it comes to increasing (Chinese) consumption, which is good for everybody in the protein sector,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, traders in Europe said potentially huge flows of speculative money from China to U.S. markets could also drive agricultural commodity prices higher.\nStung by losses in the Chinese equity markets and outlook for lower crude oil and industrial metals prices, analysts say funds could be looking at agricultural commodities, including livestock for possible investment.\n\"Chinese investment fund money flowing into agricultural commodities could create upward impetus as U.S. and European fund buying did a couple of years ago,\" said a German trader.
