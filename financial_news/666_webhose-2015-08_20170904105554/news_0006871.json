What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.Today’s Social Security question is about confirming that benefit amounts are correct. Question : How can I audit the calculation made by the Social Security Administration of my benefits? Is there a process for them to disclose the data used, and which rules were applied, to determine the amount that I receive? Answer : You can retrieve you covered earnings record online, if you haven’t started taking your retirement benefit. If you have, you will, I believe, need to contact Social Security and request they mail it to you. I find it crazy that people who are already collecting benefits can’t access their earnings records online, but, unless they’ve changed things of late, that’s the case.When you get your work record, make sure it’s correct. Even if it is, you can count on Social Security to give you a bogus estimate of your Primary Insurance Amount if you are under 60 or over 60 and still working, because Social Security assumes that the economy will never ever experience any inflation and will never ever experience any growth in average wages. They will also, in their standard calculation/calculators, assume you will keep working through your full retirement age and earn the same amount each year.My company’s software goes to considerable lengths to reverse engineer Social Security’s benefit estimates as needed to properly account for future growth in wages and prices as well as the precise amount each household members expect to earn in the future. We’ve found that Social Security can significantly underestimate benefits for those below age 60. For example, for many 50-year-olds, the underestimate is roughly 20 percent.All this said, once you retrieve your covered earnings record, the only way to audit Social Security’s benefit calculation is to use a commercial software program.
