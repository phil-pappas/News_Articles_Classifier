We also need to think innovatively and differently.' \nData from the 2000 and 2010 Population and Housing Census showed a 55.5 percent increase in the demand for housing over the decade, and this puts the housing deficit at about 1.7 million units. \nThe deputy minister reiterated that the government, through the Ministry of Water, Works and Housing, was working effortlessly to address the challenges in the housing sector. \nBut government alone cannot do much in tackling the problem without the support of others, other stakeholders from the private sector must support government, he indicated. \n'The housing industry needs the support of the private sector. Indeed, our housing profile indicate that the private sector account for 95 percent of our housing stock in Ghana. And if we are to address the huge housing deficit in Ghana, then the Ministry of Works and Housing needs to engage the private sector.' \nAs part of measures to provide shelter for poor Ghanaians, he said government had commenced the construction of thousands of affordable housing units in some selected communities across the country, with about 1,500 of them expected to be commissioned by President John Mahama in the second quarter of 2016. \nMr. Adusei lauded the initiative of Multitv and HFC Bank, saying 'the ministry welcomes this kind of news because it does not only provide us the opportunity to transact and forge closer partnerships with stakeholders of our industry but create an opportunity for sustained interaction among stakeholders and enhance the cross-examination of ideas among our stakeholders.' \nThe Fair About 86 exhibitors from the housing industry attended the fair and offered various products and housing solutions to prospective buyers. \nHead of Sales and Marketing, Multitv, Mordecal Quarshie, in a statement, indicated that the fair is a platform that seeks to bring together players within the housing industry to collectively find a solution to the nation's rising housing needs. \nHe announced that the final edition of the fair would be held in Kumasi in November. \nGeneral Manager of Mortgage and Technology at HFC Bank, headline sponsor of the fair, Charles Bonsu, said the fair has enabled HFC over the last five years to offer housing solutions to many Ghanaians at affordable rates. \nMr. Bonsu said, 'The bank has been able to reach out to more Ghanaians who have been able to own homes for less than GHÂ¢60,000.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:03:16.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
