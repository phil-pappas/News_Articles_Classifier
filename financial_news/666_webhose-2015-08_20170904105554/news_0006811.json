But today, I am glad to say that all sides have respected their commitments. Greece is living up to its ambitious reform commitments,\" he said in a statement after six hours of gruelling talks in Brussels Friday. \nGreece will receive a first instalment of 13 billion euros next week, helping cover a debt payment due to the ECB next Thursday. \nEurozone ministers said the first main 26-billion tranche of the bailout will include an \"immediate\" payment of 10 billion euros to Greece's banks, which are desperately short of cash after panicked customers flocked to withdraw their money. \nThe deal must still be approved by parliaments in several European countries to go ahead -- notably in Germany, Europe's effective paymaster, where lawmakers are set to vote on Wednesday. \n- Election headache - \nTsipras now faces the unenviable task of implementing the reforms -- many of which must be voted into law, a worrying prospect in a parliament where so many of his lawmakers have turned against him. \nGreece's Kathimerini newspaper on Saturday counted nearly 40 measures on tax, competition, social security and pensions that must be voted through and brought into force by the end of the year. \nTsipras has made it known to his European partners that early elections are inevitable, according to Greek media reports. \nBut the question of when to hold the vote represents a major headache for the prime minister. \nSeptember elections could give him the upper hand against Syriza's leftist bloc by giving them less time to organise, but this could delay the implementation of the bailout. \nA vote by the end of October, on the other hand, could allow Tsipras to benefit from a glowing first report from the creditors -- but this could prove detrimental if it allowed his high popularity ratings to slip as the first reforms bite. \nThe accord goes far beyond economic management to include an extensive overhaul of Greece's health and social welfare systems, its business practices and public administration. \nGreece will have to balance its books to produce a primary budget surplus -- that is, before interest payments -- and take on a major privatisation programme to help reduce a debt mountain equivalent to 170 percent of its GDP. \nDebt relief remains a major sticking point between Greece's creditors themselves, with the IMF insisting the burden must be brought down to a sustainable level, but Germany digging in its heels. \nBerlin has been hostile to the prospect of a \"haircut\" or partial writedown that could potentially cost it and other holders of Greek debt billions of euros. \nEurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem said the eurozone's finance ministers also opposed a haircut, but was ready to consider other options, including extending the period of the loans. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T20:28:33.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
