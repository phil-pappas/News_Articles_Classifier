Photo: Patrick Scala\nRoss Sudano's decision to stock the shelves at The Reject Shop with everyday products such as discount Nescafe coffee and cut-price Finish dishwashing powder is paying off in spades.\nThe veteran retailer, who took the helm at The Reject Shop 11 months ago, believes a rebound in same-store sales in the second half of 2015 – fuelled by sales of consumables such as groceries, pet care and garden products – will continue in 2016, underpinning the first growth in full-year profits for four years.\n\"We're not successfully delivering every day but when we get elements of the offer right our customers are responding very well,\" Mr Sudano said on Wednesday after reporting a better than expected 1.9 per cent decline in full-year net profit to $14.2 million.\nAfter a 24 per cent fall in first-half net profit to $12.8 million, The Reject Shop made a $1.4 million profit in the second half. It was the first time the company has reported a profit in the second half since 2012, and Mr Sudano has forecast further gains in 2016.\nAdvertisement Same-store sales, which had been going backwards for two years, surged 4.7 per cent in the June quarter and by 2.3 per cent in the June half as customers shopped more often and put more in their shopping baskets.\nFull-year sales rose 6.4 per cent to $756.8 million as the retailer opened 21 new stores, including a new format store at Kellyville in Sydney, a model for future outlets.\nMr Sudano said the improvement in foot traffic and customer transactions had continued into the first few weeks of 2016.\n\"Every week we have seen transaction growth and on top of that basket size growth,\" he said. \"We are getting consistently more people in our stores.\"\n\"I wouldn't say the journey is complete – we still have an awfully long way to go – but it's pleasing to see customers responding positively.\"\nThe Reject Shop shares jumped 16 per cent or $1.04 to a nine-month high of $7.40 as traders covered short positions and analysts and investors upgraded their profit forecasts.\nTurnaround engineered \"Obviously [Ross] Sudano is engineering a turnaround and the market loves a turnaround,\" said Eley Griffiths portfolio manager Ben Griffiths.\nAnalysts said the 2015 result exceeded their forecasts but further gains would depend on customer reaction to the new product range and the retailer's ability to manage higher cost of goods following the dollar's fall.\n\"It's very early days – they still have a lot of work to do with the product and managing the currency in the next few months – but it certainly gives us a lot more confidence,\" one analyst said.\nMr Sudano said the second-half turnaround reflected the \"100 different things you do every day\" but highlighted the company's efforts to better understand its customers, changing the product mix by stocking big brands at lower everyday prices, and introducing new products each week to create a sense of urgency and discovery.\nMr Sudano is also boosting TV, catalogue and digital marketing to improve brand awareness, building a digital customer database aimed at bargain hunters or \"Savvy Shoppers,\" simplifying the supply chain and negotiating rent reductions or closing underperforming stores.\nAfter years of rapid store growth, when The Reject Shop took over scores of sites vacated by the collapsed Discount Superstores Group, the company now plans to open a more modest 10 stores a year. Mr Sudano also sees scope to open small-footprint stores to take the brand into new locations.\n\"Once the business is on a sound footing and we are leveraging the benefits of scale we'll be in a position to pursue opportunities to grow the business,\" he said.\nThe Reject Shop declared a final dividend of 13.5¢, payable on October 12, taking the full year payout to an unchanged 30¢ a share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:35:42.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
