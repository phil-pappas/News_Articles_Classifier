Unfortunately, lower unemployment doesn't mean much when gauging the true health of this economic recovery. Unemployment is a great indicator for measuring the number of active job seekers who can't find work. What it doesn't show is how many people are sitting on the sidelines, or equally unsettling, clinging to jobs that aren't the right fit for them. \nParadoxically, one of the key indicators we need to see rise is the number of people quitting to look for new, more enticing jobs. This type of job turnover not only shows that people have more confidence that they can find better jobs,but it puts pressure on companies to raise wages in order to retain talent. \nThis week's jobs report won't provide much of that information, which will come out the following week in the BLS's Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS . So while the headlines on Friday may be generally positive, we should save any real excitement for the possibility of seeing strong data in the JOLTS report.

At Indeed , the world's largest jobsite by traffic (where I am chief economist), our data showed across the board strength in job openings in July . We expect JOLTS numbers will reflect an increasingly favorable environment for job seekers as we move through the third quarter and towards the year's end. \nThat said, we'll also need to see an uptick in another important economic indicator to believe employment is truly strong: labor force participation. Despite steady job growth over the last 12 months, the labor force participation rate is stuck below 63%, a rate not seen since the late 1970s. \nIn other words, a very large percentage of people remain out of the labor force. If they don't soon return, wages may rise quickly and cause inflation to tick up. In this environment, a drop in unemployment may actually be a bad sign because these people aren't even looking for work. \nThis would have several undesirable outcomes. Among these are reduced incomes for those out of the labor force, lower production and therefore less income for the U.S. as a whole, reduced tax revenues, increased government benefit costs, weaker charitable donations, and higher charitable needs. \nAs the U.S. economy continues to add jobs in a wide range of industries, it can hopefully break the pattern and draw in some of the nearly 8 million additional people who would be in the labor force now if we had the same participation rate as in 2007. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:45:06.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
