Eddie Jim Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin It didn't take much for Victoria's new slogan, \" the best of everything \", to bring old interstate rivalries back to the fore.\nIn launching the state's new brand and logo, Premier Daniel Andrews called it a return to the \"big V\", made famous by AFL State of Origin clashes and and took a swipe at Sydneysiders by noting Victoria had not been able to rely on \"lazy ... billion-dollar harbour views\".\nIt wasn't long before NSW Premier Mike Baird joined the internet trolls online to sledge the $220,000 rebranding exercise drawn up by advertising agency Ogilvy Australia, who beat four other agencies to revamp the state's \"jigsaw\" logo, which dates back to 1993 into the new V-shaped wedge through the word Victoria, with versions to be used at next year's Australian Open.\nThe new branding, announced in the same week that Google changed its name to Alphabet , will be used to launch a $20 million campaign to sell the state to tourists in China and India.\n*offer excludes harbour, infrastructure and sunshine pic.twitter.com/kj8S5qrP9D\n— Mike Baird (@mikebairdMP) August 12, 2015 \"*offer excludes harbour, infrastructure and sunshine,\" Mr Baird tweeted.\nTo his credit, Mr Andrews fired back just three minutes later. \"You're just grumpy because you haven't had a decent coffee since you were last in Melbourne! But thanks for the free coverage.\"\n\"Rather than half a dozen confusing messages ... we've instead got one clear message,\" Mr Andrews told the launch at Melbourne Park tennis centre on Wednesday.\nReaction to the campaign on twitter was mixed on Wednesday with the logo compared to the Fremantle Dockers jumper, the old State Bank of Victoria logo and a map of Tassie.\n . @mikebairdMP You're just grumpy because you haven't had a decent coffee since you were last in Melbourne! But thanks for the free coverage.\n— Daniel Andrews (@DanielAndrewsMP) August 12, 2015 \"Life was so much easier when we were just the garden state,\" James Johnson tweeted. \"The best of everything..train/tram strikes..traffic gridlock..dollars wasted,\" Kristi tweeted.\nState Opposition Leader Matthew Guy called the campaign \"thoroughly underwhelming and ... a catastrophic waste of money\".\n\"It looks like an advert for Tasmania,\" Mr Guy said.\n\"If it said 'TAS' in the triangle not 'VIC' you'd think it was branding for Tassie.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin", "https://twitter.com/mikebairdMP", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/google-is-now-alphabet-making-sense-of-a-crazy-corporate-announcement-20150810-giw566.html", "http://t.co/kj8S5qrP9D", "http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/the-big-v-victoria-gets-a-20m-brand-makeover-20150812-gixcmb.html", "https://twitter.com/mikebairdMP/status/631342185653252096", "https://twitter.com/DanielAndrewsMP/status/631346936960974848"], "published": "2015-08-12T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:56:40.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
