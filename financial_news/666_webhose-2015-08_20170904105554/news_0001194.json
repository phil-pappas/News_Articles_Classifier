The market watchdog said it might issue observations on draft offer document within 30 days after receiving a satisfactory reply from the lead merchant banker regarding the clarification or additional information sought from it. \nSebi had earlier this month also sought clarification from InterGlobe Aviation, which runs the country's biggest airline by market share under IndiGo brand. \nThe regulator received last communication from the merchant banker on July 29. Indigo had filed its draft offer document with Sebi on June 30, 2015. \nAs per the draft papers, the company has offered to issue fresh shares worth Rs 1,272 crore. An equivalent amount can be raised through sale of up to 3.01 crore shares by its existing shareholders. \nCitigroup, JPMorgan India, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, UBS Securities India and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company are managers for the share sale.
