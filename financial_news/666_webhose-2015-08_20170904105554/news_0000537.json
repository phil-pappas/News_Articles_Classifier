Additionally, the launch of EDGX Options will help enable BATS to better compete for a fresh segment of order flow that doesn’t trade on the price-time markets. \nAccording to Bryan Harkins, Executive Vice President and Head of US Markets at BATS in a recent statement on the regulatory approval, “We are pleased to receive approval from the SEC to launch EDGX Options and we are looking forward to making our mark in a new segment of the options market.” \n“Two-thirds of U.S. options market volume is executed on exchanges with a pro rata model and we believe we can help make markets better for participants in this segment of the market through our innovative technology, operating efficiency, market-leading pricing, and first-class customer service,” added Mr. Harkins.
