Villa prices declined between 2-2.4 percent, the analysts said. \nEarlier this month, Cityscape Group director Wouter Molman said recent price declines in Dubai's property market are part of a \"normal correction which was always inevitable” and that medium to long-term prospects remained positive. \nMolman said end-users were set to capitalise on stabilisation within the Dubai real estate market as more affordable housing options entered the market ahead of Expo 2020, and price adjustments improved affordability of existing stock. \n\"We must understand that Dubai is experiencing a normal market correction which was always inevitable,\" Molman said. \nThe YouGov survey, of 861 UAE residents, also found that location was a significant factor in determining where investors purchased their property. \nProperties near public transportation are the most attractive and in demand (56 percent), followed by those close to grocery stores (44 percent), retail shopping malls (41 percent) and mosques (37 percent), the survey found. \nIt also said studios and one bedroom apartments were growing in popularity, with investors shifting their focus to smaller, more affordable residential options.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T15:42:04.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
