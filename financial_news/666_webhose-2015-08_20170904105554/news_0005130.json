They have also been hurt by falls in food prices, reflecting record commodity-led deflation. \n(Reporting by James davey, writing by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T15:56:54.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
