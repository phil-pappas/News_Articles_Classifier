Andrew Meares by Joanna Mather New superannuation board rules will be altered to clarify the definition of \"independent\", but the government is refusing to give in to demands for more sweeping changes.\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is due to introduce new laws requiring all super funds to have at least one-third independent directors and an independent chairman from July 1, 2016.\nMr Frydenberg said additional detail about what constituted independence would be included in the amended laws following feedback from the industry. There were complaints that too much of the detail had been left to the prudential regulator. The precise wording of the revised draft has not been released.\nBut in a snub to industry super funds, the government has said it would not reinstate a requirement that boards have equal representation from employer and employee groups, as well as one-third independent directors.\nIndustry Super Australia had argued that its members had generated higher returns than their competitors in retail funds, which are mostly owned by the big banks.\n\"Governance requirements should rest upon clear empirical evidence, and the case for change has not been made,\" Industry Super has told the government.\nIt says the requirement to replace some directors, or engage new ones in other cases, could cost up to $168 million , which would be borne by members of the non-profit funds.\nTwo reviews have recommended more independent trustees on super boards and the Australian Institute of Company Directors endorsed the government's legislation as \"sensible\".\n \"All parties should now embrace the spirit of the legislation, which is to adopt global standards of governance that apply to other public entities,\" AICD chief executive John Brodgen said.\nBut a leading superannuation lawyer has questioned the legislation. Hall and Wilcox partner Heather Gray, who examined the proposed changes for the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST), said existing legislation and standards already dealt with the issues the government said it was trying to address.\nThese include requiring boards to have broad expertise and skills and mechanisms to manage conflict of interest.\n\"The proposals don't seem to be adding anything to what we already have and yet they will require the restructuring of boards and a distraction for funds managing the investments of members,\" she said. \"What is it that's broken? That has not really been identified.\"\nAIST opposes the changes and has demanded to know why the system needs fixing when it is not broken.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:54:32.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
