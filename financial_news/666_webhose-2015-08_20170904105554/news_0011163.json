The plaintiffs said this could have averted the 13 deaths, and many more injuries.\n\"Plaintiffs believed the automakers' repeated promises that the affected vehicles were safe,\" the complaint said. \"In fact they are not.\nThe lawsuit seeks an injunction to require the automakers to install an automatic shut-off feature. It also seeks compensatory and punitive damages, among other remedies.\nToyota declined to comment. None of the other automakers had an immediate comment. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a U.S. federal regulator, did not immediately respond to a similar request.\nThe lawsuit is the latest seeking to hold the automotive industry liable for defects that could make driving unsafe, such as Takata airbags and ignition switches on GM vehicles.\nIt was filed in the same court where Toyota defended against lawsuits claiming that some of its vehicles accelerated unintentionally.\nU.S. District Judge James Selna in 2013 approved a $1.6 billion settlement to resolve claims that Toyota vehicles lost value because of the defect. It is unclear whether he will be assigned the keyless ignition case.\nThe case is Draeger et al v. Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 15-06491.
