Daniel Munoz Share on twitter by James Thomson What a difference a few months make.\nIt was May 5 and Mike Smith was deeply unimpressed by what described as the \"frenzy\" that the banking sector had whipped itself into over capital raisings, in the face of the Financial System Inquiry and the global push to raise capital levels.\nWhile Smith said that \"it is quite clear that capital requirements from a regulatory perspective will generally increase,\" ANZ was not in a hurry.\nHe even took a shot at investment banks for whipping up the capital raising push.\n\"It is very much the analyst community that are running hot on capital at the moment. It's no surprise their corporate finance people are queuing up and saying 'we hear you need capital and we've got a good idea for you'. It's self bloody interest frankly,\" Smith told The Australian Financial Review at the time.\n\"We have been managing our capital position in a period of uncertainty for the last seven years and I think we have a pretty good track record at it. There is absolutely no need to panic. They are like a bunch of lemmings frankly.\"\n\"I don't see the benefit of holding more capital than you require,\" Smith said. \"When we did it during the crisis, we got no value for it – the market did not see us as being safer.\"\nFast forward almost exactly three months and ANZ has announced a $3 billion capital raising which the bank says will help it \"more quickly and efficiently accommodate additional capital requirements recently announced by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), in particular the increase in average credit risk weights for major bank Australian mortgage portfolios to 25 per cent taking effect from 1 July 2016.\"\n The raising comes after Westpac, CBA and NAB have made moves to raise capital in recent months. It is appears Wayne Byres at APRA has done some arm twisting.\nSmith might not have moved first, but ANZ is moving fast – that's the big conclusion from the fact the bank is raising $2.5 billion from institutional investors and $500 million from retail investors.\nRaising cash from instos via a placement is much quicker than raising money from mums and dads through a share purchase plan.\nBut this is already creating disquiet in the market, and there is a real anger that retail investors are getting the rough end of pineapple.\nRetail shareholders, and specifically self-managed super fund trustees, would dearly love the chance to buy into a big four bank at a discount, the lion's share of that opportunity will go to the big end of town.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-08-06T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:09:17.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
