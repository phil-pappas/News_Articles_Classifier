In July, credit card payments was re-introduced in India for all Android users, in partnership with MobiKwik. Now, users across iOS and Android platforms have the option to pay via debit/credit cards. \"Adhering to RBI regulations, there will be a two-factor authentication flow built into the app and users will have to enter either their online banking pin or their one-time password to request for a ride using their debit/credit card,\" the company said in a statement. Commenting on the new payment mode rollout, an Uber spokesperson said: \"At Uber, we're about making transportation as convenient and hassle-free as possible.\" \"As we continue to focus on our mission to re-define urban mobility in India, riders will have the ability to chose from debit/ credit card payments, Paytm (digital wallet), and Cash (in 6 cities),\" he added. The company earlier said that it was allowing cash payments, too, in the six cities of Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kochi and Pune. The move assumes significance as Uber's global business model does not allow cash transactions.
