All but the technology, industrial and health care sectors lost ground.\nEnergy SXEP, -0.90% and the basic resources SXPP, -0.57% sectors were the worst performing at the start of the week. Miners, sensitive to China’s economic developments, received weak data over the weekend with China saying exports in July fell 8.3% from a year earlier and imports dropped 8.1%. On Sunday, the government said the producer-price index marked its biggest year-over-year fall in nearly six years.\nThe data were “nothing short of ugly and would indicate that a 7% GDP read is very much elusive,” said Brenda Kelly, analyst at London Capital Group, in a Monday note.\nShares of Anglo American PLC AAL, -2.19% fell 2.4%, Antofagasta PLC ANTO, -1.87% lost 2.3% and Fresnillo PLC FRES, -1.02% fell 1.3%. Glencore PLC GLEN, -0.86% GLNCY, +1.13% fell 1.3% as Investec cut its rating on the mining heavyweight to sell from buy.\nThe drops helped push the FTSE 100 UKX, -0.75% lower by 0.7% to 6,672.91. Chinese stocks set aside the data, however, and logged their biggest one-day gain in a month on expectations Beijing will maintain its support for the market.\nIn other moves, Germany’s DAX 30 DAX, +0.33% was off 1 point at 11,489.52 while France’s CAC 40 PX1, +0.39% clung to a 1 point gain at 5,155.86.\nGreece’s Athex Composite GD, +1.38% outperformed, rising 1% to 683.14. The Greek government appeared closer to cinching a deal for a third financial bailout following talks with creditors over the weekend.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:00:31.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
