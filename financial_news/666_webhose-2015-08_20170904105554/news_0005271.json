Britain's space smarts are changing the lives of people on the ground, all over the world \nNick Potts is standing outside the Comfort Inn in Palo Alto, California, wearing a lurid orange polo shirt. “I’m famous for wearing the ugliest colours,” he says. “I have cerise pink and lime green. They help people spot me in a crowd.” \nIt’s a strange networking technique but one that attracted the attention of a new US distributor at the Small Satellite Conference in Utah last week which could lead to “millions” in new revenue. \nHe is about to head off to Silicon Valley to meet the head honchos at Lockheed Martin, maker of the Hubble Telescope , and is hoping his lucky shirt will get him noticed again. \nPotts, who describes himself as a “mad scientist”, is one of nine British entrepreneurs taking part in a trade mission run by UK Trade & Investment and Innovate UK, the Government-backed innovation agency, targeting the space industry. The organisations wants the UK’s share of the global space economy to grow to 10pc by 2030. \nThe Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) claims that space is one of the six premier engineering and technology-led sectors that are likely to have the biggest positive impact on the UK economy in the coming decades . \nPotts is alongside whizz kids such as Tom Walkinshaw who has built Pocket-Qube Shop, where people can build and launch their own small satellites weighing around a kilo, known as cubesats and Michele Coletti, the rocket scientist who founded Mars Space in 2007 to create super-efficient electronic propulsion systems to launch satellites into space. \nThey are part of a wave of talent that could secure Britain’s future in space systems , expected to be worth £40bn a year within 15 years. \n“All of these burgeoning firms are at the forefront of the new space race and have built innovative solutions to some of the sector’s greatest challenges,” says Tim Just, head of space at Innovate. \nOn this trip, nine companies are seeking either to raise money, find customers or create partnerships. They competed with hundreds of rivals in the UK space industry for a place on the mission, and are being introduced to venture capitalists as “the cream of UK space enterprise”. \nAmong the American VCs being wooed is O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, which backed Planet Labs, the San Francisco based start-up that is working to cover the Earth with tiny satellites for imaging, humanitarian and environmental applications . \nTo put the appetite for US space investment into context, Planet Labs has raised $183m (£117m) to date. \nPotts isn’t here to raise investment, he’s here to tell everyone that his 25-year-old company, Printech Circuit Laboratories, is the go-to company for any satellite maker who can’t use or doesn’t want to use standard parts. \nEvery circuit is made bespoke with novel manufacturing techniques and groundbreaking new materials, and the price of a Printech circuit ranges from £300 to £50,000. \nThe Essex-based firm works with industry giants such as Airbus on widgets for its imaging and telecoms satellites, but is also a crucial partner for universities which launch cubesats into space to gather data on topics ranging from weather to earthquakes. “We have thousands of circuits flying right now,” he says. \nMost notably, its flexible circuit boards were used in the imaging technology on the European Space Agency’s $1bn Gaia mission, which last month sent back a spectacular map of the Milky Way. \nUsing Printech’s technology, Gaia’s camera is so powerful “it can detect a human hair from a distance of a thousand kilometres in the dark,” says Potts. \nThe firm’s business model is to do fewer jobs at a higher value, so that it now generates the same revenue £3m a year undertaking 50 jobs a month as it did with 300 a few years ago. \nMike Lawton is also hoping to seal some lucrative deals. The founder and chief executive of Oxford Space Systems (OSS) is developing the next generation of “deployable structures” objects to fling into space focusing on antennas, hinges and other hardware. \nA core member of OSS is an origami expert who is devising new ways for robots to furl and unfurl in space. Lawton says: “If you ask the European Space Agency how long it takes to go from idea to first flight, they’ll tell you 10 years. We are managing to go from concept to flight in about two and a half years that means we’ll be setting a bit of a record in the space industry,” \nOSS is based at the Harwell Space Cluster, the UK’s “space gateway”, and home to ECSAT, the European Space Agency’s new facility. In 18 months, the area has grown from 40 to more than 60 space-focused organisations. \nArralis Technologies’ Mike Gleaves has also had a productive trip, meeting with Nasa to discuss supplying his ultra-fast radar technology for the US agency’s upcoming projects. \nNot all the companies on the Space Mission are in the hardware game. \nStephen McCabe’s Edinburgh-based Scot Sat provides high-speed broadband to the shipping industry using satellite technology. Its antenna technology, which was developed using 3D printed parts, claims to bring down the cost of broadband, charged at $6 per megabyte by incumbents such as Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) . Streaming a video on Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) can eat up to 250MB an hour. \nHis invention could hugely improve the lives of workers out at sea. \n“Crew retention is a big thing in shipping,” he explains. “If you can give people internet so they can Skype their families and check Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) , it has a huge impact on retention.” \nScot Sat will charge $1,800 a month all-in for always-on broadband, and McCabe is aiming to secure 10pc of the $2bn market. This is an ambitious target but the serial entrepreneur is not starting from scratch: he sold his previous maritime broadband business NewWave Broadband to Inmarsat in 2012. \nThe Scottish space industry employs more than 5,000 people and has doubled its turnover in three years. Dundee-based Bright Ascension, which provides software for satellites, is another Scottish representative on the space trade mission, along with Walkinshaw’s PocketQube Shop. \nThe UK punches well above its weight in the global space business, especially when it comes to nanotechnology, robotics, quantum physics and machine learning. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has less than 1pc of the world’s population but accounts for 3.2pc of global expenditure on research and development and produces 6.4pc of global journal articles and 15.8pc of the most highly cited articles, according to the UK Science & Innovation Network. \nBrad Petris, vice-president of corporate research and development at $46bn-turnover giant Lockheed Martin (Swiss: LMT.SW - news ) , says: “There’s more innovation going on in the UK than we can handle. The breadth and depth of investment in academia and SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] from the UK Government is some of the best in the world.” \nJoyeeta Das’ start-up, Gyana, uses machine learning to bring satellite-imaging data to the masses. The Oxford graduate has built a neural network based on the human brain, which allows artificial intelligence to scan images of the world and draw conclusions about what it “sees”. \nThis means it can be asked questions ranging from how many oil wells there are in Sudan to the number of Richard Geres you could fit in Wembley Stadium any question on which there is either imaging or statistical data. \n“The important thing about Gyana is that it has integrity,” she says. “If you ask Google (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) about oil wells in an area, and people don’t want you to know they are there and haven’t registered them, you won’t find them, but the image does not lie.” \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) has also built a sentiment index to work alongside the satellite search, which will allow people to find out what residents of an area are feeling, based on social media data. \n“Imagine a politician is giving a talk, and we know there’s a crowd so we see that it’s happening, and our systems show people are unhappy. You wouldn’t have to wait for the exit polls to find out which way they would vote,” she says. \nThe technology is free to use and a mobile app will launch for consumers next month. Banks, governments and consultancies are testing the service, Das claims, and will pay for analytics services if their trials are successful. \nDas (Other OTC: DASX - news ) , 30, who is on her third start-up, is seeking $1.5m in funding on this trip to build out the software and is also in talks with some of the world’s largest satellite imaging providers, such as Nasa, to access their data for free. \n“I want to put hi-tech technology in the hands of the consumer,” says Das. \nBird (Shanghai: 600130.SS - news ) .i founder Chris Brunskill wants to help everyday people access satellite images owned by governments or corporations through a single platform. “Imagine taking a real-time selfie from space,” he says. “Or checking that the hotel you’ve booked for your holiday doesn’t have a building site next door.” \nThe start-up is seeking $1m in seed capital. “It’s not difficult to buy satellite data but it’s difficult to do it in a way that’s meaningful,” says Brunskill who wants to work with other businesses to offer his curated images as a bolt-on to zoom in on your tent at Glastonbury through the festival app, for example. \nIt will be fascinating to see which of these nine entrepreneurs goes the furthest in the new space race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T20:16:14.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
