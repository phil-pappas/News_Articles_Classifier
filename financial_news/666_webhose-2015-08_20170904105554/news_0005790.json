Nearly two-thirds of consumers admit that they will spend more time watching video if they can interact with it. \n“The marketplace is being flooded with content, but our research shows that brands need to go beyond pushing passive content,” said Erika Trautman, founder and CEO of Rapt Media. “Brands that rely on passive content to win customers are missing their biggest opportunity for engagement and collecting consumer insights. They need to produce content that contains participatory elements, especially in video, to give consumers greater control over their content and drive meaningful engagement.” \nRapt Media’s research reveals consumers have shown that choices are no longer nice-to-haves; they’re increasingly expecting more options for controlling their online experience based on what is most interesting and relevant to them. Consumers also want control in the way they discover information online, which means brands can’t simply push owned content at consumers without considering overall engagement and response rates. \nKey findings from the survey indicate: 89% want control over the ads they’re shown online 57% want to find content on their own versus through advertising 64% will spend more time watching video if they can actively participate 86% want to be able to control the topics they see on news sites 56% like choosing content that is relevant to them \nDownload The Power of Choice report to discover how to improve the customer experience and create engaging content.
