Photo: Reuters\nApple Inc has attracted more than $2.5 billion of orders from fixed income fund managers within hours of launching its first Australian dollar corporate bond issue , according to bond market sources.\nThe Californian-based tech giant formally launched a two-part bond issue on Thursday morning of four- and seven-year bonds after its bankers arranged a series of investor calls for fund managers earlier in the week. The order book reached $1 billion within two hours of the offer launch, but is understood to have more than doubled to $2.5 billion by late afternoon as investors clamoured for bonds of the AA+ global technology company.\nThe \"Kangaroo\" bond – a term for bonds sold by foreign entities into the Australian dollar market – is being managed by Goldman Sachs, Commonwealth Bank and Deutsche Bank, who will set the final deal size on Friday morning when the bonds are priced. Should the final deal value exceed $1 billion, it will be the largest sale of bonds by a non-financial corporation in the Australian market, surpassing the $1 billion raised by BHP Billiton in October 2012.\nApple's bonds were initially marketed at a price guidance of 0.70 percentage points over the bank rate for the four-year bonds, for a yield of about 3 per cent, and 1.15 percentage points over the swap rate for the seven-year bonds - for a yield of about 4 per cent. But pricing guidance was moved in by 5 basis points to reflect strong interest in the sale.\nThe pricing appeared slightly expensive relative to the trading levels of Apple's US bonds, investors said. Even at those low yields, Apple's bonds are proving attractive because they allow fund managers a highly rated alternative to the major banks in their portfolios.\nApple has a AA+ credit rating, two notches higher than the AA- ratings of the major banks and one notch below the AAA credit rating of the Australian government.\nApple, which has so far raised $US50 billion ($68 billion) of debt since May 2013, has a cash balance of more than $US200 billion, but since most of the funds are in overseas jurisdictions, it borrows money to return funds to shareholders to avoid paying a large tax bill. As the company's funding task grows, it is seeking to diversify into new markets including Australia . About 89 per cent of Apple's cash is held outside of the US.\nThe company said the proceeds were intended for \"general corporate purposes\" including share buybacks, dividend payments and to fund working capital, capital expenditure, acquisitions and debt repayments.\nApple's bond issue has been regarded as a big endorsement of the Australian corporate bond market which is now attracting the attention of some of the largest companies in the world. Though highly rated government-backed agencies and banks have issued frequently in the Australian bond market, debt market bankers have struggled to attract the industrial companies from Australia and around the world that fund managers have craved.\nSo far in 2015, non-financial companies such as SABMiller, Optus, BHP and Wesfarmers have raised $5.7 billion in the bond market, just over 6 per cent of total issuance, compared with $14 billion raised in the local bond market by the big four banks.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/markets/market-data/bonds/why-apple-is-coming-to-the-australian-bond-market-20150817-gj0r15"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:24:31.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
