For those with more than £50,000 in savings, the rate rises to 1.48pc. \nInvestec Bank has a two-year “double base” product, which promises to pay double the Bank Rate plus 0.6pc. If interest rates follow expectations and rise to 0.75pc in the new year, the account would pay 2.1pc. Balances must be between £25,000 and £2m. \nCambridge Building Society and Kent Reliance both have two-year tracker Isas that promise to pay 1pc above Bank Rate, while Aldermore has an instant access account that pays 0.5pc above until at least May 2016. \nIn comparison, the best two-year fixed-rate account is Secure Trust Bank's 2.38pc bond, while Leeds Building Society this week launched a market-leading three-year fixed rate cash Isa paying 2.3pc. \nThe best variable rate savings products \nProvider Savings product Category Min deposit Max deposit Rate Guarantee Halifax Online Tracker Bond (18 months) Variable Rate Bond £500 £9m 1.43pc above BR. 1.48pc on balances over £50,000 Investec Bank Two-year Double Base Variable Rate Bond £25,000 £2m At least double BR, plus 0.6pc Cambridge BS Two-year Base Rate Tracker Isa Issue 9 Variable Rate Isa £500 £15,240 1pc above BR Kent Reliance Two-year Tracker Cash Isa Issue 6 Variable Rate Isa £1 £1m 1pc above BR Kent Reliance Two-year Tracker Bond Issue 6 Variable Rate Bond £1 £1m 1pc above BR Barclays (Swiss: BARC.SW - news ) Children's Instant Saver Issue 1 Children's Account £1 £10m 1pc above BR. Will never fall below 1.5pc Aldermore Easy Access Account Issue 9 Easy Access £1 £1m At least 0.5pc above BR until May 1 2016 Lloyds Bank 18-month Tracker Bond Variable Rate Bond £2,000 £1m 0.4pc above BR. 0.59pc above on balances over £50,000 \nSusan Hannums, of independent savings advice site Savingschampion.co.uk, said: “The sacrifice of guaranteeing that your savings rate will rise in line with any future base rate rise is usually a lower rate of interest than the very best available from other savings accounts. \n“However there are some interesting options for those who don’t want to chase the very best rates, especially when all the signs point to a rise in the Bank Rate in the near future. \n“The simple truth is that keeping your money on the move is likely to be the best way to give you better returns now and in the future you can’t simply rest of your laurels. But if you don’t want the hassle of switching accounts to get better returns, a base rate tracker could be a good option.” \n• For money-saving tips, tricks and ideas, get our weekly round-up here", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T13:28:44.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
