We went to see my family in Sicily when I was young and I remember trying on all these shoes and there were these magnificent pointy-toe high pumps with red leather bolts down the side. The reason the business came about was because I couldn't find what I was looking for. I like a very high heel or a total flat. You'll rarely see me in anything in between. I'm quite particular about the style of the heel and the colour of the materials and things like that.\nWhat's your personal style?\nI love interesting silhouettes. Textures are really important to me as well, such as pairing a pair of leather leggings with a textured wool jumper over the top. If I am looking at a skirt or dress, I want something that is lined as beautifully as it is made on the outside as well. I think that's critical to the enjoyment of wearing. I do tend towards a more monochrome palette, for the day to day, but I am stretching myself into colours more. I'm better at it in my shoes than I am in my clothes. I fall asleep at night looking at clothes on Net-a-Porter and Moda Operandi where the designers release their collections like a showroom before the collection runs have been done, so you can pre-order. I also look at their site to see what they are predicting will be the next big designers and I also look at their sales and see what didn't sell. That gives me an indication of the trends that aren't catching on. How does your style relate to your brand?\nI'm doing some work on what is the brand of Jodie Fox, how that connects with Shoes of Prey and whether that's a separate brand or whether they sit side by side. So style is more than just the way that I enjoy wearing my clothes now, it is something that is part of a bigger picture in the business. We will go into clothes. Shoes of Prey is not about shoes, it's about getting people what they want, when they want it. We will go into handbags next, then clothing, then lifestyle products.\nYou've opened six shops in the US in Nordstrom. What do you notice about style in different cities?\n It's interesting to see the cultural differences. Seattle is boots and dark colours. Miami is strappy, colourful things. San Francisco is flat, flat, flat. Seattle as well. The best thing you can do with style is wear your clothing, not have it wear you.\nYou've been travelling non-stop for the past six months. How have you survived that?\nI am in two cities or two countries a week. This week I am Sydney, Canberra. Last week it was Perth, Sydney. The week before, it was Berlin, Darwin. I have things that can ground me so I have a NutriBullet so I can have green smoothies, a candle, a silk pillowslip and a really comfortable pair of pyjamas or something I can wear on a plane.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoGrayBoss", "https://www.shoesofprey.com/"], "published": "2015-08-06T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T16:03:58.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
