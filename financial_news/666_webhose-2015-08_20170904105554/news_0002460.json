Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Just over a year ago, UberX didn't exist in Australia. Now it has 15,000 drivers, one million users and has provided five million rides. That's suddenly big business. It's also why Uber and the Australian Tax Office are locked in a ferocious battle over the payment of GST .\nThis will go to Federal Court after Uber challenged the ATO ruling that it is a taxi service. That means all Uber drivers must register and pay 10 per cent GST on every ride – just like taxi drivers.\nTax commissioner Chris Jordan dismisses Uber's claim it is not a taxi service because it doesn't pick up passengers on the street. According to the ATO's final ruling, Uber fits the definition because it involves cars hired to transport passengers for a fee. But no other country has so far defined Uber as a taxi service – another reason Uber is fighting hard to avoid the precedent here.\nYet even this fight is only one chapter of a much more complicated story. How should governments regulate – as well as tax – the new \"sharing economy?\" Is it appropriate to apply traditional rules to new services or will this limit innovation and new jobs?\nMost state governments in Australian are still in a state of complete confusion over this. Some have imposed fines on Uber drivers only to have them paid by the business and ignored by consumers and drivers alike. Now that Uber is challenging the fines in court, state governments are dropping them too. A welter of government reviews is the predictable result.\nTaxi drivers and their industry associations fume about loss of income and customers and demand action from authorities against what they see as unfair and illegal competition. Politicians are very wary that an attempt to restrict a service increasingly favoured by the public is likely to be dangerously unpopular as well as ineffective.\nTraditional business models up-ended Australia's not alone in having problems navigating its way out of the dilemma. Uber is riding high on a global tidal wave of change up-ending traditional business models and transforming consumer patterns. Within a few years, it has grown to operate in 320 cities in more than 50 countries and its last capital raising valued it at over $US50 billion ($67 billion) six years after starting up.\n But many governments and regulators are fighting a losing battle to limit its power . New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was recently forced to back down from an attempt to restrict Uber numbers. France, Germany and Spain are attempting (with limited success) to ban or restrict Uber. The European Commission will issue guidelines this year on how to regulate \"collaborative economy\" services. In the US, many politicians – left and right – celebrate Uber as an example of entrepreneurialism, combining the creation of jobs with the power of consumers.\nIn 2012, David Rohrsheim was doing his MBA at Stanford when he saw first hand the growing popularity of Uber in San Franciso. He convinced Uber he could extend the service to Australia.\nThe result is Australian taxis will never return to an era where licenses were expensive restricted commodities with little competition. Instead, the industry has belatedly had to improve its own standards to try to match a service where passenger ratings really do matter.\nNot that Uber refers to its drivers by such an old economy term . They are \"partners\", usually working part time, typically about 20 hours a week. Each Uber registered partner arranges the fee in advance over the app with a passenger, paid for by credit card. Uber takes a 20 per cent cut and the charge on average is still about 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than taxis.\nBut that's where the tax issue gets so heated. Drivers pay income tax but the ATO is determined to apply the GST as well. Jordan is clearly irritated by Uber's aggressive public campaign, which he considers highly misleading.\n\"I recognise Uber is a real innovation that makes getting a ride somewhere easy,\" he says. \"My children have used the service. I've seen the app when they've caught a ride home, and I can see how simple and effective it is – a terrific demonstration of entrepreneurship. But, as with all businesses, it comes with an obligation to pay tax.\"\nSo from August 1, the ATO has required \"ride sharing drivers\" to pay GST on every fare (including the 20 per cent deducted by Uber) – just like taxi drivers must. Other business enterprises, in contrast, have a $75,000 threshold before they are required to pay GST.\nRohrsheim argues ATO \"bureaucrats\" should not be determining policy ahead of the Federal government's tax review and negotiations with state governments – which he says he is still waiting to occur. Jordan retorts \"the law is very clear\" so there's no need for it to be part of the review.\nAccording to Rohrsheim, Uber wants regulation suitable for the digital age rather than a clunky, inefficient system where the complications of quarterly business activity statements will deter some Uber drivers from earning cash, creating employment and providing a new service. It would make more sense, he says, for the states to negotiate fees with Uber, citing the example of Washington DC where Uber pays the government 1 per cent on every ride.\nOn course, 1 per cent is a lot different to 10 per cent. And Uber could take responsibility for GST collection if it weren't billing its service through the Netherlands. The Australian business is officially owned by a Dutch company – typical of the complicated low tax arrangements favoured by global digital companies. Although Joe Hockey likes to talk enthusiastically about the growth businesses like Uber, he likes the idea of hard revenue even more.
