Following a successful pilot, this approach will eventually be used for the medium to long-term issues,' he said. \n'This is part of the debt management initiatives outlined in the Budget such as the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund, Sinking Fund, Ghana Exim, Escrow and on-lending,' Mr Terpker added. \nMr Terkper said a key objective of public debt management is to promote the development of an efficient primary and secondary domestic securities market that would provide benchmark rates for the entire economy and across maturity spectrum. \nDr Sam Mensah, a government advisor on securities, said the medium to long-term bonds would help in infrastructural development while the short-term issues could be used primarily to boost liquidity. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T21:03:02.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
