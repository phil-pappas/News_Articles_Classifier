in the mines, factories and workplaces of the modern world, autonomous machines are lowering error rates and lifting productivity.\nBut their introduction has yet to deliver accident-free workplaces.\nAdvertisement In its review of the water-cart incident, Western Australia's Department of Mines and Petroleum recommended that humans and intelligent machines should be kept away from each other.\n\"Where possible, eliminate manned activities within the autonomous mining area,\" said the department in its recommendations to the company.\n\"Where manned activities are unavoidable within the autonomous mining area, identify opportunities to mitigate potential interactions between manned and autonomous equipment.\"\nThe advice might be feasible in a mining context, but experts say segregation from intelligent machines will not be possible in most other aspects of life, not least public roads where Google and other players are already trialling autonomous cars.\n\"Traditionally the way things have often been framed is that you should put the machines inside a fence and keep humans on the other side of the fence,\" says Professor Stefan Williams, from the University of Sydney's School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering.\n\"But I think you are seeing an increasing push towards making robots that are safe and can work around people.\"\nWhen schoolchildren go on excursions to the University of Sydney's robotics centre, they love to play with Baxter, the flexible, adaptive, multi-armed, manipulator created by US company Rethink Robotics.\nBaxter is designed to work beside humans on manual tasks, and its ability to adapt to things around it, and \"feel\" for anomalies, means humans can be safe in its company.\nBaxter is an example of what advanced workplaces now call a \"co-bot\" rather than robot; a machine that works in close partnership with human workers to make their job easier and more productive.\nBut humans are used to the behaviour of other humans, and sometimes the presence of robots can make humans more error prone.\nFor example, some drivers have been confused by how slow Google's autonomous cars react when traffic lights turn green, and accident reports suggest the autonomous vehicles are most commonly rear-ended by human drivers who are at fault.\nIt has also emerged that the autonomous vehicles struggle when in snow or when trying to turn across oncoming traffic.The latter weakness is not dissimilar to the water-cart collision, where contact was made after the autonomous dump truck turned across oncoming traffic.\n\"The real challenge will be making these autonomous systems able to have common sense, reasoning or logic, these are the things we still need to achieve,\" says Swinburne University's Professor of Intelligent Systems, Ryszard Kowalczyk.\nIf avoiding autonomous and intelligent machines will not be possible in the future, Professor Williams says safety regulations will need to adapt to suit a world where people work beside Baxters, ride in autonomous cars and fly drones for fun.\n\"I think there is going to have be a whole legislative framework that is going to have to come around those kinds of things,\" he says.\n\"There are a number of legislative measures being put in place for the flight of unmanned air vehicles which are increasingly popular, and I'm not sure the road rules have quite caught up with what is coming.\"\nProminent economist and innovation commentator Nicholas Gruen says governments should avoid regulation based on ideology.\n\"The aim has to be to meet the existing obligations of occupational health and safety in a changing environment. These are the sorts of issues that arise and we have to solve them on their merits, not by ideology.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:54:27.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
