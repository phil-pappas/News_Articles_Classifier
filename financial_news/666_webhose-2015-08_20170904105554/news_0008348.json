Jo Empson by Amy Wilson-Chapman There is a humming in my ears, and it isn't music.\nIt's Peter Segal, a well-known American radio host (though I didn't realise at the time), and he's telling his story about running the Boston marathon as a guide for a visually impaired man – William Grear.\nStanding on stage at The Moth he talks about being a keen runner who'd just run his personal best time and was looking for something … more.\n\"I have run thousands of miles, and yet I am still here,\" he quipped on stage.\nGeorge Dawes Green, an American poet and novelist who brought the Moth idea to fruition in 1997. Supplied It was a particularly easy job as the world-famous running event has just two turns, he told the audience, which is now worldwide thanks to the organisation's weekly podcast.\nBut as they take the first of those last turns, with less than a mile to go, William says he doesn't think he can go on anymore. He tells Peter he wants to stop … but Peter gets him to keep going – and he does.\nWilliam charges ahead and rushes across the finish line. William, who is exhausted and in pain, asks Peter to help him find his wife.\n\"And then, boom! The loudest noise I'd ever heard … and about 10 seconds later another boom.\"\n The Moth host David Crabb says storytelling reminds people of what they often forget – empathy. It was the sound of the Boston bombings. Had Peter not pushed William, well, who knows what would have happened to the two men?.\nHumans have been telling stories like these for as long as they've existed. Long before we could write, our tales and myths were passed down from one generation to another through the spoken word. As we couldn't write down our stories, it was important to be not just a good listener, but also a good storyteller.\nNew start for storytelling But is any of that relevant in 2015?\nJenifer Hixson, a producer with The Moth, who will help develop the Moth StorySLAM in Australia. The Moth The Moth certainly thinks so. And its wildly popular podcast, which just like a moth to a bright light, has drawn worldwide attention to the ancient art, appears to have given story-telling a new life.\nStarted in 1997, by American poet and novelist George Dawes Green who used to gather on his porch and share tales with his friends, the live storytelling events have now spread from the United States to Britain and are about to start in Australia - from August 24 in Melbourne, from September 1 in Sydney.\nAt the crux of the idea is authenticity, truth and the idea anyone can get on stage and share their tales – \"without notes\".\n\"They really bring literature to life in a unique and unusual way,\" says Melbourne Writers Festival chief executive Lisa Dempster – also an avid podcast listener.\n\"The great thing that digital can do is amplify something that's happening, so they've been able to grow internationally by promotion.\"\nI must admit, when my friend first suggested I listen to The Moth, I thought it sounded hippie-like, cringeworthy. All that emotion? Why would I want to listen to other people tell what I could think would be nothing more than a lively version of Twitter's #firstworldproblems.\nBut what I found shocked me. Tales of people – from all walks of life – that (most of the time) keep me entertained and wanting to know what happens next.\nLike that guy who fixed the Hubble Telescope. Do you know him? Neither did I, until he got up on stage and told of his fear about not being able to tighten a screw – all while staring back down at the earth. Or the lady who ended up crying in my ears as I stood in the supermarket trying to decide if I wanted vanilla or greek yoghurt. I had to turn her off, save her sad story for another time.\nAwakening empathy I'm not alone in my fascination. The podcast, which started in 2008, was downloaded by 27 million people last year.\nAuthor, actor and storytelling educator, David Crabb, tells me his relatives and friends often drive home from the shops, or dropping the kids at school, and sit in their driveway for 15 minutes because they're desperate to hear the end of a story.\nCrabb, who will host some of The Moth events in Australia, says anyone can tell a good story and that's what he \"loves so much about storytelling\".\n\"You look at this cast of people, and sure there are people who are clearly there because they're a comedian, they're an actor, they're a writer, but they're mixed in with people who have interesting stories to share that might be librarians or might be accountants.\"\nThe real success of The Moth, he says, is that it awakens a part of our humanity that has almost been forgotten – empathy.\n\"Someone can tell a story that is so not related to any experience you've had, but what a great story teller does is make that experience, however other worldly, into a mirror.\n\"They find some way to use that narrative to connect to an audience… What The Moth does by getting these stories out there is it makes people feel we're a little bit more alike.\n\"I think that is key.\"\nYour truest self The Moth holds two types of shows. The Moth Mainstage, part of this year's Festival of Dangerous Ideas in Sydney and the Melbourne Writer's Festival, and to be hosted by Crabb, features polished storytellers who have worked with Moth producers to refine their story.\nThe Moth StorySLAM, however, is what many find either confronting or the real-deal. An open-mic event, the evening has one theme and anyone can put their name in a hat and get up on stage to tell their story.\nIn the US, Moth Slams are held every month (if not more) around the country and the events can attract up to 400 people. Though many come to watch and hear the stories, Crabb says eventually most people give story-telling a go.\n\"What storytelling fosters, especially via The Moth that maybe other arts [like stand-up, monologues by actors] don't, is that storytelling… isn't about crafting something so your meaning changes or your posture shifts... What The Moth really wants is for the storyteller to be their truest self.\n\"A great storyteller when they're done, I think the great trick of it is that you [in the audience] feel like you almost got to know someone and have a conversation with them ... \"\nCo-curator of Festival of Dangerous Ideas Ann Mossop says there is a trend for people seeking out raw, live experiences like The Moth – despite our growing dependency on screens. \"There's a resurgence of live storytelling that The Moth has been at the cutting edge of, a resurgence in the kind of talks that we do, which is all about people coming together as a live audience to have the live experience - whether it's ideas, a discussion, storytelling.\n\"The fact people are no longer as familiar with storytelling … makes it more powerful.\"\nJenifer Hixson, a producer with The Moth, who will help develop the Slams in Australia, thinks the events' success has been because it's \"eyes and hands free entertainment\".\n\"You're not looking at a screen, which I think is really important, and also I think one of the reasons the podcasts work is because people are sick of the blue screens.\n\"Also as human beings, we are pretty polite and we listen to someone when they talk to us and there is something about storytelling ... it feels a little civilised, even though it's an ancient kind of communication.\"\nSalty and sweet, hug 'em and hit' em Hixson has worked with many storytellers – from accountants to comedians – to help them \"de-clutter\" and \"strip-down\" their stories for the Mainstage.\n\"There are all sorts of different formulas [for telling good stories], but something has to be a stake, we have to be invested, we want to be on the story teller's side,\" she said.\nHixon says it's important to de-clutter a story.\n\"Everybody can ramble on and tell a nine minute story at the water cooler at work, but this is for presentation. It pays to have your first and last line in your head really plotted out in your head.\nAnd the audience? Forgiving, she says.\n\"Once you come and see how nice the audience is... they're quite generous and forgiving and if you stumble a little bit they just love you more as that just makes you feel authentic, because we all stumble when we're talking.\"\nHixson and Crabb both tell me their favourite type of story is a \"hug 'em and hit 'em\".\n\"As a listener, I like salty and sweet stories,\" Crabb said. \"I like laughing heartedly and intently for a long time and then not seeing it coming that I'm going to get some of emotional impact.\"\nHixson also likes a little bit of sad coupled with humour: \"I love the hug 'em and hit 'em story, as we say, where there is a little of both.\"\nThough she admits the raw storytelling isn't for everyone – and sometimes the teller won't engage you – the beauty is each person has only five minutes to tell their story.\n\"It's unadorned, so there's no music swelling up behind it, and there's no laugh track, it's unedited human voice, so it's hard not to like,\" she said.\n\"Every person only has five minutes, it will be over soon and knowing it's going to be over soon you're completely open and tolerant.\"\nFor more information on The Moth Mainstage or StorySLAM events in Sydney/Melbourne, August/September, go to themoth.org/events.", "external_links": ["http://themoth.org/events", "http://themoth.org/posts/storytellers/peter-sagal"], "published": "2015-08-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T22:01:05.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
