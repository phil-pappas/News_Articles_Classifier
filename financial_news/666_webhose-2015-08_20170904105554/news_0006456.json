Similar surveys are due to be released in Europe and the United States later on Friday, and disappointing readings could spark further market mayhem.\nMUDDY WATERS\nU.S. stock futures fell sharply after China's PMI report and most Asian stock markets and the Australian dollar extended early losses. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 sank to a more than six-month low on concerns about how China's slowdown would impact U.S. firms' earnings and global growth.\nAnalysts still expect the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates later this year, though minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's last meeting in July showed policymakers discussed China, Greece's debt crisis and the weak state of the global economy.\nWEAKNESS ACROSS THE BOARD\nA detailed breakdown of China's PMI survey showed conditions deteriorating on almost every level in August. Factory output sank to a near four-year low as firms laid off more workers, while domestic and export orders fell at a faster rate than in July.\nFollowing three decades of blistering double-digit economic growth, Chinese authorities have had limited success in shoring up activity this year despite four interest rates cuts since November.\nWorse, last week's shock 2 percent devaluation in the yuan and a near-collapse in Chinese shares over the summer that was countered by a massive stock market rescue do not appear to have calmed investor jitters.\nThe yuan has slid nearly 3 percent since its Aug. 11 devaluation, a fall that some analysts say is too modest to boost Chinese exports, but notable enough to raise fears of competitive currency devaluations between governments.\nThe speed at which China's economy is losing steam has led some analysts to warn that the government may struggle to meet its official economic growth target of 7 percent this year if it doesn't ratchet up policy support. Growth in China's factory output, retail sales and investment all disappointed in July.\nSome economists believe that China's present growth levels could already be closer to half of the 7 percent official figure reported for the second quarter.\nWith China's economic outlook so murky, some firms say it's best to be cautious and not bet on a turnaround in the near future.\n\"It's hard to predict what China is doing,\" Ivan Glasenberg, the chief executive of global mining and commodities firm Glencore said this week after reporting a slump in first-half earnings.\nGlencore is cutting its spending plans for this year as China's slowdown contributes to sharp falls in commodity prices.\n(Reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Koh Gui Qing in BEIJING, Choonsik Yoo in SEOUL and Stanley White in TOKYO; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:43:21.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
