Near-term support is at 124.12, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, with a break below that on a daily closing basis exposing the 38.2% level at 123.41 . Alternatively, a turn above the 14.6 % Fib at 124.56 clears the way for a test of the August 12 high at 125.27. Prices are wedged too closely between near-term support and resistance levels to justify taking a trade on a long or short side from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will continue to stand aside until a more attractive opportunity presents itself.
