Josh Trank appeared to blame the studio for “Fantastic Four” flop in a tweet sent on the eve of movie’s debut. Slide 1 of 6 The director of Fox’s “Fantastic Four” reboot is making headlines for a disastrous tweet that one expert says may have trimmed up to $10 million off the movie’s opening-weekend tally.\n“Fantastic Four” flamed out in its debut, grossing a flimsy $26.2 million, a little more than half of what box-office trackers had been expecting. 21st Century Fox FOXA, -1.96% , the parent company of the Fox movie studio, is now expected to lose as much as $60 million on the film, according to an analyst at FBR & Co. The film cost about $120 million to make.\nThe reviews were merciless, with the film receiving a 9% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. And as the critics began piling on Thursday evening, Trank posted a tweet insinuating that he, too, was unhappy with the final product.\nSix superhero flops besides 'Fantastic Four' (3:32) \"Fantastic Four\" delivered disappointing results in its box office debut but it's not the first superhero flick that has failed to impress fans and critics.\nAs Trank tweeted — and then immediately deleted: “A year ago, I had a fantastic version of this. And it would have received great reviews. You’ll probably never see it. That’s reality though.”\nTrank’s post may have cost the film between $5 million and $10 million in box-office revenue, the Wrap reported .\nIt’s unusual for directors to publicly dissociate themselves from their films, but it does occasionally happen. Here are four other filmmakers who weren’t fans of the final cut.\nFox was split off two years ago from News Corp, which owns MarketWatch.\nSee: 6 superhero movies that disappointed besides ‘Fantastic Four’\nEverett Collection Inc. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Joel Schumacher and George Clooney promoting “Batman and Robin.” Slide 2 of 6 Joel Schumacher, “Batman and Robin” (1997) Joel Schumacher apologized for 1997’s “Batman and Robin” in a YouTube clip , taking full responsibility for a movie often regarded as one of the worst superhero films ever made.\nHe said in interviews that he broke his own no-sequels promise in taking on the film as a follow-up to 1995’s “Batman Forever” starring Val Kilmer, ultimately caving to pressure from Time Warner’s TWX, -2.71% Warner Bros. studio.\n“Sequels are only made for one reason: to make more money and sell more toys,” he told Variety in a Q&A . “They immediately wanted a sequel, but I said yes. There’s nobody else to blame but me.”\nGetty Images Tony Kaye says he clashed with “American History X” star Edward Norton over the final cut. Slide 3 of 6 Tony Kaye, “American History X” (1998) Four years after making “American History X,” director Tony Kaye blasted New Line Cinema and the film’s star, Edward Norton, over edits they made prior to the movie’s release.\nKaye accused the studio of adding back 40 minutes of footage that he hadn’t approved. He accused Norton of giving himself more screen time, straying from the “hard, fast 95-minute” picture he’d intended. Kaye said that he became so delirious while battling the studio and Norton for creative control in post-production that he broke his hand by punching through a wall.\nKaye wrote, in reflection, in a story for the Guardian: “My problem all through ‘American History X’ was that I could never tell anyone what I wanted to do with the film. Sometimes I didn’t even know myself. More often, I was so intimidated by the process that I went into meltdown if I wasn’t left alone to work things out.”\nWhen the film came out, Kaye asked the Directors Guild of America to replace his director’s credit with a pseudonym: “Humpty Dumpty.”\nEverett Collection Inc. Sigourney Weaver, Charles S. Dutton and director David Fincher on set of “Alien 3.” Slide 4 of 6 David Fincher, “Alien 3” (1992) “No one hated it more than me; to this day, no one hates it more than me,” director David Fincher said in an interview , referring to Fox’s “Alien 3.”\n“Alien 3” marked Fincher’s debut as a maker of feature films at a time when he was better known for directing stylish commercials and music videos for Paula Abdul, Madonna, George Michael, Billy Idol and Nine Inch Nails.\nThe project was saddled with major issues from the start, including a revolving door of writers and directors and battles with the studio over creative control. Fincher, who said he worked on the film for two years and got fired three times, said he juggled shooting and rewriting simultaneously without much focus. He has since distanced himself from the movie altogether.\nThough “Alien 3” was regarded as a huge step down from the 1979 Oscar-winning classic, it had little impact on Fincher’s career. He would go on to pick up awards of his own with “The Social Network,” “Seven” and “Gone Girl.”\nEverett Collection Inc. Tobey Maguire, director Sam Raimi and Kirsten Dunst on set of “Spider-Man.” Slide 5 of 6 Sam Raimi, “Spider-Man 3” (2007) Sam Raimi said he “messed up” with 2007’s “Spider-Man 3,” admitting in an interview with Chris Hardwick’s Nerdist podcast that the movie “didn’t work very well.”\nMarvel Studios’ “Spider-Man 3” was a commercial hit, raking in over $890 million worldwide, but the reviews were mixed. Critics said the film was crowded with too many characters and plotlines, and overall the third installment didn’t quite measure up to the first two films.\nRoger Ebert summed it up this way: “Too many villains, too many pale plot strands, too many romantic misunderstandings, too many conversations, too many street crowds looking high into the air and shouting “oooh!” this way, then swiveling and shouting “aaah!” that way.”\nRaimi, famous for the “Evil Dead” movies, said his drive to top the other “Spider-Man” films ultimately doomed the final act.\nMarketWatch Slide Shows\nFOOD & DRINK Getty Images • How much it costs to shop at Whole Foods\n• 7 reasons some shoppers hate Costco\n• 5 things NOT to buy at Costco and Sam’s Club\n• Trying to avoid trans fats?
