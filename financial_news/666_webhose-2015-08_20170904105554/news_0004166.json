It Matters for Your Retirement By Mark Henricks | 08/18/15 - 01:41 PM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — You have finally gotten the idea that you need to diversify the assets in your retirement portfolio. You have saved regularly and often and invested in a balanced mix of stocks, bonds and other assets. As a result, you have reduced risk and improved your odds of enjoying a comfortable retirement. You're not done yet. \nNow you need to learn about another kind of diversification: distribution diversification . This is the flip side of the equation -- how and when you’ll take money out of your retirement accounts to spend it after retirement. Basically, you want to plan so that you pluck the fruits of your foresight in such a way that the tree doesn’t go bare until you no longer need earthly riches. \nDistribution diversification is asset allocation’s lesser-known sibling, but it’s no less important. A bad distribution decision can cost you dearly. To give one example, once you reach age 70.5, the IRS requires you to withdraw at least a certain amount from your retirement accounts each year. Penalties for failing to take required minimum distributions could be 50% of the amount that should have been withdrawn. So if you should have taken $10,000 and you took zero, you may be out $5,000. \n“Some of these things seem subtle but they’re profound,” says LouAnn Schulfer, a financial planner in Stevens Point, Wis. “It may look the same on the outside, but the mechanics of it and the long-term effects are bigger than it appears.” 1 of 4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T01:18:12.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
