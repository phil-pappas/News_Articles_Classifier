He hailed President Mugabe for his stance that Africa must find solutions to African problems. \n\"We would like to, in a vivid manner, congratulate the Government of the Republic of Zimbabwe and the relentless and hard working farmers and exhibitors who have done their best and for the opportunity that they provided for us to experience in a singular manner, the achievements of agriculture that we aspire for our people and country. \n\"It is in our interest, to share these experiences in your country particularly in the phase where we are working towards generating employment and bringing more productivity and competitiveness as priorities which have been defined by our governments,\" he said. \nPresident Nyusi said mainstreaming of markets for small scale farmers had opened opportunities for them to sell their products. \"We would like to express our desire that under the Comprehensive Agricultural Development Programme in Africa and particularly through our bilateral cooperation, we deepen our cooperation in areas of research, experience exchanges between farmers of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. \n\"President Mugabe, my dear brothers and sisters, allow me to use this opportunity to express my full availability and my high commitment to do all I can to strengthen the friendly and brotherly cooperation between our two people,\" he said.
