I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail.\" \nLeadership challenger Liz Kendall - seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea as a throwback to the failed ideas of leftwingers like the late Tony Benn. \n\"This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics. It is just Bennism reheated, a throwback to the past, not the change we need for our party or our country,\" she said. \n\"Life had moved on from the old Clause IV in 1994 let alone 2015. We are a party of the future not a preservation society.\" \nMeanwhile, several major Labour donors have reportedly pledged to stop giving money if Mr Corbyn wins the leadership contest on 12 September. \nThe Sunday Telegraph quoted the donors as saying victory for Mr Corbyn would be \"disastrous\" and could lead to Labour being locked out of power for decades. \nWith Mr Corbyn's campaign continuing to gather momentum, the Labour supporting Sunday People has come out in favour of shadow health secretary Andy Burnham in the leadership contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T10:43:18.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
