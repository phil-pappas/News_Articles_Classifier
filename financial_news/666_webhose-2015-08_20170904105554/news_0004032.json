Many processes are simple, like writing down the way daily tasks are done just to get them out of your head and on paper. She calls this the number one step in developing good business processes. \nSlice points out some of the many benefits of putting things on paper, or as she prefers, sticky notes: \n· You can recreate the same actions over time which helps you improve them and adjust them as needed and things are not as likely to slip through the cracks. \n· Slice calls a process a piece of a business’s success and writing them down will continue the successful processes without the business owner being around all the time. This gives everyone in the business more freedom and a more saleable business. \n· Take the guessing out of making decisions by writing things down. Every business, she notes, needs data to make good decisions. Making fact based decisions requires taking your bias and emotions out of the equation. “If your business is having some tough times is it a lack of leads or not converting leads into business?” Slice points out. She notes every time she sets up a process that gains data people are surprised at the results. \nProcesses are a part of the evolution of business. This evolution never ends, she says. The true work begins when a process is out there and you are consistently using it. Another key factor in this evolution is accountability by everyone in the business. Building trust is important which is developed by people living up to their word. “Accountability is also the transition of a random group to an organization working together to achieve a common goal,” Slice writes in her blog. \n“Processes are the skeleton, the bones on which an organization can start to move, grow and strengthen,” states Slice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:47:58.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
