Photo: Natalie Boog\nClearView has posted a 4 per cent rise in underlying profits to $20.5 million for fiscal 2015 following several years of integration and expansion at the listed life insurer.\nClearView, which is led by former CommInsure boss Simon Swanson, reported a 10 per cent drop in reported net profit to $12.5 million due to amortisation of intangibles and integration costs associated with financial advice group Matrix's merger into the company.\nThe insurer will pay investors a 2.1 cents a share dividend for the year - up from 2 cents a share last year.\n\"FY15 [financial year 2015] included the successful merger and integration of Matrix, the upgrade to our LifeSolutions product range and the successful launch of WealthFoundations,\" Mr Swanson said.\nAdvertisement \"The initial phases of our investment are now complete with material earnings growth expected to emerge in FY16.\"\nClearView posted a 26 per cent rise in new life insurance business, and 32 per cent increase in life in-force premiums.\nThe results come after a turbulent year of changes in Australia's life insurance industry. Last year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission discovered almost one in two pieces of advice given by financial planners working in the life industry failed to comply with the law.\nThe federal government has endorsed a series of reforms tabled by the life insurance and advice sectors to tackle the problems facing the sector.\nThis included a ban on volume-based commissions and capping of advanced commissions to 60 per cent of a policy's premiums in the first year by 2018.\nFiscal 2015 marked the end of a three-year strategy on building ClearView's market share in the life insurance and wealth management sectors.\nThe initial phases of the group's investments were now completed and material earnings growth was expected to be evident in this new financial year.\nThe company said in a statement: \"ClearView has established a strong platform to drive momentum and convert its strategic positioning into material earnings growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T05:03:40.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
