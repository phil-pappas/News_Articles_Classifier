The economy is not doing as well as I expected. There could be more talk of economic stimulus measures.\"\nOutput fell in July as companies produced less smartphone parts, computers and cars, the data showed.\nManufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to risen 2.8 percent in August and decrease 1.7 percent in September.\nThe forecast for August looks unrealistic, because many of the companies who said they expect their output to rise rely more on export demand, Mizuho Research Institute's Tokuda said.\nOne risk to the outlook for industrial output is domestic consumer spending. Weak household consumption contributed to a contraction in gross domestic product in April-June.\nPolicymakers have repeatedly said this was a one-off factor due to bad weather and that spending should do better this month, when the weather was better. However, the data has yet to show a clear recovery.\nExport demand is another worry, especially after the scale of China's economic problems sparked a global selloff in share markets.\nSome members of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party have already started talking about compiling new economic stimulus measures.\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet has indicated that it won't be stirred into action so soon, but calls for more fiscal spending could grow if economic data do not start improving.\nThis is also a tense time for the Bank of Japan because it is counting on an acceleration in economic growth to drive consumer prices to its 2 percent inflation target, but consumer prices are currently at zero and the BOJ's price target looks increasingly distant.
