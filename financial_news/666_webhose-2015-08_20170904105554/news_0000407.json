David Mariuz Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Education Minister Christopher Pyne have effectively called a truce by failing to criticise Labor's Tony Burke for taking his family on a trip to Uluru on the taxpayer's purse.\nMr Burke, who was strident in attacking former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, was forced to defend taking his family with him to Uluru, flying business class, during school holidays in 2012, a trip that cost the taxpayer $12,707.65.\nMr Burke said the claim was within the rules and he met with managers and rangers of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and members of the Mutitjulu community in his capacity as environment minister on the same trip.\nWhile Mr Abbott simply declined to attack Mr Burke on Wednesday, Mr Pyne has said increasing scrutiny of politicians use of expenses has become a \"Salem witch trial\".\nEducation Minister Christopher Pyne compared the expenses scandal to a witch trial. Andrew Meares \"I'm not going to get into the is Salem witch trial situation over members' entitlements,\" he said.\nHe said Mrs Bishop, who allegedly misused expenses on a chartered helicopter ride and a number of personal events, had made a mistake but \"we've all made our mistakes over the the years\".\nCoalition ministers fly high Using taxpayer funds for chartered flights for ministerial and electorate business is within Department of Finance rules but a new review will focus on whether politicians' entitlements are within \"community expectations\".\n Analysis of expenses data of ministers and shadow ministers reveals some used chartered transport to travel between the cities sometimes when there were alternative transport options available, based on disclosures for the second half of 2014.\nDeputy Prime Minister Warren Truss took a chartered return flight from Canberra to Brisbane on the night of the 2014 federal budget, at a cost of $21,570, to address the Conservative Breakfast Club.\nMr Truss' spokesman said he incurred the expense because no commercial flights were available and the Royal Australian Air Force plane that he was supposed to take broke down.\n\"There was no alternative. We could not cancel the event late on the evening before the breakfast speech, which some 120 people were attending,\" the spokesman said.\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz spent $7018 on chartered transport for a return trip from Canberra to his home base of Hobart on November 14, 2014.\nMr Abetz' spokesman said he had an estimates committee hearing in Canberra that conflicted with a commitment in Tasmania the night before and he took the charter plane because there were no commercial flights that morning that would have delivered Mr Abetz to Canberra in time for the hearing.\nAgricultural Minister Barnaby Joyce, Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane and Health Minister Sussan Ley also defended chartered flights between major cities in the same period, giving details of conflicting events they were obliged to attend, the timing of which was unpredictable or out of their control.\nWhile Mr Abbott said Bronwyn Bishop's parliamentary career was now likely over, Mr Pyne went back into bat for the embattled MP on Wednesday, saying he would support her bid to retain hold of her seat of Mackellar.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-08-05T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T11:08:02.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
