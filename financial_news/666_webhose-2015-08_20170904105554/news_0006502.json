Jeff Allan by Duncan Hughes Only one in three self-managed superannuation funds uses an accredited financial adviser to help with developing pension strategies, building income streams and wealth preservation.\nThat's according to research by Vanguard Investment. This means some of the remaining 370,000 schemes could face issues if the scheme member or trustee driving its strategy and administration is no longer available because of death, divorce, disinterest or infirmity, and the responsibility falls to another who might not have the same talents or interest.\n\"In most cases, this is a husband-and-wife scenario,\" says Jeremy Gillman-Wells, an adviser for Bravien Financial.\n\"It's important to have a discussion when the fund is first established on what the wishes are for each other, including whether they will want to continue with the fund, following the death of another member.\"\nThere are a range of options, including appointing an accredited adviser, recruiting another trustee or winding up the fund and transferring the assets into another approved by regulators.\nAnne Graham, managing director of McPhail HLG Financial Planning, says appointing a power of attorney should be considered to ensure a smooth transition in running a fund. Someone who has the authority to look after financial affairs on the individual's behalf.\nA typical scenario might be where the incapacity of a super fund trustee threatens the fund's tax-concessional status as a complying fund.\n\"Another option could be to bring in another family member after the death of a fund member, such as a son or daughter, to maintain at least two individual trustees,\" Gillman-Wells said.\n A recent spate of expensive legal disputes involving surviving family members rowing about claims over SMSF assets highlights the need to seek expert legal guidance to insure the appointee is faithful to the member/trustee's wishes.\n\"As funds under management increase and legislation around it becomes more complex, then the need to get legal resolutions over disputes will grow exponentially,\" warns Peter Bobbin, managing principal of SMSF specialist Argyle Lawyers, about recent costly disputes.\nGillman-Wells says having a corporate (rather than individual) trustee from the outset can help to keep the fund in a compliant trustee status until the decision can be made about its future.\nIn a corporate trust the assets of the fund are registered in the name of a company, rather than an individual.\nAnother option is a trustee company, says Graham, where the assets are registered in the name of the company, rather than individuals.\nThere's a one-in-three chance that a married couple will divorce, often after more than 20 years when the children have grown up and left home, according to government statistics.\nLawyers recommend trying to save costs and lessen litigation and bad will by negotiating an amicable agreement where the fund is retained and the SMSF is run as a business arrangement.\n\"In the case of a full separation, enough assets for the departing spouse could be sold and rolled over to a new fund – generally a retail industry fund,\" says Gillman-Wells. \"Or, if possible, use mostly cash holdings to transfer the departing spouse's share, which leaves the remaining spouse's super investments intact.\"\nWhen dealing with fund assets, the simplest way to wind up a fund is to cash out, or sell the fund's investments, and roll over the cash to a new superannuation fund.\n\"You can then repurchase new investments in the new fund,\" says Gillman-Wells.\nSome assets can be transferred in-specie, which means in its present form, rather than selling and then distributing the cash.\n\"If the remaining member was in pension phase and retired, lumpy assets such as property could be paid out of the fund as a lump sum. Assuming they were over 60, this payment would be tax-free,\" says Gillman-Wells. Stamp duty is usually paid when transferring property into personal ownership\nBefore winding up or restructuring a fund, Graham suggests this check list:\nCheck the trust deed – are there special conditions? Do all the members/trustees want the fund wound-up? Each member/trustee should sign an agreement to close the fund: this will avoid future complications. How does each member wish to receive their benefit? Will they be eligible for lump-sum payments or do the benefits have to be transferred to another super fund? Will the payments be made as an \"in specie\" transfer or cash? Is all the admin and compliance of the fund up to date? Are assets in the right name and outstanding liabilities paid? Have all member benefits been paid and contributions been received and correctly recorded? Are all financials and compliance work – such as tax returns and audits – up to date? Has a draft financial report been completed to determine the value of each member's benefit? Liquidate assets in order to pay benefits – especially if rolled over to a new fund. Some benefits may be paid \"'in-specie\" or transferred out of the fund. Consider the tax implications of liquidating assets. For example, if the fund is in accumulation phase, capital gains tax may be payable on sale of assets. Consider strategies to manage possible tax liabilities. For example, is it appropriate to convert an account to pension phase from accumulation phase if the member meets eligibility requirements? What does it mean to any Centrelink payments? Has the final return been prepared and the fund audited? The ATO must be notified in writing within 28 days of the fund being wound up Remember to close the bank account. But if a tax refund is expected, leave it open until the refund has been received.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:06:09.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
