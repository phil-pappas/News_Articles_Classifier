First responders reported very low visibility around the Tygerberg area,\" De Vos wrote in a post with an accompanying picture. \nDe Vos also suggested that the plane appeared to have attempted to land, based on \"three tracks made by the undercarriage\" of the plane. \nBut Arthur Bradshaw, former general manager of the Air Traffic and Navigation Services Company (ATNS), said it was unwise to speculate too much about the exact nature of the crash until all the facts were made available. \nBradshaw did say, however, that the holding procedure involved when an aircraft's landing is delayed was common and not complicated. \n\"It's a refined system based on radar operations. The holding stacks too are quite efficient. It's a normal procedure.\" \n'Technical glitch' \nNews24 reported on Sunday that a \"technical glitch\" with flight systems at Cape Town International Airport caused flight delays for most of Sunday morning. \nThe glitch is understood to relate to flight slot coordination, which allocates an order for incoming and departing air traffic. \nATNS spokesperson Percy Morokane said the technical failure \"could have been experienced anywhere in the world\". \nMorokane emphasised that the air crash involving an aero-medical fixed-wing aircraft from Namibia bound for Cape Town could not be linked to the system failure. \nHe told News24 on Monday that ATNS's report could take some time to compile before its release. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:00:01.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
