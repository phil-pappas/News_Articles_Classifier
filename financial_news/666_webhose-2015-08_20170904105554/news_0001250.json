Written by: Jason Notte 08/13/15 - 8:18 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) –- Yes, you can finally get an electric vehicle cheaply as a used car. That doesn't mean you'll want to. \nAccording to Kelley Blue Book's July market report, electric vehicles were the only used vehicle segment to see an increase in sales value from a month prior. In fact, the tiny, egg-shaped Mitsubishi MiEV saw its value increase 2.2% during that span to become the third best-performing used car of that month behind only two Lexus models. \nHowever, that increase in value isn't typical for electric vehicles at all. According to KBB's findings, a 2012 MiEV's value dropped to 45.4% of its sales price after a year off the lot, fell to 31.2% of that price a year later and hit just 20.2% of its initial value this year. The 2012 Nissan LEAF didn't fare all that better, watching its value drop to 44.4% of its asking price in year one, 37.5% a year later and just 19.7% this year. Compare that to the 2012 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, which retained 51.9% of its value in 2013, 39.6% in 2014 and 34.6% this year. According to KBB analyst Tim Fleming, the Volt has held considerably more value than the two pure EVs, in part, because its gas engine extends the vehicle’s range. However, though the Volt is in line for a new battery of its own, battery and range improvements in more recent EVs -- including a 2016 Nissan Leaf with a range of 100 miles, compared to just 84 for the model year prior or 73 for the 2012 -- have made some buyers wary of used EVs.

We know many consumers aren’t sold on long-term ownership costs either, simply because the technology is so new versus the combustion engine which has been around for such a long time now.” \nKBB isn't alone in noticing carbuyers' reluctance to jump on new or even used electric vehicles. The folks at Hearst-owned BlackBook have found that electric vehicles not only have a hard time retaining their value, but often end up costing far less on the used market than their gas-powered counterparts. BlackBook took a look at a similarly equipped 2012 Nissan LEAF ($36,380) and a 2012 Nissan Versa ($19,320) and found that the former retained only 26% of its value ($7,400) three years later, while the latter held on to 43% ($8,300). That made an electric vehicle that cost $12,787 more to own than its gas-powered rival on the new car market ($20,287 minus $7,500 in federal EV incentives) $900 cheaper as a used car. \nHowever, that doesn't include the $5,500 cost of a replacement battery, should the LEAF need one, or the $225 cost of the mounting system require to make that battery fit into a 2012 model. That's just a microcosm of the costs that used car buyers fear most. \n“On several of today's popular EV vehicles, the depreciation curve is very steep, largely driven by lack of consumer demand preferences for fuel-efficient models with current price of gas,\" said Anil Goyal, Vice President of Automotive Valuation and Analytics for BlackBook . \"Smaller cars have experienced heavier depreciation over the last 12 to 18 months, but it’s clear that the small mainstream electric vehicles are experiencing even heavier valuation drops.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:12:55.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
