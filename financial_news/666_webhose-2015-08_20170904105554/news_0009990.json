Dominic Lorrimer Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The Australian dollar continued trading in a tight range on Thursday, putting the whipsaw movements of Monday's global stock market meltdown behind it.\nIn late local trade, the Aussie was buying US71.12¢, about 0.8 per cent higher than the fresh six-year low touched during the week's market upheaval, when sharp falls on Chinese sharemarkets revived fears of broader economic problems in the world's second-largest economy. The currency touched US70.50¢ , its lowest reading since April 2009, at the peak of the tumult.\nA marginally better than expected business investment outlook from the Australian Bureau of Statistics gave the local unit a midday boost, but it proved short-lived.\nAlthough Australia's stock market has steadied since Monday's 4 per cent drop in the main index , the Aussie is being weighed down by persistent commodity price weakness, ongoing market jitters that saw the Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index reach levels not seen since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nAll this volatility should have driven the Australian dollar down faster and further, according to Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie.\n\"The fact the Aussie has mostly recovered suggest there is some considerable resistance there,\" he said on Thursday.\n\"The resilience is stemming from a number of factors, including that iron ore still hasn't dropped below $US53 a tonne yet, and the RBA's mantra was that it was likely and necessary it [the $A] would fall, and that has taken some of the weight off.\"\nMr Rennie said the dollar had likely entered a new trading range of US70¢ to US72¢, slightly lower than the US72¢ to US74¢ range established in July.\n While the dollar might seem relatively steady for now, it would continue to decline over the year, Mr Rennie said, especially as Westpac is forecasting that China will continue devaluing its currency. Further monetary and fiscal policy easing is also in prospect, economists say.\n\"China is midway through an easing cycle that will probably include a number of different policy instruments, including lending rate cuts and the currency, and we definitely expect it to fall,\" Mr Rennie said.\nWestpac sees the Australian dollar at around US70¢ by December, while Commonwealth Bank of Australia is forecasting the same rate by March.\n\"It's not been as rapid as we might have expected with this volatility, but the Aussie is still falling because commodity prices are weak and the US economy remains strong despite its equity market meltdowns,\" CBA currency strategist Joseph Capurso said.\nThe strength of the US economy matters to the Australian dollar because its central bank, the US Federal Reserve, requires stable, sustained growth to begin to raise its interest rates after almost a decade of record lows.\nUntil late last week, the market was pricing in the first rate rise in September or December. Following this week's volatility, the market is now pricing it in during April.\n\"I do think they've overreacted. It was May [2016] earlier this week; now it's April and I expect that will continue to drop back to either December or January,\" Mr Capurso said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/currencies/australian-dollar-sent-on-wild-ride-as-china-rout-rattles-commodity-currencies-20150824-gj6snc.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/business-investment-still-weak-but-rate-of-decline-slowing-20150826-gj8q3j.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asx-bloody-monday-as-60-billion-torched-on-sharemarket-20150824-gj6dqc.html", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/global-market-rout-means-surge-in-fear-20150825-gj6y1w.html", "https://twitter.com/@rosepowell", "http://www.smh.com.au/world/partys-silence-deafening-as-bear-market-consumes-chinese-shareholdings-20150826-gj8aqv.html"], "published": "2015-08-27T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T11:04:59.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
