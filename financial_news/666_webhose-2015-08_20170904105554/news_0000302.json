The committee has suggested to amend the law in a way which allows urban co-operative banks to exit from the Multi State Co-operative Society Act and became a part of the Companies Act. All new banks in the private sector are governed by the Companies Act.\nAt present, the Banking Regulation Act, that governs commercial banks, does not apply fully on the co-operative banks, as a result, all RBI norms are not applicable to these entities.\n\n\"Today legal enablement are not there. Today, company's act allows an entity to become a bank. But that provision is not there in the laws that govern co-op banks. We have recommended to the government to amend the laws accordingly,\" R Gandhi deputy governor of RBI, told Business Standard in an interview. He also added that the UCB banks are functioning well now and the sector as a whole as stabilised.\n\"UCBs have gone through various ups and downs. The latest problem they had was in early 2000. So, we had to tighten the regulations and supervision. Now, they have reached a good position. Gross non-performing asset position of UCBs are around 5% while net NPA is around 3%,\" he said.\n\nThe asset quality ratios of the UCBs are now almost in line with the overall banking system numbers. Provision coverage ratio of UCBs improved significantly to 59.7% as on March end from 52.4% as on end September. \"The number of negative net worth banks are constantly coming down,\" Gandhi added.\nAccording to latest RBI data, the capital adequacy ratio of UCB as on March end was 12.6%, as compared to the  regulatory requirement of 9%. Only 5 such banks have CAR below the 9% mark.\nThe move to grant commercial banking licence to UCB comes at a time when the central bank has decided to give niche bank licence - as opposed to universal bank licence - and has invited applicants in the payments banks and small finance bank segment.\nOne issue that acted as an hurdle for UCBs to become a commercial bank was governance practices. But now, that issue has been addressed to a large extent.\n\"They still have some issues so far as governance is concerned. This is being accepted by bringing in the concept of board for management, as was recommended by the YH Malegam committee. We have also insisted for professional directors on the board,\" Gandhi said.\n\"Here and there some bad apples are there. But the system as a whole, they have consolidated. Now, it is time for them to grow,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:28:47.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
