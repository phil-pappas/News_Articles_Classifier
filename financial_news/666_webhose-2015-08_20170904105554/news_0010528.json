Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Queensland Labor government has flagged a dramatic shift away from the coal sector as it attempts to reach its ambitious target of 50 per cent of renewable energy by 2030.\nDespite the coal industry delivering billions of dollars in royalties and thousands of jobs each year, Energy Minister Mark Bailey said the Palaszczuk government would be doing everything it could to support the development of solar and wind projects in the state.\nThis included forcing state-owned energy company Ergon Energy to purchase 150 megawatts of renewable energy from the market as well as doubling the number of homes with roof-top solar systems to more than 1 million by 2020.\n\"We have to be active in terms of our policy and making sure we are moving away from carbon-emitting industries into clean energy industries,\" Mr Bailey told a budget estimates hearing on Friday.\n\"We have to grow jobs in emerging industries in Queensland like the renewable energy sector. In Queensland we've gone backwards in the last three years with the loss of 1300 jobs in renewables.\"\nMr Bailey said the goal of 1 million homes with solar photovoltaic systems was achievable, saying Queensland had the fastest up-take of solar in the world, with 28 per cent of homes currently with a system on their roof.\nThe Palaszczuk government will also conduct its own \"reverse auction\" to purchase an additional 40 megawatts of renewable energy.\nBut new director-general of the Department of Energy, former AGL Energy chief economist, Paul Simshauser admitted to the budget estimates committee there had been no modelling done yet on achieving the 50 per cent renewable target by the end of the decade.\n There are also fears taxpayers could be left with the stranded assets of old coal-fired power stations owned by CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation which the former Newman government was trying to sell off as part of its $37 billion privatisation plan. There is also the issue of on-going cross-subsidisation of solar households.\nDespite warnings by Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chairman Rod Sims about the lack of competition in the generation sector , the Palaszczuk has kept its state-owned companies in public ownership and is planning to merge the five companies into two.\nMr Bailey said the Labor government was still committed to the merger, but wouldn't confirm whether the government would abandon plans to merge the two generation companies.\nClean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton welcomed Queensland's shift to embrace renewable energy, saying it was part of a push by all states to lock in renewable investment following the federal government's new post-2020 target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.\n\"Now that the RET is resolved, there is a race on between the states to attract the investment and jobs from clean energy. These targets will give comfort to the industry,\" he said.\nBut Queensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said it would be a big ask for the Palaszczuk government to reach its 50 per cent renewable target - which mirrors federal Labor aspirational scheme.\n\"The government hasn't been able to articulate the pathway to reach the target or the cost implications,\" Mr Roche said.\n\"It is a big leap and it has scary cost implications unless there is some radical re-setting of the cost of renewables.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-08-28T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T13:20:44.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
