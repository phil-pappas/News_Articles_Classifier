Georges Antoni Photographer Share on twitter by Fiona Carruthers It's been a big year of debuts for comedic Italian bass baritone, Paolo Bordogna.\nEarlier this year the Milan-based funny man of opera sang for the first time in the United States - in the Washington National Opera house in the John F. Kennedy Centre. Then in June, he travelled to Vienna to make his debut at the Wiener Staatsoper in the opera Don Giovanni as his servant Leporello. \"I was just flying out of New York when my agent rang me to say the role of Leporello was sick in Vienna, where Don Giovanni was about to open,\" Bordogna tells the Financial Review. \"So I changed my plans and flew pretty much straight to Vienna. It was so important for me to sing there. Vienna really is a temple of opera.\"\nAnd now, he's made his debut in the lively role of Figaro in Opera Australia's winter production of the Marriage of Figaro, directed by Sir David McVicar and playing at the Sydney's Opera House until August 29, after which the production will shift to Melbourne.\nNot a bad series of firsts for a singer who only stumbled into his craft aged 16 after a school friend made him join the local choir.\nFinally married: Figaro and Susanna (played by Paolo Bordogna and Taryn Fiebig). Georges Antoni Photographer But arguably Bordogna's biggest first this year was the release in July of his CD, Tutto Buffo , by Universal Music's Decca label. The 43-year-old has delighted audiences with his skill and personality in a series of comedic (or buffo) baritone opera roles - such as singing the lead in The Turk in Italy in Sydney last year. The reaction he gets from audiences also gave Decca enough faith to release the label's first ever CD devoted entirely to the genre - and all sung by the same baritone.\n\"It's very easy for a label like Decca to sell a CD with a tenor singing a beautiful aria,\" says Bordogna. \"When I proposed this buffo project, they were a little surprised â€“ they said no-one thought of this before. After a week, they called me and said: 'It's a really a good idea', and I said: 'Yes, I told you!\"\n\"'I always say that funny operas have much more truth inside them than serious operas. I love Verdi, but it's a bit hard to always identify with his work. Whereas, everyone can feel comedy.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SophTraveller"], "published": "2015-08-10T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:06:40.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
