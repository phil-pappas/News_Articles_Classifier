Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Hutchison Ports Australia, which operates international container terminals at Sydney's Port Botany and the Port of Brisbane, sacked more than 40 per cent of its waterfront workforce by text and email, prompting furious employees to stage pickets outside the company's terminals.\nThe Maritime Union of Australia said the waterfront's third operator told 97 employees by email at 11.30pm on Thursday that they had been made redundant.\nEmployees rostered to work on Friday were sent a text telling them they were not required and to check their emails.\n\"Your position will not be retained,\" the emails said. \"There are no redeployment opportunities. The intended last day of your employment will be Friday, 14 August 2015. I realise that this is a lot of information to take in. Accordingly you will not be required to attend work effective immediately. We will of course pay you your normal salary to your last date of employment.\"\n'Callous': Shorten Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that \"the idea that you just dismiss 100 plus people by text message is heartless, it's callous and it's stupid\".\n\"I don't believe any legal system should support that and I'd expect the government here to stand up to make sure that unfair behaviour isn't rewarded,\" he said.\nACTU secretary Dave Oliver said Prime Minister Tony Abbott should \"stand up for Australian workers and call out this disgraceful behaviour\" by the Hong Kong-based company.\n Employment Minister Eric Abetz said that while he was unaware of the specific details it was important the employers and employees treated each other with respect.\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed last week the company's plans to cut its 224-strong workforce. Hutchison has previously flagged unspecified job and customer services losses, signalling a retreat from its $700 million effort to bust the waterfront duopoly.\nIn flagging the job cuts, a July 24 memo to staff said the company claimed it did \"not have a concluded view on the individuals and/or the timing\".\n\"But we would not in these circumstances simply ask people to leave immediately,\" the memo said. \"Before any position is made redundant, we will meet with the affected person. We will give this person an opportunity to respond.\"\nStaff were sent emails on Thursday stating their employment had been terminated.\nFWC hearing The Fair Work Commission has scheduled a hearing on the dispute for late Friday. The MUA said there were security guards on the terminal gates and the workers had not been allowed to clear their lockers.\nThe union's national secretary, Paddy Crumlin, who is also the International Transport Workers' Federation president, said: \"This type of corporate behaviour is unacceptable. The MUA utterly rejects the suggestion that the company is reducing its Australian operations due to a lack of competitiveness.\n\"The union and myself personally have worked closely with senior Hutchison management to ensure productive, flexible, safe and reliable working arrangements to allow the company to enter into a highly competitive market.\n\"This is the same workforce that underpins the successful operations of Australia's other stevedoring companies.\n\"Hutchison should know better than to treat their workforce like this. They are a major global player in container terminals and they know that mutual respect with your workforce delivers the best results,\" Mr Crumlin said.\n\"We believe this is a strategy to further introduce automation without any discussion or consultation.\n\"There are no logical reasons why the company would otherwise give away profitable contracts as they have done recently, other than an extraordinary act of self-harm.\n\"The union is seeking a fair and objective process where all labour data and modelling are put on the table to determine the true nature and scope of the problem.\"\nThe company could not be reached for comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-08-07T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:09:57.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
