Downdetector.com is showing outages in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, Indiana, and Mississippi for all four carriers. According to a Sprint representative that spoke to Re/code , the issue is related to a local exchange provider that works with AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile. “We are aware of the impacts to service in which customers across multiple carriers may be unable to access voice and some data services,” the Sprint representative said. “This appears to be an issue caused by a local exchange provider and our network team is working with the provider to restore service to impacted customers as quickly as possible.” \nSprint said the company is working on a fix, as did representatives from Verizon and AT&T. AT&T said it’s working to restore service, while Verizon said its engineers were working with “vendor partners” to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. It is not clear when service will be restored for affected customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:31:27.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
