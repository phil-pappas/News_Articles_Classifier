In the same period average pay has increased by merely 9%. So Britain’s commuters are likely to feel considerable relief at the announcement that fares will be going up by only 1% next year, especially as earnings have begun to rise faster. The rail minister, Clare Perry , duly went the rounds of media outlets to trumpet an end to inflation-busting increases.\nRail users shouldn’t get carried away with gratitude. Rail fare increases each January are linked nowadays to the previous July’s retail price index (RPI) inflation, which clocked in today at the 1% by which prices will rise in 2016. Elsewhere in the forest, however, ministers were highlighting the wafer-thin 0.1% rise in the government’s preferred and differently calculated consumer prices index (CPI) inflation figure. So commuters are actually going be charged 10 times the headline rate of inflation for their journeys. That’s a funny sort of inflation-busting.\nRail prices matter in two ways. First, because they provide the bulk of the rail industry’s income. Few railway systems in Europe are as dependent on passenger fares as the UK’s. Fares provided 62% of rail industry income in 2013-14 , an 11% increase in share in a mere three years. During that time, the government’s share of spending fell by 16%. As transport is facing further cuts in the autumn spending review, something is going to have to give in rail economics. That something will have to be paid for by taxpayers.\nRail prices also matter because they are a high household cost to those who pay them . Campaigners claimed earlier this year that UK commuters were spending more than twice as much of their salaries on rail fares as passengers elsewhere in Europe. That naturally makes them politically sensitive. Yet this is an issue on which Labour failed to make much impression in May 2015. Commuter constituencies around London swung heavily to the Conservatives in the general election. Fare increases have not, thus far, hurt the Conservatives in the south.\nAll this provides an important context for the current flurry in parts of the Labour party about renationalising the railways. There is little evidence that the absence of a promise to renationalise held the key to Labour’s election defeat. Rail commuters dislike a lot of things about the system: the fares, the rises, the delays, the failure to get a seat. There are plenty of latterday Reggie Perrins who can reel off the latest improbable reason for a late train. But there has also been a huge rise in rail use. Passenger numbers have more than doubled. Safety has improved since the grim days of Hatfield and Potters Bar. Investment is coursing through the system, whether in the high-profile form of Crossrail and the putative HS2 or in the less glamorous but, to users, much more tangible form of improved rolling stock on commuter and inter-city lines alike.\nThose who wish to renationalise the railways need to be certain that public ownership is a means to a more efficient end, not an end in itself. Only an ideologue will fixate on the latter. Though some unions are pushing for nationalisation, staff numbers have risen in recent years and wages have increased in ways that might not be guaranteed under public ownership.\nThere is unquestionably a strong case for public-sector alternatives to compete – they should certainly not be excluded – on a case-by-case basis as existing franchises expire. There is also a good case for the state to have a strategic role in urban railways, where the public interest in supporting ecological mass-transit systems is particularly obvious. Even here, though, public ownership is not the magic bullet, as the popularity of the London Overground, run by an amalgam of private companies on track that is not controlled by Network Rail, illustrates.\nPassengers are having to bear too much of the cost of the railways. That much is clear. But the answer to that lies partly in pay reform and reducing high housing costs as well as cutting fares. Britain’s railways are in some respects a success story, based on an unplanned pragmatic mix of private and public investment. Privatisation , 20 years ago for ideological reasons, was a dogmatic course. Renationalisation for ideological reasons 20 years later would be dogmatic too. There is plenty of room for imaginative new thinking about the railways and their place in the transport system without substituting one ideological obsession for another.", "external_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/government/news/earnings-outstrip-rail-fare-increases-for-first-time-in-a-decade", "http://actionforrail.wpengine.com/uk-commuters-spend-more-than-twice-as-much-of-their-salary-on-rail-fares-than-most-european-passengers-2/", "http://actionforrail.wpengine.com/rail-fares-have-risen-by-25-per-cent-since-2010-tuc-analysis-reveals/", "http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/july-2015/index.html", "http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/16997/gb-rail-industry-financials-2013-14.pdf"], "published": "2015-08-19T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:53:32.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
