Maynier said he was \"delighted\" about the move. \n\"I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It's obviously a much bigger... more complex portfolio. Defence had a R48bn per annum perspective. In finance, one has a R1.2 trillion perspective. So they are very different portfolios.\" \nSpeaking about President Jacob Zuma's mid-year review conference at the Union Buildings on Tuesday, Maynier said he was shocked to hear the country's leader say there was no \"doom and gloom\". \n\"It's simply not true for the president to argue that the factors constraining growth are mostly external. They are partly external, but there are major structural constraints on economic growth and jobs in South Africa, which we can do something about,\" he said. \n\"I was shocked that the president called a press conference and claimed that there was no doom and gloom when economic growth is declining, unemployment is increasing and inflation is increasing. The country is essentially caught in a low growth, high unemployment cycle.\" \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T18:44:49.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
