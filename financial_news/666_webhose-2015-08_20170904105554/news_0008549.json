We think there's a better way. Follow @k_pitsker Courtesy of Gage Skidmore via Wikimedia Commons \nWith college tuition and student borrowing -- along with enrollment -- on the rise, the affordability of a college education will be an issue for young adults and parents alike in the 2016 elections. Earlier this month, Democratic presidential hopeful Martin O’Malley, former governor of Maryland, outlined his proposal to help students who attend an in-state public four-year college graduate debt-free by increasing Pell grants, automatically enrolling borrowers in income-based repayment plans and helping borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates. Take Our Quiz: Valuable Lessons on Getting, Repaying Student Loans \nBut hold on. Alongside his proposal, O’Malley shared his family’s own student debt story, revealing that he and his wife, Katie, a Baltimore judge, took out nine parent PLUS loans (federal loans taken by parents or graduate students), totaling more than $339,200, to educate their daughter Grace at Georgetown University and daughter Tara at the College of Charleston. \nWhoa! Although most students borrow to finance their education -- to the tune of an average $27,300 per borrower for the class of 2013 -- bulking up on loans the way the O’Malleys did is rarely a smart financial decision. The country’s $1.2 trillion student debt problem shows that the O’Malleys are far from the only family with student debt. But relatively few are in as deep as this couple. In the last quarter of 2014, only 4.2% of student loan borrowers had balances of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Federal Reserve. \nHaley Morris, an O'Malley campaign spokesperson, said: \"This was a family decision to take on this debt and make this sacrifice for their daughters' education and future, and that’s something they will decide again as a family for their sons.\" She adds: \"It’s clear that the governor and his family value education and made that a priority, and I think that’s something they share with a lot of families.” Advertisement \nAt Kiplinger, we believe that the O’Malley approach is no way to go, especially because they still have two younger sons who may also want to go to college. Sure, there are some high-paying professions, such as doctors and lawyers, where earning degrees costs huge sums of money up front. But piling up an enormous student loan debt without a credible plan to pay it back can put you in the red for a lifetime. \nHere are five lessons student borrowers and their families can learn from O’Malley’s experience with student debt. \n1. Start the discussion early . Kiplinger editor Janet Bodnar recommends that as children near the beginning of their college search, you talk with them about the cost of their options. One important distinction to make: the difference between your state’s public school and private or out-of-state options. In 2014-15, the average sticker price for an in-state four-year public institution was $18,943. Meanwhile, the average sticker price for a four-year private nonprofit college or university was $42,419 a year. \nPrivate is not synonymous with quality. For example, the in-state cost of attendance at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (number 22 in our combined rankings of best college values ) is $20,412. About 10 miles away, Duke University (number 10 in our combined rankings) charges an annual sticker price of $61,878. You’ll want to share with your children how you’ve been saving for the expense, what portion of it you’re hoping to cover -- and what you’ll expect them to contribute. \nPerhaps your family plans to contribute a certain dollar amount for each child, or maybe you’re planning to save enough to cover in-state tuition at a public school. You’ll need to help your child understand that attending school out of state or at a private school means he will need to make up the difference with scholarships, loans or his own earnings. And no matter what level of financial support you’re able to offer your kids, it’s smart for your students to have some skin in the game, taking some financial responsibility for their education. \n2. Know your options . Before casting a wide net for your family’s college search, familiarize yourself with options closer to home, including in-state public universities, community colleges and even certificate or apprenticeship programs (see our story 4 Alternatives to a Four-Year College Degree ). Depending on what your child plans to study, or the offerings of your state’s public university system, you may find an affordable option close to home. Some states and cities also offer programs to pick up the tab for some students (see our story Free Community College for All? ). \nWhen O’Malley was governor of Maryland, he froze tuition at state universities for four years in an effort to keep the cost of a higher education affordable. His children could have graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park for less than $100,000 each (without scholarships or financial aid). Yet as his daughters entered college, they enrolled at Georgetown University and the College of Charleston, where the cost of attendance for four years rings in at roughly $270,000 and $160,000 (for non-residents of South Carolina), respectively. “For us, this is what the American Dream is all about -- working hard and making sacrifices so our kids can pursue bigger opportunities and do better than we did,” says O’Malley. But there are plenty of ways to help your children attend college and achieve their dreams that don’t require taking on a mountain of debt (see our story Why Elite Colleges Don't Guarantee Success ). \n3. File the FAFSA and apply for scholarships . Even if you don’t expect to qualify, you should still fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The form is the starting point for all financial aid, not just that offered by the federal government. Many states, schools and scholarships also use the FAFSA to award financial aid. You may be surprised to discover that your family does qualify for federal aid. Plus, filing the FASFA opens the door for your student to receive other funds from the state or the school.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T00:43:09.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
