Perpetual raised $250 million for its first LIC, while Perennial Investment Partners also launched an LIC version of its wealth defender strategy.\nContango Asset Management's income generator LIC debuted on the ASX on Friday at $1.01 before closing at $1.02, after raising $72 million from investors.\nMr Wilson is seeking to raise up to $550 million for the charity-focused Future Generation Global Investment Company.\nHe believes DIY super funds will be the driving force behind the take-up of LICs in the near future, as investors continue combing for yield amid record low interest rates.\n\"We're seeing more and more DIY fund investors moving away from managed funds into LICs, as they [LICs] can provide a consistent stream of fully franked dividends,\" he said.\nBut opportunities for investment managers remain tight amid a low-growth environment. Chris Stott, chief investment officer of WAM Capital, said the Australian sharemarket was operating in the \"mature stages\" of a six-year bull market, which followed the early-2009 lows.\n\"In FY2016 we expect the Australian equity market will continue to benefit from low interest rates and improving domestic economic conditions,\" he said.\n\"The upcoming reporting season will provide a good insight into the health of Australian companies. We believe strong corporate earnings are needed to see equities trade higher.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T02:58:48.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
