However, there can be no denying that several - though of course not all - of the UK’s key weaknesses are finally seeing some improvement. Wages are growing at a remarkable rate, in both nominal and real terms; and productivity may finally be improving. These were two of the highlights from the Bank of England’s Inflation Report - on top, of course, of the confirmation that interest rates won’t be going up this year, even though the economy is powering ahead. \nLet’s start off with pay, a key area of concern that had prompted dangerous interventions by the Government in the form of a planned massive increase in the minimum wage. George Osborne recently claimed, as politicians are sometimes wont to do, that the UK now “deserved” a pay rise after years of austerity. It turns out that his imploration wasn’t actually necessary: the market was already delivering in a big way. \nPay grew by 3.2pc in the three months to May compared to the same period a year earlier, the Bank reminded us. Private sector pay shot up by 3.8pc; during the same period, the consumer price index rose by 0.1pc, implying a massive boost in real terms. Needless to say, public sector wages are partly determined by market forces and partly by government fiat; it is the Treasury’s policy to keep the lid on pay to contain overall spending. These sorts of top-down price controls are far from ideal - but given the fact that pay was previously allowed to spiral out of control by the Labour government , and the need to slash spending far more aggressively, they are the least bad option to inject a little sense into the system. \nThere is another encouraging fact here. If anything, these overall figures for UK-wide pay growth actually dramatically underplay the extent of the pay hikes already taking place in the economy. The problem with our average pay statistics is that the numbers are hugely distorted by changes in the composition of the workforce. The data don’t actually track individual workers; they look at the median weekly wage for all workers, which may vary for a variety of reasons. Existing workers may be getting healthy pay rises; but the statistics would not visibly reflect this if new entrants to the workforce find jobs that pay less than average. \nThe Bank of England's Inflation Report \nIt is excellent progress that the authorities now accept this. The Bank explains that since mid-2013, net job creation “has been unusually concentrated in lower-skilled occupations and among employees with fewer qualifications and those who are new to their roles”. As a result of this, it now estimates that adjusted, underlying wage growth was roughly 0.8 percentage points higher in the first quarter than the standard figures would suggest. \nWhat is clear is that after years of belt-tightening, private sector Britain is now enjoying a pay rise bonanza on all measures. The danger is that we could get too much of a good thing and wages spiral out of control, threatening a resurgence in inflation. With the consumer price index back down to zero growth in June, few are worried about that for now - but we live in a world where inflationary pressure and excessive demand manifest themselves in very different ways. \nThere was more good news in the (slightly historic) productivity figures cited by the Bank. \nIn the 12 months to the end of March, productivity grew 0.8pc; this rate of increase is expected to have accelerated to 1.5pc in the year to the end of June. This is a slightly more respectable figure than the disastrously poor numbers we have been used to for so long. The pre-crisis rate calculated by the Bank was still quite a lot higher at 2.4pc a year, but Britain’s post-recession productivity crisis could finally be ending. This helps to explain the acceleration in wages: over time, workers who make more, earn more. Pay rises that are accompanied by productivity growth are fine; it is those that proceed without a parallel increase in output per hour that are a worry. The latter increases unit labour costs, reduces the demand for labour and can signal over-heating. \nThe minutes of the latest MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) meeting \nThe third part of the jigsaw puzzle is economic growth, which the Bank now expects to come in at a decent 2.8pc. Just imagine what could happen to growth if the supply-side of the economy were truly liberated: if, for example, the housing industry were unleashed and housebuilding doubled. The economy could probably grow by 4pc a year, though it would have to either train far more construction workers or import them. \nTo highlight these sorts of genuine improvements isn’t to pretend that all is right with the UK economy . The current account deficit is massive: this is usually a sure sign that demand is too strong and supply too weak. It may be that the statistics exaggerate the extent of the problem but there can be little doubt that this is a major challenge for the British economy. Higher interest rates would both help and exacerbate the problem: trimming domestic demand would reduce imports; but a higher pound against the euro could hit exports. \nUltimately, however, the Bank’s so-called “Super Thursday” will be remembered for one non-development: interest rates will remain on hold for the rest of the year and beyond, with the first tightening likely next year. That is a little more dovish than we had recently been led to be believe. Is that the right answer? I doubt it. The economy is now doing too well, and wages growing too quickly, for emergency levels of interest rates sensibly to be maintained. A better strategy would be to hike rates immediately after the Fed finally makes a move. There is case against the UK acting unilaterally; there is no case to delay monetary policy tightening for another nine months. \nallister.heath@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T02:07:58.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
