So, I was really shocked to learn on the July 27, 2015 episode when Jon Stewart mentioned that US State Department is using flyers (yes, printed content) to combat ISIS's full blown Social Media web sites! I was not only offended as a US tax-payer, but also appauld as a believer in Content Marketing. \nThe image used in the flyer is stark and bloody one that shows a monstrous-looking member of the ISIS urging a frightened youth to step forward, as another militant shoves a man head-first through a meat grinder. The sign overhead reads “Daesh Recruiting Office,” making the case that those who join the militants are being fed into a machine in which they cannot survive. \nI guess it's fair to conclude that when it comes to Content Marketing using Social Media; the US State Department and Central Command are in dark ages. In fact, last time I remember paying for flyers to be mailed to potential customers was more than 10 years ago. That's because Direct Marketing -like Cold Calling- is very ineffective because more than 95% of the targeted audience are not interested in your message. So, unless US State Department can target these flyers to reach the most vulnerable population of Middle East between 10-25 years old who can read Arabic and live within 2 mile radius of these airdrops; this effort is doomed to fail. \nOther advantages of Social Media marketing is that it comes with robust tools for sharing and feedback. On Facebook alone there are \" re-targeting \" strategies to make sure the message is delivered repeatedly to the same group. You can also create \" custom audiences \" with Facebook. On Twitter, there are opportunities to create followers and reach them with messages of hope and freedom that US could champion. \nI just wish I was a fly on the wall at CENTCOM when they decided on Flyers as the best tool to combat ISIS's full blown Social Media campaign. It's comical to think that flyers can combat Social Media campaigns. In fact, if we are trying to win the hearts-and-minds of the Arab youth away from ISIS and their destructive view of life; we need to do better Facebook, Twitter and YouTube that ISIS. \nTrying to counter ISIS's Social Media marketing campaigns with printed flyers is akin to taking a butter-knife to a gunfight. It's not going to be pretty and US will certainly lose. \nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:06:38.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
