The Increase in product prices and the low salaries are making it hard to make ends meet at the end of the month. One of the common ways to get the needed cash needed is to take payday loans . The following article will help you with making the right decision when taking a payday loan or car title loan. 1. As in every consumer decision you make, conduction a research prior to taking the loan is highly important. Some payday lenders charge heavy premiums and fees, while others don't. Also, some lenders may offer short term specials that will make a huge difference. Don’t rush into decision and make sure you get the best deal possible. 2. There's a difference between payday loans, personal loans and car title loans . Research into the different types of loans to find out which one suits you the best. The loan's value and your credit score are crucial factors in determining the best loan option. A thorough research can result in major money saving. 3. Make sure to read all the fine print in the agreement prior to signing on it. The legal language can be used as a mask that hides extra rates and fees. Know exactly what you're signing on. 4. Different loan programs work differently for every loan take, depending on their personal situation. More and more loan companies today offer more flexible programs, such as 30-day repayments. Choose the lender which offers the most suitable plan for you. 5. Your credit score can play a crucial role in determining the interest rate. Having a bad credit history doesn't necessarily mean you won't be given a loan, but they will be very costly. Car title loans, on the other hand, usually don’t care about your credit score since they are using your car title as collateral. 6. Be suspicious of online lenders, and prefer taking a loan from a lender in person. There are many suspicious online lenders that are just trying to steal your money or information. 7. Avoid taking multiple payday loans at once. Besides finding it hard to pay them all by the time you get your paycheck, other loan companies will be able to know if applied for additional loans. Car Title Loans Another personal loan option is the car title loan. With these loans the person applying uses his car title as collateral. So if you own a car and its title has no liens attached, a car title loan is an option for you to consider. Pay attention to the fact that the loan company holds your title until the loan is paid off. The tips provided above can make a huge difference when applying for a payday loan. The fact that you're in need of cash doesn't mean you have to take the first loan you see. Making the right choice can save you a lot of money, thus minimizing the chance you'll need another loan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T12:42:33.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
