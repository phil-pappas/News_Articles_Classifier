We went from 2013 from having a project loss of about $50 million to 2014 when we started this programme of having product gain of $3.5 million. \n'This year, we've gone from basically breaking even or making losses historically as a company in general to generating profit in excess of $21 million,' he said. \nMr Awuah-Darko stated that he was confident that union members, staff and management would be highly motivated to effectively deliver and get performance bonuses for themselves. \nHe added that he was pleased that management and the board together with the union members had been able to finalize the process which started about 15 years ago. \nBernard Owusu, Local Unionized Chairman at BOST, commended the board and management of the company for engaging the unionized members in the re-structuring process which was 90 percent complete. \n'Over the past nine months, we, members of the Unionized Staff, have performed well which has brought in bonuses totaling about GHÂ¢700, 000,' Mr Owusu said. \nHe said they would fully support the Kakra Essamanh-led board in an ongoing corruption investigation at BOST that had led to the interdiction of some general managers and senior staff. \n'We are of the view that whoever is found culpable must not be spared but made to face the full rigors of the law,' he said. \nBy Nii Ogbamey Tetteh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:53:08.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
