The guidelines also contain guidance on the transmission of information about passport notifications to competent authorities in host member states and on the information about passporting firms that competent authorities should make publicly available. \nThe EBA consulted on the guidelines in June 2015. \nThe guidelines apply from March 21, 2016, the transposition date for the MCD, with the exception of certain information requirements for competent authorities that apply from the day after the date the guidelines are published in the official languages of the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T17:26:14.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
