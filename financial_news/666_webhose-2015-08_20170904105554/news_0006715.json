Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Fleur Anderson What do Joseph Stalin, clowns, Robert Menzies and Italian fashion designers have in common?\nThey have all been invoked in a head-spinning political brawl over marriage equality, democracy and party discipline versus individuals' conscience.\n\"I don't run a Stalinist party, like those opposite,\" Prime Minister Tony Abbott pointed at Labor in question time.\nLabor erupted in outrage at Abbott's reply to Labor leader Bill Shorten's question whether Abbott would sack any of his ministers who dared cross the floor to vote in favour of marriage equality.\nSome Labor types are happy to fondly call each \"comrade\" but to be compared to a paranoid Russian dictator tends to irritate.\n\"Members opposite have these Stalinist rules but, Mr Speaker, backbench members of the Coalition always have a conscience vote,\" Abbott went on.\n\"Members of the executive, as usual, as always, are bound by the policy of the government.\"\nDiffering policies on voting Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull during QT. Alex Ellinghausen It's been a scrappy 24 hours in which Abbott's minister Eric Abetz, wearing an understated well-cut suit, cited Italian fashion designers Dolce & Gabbana as evidence of some gay men not wanting to get married, Labor leader Bill Shorten called Abetz a clown and Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg suggested Liberal hero Sir Robert Menzies would turn in his grave for not allowing a conscience vote.\nLet's try to get this straight. After the Coalition's marathon heart-to-heart session about gay marriage on Tuesday night, Coalition MPs will not be allowed a free vote on marriage equality.\nBut Abbott boasts the Coalition is a \"broad church\" that still allows its backbenchers to cross the floor to vote against the party without – theoretically – fear of being thrown out of the party.\nIts frontbenchers, however, are compelled to vote along party lines. And this makes things difficult for ministers such as Malcolm Turnbull, Julie Bishop, Josh Frydenberg and the 13 other frontbenchers who have spoken in favour of gay marriage.\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt reacts to heckles from the opposition. Labor on the other hand agreed at its national conference to give its members a free vote on gay marriage until 2019, when the rules revert to a \"binding vote\" this time in favour of gay marriage.\nSo in other words, one party's members get political free choice for the next four years on one issue but otherwise have absolutely no choice on anything else forever more. And the other party allows its backbenchers to have voting freedom all the time, but its senior members no choice but to follow the party line.\nFrom there it gets even more confusing.\nAbbott, who doesn't want gay marriage, thinks the issue should be put to the people at the election and a plebiscite some time after. Turnbull, who does support it, thinks a plebiscite is a terrible idea that will just suck the oxygen out of every political discussion until the next election.\nAnd then Bill Shorten wants the issue decided by Parliament, which Abbott says is less democratic than a plebiscite.\n\"Members opposite want a politicians' choice, this side of Parliament wants a people's choice,\" Abbott said in question time, in a not-so-subtle reminder to Turnbull just which side he should be on.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/fleur_anderson"], "published": "2015-08-12T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:05:48.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
