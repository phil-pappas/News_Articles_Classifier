Antonel by Simon Evans The terms of trade have crashed and the dollar, already well down against the greenback, is tipped to fall further. So when do prices for TVs, champagne and everything else we import from overseas start rising?\nAnyone thinking of racing out to beat price hikes can probably relax. The falling dollar-rising prices dynamic has been up-ended by online retailing, fierce competition and a desire by manufacturers to keep sales volume up in a slower-growing economy. The lead times for jacking up prices are longer than they used to be. It also depends on what you're buying.\nWhen it comes to big-ticket items like the latest flat-screen televisions, the currency drop is generally rolled into higher prices under the cover of new model upgrades and innovations in technology such as smart TVs and ultra-high definition.\nFor the big-screen TVs, February and March 2016 are likely to be the time for the next big leap in prices. Industry players say once a new generation of technology comes out it is priced at its highest point by manufacturers, who build in the impact of currency imposts with their new price lists and then it generally drops in price regardless of currency, as the \"newness\" factor dissipates.\nAt the smaller appliances end in a market brimming with kettles, toasters, mixers and coffee machines, competition is fierce as fashion and new technology deliver a constant stream of new models.\nJonathan Ling, managing director of ASX-listed GUD Holdings, which has brands such as Sunbeam and Oates cleaning products in its stable, said shoppers were paying higher prices now than they did in 2011, when the dollar was at its strongest, but the technical advances, better energy efficiency and bigger motors in kitchen appliances were part of the reason prices were higher. \"I think it's fair to say they probably are paying more,\" he said.\nBut the market was so competitive, further price rises would be limited, he said.\n\"You've got a lot of other levers to pull. It's such a competitive market that you can't just put prices up. Otherwise you'll just lose share.\"\n Demanding more That includes pulling out supply chain and transport costs and demanding more from retailers such as in-store promotions as part of supply agreements.\nBig international players in cosmetics and luxury fashion are reluctant to lift prices too much and are likely to keep prices largely steady for at least another 12 months. It's a fine line, and influenced by a need to ensure sales volume targets are met in Australia, at a time when shoppers are coming back in droves to stores because their spending power on the glittering websites of offshore online retailers is greatly diminished. The British online retailer ASOS is a barometer. Once it was flying four jumbo jets full of clothing a week to Australia to customers ordering online with the enhanced spending power of a roaring Australia dollar, but sales have fallen sharply.\nThe private label clothing offerings in department stores like Myer and David Jones are under the most pressure from a dropping Australian currency because there is no intermediary to absorb the shift in the exchange rate.\nThe Australian dollar has dropped by 21 per cent against the US dollar in the past 12 months. It has fallen just 5 per cent against the Euro in that time – the Australian dollar buys about €0.65 now, which is well below the €0.80 it bought through much of 2012 and 2013. Based on a basket of currencies of Australia's most important trade partners, the trade weighted index, the dollar has fallen 14 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia insists the dollar needs to go down even further and has signalled a willingness for another interest rate cut if needed.\nLargely benign Official data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics backs up the notion that despite the dollar's fall, price rises have been largely benign to date. ABS data released on July 29 showed prices paid by a typical wage earner increased by an annual 0.9 per cent, substantially below the 2.9 per cent average annual increase of the past 16 years.\nHowever, a conundrum is coming for those with a taste for the finer things in life like French champagne. Sales of imported champagne almost doubled over the four years from 2010 to 2014, during a time when the Australian dollar was exceptionally strong and the purchasing power of local drinkers was maximised. Big brands like Mumm, Moet and Piper-Heidsieck revelled as imported champagne sales climbed to 6.52 million bottles in calendar 2014, from 3.69 million bottles in calendar 2010, official figures from the Champagne Bureau show. Prices have been creeping back up, and industry players expect that will continue slowly. The Australian dollar was at its peak of $US1.10 in mid-2011 and has since sunk back to about $US0.73.\nRob McLean, assistant manager at Five Way Cellars in the affluent Sydney suburb of Paddington, said there had been a shift toward top-quality champagne in the past few years and this would be tested as prices climbed. He had seen small price rises in the past six months and expected more.\n\"I think there will definitely be a creep.\"\nDrinkers relished the better buying power of an Australian dollar either above, or close to $US1.00, he said.\n\"When you've been serving up those brands to your friends, I think it is hard to go back to Australian bubbles.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T07:00:38.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
