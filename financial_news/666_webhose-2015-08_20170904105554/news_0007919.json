Investors seeking to capitalize on the sector may want to start building a stake in conservatively run MDC Holdings ( MDC - Get Report ) , said Iman Brivanlou , portfolio manager for the TCW High Dividend Equities (TGHDX) fund. \nBrivanlou said MDC's CEO Larry Mizel saw the 2008 downturn early and built a strong balance sheet in advance, which allowed the company to navigate the downturn much better than its peers. He added that MDC's management was also a little slow to catch the upside during the recovery, but he appreciates a cautious management team in a cyclical sector. \n\"The company weathered the downturn much better than its peers,\" said Brivanlou. \"Part of that conservatism prevented Larry from getting back into the game as early as some of his competitors, but we think the market overly punished MDC for that specific reason.\"The TCW High Dividend Equities fund is up 2.3% year-to-date, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. Shares of MDC Holdings are up 17% so far this year . \nBrivanlou is also bullish on WP Glimcher, a $2.5 billion mall REIT that was spun out of Simon Property Group ( SPG - Get Report ) . Shares of WP Glimcher WPG have dropped 21% year-to-date , but Brivanlou said the company's assets are of a higher quality than implied by the company's current valuation. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nFinally, shares of Qualcomm ( QCOM - Get Report ) are down over 17% thus far in 2015 primarily because its chip business has come under pressure. However, Brivanlou remains positive on the company, saying the stock's current valuation of 13 times forward earnings is supported by the royalty stream alone. \n\"You have a very high quality royalty business,\" said Brivanlou. \"It is our viewpoint, based on our analysis, that the current valuation embeds only the value of that royalty business plus the company's cash. So we view any recovery or turnaround in the chip business as potential upside for the company.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
