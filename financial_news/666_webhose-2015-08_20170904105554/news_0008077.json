This deal gives us that certainty for our passengers and employees beyond that date and through to 2025,\" he said. \nQantas will receive $535 million in cash as part of the sale of the lease and book a $210 million profit on the deal in its 2015/16 financial results. \nIn exchange, Sydney Airport will receive per-passenger payments from Qantas for flights arriving at the terminal and will also take control of T3's retail space. \nQantas is also in talks about the sale of its leases at Melbourne and Perth airports. \nThe airline's shares gained three cents to $3.79 and Sydney Airport shares dropped seven cents to $5.63. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Qantas Sells Syd Airport lease for $535m AAP \nQantas has sold back its lease on Sydney Airport's Terminal 3 four years early for $535 million.
