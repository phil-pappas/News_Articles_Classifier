Greeks can withdraw only up to 420 euros (460) a week. \nThe capital controls were slightly eased for businesses last week but economic activity especially imports continues to encounter numerous obstacles. \nFounded in 1876 the Athens stock exchange has closed down more than a dozen times in its history the weekly To Vima reported Sunday most recently in 2008 owing to a strike by Bank of Greece staff. \nOther instances include the Balkan Wars of the 1990s the World Wars I and II the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 1987's 'Black Monday' in the United States and the outbreak of a stocks manipulation scandal in 1996. \nThe Greek economy is already forecast to contract by 3 percent this year by the Standard and Poor's rating agency but extended capital controls and a big bail-in could constrict activity even further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:55:53.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
