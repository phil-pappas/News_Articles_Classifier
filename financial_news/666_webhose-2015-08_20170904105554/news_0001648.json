We've considered a spectrum of options and we believe that the best outcome for the region and the brand is to keep an operational brewery on site at reduced production capacity,\" he says. \nIt is hoped some of the affected staff can relocate to other DB sites or be redeployed to the new brewery. Some will help with help decommission the existing brew plant. \nDB says six bespoke Tui beers will be brewed and served at the new plant and it will give it more flexibility to experiment with new beers. \nThe 126-year-old site, with a restaurant and museum, hosts functions, weddings, events and tours. \nAbout 45,000 people visit every year and the changes will help it cope with an expected 30 percent increase in visitor numbers. \nThe work shows DB is committed to staying in Mangatainoka, Tui marketing manager Nick Rogers says. \nDB, owned by Heineken, also has breweries in Auckland, Timaru and Greymouth. \nThe Tui Tower is a Category 1 Heritage listed building and as part of the work will undergo base isolation work, with Fletcher Building to replace the foundations with sliding bearings designed to absorb and cushion the movement of earthquakes. \n3 News / NZN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:30:21.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
