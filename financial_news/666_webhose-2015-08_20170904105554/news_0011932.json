(AP) - Gap Inc. is ending its practice of requiring workers to remain on-call for short-notice shifts following an inquiry from New York's attorney general.\nA spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based retailer said Thursday the decision also applies to Gap's other brands, including Banana Republic, Old Navy and Athleta and was part of an effort to \"improve scheduling stability and flexibility\" for workers.\nSpokeswoman Laura Wilkinson said the change will apply \"across our global organization\" and will be fully implemented by the end of this month. Wilkinson said the company is working to establish scheduling systems giving store employees at least 10 to 14 days' notice.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman's office sent letters to Gap and 12 other retailers earlier this year questioning them about on-call scheduling, which required hourly workers to stay on-call for shifts set the night before or the same day, giving them little time to arrange for child care or work other jobs.\n\"Workers deserve stable and reliable work schedules, and I commend Gap for taking an important step to make their employees' schedules fairer and more predictable,\" said Schneiderman, a Democrat.\nAbercrombie & Fitch also ended the practice this month.\nCarrie Gleason, director of the Fair Workweek Initiative at the Center for Popular Democracy, said in a statement that Gap's decision reflects not only Schneiderman's concerns but also a new ordinance in San Francisco requiring chain retailers to set schedules in advance. Similar proposals are pending before other city governments.\n\"Working people in hourly jobs are starting to speak out about the impact that employers' scheduling practices has on their lives,\" Gleason said in a statement.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T01:32:14.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
