( SPRO ), a leader in the field of accredited professional education and corporate training, today announced its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Financial results from continuing operations for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to 2014 Net revenues of $3.65 million, compared to net revenues of $3.69 million, Operating Income $474,000 compared to an operating loss of $176,000 Gross profit margin of 61.6% compared to gross profit margin of 53.6% Net income of $448,000 or $.10 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $234,000, or $.(05) per diluted share \nFinancial results from continuing operations for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to 2014 Net revenues of $6.36 million, compared to net revenues of $6.35 million Operating income of $154,000 compared to an operating loss of $715,055 Gross profit margin of 59.5% compared to gross profit margin of 53.6% Net income of $121,000, or $.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $618,000, or $(.13) per diluted share RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO EBITDA: JUNE 30, Interest and dividend income, (net) EBITDA before adjustment for discontinued operations Adjustment to EBITDA for discontinued operations Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations $ 86,820 \nAs of June 30, 2015 the Company had approximately $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1.5 million in accounts receivable, $3.8 million in deferred revenue, stockholders' equity of $7.6 million, and no debt. \n“Excluding discontinued operations, our results over our first six-months of this year are the best we’ve posted in more than 5 years,” said Allen Greene, Chairman and CEO of SmartPros. “Because of the seasonal aspects of our business, it has not been uncommon for us to show a loss at six-months. However, our recent six month numbers show a return to profitability, producing a $738,000 turnaround from last year’s results. In addition, our operating income for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was up $869,000 over the previous period. Although our three months revenues were relatively constant we had substantial increases in both operating income and net income as compared to the previous year.” \nGreene continued: “We attribute this performance to a number of different factors, including an increase in earned revenues from the sale of our technology products as well as the ongoing effects of the \"Back to Basics\" program that we implemented in June 2014. Specifically, we are starting to build a good pipeline for our Audit Management System (AMS) and we have created some new products related to the AMS. In addition, we eliminated a few of our poorly performing products and unprofitable customers and sold some of the operating assets of our former Skye Multimedia, Ltd. subsidiary back in December 2014. Overall, for the six month period, our cost of revenues was down 13% and our selling, general and administrative costs were down 14% compared to last year. In addition, our gross profit margin was up 11%, from 53.6% to 59.5%, and close to our target goal of 60%. The net result of all these efforts has taken us back to a profitable bottom line.” \nSmartPros’ Board of Directors declared the Company’s 23 rd consecutive quarterly dividend. The $.015 per common share dividend is payable on October 7, 2015, to shareholders of record as of September 18, 2015. The Company cautions that any future dividend will be affected by ongoing results. \nShareholders and other interested parties are encouraged to contact the Company with any specific questions relating to the Company’s public filings.
