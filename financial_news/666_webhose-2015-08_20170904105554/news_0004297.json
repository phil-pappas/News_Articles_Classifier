Sallie Mae has taken a good, long look at your college savings plans, and its prognosis is a dire one. According to a recent study from the college loan giant, only 48% of U.S. parents have a savings plan for college, and the average college savings plan amount fell to $10,900 this year - a 25% decline since 2009. Surprisingly, only 27% of parents are using what many expert call a solid college savings vehicle, the 529 plan, Sallie May reports. According to SavingsForCollege.com, a 529 plan is an education savings plan operated by a state or educational institution designed to help families set aside funds for future college costs. The plan is named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, which created the plans in 1996. More specifically, it's a state-sponsored plan managed by state-appointed investment managers that lets you invest in a selection of age-based or static investment portfolios. \"Withdrawals are tax-free for qualified college and graduate school expenses,\" says Rande Spiegelman, vice president of financial planning at Charles Schwab. \"There are no annual contribution limits - just a lifetime limit of about $300,000 or more per beneficiary for all states.\" That underuse of 529 plans by Sallie Mae is supported by other studies. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:39:25.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
