Therefore, with a strong order book, a growing pipeline of contract opportunities and the prospect of market conditions continuing to improve, our expectations for 2015 and the medium term remain unchanged.\" \nThe company said it would raise its interim dividend by 2pc to 5.7p. \nIn July, Carillion secured an £80m contract to build an operational base and accommodation complex for BP's Khazzan gas project in Oman.
