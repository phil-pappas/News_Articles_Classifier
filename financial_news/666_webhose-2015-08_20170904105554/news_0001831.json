More Young people more demanding over salaries \nTaxpayers paid about £275m less in total, Nationwide estimated, but about 2,000 purchasers — two-thirds of them in London — paid an average of £28,000 more under the changes. The decline in tax paid reverses a steep upward trend in stamp duty revenues, which were at record levels last year. \nThe mortgage provider said it had also seen less “bunching” of house prices around tax thresholds at £125,000, £250,000 and £500,000 that had previously triggered jumps in stamp duty. \n“Even though the change to SDLT (stamp duty land tax) only came into effect six months ago, the impact on the pattern of transactions is already evident,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. \nHouse prices, meanwhile, rose slightly in July, maintaining annual growth at a steadier rate than over the past two years after a surprise dip in June, according to the Nationwide house prices index. \nPrices were up by 0.4 per cent during the month, pushing the annual pace of house price growth up slightly to 3.5 per cent from 3.3 per cent a month earlier, the mortgage provider said. \nThe average price paid for a home was £195,621, up from £195,055 in June, when house prices fell 0.2 per cent from the previous month. \n“After moderating over the past 12 months, there are tentative signs that annual house price growth may be stabilising close to the pace of earnings growth, which has historically been around 4 per cent,” said Mr Gardner. \n“This would bode well for a sustainable increase in housing market activity, though whether this will be maintained will depend on whether building activity can keep pace with increasing demand.” \nAnalysts at IHS Global Insight noted that Nationwide’s figures portray milder price inflation than those of Halifax , a rival mortgage provider, which showed a jump of 1.7 per cent month-on-month in June and 9.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. \nIHS expects house prices to rise by 6 per cent in 2015 and 5 per cent in 2016.
