Henceforth, the president crowed in typically folksy fashion, Brazil would be a respectable worker who “looks after the family”. Yet under Lula’s protégée and successor, Dilma Rousseff, Brazil risks falling off the wagon.\nOn July 28th Standard & Poor’s, a rating agency, said the country may lose its cherished status if it doesn’t sober up. The warning was precipitated by the government’s decision last week to lower its targets for primary surpluses (ie, before debt-service costs) for 2015-18. The goal for this year and next shrank from 1.1% and 2% of GDP, respectively, to 0.15% and 0.7%. The target for 2017 was cut from 2% to 1.3%, even though the IMF had recently suggested that it ought to go up to 2.5%. “The government seems to have thrown in the towel on the fiscal adjustment,” complains one investment banker. The other big rating agencies are expected to follow S&P’s lead soon.\n Politics World politics Brazilian politics Latin American politics Brazil\nThe central bank had been hoping to start cutting rates soon. The fiscal backsliding has made that impossible: on July 29th it raised rates instead by half a percentage point (the sixth such rise in a row), to 14.25%.\nJoaquim Levy, the hawkish finance minister, insists that the relaxed targets do not amount to surrender, merely a tactical retreat. Output is falling faster than hoped, ministers explained, weighing down tax receipts; they now expect to collect 122.5 billion reais ($37 billion) less this year than first thought.\nMr Levy plans to boost revenues with one-offs such as the sale of infrastructure concessions, a few (timid) privatisations and a tax amnesty for repatriated profits. But if growth does not pick up—and there is no sign that it will—gross public debt will exceed 70% of GDP by 2018, reckon analysts at BNP Paribas. That is inconsistent with an investment grade, given Brazil’s hefty interest bill, says Mansueto Almeida, a public-finance expert. Retaining that rating requires an overhaul of benefits, public pensions and other fixed spending, which account for some 80% of the budget but are politically sacred.\nMarkets appear to share S&P’s view. The price of insuring Brazil’s government bonds against default shot up in the wake of last week’s announcement. It is now higher than for Turkish bonds, which S&P rates as junk. The real has weakened by 3.9% against the dollar in one week.\nS&P is at pains to stress that its shift is not tantamount to a downgrade. India spent two years on a similar negative watch before returning to a stable outlook, it notes. Mr Levy and the central bank have been making some progress (the current-account deficit has narrowed; inflation expectations have subsided). S&P’s warning may yet concentrate minds in Brazil’s government. But fear of a relapse is rising.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/290-width/images/print-edition/20150801_FNP005_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T10:21:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
