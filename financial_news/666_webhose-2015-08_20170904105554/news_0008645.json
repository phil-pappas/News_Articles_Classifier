You add value from an informed position which comes from consulting the constituency. Mufukare alone does not constitute Emcoz.\" \nOn termination of contracts on three months' notice, which has triggered the loss of more than 6 000 jobs, Mufukare said the process should only be used when it is not retrenchment, dismissal or illness. \nA Supreme Court ruling that allowed employers to terminate contracts on July 17 has triggered a retrenchment bloodbath. More than 400 Sino-Zimbabwe workers on Wednesday last week were locked out of the company's premises and served with termination letters. \nTN Holdings, which has been struggling to stay afloat, laid off most of its employees as did furniture shop Pelhams, among others, on the basis of the same ruling. \nMedia companies have also been laying off workers.
