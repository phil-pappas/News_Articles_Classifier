The results from the study show that the addition of Nevisense significantly improved the ability of US dermatologists to accurately detect melanoma. The Reader Study is an important requirement of the application process to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With the results from the study, SciBase can now compile their complete application. \nRegulatory News: \n“We are very pleased with the result of the study. This was the last requirement from the US FDA for our Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application for Nevisense on the US market. Now that the Reader study is successfully completed, we can finalize and submit our application”, says Simon Grant, CEO of SciBase. \n41 US dermatologists reviewed online 141 randomly selected potential melanoma lesions; first with an image of each lesion together with patient information, and then with Nevisense information added. \nThe results showed that the use of Nevisense significantly improves physicians’ ability to detect melanoma, whilst also satisfying the goal set for accuracy. This meant the study met both primary endpoints agreed with the FDA. \n“The study results are in addition to the results from the SciBase pivotal study published last year, but with a different approach and with a broad group of US dermatologists. This shows that Nevisense has the potential to provide additional valuable information to clinicians in the difficult task of accurately detecting malignant melanomas”, says Simon Grant, CEO of SciBase. \nApproval from the FDA is required for SciBase to be able to market and sell Nevisense in the US, the world’s largest medical device market. By meeting the FDA’s requirements for the study, SciBase can now finalize its pre-market approval (PMA) application, which is scheduled for submission before the end of 2015. \nSciBase’s point-of-care device Nevisense is based on a method called Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), which uses the varying electrical properties of human tissue to categorize cellular structures and thereby detect malignancies. \nFor more information, please contact: \nSimon Grant, CEO \nEmail: simon.grant@scibase.com \nAbout SciBase and Nevisense \nSciBase AB is a Swedish medical technology company, headquartered in Stockholm that has developed a unique point-of-care device for the accurate detection of malignant melanoma.
