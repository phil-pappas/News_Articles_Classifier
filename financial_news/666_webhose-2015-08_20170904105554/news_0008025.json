Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Half a dozen industry super funds say they are reviewing their investment in Transfield Services, citing risks in its operation of offshore detention centres, but the company says it is hoping to expand the business.\nThe country's sixth-largest super fund HESTA dumped a 3 per cent holding worth $18 million in the sharemarket-listed company last week after an 18-month review.\nTransfield said it was \"committed to the ongoing development and growth of its business\", including offshore detention, which is estimated to be worth up to 20 per cent of its revenue, which was $1.9 billion in the last half.\nEconomist Sinclair Davidson, a senior fellow at free-market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs, warned that super funds should be careful not to leap into ethical investing, if it might be in conflict with their fiduciary duty to act in the best financial interest of members.\n\"If funds do not specifically identify themselves to members as applying ethical considerations to their investment decisions then they have a fiduciary obligation to make choices based solely on financial considerations,\" Mr Davidson said.\n\"Activist investing from super funds on ethical grounds is fine, as long as they are being true to label.\"\nThe Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents 30 non-profit super funds managing about $400 billion, has also been putting pressure on Transfield Services to justify the governance risks associated with its detention centre business for more than a year.\n\"Human rights issues will always be near the top of the agenda for ACSI members when considering the long-term governance risks associated with an investment,\" ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said.\n Substantial body of evidence HESTA chief executive Debby Blakey said the review showed a substantial body of evidence pointing to the negative impacts of prolonged mandatory detention of asylum seekers.\nVicSuper, which has a small exposure to Transfield Services through the passive part of its share portfolio, is among those that have instructed fund managers or other engagement specialists to apply pressure to Transfield Services on their behalf seeking better disclosures in response to questions about alleged human rights violations occurring inside the detention facilities it runs.\n\"Our approach is to engage with companies to influence changes and improvements in corporate governance and corporate behaviour,\" the $10.2 billion public sector fund's chief executive Michael Dundon said.\nCbus also confirmed it was conducting a review of the governance risks associated with its small holding in Transfield Services.\n\"No decision has been made to date to divest the company, and our assessment is ongoing,\" a spokesperson for the $26.2 billion construction industry fund said on Wednesday.\nâ€‹Retail industry funds are also set to start turning up the heat on companies over their human rights track records.\nAssess and disclose From July 1 the Financial Services Council, which represents 130 wealth managers responsible for $2.5 trillion in savings, has required all of its members to assess and disclose the environmental, social and governance risks in their portfolio.\n\"Superannuation managers should treat ESG risks in exactly the same way as they treat more traditional financial risks,\" FSC director of policy Andrew Bragg said.\nOther experts said all super funds had an obligation to evaluate governance risks.\n\"It is absolutely part of their fiduciary responsibility to consider ESG risks,\" Governance Institute head of policy Judith Fox said.\n\"As long-term shareholders, often with liabilities that extend for more than 30 years, it is central to good risk management for super funds to engage with those companies they are invested in to try to minimise governance problems.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/hesta-dumps-transfield-citing-detention-centre-abuses-20150818-gj218u.html"], "published": "2015-08-19T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:01:51.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
