The benchmark 30 year fixed rate mortgage came in at 3.93% which is only one basis point from the previous week. However, for those who follow rate trends, down is better than up. \nThe trend is very important because during most of July and some of June rates were 4% and higher. Industry experts point to better overall housing stats as the primary factor in driving rates down. Even though employment data showed a decline in the number of new hires from the previous months, the economy has been riding a steady stream while allowing consumer confidence to increase. \nWhile the 30 year mortgage is an industry standard, many consumers who are part of the refinancing boon favor the 15 year mortgage because it allows for quicker payoff. That rate dipped two basis points to 3.150%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:08:17.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
