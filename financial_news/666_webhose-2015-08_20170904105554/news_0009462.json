As snow fell outside, Hudson began to fidget, reaching for his jacket pocket. \"Is there something you want to give me?\" Kekedjian asked. \"Yeah,\" Hudson responded as he pulled out a sealed envelope. \"And it's not a marriage proposal.\" Bloomberg by Richard Clough The most sweeping transformation in General Electric Co.'s 123-year history was helped along by an unlikely tool: a noise-making cellphone app.\nAris Kekedjian, head dealmaker for GE's lending arm, was hours away from an April deadline to sell $US23 billion in real estate assets – the centrepiece of a plan to jettison virtually all of its vast banking operations. To prod negotiators, Kekedjian pulled up an iPhone program that mimics a hotel call bell, ringing it each time they agreed to a point.\n\"The lawyers were livid\" at being rushed, Kekedjian said with a smile during an interview at GE Capital's headquarters in Norwalk, Connecticut. \"We just cut through it all by putting the principals in a room and just pushing and pushing and pushing through it. We've had the momentum ever since.\"\nA look inside GE's metamorphosis shows the speed and shrewd bargaining behind one of the boldest corporate overhauls ever. In just a few weeks, a small GE Capital team mapped a path to take advantage of favourable markets and sell $US200 billion of financial assets. By shedding those businesses, GE can refocus on the manufacturing operations at its heart since the company was founded by Thomas Edison in the 1890s.\nUnder the direction of GE Capital chief executive Keith Sherin, Kekedjian has already unloaded more than $US30 billion in assets, including a buyout lending unit to Canada's largest pension fund and an online bank to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., since agreeing to the real estate sale to Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo & Co.\nNew deals Against a backdrop of rising global volatility, GE could soon sell $US40 billion of North American commercial lending divisions and is nearing deals for its rail-car finance unit and a portfolio of corporate aircraft loans. Wells Fargo and Toronto-Dominion Bank bid for all of those commercial lending assets, while KKR & Co. and Apollo Global Management LLC are seeking portions of that business, people familiar with the matter said. The suitors declined to comment or didn't respond.\nGE Capital staffers initially dubbed their divest-it-all effort \"Project Monty,\" because the concept seemed so outlandish that it evoked visions of the Monty Python comedy troupe and its catchphrase \"and now for something completely different.\" As the details came into focus, the codename became the grander \"Project Hubble,\" after Kekedjian's favourite telescope.\n One constant: GE's hardball approach.\n\"If you think you're going to bid X, and come in at X minus one, that will not go down well,\" said Steven Hudson, CEO of Element Financial Corp., which bought GE's vehicle-fleet management unit. \"They're tough.\"\nFour passports Kekedjian, a youthful 49-year-old with a wide smile and close-cropped hair, has maintained a low profile while becoming well-known to those pursuing GE Capital assets. The Canada-born executive, a Concordia University graduate who joined GE in 1989 at age 23, sometimes flies around the world for a single dinner to discuss a deal. He's gone through at least four passports – extra-thick ones for frequent travellers – since becoming M&A head five years ago.\n\"People don't wire you billions of dollars because they like your voice on the phone,\" he said.\nFor GE investors, exiting finance is long overdue. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company built out GE Capital starting in the 1980s. By the 2000s those assets swelled to more than $US500 billion and lending accounted for half of GE's profit.\n'Crown jewels' When credit dried up in 2008-09, the unit's reliance on capital markets almost capsized the entire company. GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt sold some poorly performing divisions amid Wall Street pressure while planning to keep most of GE Capital intact. Yet the regulatory burdens and costs in running a large lending business – and remaining a systemically important financial institution – continued to grow.\n\"We'd never really thought of getting rid of our crown jewels as the linchpin to the strategy,\" Kekedjian said. With the piecemeal disposals not working, \"You start thinking: 'You know what, what if we just get out?'\"\nThat idea was broached in November 2014 during a series of GE Capital planning sessions that included Sherin, Kekedjian, Financial Planning Leader Daniel Colao, Treasurer Daniel Janki and Global Tax Director Michael Gosk. Some participants were skeptical, but Sherin was intrigued and asked for more study. An analysis suggested investors valued the bulk of GE Capital at only about 70 percent of book, far less than it could fetch in a sale, Sherin said in an interview.\nSnowy evening The potential size of the prize became even clearer one night in February.\nHudson, the Element CEO, flew into New York and drove to Connecticut to have dinner with Kekedjian at Rebeccas, an upscale restaurant in Greenwich. As snow fell outside, Hudson began to fidget, reaching for his jacket pocket.\n\"Is there something you want to give me?\" Kekedjian asked. \"Yeah,\" Hudson responded as he pulled out a sealed envelope. \"And it's not a marriage proposal.\"\nThe executive produced a detailed offer for the US portion of GE's multibillion-dollar fleet business. Kekedjian, still two months from unveiling Project Hubble, couldn't let on that he was already considering a divestiture. He told Hudson the timing wasn't right and said he'd be in touch.\nBy March, the Project Hubble planners – or GE Capital skunkworks, as Sherin called them – completed their blueprint and got approvals from Immelt and GE directors to proceed.\n'The moment' \"One of the things that I remember saying to the board was, 'If you're ever going to do it, this was the moment to do it,'\" Kekedjian said. \"You've got markets that are in your favour, you've got assets that are being sought.\"\nThey set a date just a few weeks later, in early April, to take everything to market; ordinarily they'd spend months prepping just one business for sale.\nMeanwhile, Sherin and Immelt walked the idea past regulators, who have final say over whether GE can shed its too- big-to-fail label. They met in Washington on April 1 with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Governor Daniel Tarullo, the central bank's point person on financial rules.\n\"What we didn't do was go ask regulators for anything,\" said Sherin, 56. \"But we got enough of an understanding that they understood our strategy and they didn't raise a significant objection.\"\nSherin and Kekedjian decided to start the sales with one of GE Capital's least-desirable units.\nMessage sent \"If we picked an asset class that both our investors and our regulators hated more than anything else, it was our real estate book,\" Kekedjian said. \"It was a great way to send a message as broadly as we can to all the key constituents that this is for real.\"\nKekedjian told Jon Gray, global head of real estate for Blackstone, that if the investment firm could agree to terms quickly and with limited due diligence, a deal would be done; if not, GE would open up the bidding four weeks later.\nAs the deadline approached, Kekedjian went to Manhattan for a meeting with Gray, lawyers and advisers. Timothy Sloan, who runs wholesale banking at Wells Fargo, a partner on the deal, listened on speakerphone. Discussions were tense as the buyers sought only specific properties.\n\"They're saying, 'I have the right to kick assets out,' and we're saying, 'No, you don't,'\" said Kekedjian, who by then hadn't slept for two days. When the talks stalled, he pulled out his ringing-bell phone app.\nInterest piqued Early in the morning of April 10, GE agreed to sell about $US23 billion in real estate assets to Blackstone and Wells Fargo. Hours later, GE announced the entire restructuring, giving the stock its biggest jolt in six years. More than 450 inquiries flooded in from prospective buyers, and several bankers even drove to GE Capital's Norwalk offices that day and waited in the lobby to be first for an in-person meeting.\nKekedjian followed up immediately with Hudson to see if he was still interested in the fleet business. Toronto-based Element soon agreed to buy most of the unit for $US6.9 billion.\nThe pace of execution has pushed the GE Capital team to its limits. To reward his lieutenants for toiling on one of the first major deals, Kekedjian promised dinner at Le Bernardin, an acclaimed New York French restaurant, but they were too exhausted to take him up on the offer. Would Le Bernardin do takeout? Kekedjian asked. No, it would not.\n\"As much as on the surface it looks smooth and the announcements look like there's a rhythm to them, there's just a lot of craziness going on,\" said Kekedjian, beside a scale model of the Hubble telescope on his windowsill. \"It's not an easy thing to sell every part of yourself.\"\n﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T14:07:05.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
