October -- the only other meeting on the 2015 calendar -- wasn’t part of the conversation, mainly because there’s no press conference scheduled along with the central bank’s interest-rate decision that day.\nNow that may be changing for some analysts after the recent financial-market turmoil. September may be too soon, and December is problematic in the eyes of some investors because liquidity in financial markets tends to dry up at that time of year. That puts October on the radar screen.\n“We have to look at it more seriously,” said David Keeble, the New York-based head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “You really want to be moving a little bit before December, otherwise your credibility starts to disappear,” said Keeble, who’s still projecting the Fed will boost its target next month for the first time since 2006.\nThe Fed has been signaling for months that it would raise interest rates this year, after holding its target near zero since 2008. The market was buying into that message until global equity markets lost more than $5 trillion of value in less than two weeks on expectations of slowing economic growth.\n“An off-cycle hike in October is a possibility if September is too soon because of market jitters,” said Greg Anderson, Bank of Montreal’s global head of foreign-exchange strategy.\nTraders see a 28 percent probability that the Fed will raise its target next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That probability rises to 34 percent by the end of October, and jumps to 51 percent by the December gathering.\nYellen holds press conferences after every other Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\nSome traders see the lack of an October press conference as a dealbreaker. Yet Yellen has indicated that rate decisions wouldn’t depend on when press conferences are scheduled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:18:37.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
