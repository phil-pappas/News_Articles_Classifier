( National Journal July 9). \nThe first breach was discovered in April. Cyberthieves stole information such as full names, birth dates, home addresses and SSNs. If you were affected by this breach, you should have already received notification. \nWhile investigating the first breach in June, OPM discovered that additional information had been stolen, including the background investigation records of current, former, and prospective federal employees, and their spouses or co-habitants. Notifications for this incident have not yet begun. \nIf your personal information has been exposed, the OPM will send you a letter explaining what information was involved. The government also will inform you about identity-theft protection services that will be made available to you for three years at no cost. \nYou don't have to wait for that letter--here's what you can do now: Check your credit report at annualcreditreport.com. Look for accounts or charges you don't recognize. Thieves may have used your SSN, address, and date of birth to open accounts in your name; Take advantage of the OPM's offer to potentially affected individuals for credit report access, credit monitoring, identity-theft insurance, and recovery services; and Place a fraud alert on your credit reports. With a fraud alert, businesses must verify your identity before providing new credit. An initial fraud alert lasts 90 days and is renewable. \nFor updates about the breach, check opm.gov.
