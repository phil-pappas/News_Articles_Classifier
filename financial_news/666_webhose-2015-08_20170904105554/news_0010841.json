That was in line with the industry group the American Petroleum Institute's late-Tuesday report. \nAnalysts had expected an increase of 1 million barrels. \nIn other financial markets, a rebound on Wall Street helped soothe investors' tattered nerves, while the dollar rallied as risk aversion eased. \nData released on Wednesday showed U.S. non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft increased 2.2 percent in July, the biggest rise since June last year and handily beating expectations. \n(Reporting by Meeyoung Cho; Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T06:31:48.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
