But they do not care what number USDZAR is in itself. Hence, speed of adjustment and volatility is more important to them,\" he said. \nHe said it is unlikely that the Sarb would intervene with orderly markets during normal hours, as they are still nursing wounds from their 2001/2 experience of intervention, \"which left deep institutional scars within the Sarb and a real risk aversion against intervention to anything but the most exceptional circumstances\". \nOn the Sarb's statement on market intervention, Montalto said it is not new policy. He sees the comments more as a position statement than verbal intervention. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T03:25:04.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
