The award of the contract was rife with irregularities, prosecutors said.\nVantage Drilling did not answer calls for comment by Reuters to its executive office in Houston. Representatives of TMT could not be reached.\nVantage Drilling's CEO said on July 2, when Zelada was arrested and prosecutors first mentioned the company, that they had no evidence substantiating allegations of improper activity in connection with the awarding of the Titanium Explorer contract.\nZelada's lawyer Eduardo Moraes could not immediately be reached for comment but had said previously that his client's arrest was unnecessary and illegal.\nProsecutors also said international cooperation from authorities in Monaco had helped to uncover accounts held by Zelada amounting to 11.58 million euros ($12.7 million).\nZelada's accounts were still moving funds after he became ensnared in the corruption scandal, known popularly in Brazil as Operation Car Wash, prosecutors said.\nThey said evidence of irregularities in the Titanium Explorer contract included meeting records, e-mail exchanges and foreign bank transfers into and out of Zelada's accounts.\n($1 = 0.9156 euros) (Reporting by Reese Ewing and Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Ken Wills )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T03:58:48.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
