You’re running the best island resort in Australia. Every self-respecting person of means on the east coast has already stayed in your luxuriously large private villas.\nWhat can you do to jolt them into booking in for another weekend? The answer may be as easy as candles and flowers.\nYes, yes, I hear you. “Candles? Flowers? WTF” is the assessment scribbled atop my notebook page.\nI wouldn’t travel across the street for a candle shop and flowers are one of the things that usually inspire fear of forgetting lest the marriage contract be breached.\nSelecting and stripping the flowers, then arranging them proved way more enjoyable than expected. Andrew Burke And yet that was the totally unexpected pitch from qualia, the luxury resort built by winemaker and yachtsman Bob Oatley.\nA 'Weekend of Wonderment'? It looks out to the Whitsundays from its perch above the north shore of Hamilton Island. The invitation to join qualia’s (marketing puffery alert!) “Weekend of Wonderment” promised a “collection of deeper sensory experiences”.\nMost of the program did look pretty good. The headliner was a dinner prepared by Andrew McConnell of Melbourne’s Cumulus and Supernormal, a chef who had just filled two of the top 25 slots on The Australian Financial Review ’s inaugural top 100 restaurants list.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

All in a six-star resort with daytime temperatures in the mid-20s as winter took hold down south.\nSo how was it?\nThe first appointment on the dauntingly full schedule was a champagne meet and greet on board a luxury cruiser motoring north. The destination was a mud flat in Gulnare Inlet on Whitsunday Island, reached via a mid-sea rendezvous with burly “crab man” Matt Vickers, a marine biologist who now earns most of his crust hauling mud crabs from the north Queensland shallows.\nVickers was as knowledgeable as you’d expect and the 40 minutes spent manhandling crab pots into his tin runabout was an education. Who knew that to test how ready a crab is for eating you have to squeeze its underside shell – the harder it is, the better.\nIt was, I’d soon learn, indicative of the “experiences” qualia was offering on this weekend – new, tactile, informative and fun.\nWarm glows Back on the cruiser, as Vickers took a second group crabbing, the relative merits of the Johnnie Walker scotch range were explained. This, too, was better than I expected, not least because the scotch megabrand’s “ambassador” – flown in specially for the job – was blessed with a storytelling ability almost as smooth as the Blue Label blend we worked our way up to.\nI’d like to say I remembered his lesson in how to make an old-fashioned, but I can’t. We arrived back at Hamilton; the sun was blazing into the sea, and the travelling party was also feeling a warm glow.\nBy the time dinner was served in a marquee on the helipad, our 25-strong group of paying guests, hosted media and talent (all sat down that first night – chefs, florists, candle makers and their partners) was well acquainted.\nFor this camaraderie, I credit the schedule. Load a boat with guests, the off-duty talent and Hamilton Island top brass such as CEO and former Olympic yachtsman Glenn Bourke, take it out for two hours, ply us with fine scotch and French champagne and – hey presto – everyone’s getting on famously.\nSo it was little surprise that Friday’s dinner, prepared by qualia chef Alastair Waddell, was well received. Seafood canapes set the tone before mains of gold band snapper with pine mushroom and bone marrow, grilled marron with beach plants and bisque cream, and a mouth-watering shiro kin wagyu sirloin. All washed down with members of the Robert Oatley 2013 Signature Series, including sauvignon blanc, chardonnay and cabernet sauvignon.\nFloral fears As dinner broke up I was interested to hear I wasn’t the only one with doubts about the morning’s appointments with wax and petals. “So there’s a go-cart track on the island, lads, maybe we should head there while the ladies look after the candles and flowers,” suggested one man to general guffaws.\nAt 9.45am on Saturday, all the men sat quietly in the library. At the front of the room, Elise Balzac, the French-Australian founder of fast-growing soy candle business Maison Balzac, introduced herself and her craft.\nCandle making, she explained, is all about the scent. And candle makers can create just about any scent if they work hard enough. At this point I was again taken into new territory when asked to name my favourite, most evocative smells. It was, I realised, the first time I could ever recall even thinking about this, let alone being asked. The question did what it was supposed to, evoke places and situations associated with smell. For me it was cardamom tea, so redolent of the bazaars and teahouses of Iran where I’ve spent so much time.\nThe manufacturing process was, as Balzac put it, “not at all interesting”, simply pouring hot, rose-scented wax into a ceramic jar and standing the wick as straight as possible. But as a “sensory experience” it delivered.\nAll of which set us up nicely for 90 minutes’ arranging flowers with Dr Lisa Cooper of Dr Cooper’s Studio at Sydney’s Carriageworks. Cooper is a hot, if somewhat controversial, property in the flower world right now, thanks to her outspoken beliefs on how florists are trained, and the story of how she found her way into floral art proved an emotional introduction. But it was the hands-on craft of selecting and stripping the flowers, then arranging them, that proved way more enjoyable than I’d expected. All the “blokes” got into it in ways they, like me, probably didn’t expect.\nMud crabs and nettles at Pebble Beach By the time we sat down to a gala dinner on the Saturday night in the resort’s seaside Pebble Beach restaurant, I was wondering exactly what chef McConnell and his henchmen were going to do with nine Popeye-sized mud crabs.\nIt didn’t take long to find out. First up, they were in the canapes (devilled on a bed of cos lettuce with fennel seed, chilli, Espelette pepper and a fried curry leaf), then a seaweed cracker with sorrel and avocado, and later with a risotto of rice venere and nettles.\nNon-crab selections included burrata with an heirloom tomato salad, shiro kin wagyu sirloin with pepper sauce and slow-roasted onions, finished off with a soft meringue with sheep’s milk yoghurt and an apple and shiso granita.\nIn the end, I decided, the “wonderment” wasn’t so much about the flowers and candles specifically. Nor the scotch, crabs or even chef McConnell’s delicious bespoke meal. And no, I won’t be seeking out candle shops or arranging flowers in my spare time.\nThe real sense of wonder came in being dragged out of daily life’s comfort zone to mix with interesting people in one of the most comfortable destinations around.\nQualia holds two Weekends of Wonderment a year, with a maximum of 21 guests per event. Dates for the next weekend are being finalised. Prices: from $2110 per person for two nights, and $2530 for three nights, in a qualia Leeward Pavilion. Guests must be 16 or older. qualia.com.au\nAndrew Burke is AFR Weekend’s deputy editor and previously worked on more than 20 books as a Lonely Planet author and photographer, including guides to Iran, Laos, Burma, West Africa and Papua New Guinea, all without ever arranging flowers or making candles.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@andrewburke2", "http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/fine-art-blooms-at-carriageworks-for-lisa-cooper-20150615-ghnz0p.html", "http://www.qualia.com.au/"], "published": "2015-08-02T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:37:32.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
