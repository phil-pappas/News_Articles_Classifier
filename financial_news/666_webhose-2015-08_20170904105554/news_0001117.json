Starbucks Is Brewing up a Bounce for Its Shares After a Pullback \nThere are many reasons why costs are much lower in Central America. There are two more subtle ones. \nThe first has to do with health care. Quality health care services provided by dentists, doctors and hospitals cost less in Central America. For example, an expat in Panama told me her husband needed dental work that would cost $3,000 to $5,000 in the U.S. He got it done in Panama for $1,200. \nIn addition to paying less for health care, our expats reported that they needed less health care in the first place. Here are some of the reasons why: Time after time, we heard from expats who reported that, after moving overseas, they lost weight. Some lost a lot. Many others reported no longer needing medication for high blood pressure. Why? They ate better because of the abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables. In most places, there is less fast food and processed foods. Many expats walk more often than they did before, as opposed to taking a car. They tended to make better food choices because they were less stressed, hurried or emotional about eating. They had significantly less of the bad type of stress, which has been linked to heart disease (including high blood pressure), asthma, obesity and diabetes. One frequently cited reason for the lower level of stress experienced by our expats was the overall lower cost of living (see above), which created a virtuous cycle of less stress in general, leading to better health, leading to lower costs. Because of the lower cost of living, some of our expats were able to quit work, which removed an entire layer of stress, not only about the job directly, but also about related items, such as driving in rush hour traffic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T18:19:06.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
