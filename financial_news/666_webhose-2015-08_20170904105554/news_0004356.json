Only after the comments are received that the government will take a view,\" he said. \nMinister of State for Finance Jayant Sinha also told reporters here on last week that the government will consult the RBI before taking a decision on the formation of the monetary policy committee. \nJaitley, in his February budget, had announced a monetary policy committee pact earlier with the RBI that will reduce the governor's power to act alone. \nHowever in May, Jaitley backtracked, withdrawing from the Finance Bill the clauses pertaining to setting up of a public debt management agency (PDMA) and the amendments to the RBI Act that would have taken away its powers to regulate government securities. \nThe United Forum of Reserve Bank Officers Employees had earlier written to MPs and various chief ministers that the changes, if implemented, would cripple the functions of the central bank. It said the proposed changes would curtail the authority of the RBI and render it totally ineffective in discharging its responsibilities on monetary policy, financial stability and targeting inflation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T17:51:51.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
