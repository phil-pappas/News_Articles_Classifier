Should you only return to the markets on St Leger Day (which, as racing fanatics will know, is in early September each year)? \nNo, clearly not that's a load of superstitious bunkum, akin to crossing your fingers and rubbing your rabbit's foot as you bet on a sixfold accumulator. Quite aside from the fact that it's basically a coin toss on whether the markets will make or lose money in the summer, the transaction costs involved in liquidating your entire portfolio and then reinvesting the money every year would be astronomical. \nThat being said, anyone who did it this year would be laughing now. The FTSE 100 is officially in correction territory having fallen more than 10pc since its last peak of nearly 7,104 on April 27 yes, just four days before the beginning of May. And there's over three weeks to go until the St Leger Stakes runs at Doncaster on September 12. \nBut the general malaise hides a more nuanced picture. Take a look at the worst performing five stocks in the FTSE 100 this year. They are Aberdeen Asset Management (-22pc), Weir Group (-26pc), Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (also -26pc), Anglo American (-37pc) and poor, old Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (-45pc). What's the common theme here? China . \nFears about a slowdown, or even a crash, in the world's second largest economy have weighed heavily on the Asia stock markets in which Aberdeen invests and hurt the prices of the commodities that Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) produce. Only Weir Group, the industrial pump maker, stands out from the laggards. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) supplies the oil and gas market and has therefore been hit by the slump in the price of crude. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) look at the winners. They are Direct Line (Other OTC: DIISD - news ) (up 31pc), Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) (37pc), Persimmon (43pc), Mondi (49pc) and, top of the pops, Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) (55pc). It will not have escaped your notice that three of the five are UK house builders. So, on the one hand there are the stocks that have benefited from the uptick in the UK economy (and the housing market in particular); on the other are those stocks that are more exposed to the vagaries of the global economy and worries about China in particular. \nThis dichotomy is reinforced lower down the scale of market capitalisation. The FTSE 100 is down 3pc for the whole year to date but the FTSE All Share is up 2pc. The average UK fund manager is also in positive territory, up over 6pc, according to Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) . That is because they are overweight midcap stocks which tend to be more exposed to the UK economy than blue chips. The question now is: what next? The consensus view appears to be that the slowdown in China could get worse before it gets better. \nThat being the case, it remains to be seen how much of a drag a further slowdown in the global economy exerts on the UK markets. The silver lining of this scenario is that it might further delay a rise in interest rates, which, all other things being equal, should be a positive for equities in general and those of housebuilders and construction companies in particular. \nOn the flip side, if pessimism about China has been overdone ( as our own Ambrose Evans-Pritchard believes ), then the miners could come bouncing back, which would, relatively, hurt those managers that remain underweight in the sector. Active fund managers often come in for a fair amount of stick comparisons to monkeys throwing darts are not unknown. In aggregate they often fail to outperform the market, especially when fees are taken into account. But, fair's fair, they've proved their worth so far this year. They will have their work cut out navigating the months ahead. \n= Just when you thought it was safe to get back in the Aegean …. = \nThursday was the first official day of Greece's new bail-out. So, naturally, Alexis Tsipras called snap elections , raising the prospect that Greece may add to its tally of five prime ministers in six years. \nTrue, this had been on the cards since its parliament voted for the fresh bail-out deal but most Syriza MPs rebelled. But it was hoped that Tsipras's popularity would help him ride this out. His resignation highlights the extent of the schism and ramps up uncertainty just as everything had started to calm down. \nOn the most prosaic level it raises questions about whether Greece will be able to meet its strict timetable of reforms while it is, effectively, leaderless for a month. The eurozone creditors are due to hold their first review of the programme in October. The long hoped for debt relief could hinge on their findings but past experience suggests little will get done from a legislative perspective in Greece while an election campaign is running. \nThen there's the outcome. Tsipras's approval rating has been miraculously undented by his numerous about-turns; Syriza is still the most popular party in Greece. \nBut it is unclear what Syriza will look like come the election if members of the Left Platform, who voted against the bail-out deal, split from their leader. \nBeyond the election, whoever wins power will be responsible for implementing a series of reforms that the Economist Intelligence Unit says will \"exceed anything visited upon even the post-communist states of eastern Europe\". \nThe majority of Greeks still want to stay in the eurozone. That resolve will be repeatedly tested in the years ahead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T03:29:00.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
