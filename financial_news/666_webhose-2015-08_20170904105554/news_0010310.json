The eight include three of the firm's most senior executives who sit on the executive committee that manages the company. \nCaixin called the eight on their mobile phones but no one answered. Citic Securities said on August 26 it had not received any notice regarding the detentions. \nOne of the executive committee members is Xu Gang, a managing director of Citic Securities who oversaw the firm's brokerage business until he was recently transferred. He joined Citic Securities in 1998 and worked in managerial positions in various departments. \nXu is credited with playing a leading role in the establishment of Citic Securities' well-known research department, where he remains in charge. Under his management, Citic Securities ranked ahead of all other Chinese securities firms for many years in terms of the value of stock transactions it brokered. \nHe was last seen having lunch at the company's office building on August 25, Citic Securities employees said. \nCitic Securities transferred Xu to its IT department on August 18. Liu Jun, who oversaw the firm's asset management department, now heads its brokerage services. The appointments were announced to the firm's employees only. \nThe other two executive committee members facing investigation are Ge Xiaobo, who manages risk control and alternative investment, and Liu Wei, who oversees businesses including fixed-income investment. \n\"Liu is very well known in the bond market\" and the department he manages makes more money than all others in the company, an employee of Citic Securities who declined to be named said. \nAll three people own shares of Citic Securities and each had salaries of more than 5 million yuan last year, the firm's public records show. \nCitic Securities is partly held by the state-owned financial powerhouse Citic Group. It is reportedly close to inking a US$ 1.8 billion deal to buy Russell Investments , a global asset management firm that focuses on the U.S. market, from the London Stock Exchange. \n(Rewritten by Wang Yuqian) Eight Employees of Brokerage Firm Reportedly Detained Citic Securities employees held for questioning over possible involvement in illegal investment activities, state media says By staff reporters Yue Yue and Wu Hongyuran SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:36:30.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
