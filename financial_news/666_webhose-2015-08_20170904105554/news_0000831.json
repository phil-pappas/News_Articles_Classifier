Written by: Robert McGarvey 08/06/15 - 3:52 PM EDT More Headlines Should You Panic If You Don't Have Chip And PIN Credit Cards? \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — $5 billion. That is the value of four year-old payments innovator Stripe which, in a recent venture round, won funding from among others American Express , Visa, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, a roll-call of votes that matter in payments. If your dream is to make a fortune selling on the Internet, be it online or mobile, you want to know about Stripe . And probably about PayPal - its Braintree subsidiary at least. That is because they are in essentially the same business - facilitating payments at online and mobile merchants. They are how to ring your digital cash register with real money. And for consumers, both Stripe and PayPal loom as comparatively trusted ways to shop at small merchants that may seem iffy if only because of their smallness. Even though they are a lot alike, probably you want to know first about Stripe, because buzz about it is the loudest even though it is a diminutive company with some 276 employees in what the company calls an old trunk factory in San Francisco’s Mission District. It also says it processes “billions of dollars” a year in payments, but it is stingy with details, other than noting that Twitter, Salesforce, Lyft, and several more hot companies use Stripe. PayPal , by contrast, has around 13,000 employees, and it has offices in San Jose, Luxembourg, Singapore, Nebraska, Arizona, India, Texas, and a lot more places. Its market cap is around $50 billion, now that it is a separate company from eBay. But tiny Stripe looms as this space’s diminutive X factor. What exactly is up? Call this a tale of three problems. The first is that the world is filled with would-be online merchants who bump into a cold reality: it just is not easy to gain acceptance as a Visa or MasterCard merchant. Not when you are tiny, have no track record and also have no bank account balance. The other is that it has not always been easy for small vendors to insert code into their websites that let them take payments. You would think this simple. It is theoretically cut and paste, but nothing is simple when existing code interacts with new code and often the result is a mess. The third is that shopping cart abandonment -- would-be buyers who take a hike before tapping “pay now” -- is through the roof when it comes to mobile commerce. People are searching for goods on mobile; they just aren’t buying. And most experts believe the hold up is the friction involved in transacting on a small screen.
