Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The National Reform Summit in Sydney this week might have been a cri de coeur from those in the Australian community who have become increasingly alarmed and despondent about the deteriorating quality of our national political debate.\nBut the extensive consensus that the summit revealed this week might have surprised many of those who had hoped it would give new impetus to the old mantras about the need for hardline industrial relations and tax reform.\nIt's not that industrial relations or tax weren't part of the discussion. It was just that the whole tone of the consensus reached by business groups, the trade unions and welfare representatives was so utterly different, so utterly reasonable compared to much of our recent and bitterly divided national discussion.\nTone might sound like nothing more than an atmospherics.\nBut the message from this summit – and all the work behind the scenes leading up to it to develop a consensus position – was a profound pointer to the way the 2014 budget, and even Tony Abbott's particularly aggressive style of politics, seems to have actually produced a counter movement in policy discussion in the rest of the community, whether or not the pollies recognise this yet.\nConsider how the adversarial nature of our parliamentary politics fed into the way peak business groups operated in the former Parliament.\nThe Business Council of Australia was seen as utterly hostile to the government, its then president Tony Shepherd a clearly declared Coalition ally. But perhaps more importantly, its agenda was classic business rent-seeking: government spending must be cut to fund a cut in the company tax rate.\nRecognition By Wednesday, there was a recognition that both sides of the budget balance sheet had to be addressed and that lowest-income households had to protected.\nThe ACTU was equally hostile to the Coalition and ready to take pot shots at stakeholder groups aligned with the Coalition.\nThen consider what unfolded at the summit. Left to work out among themselves what they believed to be important, the interest groups actually sought to give each other room to manouevre. Language that might be inflammatory for each other's constituencies was removed or avoided.\nIt was as if there was a general recognition that all the previous adversity had achieved very little.\nCritics would say the result was a little bland. But this misses the fact that – politicians aside – there is general agreement among our most influential stakeholders on the need to address both the spending and tax sides of the budget and that the retirement incomes system needs a massive overhaul.\nEven areas regarded as too contentious before the meeting were tackled in the final statement, notably climate change. \"Unconstrained climate change would have serious environmental, economic and social impacts on Australia,\" the statement said.\n\"The challenge that climate change represents and the opportunities it presents for new industries and jobs\" would be an additional area that would be discussed in future.\nImportant productivity issue Surprising issues came to the surface. The importance of affordable housing close to workplaces was identified as an important productivity issue.\nThere was a lot of talk about young people, and research and development.\nPerhaps most significantly, there were some signs that our debate is entering new realms.\nFor starters, not every discussion started with \"the government ought to do something\". There was a recognition that a lot of issues are now out there for the communities to work out for themselves.\nMeanwhile, while the government is still wrestling with its transition from \"budget emergency\" to \"not really doing much on the budget\" and \"gee the economy keeps being weak\", there is pragmatic refocusing by stakeholders on the budget task at hand.\nYes, the need to address the problem is urgent, was the message. But equally, the fact it might take a long time to do it, and that there therefore needs to be a well-sequenced series of inter-related changes and trade-offs, was also recognised.\nTax reform should not just be about tax \"relief\" or lower taxes but about an efficient and equitable tax system.\nMaking small changes Spending changes should also be about improving \"equity, effectiveness, access, and efficiency of services\", not just drastically cutting spending, \"making small changes that grow over time, and targeting the highest-growing programs per capita going forwards\".\nThere were even attempts to find – or remind – politicians of the vehicles they can use to clarify and explain their actions, like regular reform statements, and the use of \"rigorous quantitative analysis of the efficiency and distributional impacts\" of tax changes, so that the public can confidently understand the implications of proposed changes.\nThe summit has given political leaders important space to consider retirement incomes, the broader tax agenda, the budget and the importance of boosting national productivity.\nWhether they identify that gift is yet to be seen. But the summit has created a new era of consensus and relationships between some of our most powerful voices, and they plan to keep talking.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:05:39.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
