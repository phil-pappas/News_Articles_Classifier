PUBLISHED: 17:24, Fri, Jul 31, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:34, Fri, Jul 31, 2015 GETTY Are you owed money by the Student Loan Company? \nAlmost 80,000 borrowers were left out of pocket by an average of £850 last year, showed a Freedom of Information (FoI) request made to the Student Loans Company (SLC) by accountancy firm Baker Tilly. The £45.4million in overpayments reaped by the loan company was a 10 per cent rise on the year prior. Experts said that system used by the loan company is out of date and people who overpay face too many hurdles and delays in getting money back. Repayments are collected through the UK tax system from borrowers who are in the country, but SLC only receives information about what customers have repaid once a year after it is passed on by HMRC. The time lag means thousands of people nearing the end of their repayments end up overpaying.Those trying to get a refund are then usually required to send the SLC copies of their payslips or P60 before cash is given back.

These double standards mean some borrowers have to jump through numerous hoops or face a lengthy wait to receive their refund.\"Ms Fidler add that it was time for the SLC and HMRC to \"bring the current antiquated and inefficient system into the 21st century\".Graduates who are within two years of repaying their loan have been urged to switch to direct debit payments and monitor theiraccount through the SLC website to avoid overpaying.A spokesperson for SLC said: \"When the Student Loans Company receives notification of repayments from HMRC and this shows that the customer has paid too much, we write to the customer to advise and to arrange a refund of the over-repaid amount plus interest. \"Should a customer advise SLC that they have overpaid before the notification from HMRC has been received, we ask them to send us evidence showing their repayment deductions. \"We then contact HMRC to request that the employer be informed to cease deductions and a refund of the over-repaid amount plus interest will be made.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:18:23.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
