It was a do or die situation; a matter of life and debt. It still is. \nThis is how I looked at that picture, not because I want to, but because that is what is. The increase in people who are selling almost anything to each other on the streets is not about overpopulation, or lack of goods in the shops. It is because that is the only way people can make a living. \nNo option \nEven if you were lucky to get two hectares from the land reform programme, the main buyer- the Grain Marketing Board -has warned you to surrender your grain at your own risk because it is broke. \nIf you have the grain to sell you are lucky, because that means the gods saved you from the drought. If you have some, the maize will still will not pay for your hospital bills, so you have to sell it on the streets in exchange for cash. \nYou cannot even boast about the job you got through your uncle, who bribed the Human Resources manager of a security company, because you have not been paid for the last six months, and you are not sure whether to call yourself a worker or a volunteer. \nSo if you are to pay this month's rent, you have to sell airtime vouchers that people will buy like hot cakes even as they are complaining that the service providers are fleecing them. \nThe high turnover of those vouchers, with a 10 cents profit each, will ensure that by the end of the day you can buy that necessary litre of paraffin; if you are to have any supper that night. It is not subject to debate, it is cast in stone that vending will see you through the day and probably the year. \nWhat we have been reduced to \nThe constant reminders through the news or social media messages that vendors said 'we will not go', are just a reminder of how we have run out of options. It is not because we do not like the available options: there are no options. \nIf someone calls themselves a graduate vendor, it is a confession that they have decided to turn to the only option there is. Not so long ago Zimbabweans held mass stay-aways from formal employment in order to make a statement on what they were unhappy about. \nThis was because a good number of them were still employed. They demanded for jobs because there could see the potential of companies growing and even new ones being established. This is not the case in 2015. \nThe only possible way \nThe way that each Zimbabwean is willing to fight for the his/her one square metre space on the street is similar to the way anyone would battle for their life. Vending has become the only possible way for most to make a living. \nNot even the length of day can accommodate the need for people to be on the streets advertising their different goods. That is why even as early as 5 am and as late as 11pm someone is on the street, hoping that a passer-by will part with a few coins to buy a tin of baked beans or an overflowing cup of dried Kapenta fish. \nOne can sell food because people need to eat, one can sell clothes because people need to be clothed, one can sell soap because people need to bath. Even if one fails to sell anything, one complain about poverty with dignity because there is still proof they are trying to do something about their situation. \nWe need solutions not ultimatums \nInstead of giving people ultimatums the government should be working towards solution based alternatives. Chasing people off the streets is not going to take away the need for food or the need for a decent livelihood. \nDictating fees for vending spaces is not going to make the money miraculously available. Instead, provide spaces big enough to for all in need of the space, provide ablution facilities to ensure a disease-free operating space. Provide spaces with security for storage of goods overnight. Provide lighting that is needed for the night. Manage the allocated spaces like responsible authorities, and not like greedy land barons. \nThis is the immediate possible solution to the issue of poverty right now. Re-opening closed mines and factories will only take years because too much trust has been lost. It will take years to restore investor confidence in potential business people if we intend to restore it. \nBut, in order to survive until that day when Zimbabwe will become an economy again, people need something to hold on to. Vending is all they have so handle it with care, people's lives are at stake. \nWaza is proud to feature as part of its content local bloggers who have a knack for expressing their unique perspectives, independent thoughts and engaging stories.
