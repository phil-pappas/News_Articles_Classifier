The company has been co-developing next-generation lithium-ion batteries with Germany's Robert Bosch GmbH and Mitsubishi Corp since they established a joint venture last year.\nElsewhere, individual company news steered investor activity.\nOlympus Corp dropped 2.7 percent after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned that medical device makers had skirted a host of requirements linked to 'superbug' infections.\nViolations range from not properly evaluating cleaning, sterilization and testing procedures to failure to report infections and other problems, FDA said in warning letters to companies. Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Pentax Medical, a unit of Hoya Corp were also cited for violations in their marketing applications for the devices, known as duodenoscopes.\nFujifilm shed 0.7 percent while Hoya declined 1.7 percent.\nDon Quijote fell 4 percent after its lower-than-expected operating profit for the year ending June 2016 disappointed investors.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.2 percent to 1,677.02 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 advanced 0.2 percent to 15,106.87.\n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T05:25:19.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
