Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle Labor says it will abolish the central plank of the Coalition's climate change policy – the emissions reduction fund – saying it will save over $4.3 billion, in a move reflecting increasing opposition confidence that it can win the carbon debate after this week's announcement on an emissions reduction target.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten says an incoming Labor government would honour all existing contracts under the scheme but \"end the wasteful spending\".\nThe emissions reduction fund is the major plank in the Coalition's climate change policy. It announced this week it would be able to cut emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 using the ERF plus a variety of other policy tools.\nHowever, it is yet to release details of these.\nMr Shorten made his comments as he said he believed there was a \"shift in the national mood\" underway on climate change.\n'Action on climate change' \"More and more Australians are choosing to reject the empty politics of fear and the great big old scare campaigns on everything\", he said. \"Australians are demanding, again, action on climate change\".\nMr Shorten said that in hard economic times, Australian can't afford to \"waste taxpayer money on a plan that won't work\".\n Labor \"will not continue to subsidise windfalls for companies that are acting [to address climate change]\".\nMr Shorten said that \"based on the remaining uncommitted funding allocated in the 2014 Budget, and the additional $2.4 billion announced this week\", abolishing the program \"represented a saving of $4.3 billion\".\nEnvironment Minister Greg Hunt said this week the government had allocated approximately $200 million a year for the Emissions Reduction Fund or \"$2.4 billion over the 12 years from 2018 to 2030\".\n\"It's not cost-free but it is radically less than a massive electricity and gas tax\", Mr Hunt said.\nBut Mr Shorten said renewable energy was the centrepiece of a \"better, cheaper, faster and more efficient way for Australia to tackle climate change\".", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-13T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T21:38:29.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
