It is also a driving force for illegal chainsaw milling. The conservative estimated volume of wood exported annually across the northern borders of Ghana alone is 250,000m 3 – mainly illegal chainsaw lumber – which is equivalent to some 825,083m 3 of round logs. At least 130,000m 3 of overland lumber exports comes from the major timber markets alone.\nThis implies that some 120,000m 3 of lumber may be exported overland directly from production sites and from minor timber markets. \nThe main markets for these overland exports are Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. The latter two countries provide the major market for Ghana’s timber and wood products. Nigeria’s importation of mainly plywood and lumber from 2005 to 2012 has averaged an annual volume of 78,000 m 3 valued at over Euros 24.04 million. \nThese exports go through approved exit points at the borders, particularly at Aflao on the south eastern corridor as well as Paga, Hamile and Tumu all on the northern frontier of the country. \nThe study pointed out that the main trade of lumber occurs at recognized timber markets, mainly Techiman and Kumasi-Sokoban, as well as direct procurement from producers at loading sites closer to production areas. \nThe study revealed that about 62% of the volume of timber traded in these two major markets – mainly illegal chainsaw lumber – was exported overland mainly to Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali. About 54% of the lumber exported overland from these two markets was transported to Burkina Faso accounting for 54% of trade (estimated 46,031m 3 of lumber end up on Ouagadougou markets). \nIn the context of VPA implementation, the overland export trade presents a challenge, in terms of how chainsaw lumber transported across the border can come under a legality regime. \nThere is the need to test how the wood tracking system developed under the VPA can help track such timber and help control the illegal trade, the study recommended. \nMoreover, the institutional arrangements and governance of overland timber trade needs a complete review – in particular, how to improve documentation and data capture of the trade, both from timber markets and at national borders, institute a collaborative system that guarantees effective coordination among agencies and to improve transparency at the borders are crucial. \nIn conclusion, the study says national stakeholder meeting and a dedicated multi-stakeholder team should work out institutional reforms towards these goals are urgent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:53:23.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
