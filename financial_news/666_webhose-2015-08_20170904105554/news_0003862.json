More Boardroom trades, August 7 \nShares in the popular trust, which had been trading at a premium of more than 15 per cent, fell 3.2 per cent on the news. \nPatient Capital’s initial public offering was the biggest on record for a UK-based listed fund, with investors drawn in by Mr Woodford’s long record of generating strong returns — most of it at Invesco Perpetual, where he worked until setting up his own asset manager last year. \nUnlike his other fund, Woodford Equity Income, Patient Capital emphasises early-stage and early-growth companies, while also holding some blue-chips. It targets 10 per cent annual returns and is aimed at investors with long-term horizons. \nIn net asset value terms, the trust returned 3.1 per cent between its launch and June 30, and a further 1.7 per cent since. \nMore than 75 per cent of the trust’s capital has now been deployed. Its top 10 holdings focus on pharmaceuticals, including four biotech companies; US-based Prothena , which develops immune therapies, is the largest holding, making up 4.5 per cent of the trust. Twelve of its holdings are unquoted. \nIt also holds big listed companies such as AstraZeneca , GlaxoSmithKline , Legal & General and Rolls-Royce . \n“Although it is very early days, we are pleased that the company’s net asset value has moved forward modestly. Much of the positive performance to date has been delivered by holdings we would classify as early-stage,” said Mr Woodford. \n“Indeed, our blue-chip holdings have typically detracted from performance thus far, with GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca in particular showing short-term share price weakness.” \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Investors are already sitting on a 15 per cent profit, but so far this has largely been driven by the popularity of the trust itself, rather than a result of hard yards gained by the underlying companies.” \nAnalysts at Numis Securities said they rated Woodford highly and thought the fund’s mandate “interesting”, but added: “We have been wary of the excessive premium, and believe there is potential for this to reduce over time, especially given the implementation of a tap issuance programme.” \nMr Woodford has a loyal following among retail investors, but advisers have warned this fund is much higher-risk than his other product. \nIt has won praise for its innovative fee structure, in which the management is paid solely through a performance fee — paid in shares — which consists of 20 per cent of net asset value returns above 10 per cent a year. \nGervais Williams, a well-known small-cap manager, also launched a fund focusing on early-stage companies in April. The £54m Miton UK MicroCap Trust is trading at a premium of 2.8 per cent. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
