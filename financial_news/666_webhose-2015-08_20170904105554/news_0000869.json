Some of that can be tackled through education. \n\"In South Africa, there are 80,000 jobs available, but there aren't people with the skills to fill those jobs,\" Adesina told The Africa Report on the campaign trail in May. \nThese priorities are not idle wish lists, either. With an estimated 370 million young people entering the job market over the next 15 years, governments will need to work quickly to prevent demographic growth turning into political unrest. \nThis problem is particularly acute in the cities. \"We have islands of prosperity in oceans of poverty,\" says Adesina. \nHis solution is a greater focus on social housing, mortgage finance and mass transit to give those on the fringes better access to public goods. \nThis should, in turn, create large and stable reservoirs of labour for Africa's industrialisation. That is, of course, assuming that Africa industrialises. \nWhile established companies are expanding, new businesses are rarely able to make the jump up the value chain. \"Eighty-five per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises who want finance can't get it,\" says Frannie Leautier, head of the Mkoba Private Equity Fund. \nThis creates a narrow corporate ecosystem unlikely to create the innovative and fast-growing companies that might spearhead a new wave of industrial growth. \nAdesina points to de-industrialisation in parts of the continent: \"We need proper planning. But we also need to link the private sector to those industrialisation goals.\" \nParting gift \nOn the sidelines of the annual meetings held in Abidjan, Kaberuka told Chinese media that \"the global manufacturing cycle started from Europe then [went] to America before moving to South-east Asia and China. It is now coming to Africa.\" \nAnd so, with transport and energy remaining the two greatest barriers to this becoming reality, Kaberuka's parting gift to the AfDB before he leaves on 1 September is the Africa50Fund, a way of harnessing Africa's own resources to de-risk infrastructure finance. \nReaching financial close in June, with 17 African countries already signed up to the tune of $750m, the fund will hire private-sector managers and use sovereign African reserves to catalyse the big infrastructure projects that change the dial for manufacturers - large power plants, rail networks and modern ports. \n\"And part of that is an innovative project developer built into the fund that can take the early-stage risk\", says Tas Anvaripour, the chief executive of the Africa50Fund. \nWhile claiming not to be a \"legacy person\", Kaberuka was still keen to hammer out some priorities: \"You can be a landlocked country. But a kid without communications is mentally landlocked, and that's a real problem.\" \nAnd the fact that the AfDB has become Africa's lead negotiator on things like climate change, the fight against Ebola and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals - the global architecture that replaces the Millennium Development Goals - speaks volumes for the journey the Bank has taken over the past decade. \n\"But there mustn't be any misunderstanding,\" quips Kaberuka. \"Adesina has his own shoes, and they fit very well.\" Ethiopia \nThe Ethiopian federal high court fourth criminal bench today sentenced eighteen Ethiopian Muslims including four members … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Ethiopian Herald.
