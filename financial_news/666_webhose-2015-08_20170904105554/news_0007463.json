The average size of a fund being fully cashed in by Royal London customers was slightly lower at £14,100. Based on these figures the initial tax charge would be £3,347, because the cash lump sum would be subject to emergency tax on payment. \nAnna Bowes, director of rate monitoring website Savings Champion, said she is seeing an increasing number of people cashing in their pension pots. “People understand cash better than pensions and investments and want the security of being able to access the money when they like without restrictions,” she said. \nOthers cite the emotional pull of cash. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “People like the idea of taking cash from their pension funds without necessarily thinking about what they will do with the money. \n“The smaller the pension pot the more likely it is that the saver will take all their cash in one go. This is because the level of income you can generate from a pot of this size is very small.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T04:12:31.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
