The truth is that companies at best delay shareholders paying tax on income at their marginal rates of tax, and in fact disadvantage shareholders when it comes to capital gains tax.\nTo make sure that shareholders can not withdraw profits from a company, and avoid having the amounts withdrawn counted as income and pay tax at their marginal rate of tax, Division7A of the Income Tax Assessment Act was introduced.\nQ. I was reading your article Maximising payments made to a company owner and found it very interesting and helpful. I still am however unsure which way is the most preferable to pay less tax. I am trying to bring my books up to date and I have been withdrawing amounts over the last three years. Can you please advise more details on how to treat shareholders withdrawing money as a formal loan agreement?\nA. One of the many ways that small businesses get into financial difficulties is when the owners do not calculate how much income they need to fund their required lifestyle, and then take a salary for the required amount. When cash is taken to fund a lifestyle the resulting tax bill can cause cash flow problems for the business.\nFrom your question it would appear that you have regularly withdrawn amounts from the company and therefore have built up a shareholders loan account. If a formal Division 7A loan agreement is not drawn up, with the required repayments being made, the amounts withdrawn could be regarded as unfranked dividends on which you will pay tax at the relevant marginal tax rate.\nThe first part of drawing up a Division 7A loan is to decide whether you can secure the loan, by a mortgage over a property, or whether it will be unsecured. Shareholders loans that are unsecured must be repaid within seven years, while a secured shareholder loan can be repaid over 25 years.\nIn addition to the minimum and maximum loan repayment periods applying interest must be charged on a shareholder loan at a bench mark interest rate. This rate is decided on by the reserve Bank of Australia and for the 2014/15 financial year was 5.95 per cent.\nUnder the division 7A rules the first repayment of a shareholder's loan must be made by the end of the financial year following the year that the loan was made. For example if you took $20,000 in loans from your company in the 2014 financial year, the first repayment must be made by June 30, 2015.\nLoan repayments can be made either as cash payments by the shareholders back to the company. Alternatively the company can declare a fully franked dividend; equal to the minimum loan repayment required, that is not paid but used to decrease the shareholders loan account.\nLoans taken by shareholders of the company are a complicated area of income tax law and there are a number of strategies that can be used to reduce the income tax impact. Before taking any action you should consult a professional that specialises in this area.\nQuestions on small business income tax and other issues can be emailed to max@taxbiz.com.au\nMax Newham is the founder of www.smsfsurvivalcentre.com.au\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T01:50:57.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
