Joe Skipper by Tess Ingram US Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is better placed to come out of the presidential race on top this time than in her first attempt in 2008, Gene Sperling says.\nMr Sperling, a former director of the White House's National Economic Council who has been advising Ms Clinton during her campaign, said he would bet on her to win the Democratic nomination and the presidency.\n\"When I have seen her over the last several months I have found her very comfortable, calm and in control and it gives me confidence she is a little more rested and ready than in 2007 or 2008,\" he said.\n\"I think she is one of the most qualified candidates. I don't think there's any question. After being secretary of state for four years she runs in 2016 with better qualifications than in 2008. It makes her as qualified as anyone that has run for president in quite a while.\n\"I think if I had to bet I would bet on her but I would also bet it is going to be a rocky and hard and difficult rise. But I think she has the experience â€“ she is used to being a recipient on the rough and tumble of politics.\"\nMr Sperling said on the Republican side there were \"a lot of strong candidates\".\n\"There is no question many are well qualified and I think many of them will turn out to be better candidates than Mitt Romney was,\" he said. \"I think there will be a lot of people who want to see a fresh face and will look at a lot of different folks.\"\nHow Ms Clinton would fare during the road to the election was uncertain, he said.\n \"One theory is they [Republican nominees] will all beat each other up so much Hillary Clinton will be in a much stronger position. Another theory could be they will be battle-tested because they are against her and she has 16 people criticising her every day.\n\"I think it will be very interesting and very competitive. The US is very polarised right now so most presidential races will be very close because a number of people are probably not moveable.\n\"So it comes down to those undecided voters who can rattle the base and that's the interesting part because your strategy for rattling the base may not be the best strategy for the rest of the voters.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:54:38.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
