While he expects further disagreement between Ukraine and its creditors, and maybe even a temporary freeze on payments, he’s betting the two sides will eventually agree on a 15 percent principal writedown in September.\n“There’s still going to be plenty of negative news on the market and potentially the moratorium itself that will give us a better chance to add to our positions,” he said by phone Wednesday.\nUkraine’s Eurobonds slid the most in two months today as renewed signs of discord between the nation and a Franklin Templeton-led creditor group increased the likelihood of default. Renewed turbulence in negotiations is eroding a rally that pushed the nation’s 2017 notes up 9.9 cents last month on optimism a deal was imminent.\nThe country has threatened to announce a moratorium on debt payments before a $500 million bond falls due next month amid a disagreement with bondholders on the principal reduction needed to meet restructuring targets. The committee, which owns $8.9 billion of the nation’s debt, offered a 5 percent haircut last week, while the Finance Ministry was said to be asking for 40 percent in June, according to people familiar with the talks.\n70 Cents Ukraine’s dollar-denominated bond maturing July 2017 fell 0.24 cents to 55.51 cents on the dollar by 11:23 a.m. in Kiev, retreating for a fifth day from the highest level in six months last week. The notes headed for the first weekly decline in seven weeks.\nSyzdykov, who is long Ukraine debt relative to the benchmark bond index, said the most liquid securities will move toward 70 cents on the dollar as an agreement emerges.\nHis prediction of a 15 percent cut to face value compares with a median estimate of 22.5 percent in a Bloomberg survey of 15 economists.\n“The government realizes that a 40 percent haircut is not something they will achieve,” Syzdykov said. “The train has left the station: the major stumbling block of the demand of no haircut has been taken off the table.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T11:59:15.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
