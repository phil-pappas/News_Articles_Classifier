WaterHealth is pursuing an audacious goal of serving about hundred million customers in the underserved communities by 2020,' Vikas added. \nHe said WaterHealth's Reverse Osmosis (RO) system removes all the unwanted contaminants including undesirable chemicals and salt in the water making it sweet and drinkable. \nThe water is then passed through the patented UV Waterworks unit which deactivates all the microbiological contamination present in the raw water. \nThe treated water is finally tested as per WaterHealth Ghana's benchmark standards in the WaterHealth captive laboratory to ensure that the water quality strictly meets or exceeds the World Health Organization and Ghanaian potable water standards. \nWaterHealth Ghana was established in 2007 to provide safe, scalable and affordable drinking water to underserved communities. \nIn the last eight years of its operation, WaterHealth Ghana has successfully operated over 30 WaterHealth Centers across seven regions of the country.
