Victims' families are being offered at least $1 million each. \nThe fund, administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg, finished processing the 4,342 claims it received by the Jan. 31 deadline. Of those, 91 percent were deemed ineligible. \nFund spokeswoman Camille Biros said Tuesday that 298 of the 396 offers made so far have been accepted. Five have been rejected. The fund plans to make two more offers, bringing the total to 398. \nGM recalled 2.6 million small cars last year but acknowledged it knew about the ignition switch problems for more than a decade.
