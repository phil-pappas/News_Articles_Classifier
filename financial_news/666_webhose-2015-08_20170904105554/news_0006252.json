The amount - expected to grow by the time the work is done - represents a fraction of the more than $US600 billion needed to address the nation's water and wastewater needs over the next 20 years. \nThat has left states and local water authorities scrambling to fill the financial void. \nOf the many pipeline proposals in the West, one calls for moving water from four remote valleys in eastern Nevada to Las Vegas to reduce the region's reliance on the Colorado River. Others call for piping water from Lake Powell to southeastern Utah and for taking water from Wyoming across Colorado's Front Range and on to Denver. \nIn New Mexico, officials are desperate to head off the shrinking of the Ogallala aquifer, an underground supply of water that stretches through eight states and is being rapidly depleted along the Texas-New Mexico border. \n\"People are going to have to understand that in the West, that old saying 'whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting' - that's where we are right now,\" said Gayla Brumfield, chairwoman of the Eastern New Mexico Water Utility Authority. \nSome studies show pockets of eastern New Mexico might have less than a decade before wells run dry. Others could have 40 years, but all signs point to demand outpacing supply as surface and groundwater sources dwindle across the West. \nThe pipeline would funnel more than 5.3 billion gallons of water each year from the Ute Reservoir south to Clovis, Portales, Cannon Air Force Base and other small communities. \nIt includes a $US19 million intake system at the reservoir, pump stations and more than 241km of pipe that will serve about 70,000 people. \nThe price for the Ute project has ballooned to more than $US550 million, and the federal Bureau of Reclamation acknowledges it could end up costing $US750 million. \nCritics say the Ute project will do little to solve the region's drinking water woes and has only given way to bigger questions about the benefits and sustainability of high-dollar rural water projects that depend on shrinking rivers, reservoirs and aquifers. \nRed Arndt, chairman of the Lewis and Clark Regional Water System said the Obama administration talks about improving the nation's infrastructure and boosting economic development but hasn't followed through with any meaningful investment. If a business comes to the area, local leaders must ask how much water they're going to use. If it's too much, Arndt said the businesses are told to move on. \n\"They want infrastructure and they want economic growth and what's more important than anything? Water. If you don't have water, you don't have growth of anything,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook CBA's Narev earns $8m in a year AAP \nCommonwealth Bank chief executive Ian Narev's pay has fallen slightly to just under $8 million.
