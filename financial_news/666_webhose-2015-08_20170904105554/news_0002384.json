That would be a 10% increase over a year earlier. There’s also a streak to keep alive: Disney has beaten EPS expectations in each of the last 10 quarters.\nSales: Disney is expected to post revenues of $13.17 billion, up 6% from $12.46 billion a year ago. The company has topped FactSet consensus on revenue in nine of the last 10 quarters. Analysts expect $4.25 billion of Disney’s revenue to come from its parks and resorts, followed by its cable networks at $4.07 billion.\nRead: Why Disneyland deserves 60th birthday wishes\nShare Price: Trading close to $120, shares of Disney are up 28% so far this year, handily beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down 1%. Analysts covering the stock on FactSet have an average price target of $121.92 and an overweight rating. The most bullish analyst has a price target of $150, while the most bearish is at $98.\nOther Issues: Disney has had lots of success at the box office so far this year. The company’s film distributor, Buena Vista, has the second-largest market share among film studios, after Comcast Corp.’s CMCSA, +1.28% Universal’s $1.9 billion. Movies like “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Inside Out” have helped Disney rake in $1.3 billion in box-office receipts.\nOne thing to look for on Tuesday will be any news of another likely Disney hit: “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is set to debut Dec. 18.\n“As expectations begin to ramp from ‘Star Wars’ we look at how to benchmark the film compared to ‘Avatar’ and some of the other recent global blockbusters,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Benjamin Mogil wrote in a recent note. “In aggregate, we believe that the film can gross around $2.2 billion globally.”\nThat could top “Titanic,” now the second-highest grossing movie globally of all time, without accounting for inflation, at $2.18 billion. “Avatar” is the highest-grossing with $2.8 billion.\nOne of the biggest unknowns is when the movie will be released in China, an increasingly important market for film studios, Mogil said. China has increased its screen count 400% since 2009, he said.\nOne headwind for Disney is the foreign-exchange rate in many markets when revenue is converted back into dollars, Mogil said. The stronger U.S. currency means it will take more of the local currency to buy the same amount of dollars.\nAnother issue to watch for is Disney’s plans for ESPN. Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told CNBC last week that the sports channels eventually will move toward becoming a stand-alone streaming service.\n“I think eventually ESPN becomes a business that is sold directly to the consumers,” Iger said.\nAccording to Nielsen data, ESPN has lost 3.2 million subscribers in just over a year. A move to offer direct-to-consumer content would certainly push forward the cord-cutting movement. In a lot of eyes, sports content, including live events, is one of the last tethers holding consumers to pay-TV bundles.\nSelfie sticks and 5 other things banned at Disney theme parks Opinion: ‘Star Wars’ could boost Disney stock by 25% ‘Frozen’ still reigns over the Disney kingdom", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T09:52:36.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
