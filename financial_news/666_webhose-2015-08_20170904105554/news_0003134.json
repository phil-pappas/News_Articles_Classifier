I thought, if we could train some people on an ongoing basis and give them some work experience, they would be very desirable to the rest of the industry in the city.\" \nThe bar at Southside Social before opening \nSouthside Social plans to train three groups of nine people every year on a 19-week program that includes five weeks of classroom-based study and 14 weeks of on-the-job training including bar work, table waiting, customer service and management . Participants will graduate with a certificate of work readiness and qualifications in relevant fields such as first aid and food hygiene. \nMr Thewlis said that \"everything we make above and beyond\" will be donated to a local charity decided by a board of people or recycled into the programme. \nMr Thewlis already runs a similar social enterprise scheme at his security company that he said has helped more than 100 people between the ages of 18 and 25 into sustained employment since its launch three years ago. \n\"It’s a unique thing in the industry, the only social enterprise employer and living wage employer in the security industry,\" he said. \"Once again, we’re going to lead the way here. It's the first social enterprise of its kind. It's very innovative.\" \nChris Thewlis with a menu for Southside Social and a shot of the pub's exterior \nWhile Southside Social is believed to be the first pub of its kind in Edinburgh, there are a number of social enterprise schemes elsewhere in the UK's hospitality industry. \nBrigade, a bistro and bar in London Bridge, employs homeless and vulnerable people; the Camden Society runs several cafes across London that provide work for people with disabilities; while The Clink, the restaurant at HMP Cardiff that is staffed by inmates , was recently ranked the Welsh capital's best eatery by TripAdvisor (NasdaqGS: TRIP - news ) . \nJamie Oliver famously set up a restaurant, Fifteen, with the aim of helping economically disadvantaged people find work, and sparked a stormy debate last year when he hired a convicted paedophile who had completed his prison sentence. \nRussell Brand also has a social enterprise cafe, Trew Era in Hoxton, which hires recovering drug addicts and is funded with the proceeds from his book, Revolution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T11:30:14.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
