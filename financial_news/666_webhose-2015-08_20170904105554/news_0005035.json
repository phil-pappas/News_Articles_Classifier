Net profit rose 56 per cent to $145.8 million in the year to June 30, from $93.7 million, while total revenue was up 15 per cent at $925.6 million thanks to record sales. Cochlear's forecast of a rise in net profit to between $165 million and $175 million during 2015/16 also disappointed analysts. CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said investors had anticipated a better result. \"I'd suggest it's a miss, a substantial miss,\" Mr McCarthy said. He said Cochlear had booked earnings per share of $2.56, but the consensus estimate was of around $2.75. \"Some estimates were even higher. One report I was reading was looking for a profit of $160.8 million,\" Mr McCarthy said. He said that in the past month, Cochlear shares had surged from below $78 to almost $93, so expectations had been high. Cochlear had long been a leader in its field but was now being lapped by competitors. Mr McCarthy said the final dividend, cut to $1.00 from $1.27 fully franked, had exacerbated the negative reaction. However, the stock wasn't a high dividend payer in relation to its share price, so the cut wasn't as influential as the profit result.
