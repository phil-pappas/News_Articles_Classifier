It sold to a Melbourne family.\nOn the corner of Mercer Road, the three-level building – once owned by education entrepreneur Shesh Ghale – includes a basement car park, six shops and upper-level office space.\n\"Bayley Stuart has been repositioning assets for our clients for years and when this was put to us we thought it was a suitable, well-located asset that offered a low-risk profile and enhanced returns so we decided to put a club together,\" Mr MacGillivray said.\n\"The diversity of income over multiple tenants and rock-solid location saw strong competition in an off-market sales strategy that led to a very strong result,\" Mr Gruzewski said. \"The sale reflects a high capital value on the building of just under $10,000 per square metre.\"\nIn a separate transaction, an owner-occupier is understood to be paying another eight-figure sum for an office in central Box Hill.\nThe agent behind that deal, JLL director Joshua Tebb – who manages leases and sales – said access to cheap money, a good rental return and in some cases, airspace development potential – are factors driving the suburban office investment market.\nIn February, Zagame Hotels paid $24 million for a Hawthorn headquarters it occupies part of, and derives a rental income from.\nThe National Association of Testing Authorities will also partly occupy a Camberwell office it bought for $20.3 million earlier this year.\n\"Businesses are taking a different view as to where they want to invest capital and are happy to take on leasing risk some syndicates or private investors won't,\" Mr Tebb said.\nTight yields for CBD property has also resulted in investors seeking suburban stock, especially near established satellite hubs, he said.\nIn Box Hill and Armadale recently, developers have convinced planning authorities to increase the height of permissible buildings.\nThe Deague family won approval to develop a 36-level skyscraper in Box Hill, and Lend Lease will develop 12-level buildings in Orrong Road, Armadale, a site not part of a suburban Central Activity District.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:54:30.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
