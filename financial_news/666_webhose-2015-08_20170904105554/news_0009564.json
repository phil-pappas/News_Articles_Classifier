Photo: Ryan Stuart\nGold miners are capitalising on current market conditions, with some sending drill rigs into the dirt while others strike deals to ensure growth.\nDespite a sinking US dollar gold price, a lower local currency has provided a buffer for Australian gold miners and allowed them to generate enough free cash to consider growth options. Gold is trading at five-year lows around $US1100 an ounce.\nFormer acquisition darling Northern Star Resources spent $50 million on exploration in the 2014-2015 financial year. At the Diggers and Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie on Tuesday, the company revealed its recent drilling efforts resulted in a 44 per cent increase in the company's resources count, to a total of 8.9 million ounces. Known reserves increased 26 per cent to 1.5 million ounces.\nNew discoveries Advertisement The miner reported a number of extensions in known mineralisation as well as a handful of new discoveries and committed to spending a further $35 million on exploration this financial year as well as guiding a $39 million spend on expansions and investments.\nNorthern Star managing director Bill Beament said well drilled areas, such as the historic Kalgoorlie gold mining region, were not necessarily well explored.\n\"When they [geologists] know there's a finite position they're given money to test theories and go back to basics and all of a sudden you find stuff,\" he said.\n\"I reckon this whole region in Kalgoorlie is lighting up, it's quite exciting.\"\nCiti analyst Trent Allen said the \"solid result\" of Northern Star's exploration efforts would extend their group-wide mine life to about eight years.\n\"We are encouraged by the exploration success at Kalgoorlie, which is the result of one of the largest drilling programs seen in the Kalgoorlie goldfields in recent years,\" Mr Allen said.\nIn a thinly veiled dig at the cost of some acquisitions in the sector in recent months, Mr Beament said it was \"extraordinary\" the additional resources cost the company just $19 an ounce.\n\"We took a view in the 12 months the best value we could add for our shareholders was through the drill bit and that was well and truly exhibited today,\" he told reporters after his address.\nLast week, the miner completed a joint venture deal over Tanami Gold's Central Tanami project in the Northern Territory, which Mr Beament said had the potential to produce 150,000 ounces a year from 2017.\nBottom of the cycle Rival gold miner Evolution Mining is also finding opportunities at the bottom of the cycle, recently picking up the Cowal gold mine from Barrick Gold for $550 million as well as a deal to acquire La Mancha's Australian assets.\nEvolution chairman Jake Klein told The Australian Financial Review on the sidelines of the conference that, \"in a strange way the tougher times get, the more opportunity presents itself\".\n\"Cowal for us is transformational,\" he said. \"250,000 ounces a year at a low cost with permitting out to 2024 is just something we would not have been able to contemplate buying three years ago.\n\"We are dealing in a remarkably transformative period in the Australian gold sectorâ€¦ 23 per cent of Australia's gold production has changed hands [in the past four years]. What created Evolution and Northern Star is the change in these dynamics of ownership where the majors and other groups have sold [assets]. So that to me is a once off opportunity.\"\nChinese miner Zijin, which recently acquired local miner Norton Gold Fields, launched an offer for explorer Phoenix Gold in June, and shortly after Evolution increased its foothold in the company to 19.8 per cent, sparking a potential battle for the local junior.\nMr Klein would not comment on the company's next steps but a bidder's statement from Zijin is expected soon.\nZijin Mining executive director George Fang told reporters at the conference its process with Phoenix was ongoing, declining to provide any further detail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:58:36.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
