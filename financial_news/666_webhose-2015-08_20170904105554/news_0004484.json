CAR reported second-quarter 2015 earnings per share of 84 cents, which cruised 23.5% ahead of both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the year-ago quarter earnings of 68 cents. On a GAAP basis, earnings came in at $1.34 per share, significantly up from earnings of 24 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Avis Budget Group Inc. - Earnings Surprise | FindTheBest Results benefited from an increase in organic volumes, continuous improvement in margins, and contributions from acquisitions, partly offset by lower pricing.However, shares of the company dropped nearly 3% in the after-market trading session as its net revenue slipped 1% year over year to $2,173 million and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,263.7 million. The decline in sales was due to a negative impact from foreign currency translations, offset by a 3% rise in rental days in the Americas. Revenue was up 5% on a currency neutral basis.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 7% to $227 million. Segment Performance Americas , which consists of the company’s operations in North America, South America, Central America and Caribbean, reported revenue growth of 1% year over year to $1,556 million, driven by 3% volume expansion and 3% improvement in ancillary revenue per rental day. Pricing was down 2% (1% on a currency neutral basis). Adjusted EBITDA grew 3% to $178 million on account of higher volume coupled with better fleet utilization, somewhat negated by lower pricing.The International segment’s revenues came in at $617 million, down 5% from the year-ago quarter, largely impacted by negative currency movements. However, the segment’s revenues benefited from an 18% rise in rental days, while in constant-currency total revenue per rental day fell 4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment rose 11% to $61 million, backed by higher volumes along with lower per-unit fleet expenses.

Guidance Based on improvement displayed by pricing comparisons in the Americas by the end of the second quarter, Avis Budget expects the pricing pattern to solidify further in the second half of the year. Also, it remains focused on delivering another year of record earnings in 2015, as it anticipates fleet costs to be manageable during the year.However, on account of the strong ongoing currency headwinds, Avis Budget narrowed its guidance for 2015. The company now expects revenue in the range of $8.6–$8.7 billion, compared with $8.8 billion predicted earlier. The new guidance reflects an increase of 1%–3% from 2014, down from 4% growth projected earlier.The company’s Americas segment rental days are now expected to grow 4%–5%, against the previous guidance range of 5%–7%. Pricing is now anticipated to remain mainly unchanged on a currency neutral basis, compared to the previous prediction of a 1%–2% increase. The company expects revenue to bear a 5 points negative impact from currency translations.Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $900–$950 million, down from the previous guidance of a $900 million to $1 billion range. Adjusted EBITDA for the year is expected to include a $40 million negative impact from foreign exchange movements.Per-unit fleet costs in the Americas for 2015 are now estimated to be about $300–$310 per month, compared with $310–$320 per month anticipated earlier. Additionally, per-unit fleet costs for the total company are anticipated to be about $280–$290 per month, compared with the prior prediction of $290–$300 per month.Interest expense pertaining to corporate debt is expected to be nearly $200 million. The company’s non-vehicle depreciation and amortization costs guidance (excluding the amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions) is pegged at about $165 million.The company’s effective tax rate in 2015 is expected to be 37%–38% on an adjusted basis, while diluted shares outstanding are projected to be approximately 106 million.Based on the above expectations, the company’s adjusted earnings are now envisioned in a range of $3.15–$3.45 per share, reflecting 6%–17% year-over-year growth. This compares unfavorably with the previous guidance of $3.15–$3.75 per share, reflecting a 6%–27% year-over-year increase.
