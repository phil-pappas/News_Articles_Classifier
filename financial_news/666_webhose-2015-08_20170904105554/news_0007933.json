Its institutional partners are putting up the rest. \nAccording to a statement, each Asciano shareholder will receive Aus$6.94 in cash and 0.0387 Brookfield units, for a total value of Aus$9.15 per share. \nThis represents a 39 percent premium over Asciano's share price on July 1, the day it disclosed talks with Brookfield. \nThe deal, which has the unanimous support of Asciano's board, comes amid a flurry of takeovers in Australia's transport sector amid a decline in the country's currency. \nJapan Post Holdings recently purchased logistics firm Toll Holdings after a consortium led by China Merchants Group acquired Newcastle Port last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:57:51.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
