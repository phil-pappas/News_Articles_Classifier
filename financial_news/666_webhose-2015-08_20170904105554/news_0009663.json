Share on twitter by David Ramli\nHigh above the Indian Ocean, nestled among the pin-pricked blackness of space, sits an empty piece of orbital real estate that was meant to be Australian.\nJabiru-1 was the $620 million satellite that was destined to take its place among the stars. It would be built by Lockheed Martin for Australia's only independent satellite operator, NewSat.\nBut 11 months before its launch the dream is dead; the money invested in the project squandered and shareholders left out of pocket.\nThe largely finished Jabiru-1 has been reclaimed by its maker and is set to become little more than a series of spare parts.\nThe culprit for NewSat's downfall is unclear. Some claim chief executive Adrian Ballintine led a culture of excess that squandered millions of dollars on parties, plane rides and his son's Gold Coast yacht company. Ballintine rejects any wrongdoing, blaming rival directors and French bankers for the problems.\nWoven through this complex tale is a motley crew of characters from the Saudi royal family, football champions and a Chinese government enterprise to the former prime minister Bob Hawke and Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull.\nBeneath it drums a simple question: will anybody ever face justice for the death of NewSat?\n Unlikely heroes Ballintine's career began in local government as a town clerk for the City of Prahran in Melbourne. It was stable, humdrum work that didn't appeal to a man with ambitions to stride the Earth. He packed it in and entered IT, founding a company called MultiEmedia.\nIn 2005 MultiEmedia bought two \"teleports\", which are ground facilities that use their large dishes to transmit data to and from satellites, off a Danish company.\nIt rebranded to become NewSat, gaining a reputation as a cowboy provider with a showy attitude – frowned upon in a sector where most of the providers have a state-owned pedigree.\nDespite the disdain, the company grew, thanks to the mining boom needing remote communications and the US government's \"war on terror\", where ground communications with troops on the ground was crucial in the mountains of Afghanistan and helped NewSat win valuable military contracts.\nBut Ballintine wanted to be more than a reseller: he wanted to stamp his name into the sky with a constellation of satellites using orbital slots bought from the Cypriot government.\nThese would turn Australia into a hotbed of high-tech space jobs anchored by NewSat, which in turn would make a lot of money - the dream was that Jabiru-1 would bring in $3.5 billion in revenues and an 80 per cent profit margin.\nThe irony for NewSat was that picking the gold-plated option, rather than a cheaper Russian or Chinese alternative, was also the easiest to fund because this option often came with state-backed loans designed to boost domestic employment rather than profits.\nIn 2012 US defence contractor Lockheed Martin was given the task of building the satellite, while the world's most expensive commercial launcher, France's Arianespace, would put it into orbit.\nThe total project would cost $US620 million – an eye-watering amount for a company with a market capitalisation of just $40 million to $50 million. With the US government-backed Export-Import Bank chipping in $US300.5 million and Europe's big insurer, COFACE, underwriting about $US100 million, shareholders would have to stump up the remaining $US220 million and Standard Chartered Bank would provide a $US25 million facility for miscellaneous expenses.\nThe participation of these big names helped to convince shareholders the project was too big to fail. Established Melbourne brokerage firm Baillieu Holst helped raise equity, while Credit Suisse was one of the lenders and Malaysian pay TV giant Measat provided the first orbital slot.\nNewSat also got ringing endorsements from then-shadow communications minister Malcolm Turnbull, and Bob Hawke, who worked with Ballintine on trade missions to the Gulf States. He opened doors for the company using his reputation and panache from 2011 until 2013.\nBack for more This is why shareholders kept coming back for more despite the clear risks of investing in a start-up satellite company like construction delays and launch explosions as well as the expanding costs of the project.\nBut two things outside of NewSat's control took the wind out of its sails – the winding down of the war on terror and end of Australia's mining boom.\nIn the words of the latest report by NewSat's administrator PPB Advisory: \"the group was loss-making at the EBITDA level in each month since October 2013\".\nBut Ballintine kept spending. He hosted dinners for customers and lenders in Washington and Melbourne and spent $2 million on travel alone. And Ballintine's counter-argument to the costs has some merit. The satellite industry is an odd collection of military contractors, frontier miners, blue-chip clients and government agencies with conferences held on luxury cruise liners and far-flung hotel ball rooms. After all, sales staff are trying to flog the last frontier, and winning deals was vital for the viability of Jabiru-1.\nPutsch For Ballintine, though, the vision was increasing being sucked into a red hole and in 2014, the company's independent directors, who had been concerned about the increasing costs, commissioned former BHP vice-president Brendan Rudd to investigate the books.\nThe report was damning. It found cases where NewSat's brokers had traded company shares during blackout periods, where the company had transferred $400,000 to Cresta Motor Yachts, which lists Ballintine as president, and failed to deduct tax from a bonus payment made to him.\nBallintine says many of the issues were simple clerical errors. He says the money paid to Cresta was owed to him in return for unpaid sales commissions, and the matter of withheld tax was settled months ago. The PPB report does not agree with this, adding it has also found a $905,000 loan was made from NewSat to Ballintine.\n\"All up, I'm owed about $5.4 million by NewSat, so it's not like I'm retiring to a nice nest egg,\" Ballintine says, adding that all this was done with the approval of the company'sremuneration and audit committees.\nHe condemns the Rudd report as \"gossipy non-truths\" and maintains it was put together with the independent directors as part of a push to take over the company – a claim at least one of them strenuously denies.\nExplanations, reform wanted Rudd's report was handed to NewSat's three independent directors, former St Kilda Football Club president Andrew Plympton, Australia Post deputy chairman, Brendan Fleiter, and Mark Fishwick as well as its biggest lender, the Ex-Im Bank.\nThe bank pushed hard for explanations while the independent directors pushed for urgent reform, personally lobbying NewSat's biggest shareholder and Oxley Holdings executive chair, Ching Chiat Kwong.\nThey also pushed back in the boardroom. Video obtained by Fairfax Media shows an extraordinary 2014 confrontation between the independent directors and NewSat chair Richard Green , who grew increasingly frustrated at Fleiter's questioning about which party Green's son-in-law, John Stewart, represented during a debt raising with Ching.\n\"What are you going to do? Stand up and hit me?\" Fleiter asks with incredulity as Green stands above him. \"Well I might, yes,\" Green replies.\nBy June 2014 all three independent directors quit. \"When we read the report we were disappointed and outraged ... so we had to do it,\" Plympton says.\nThe report and their sudden departure caused a crisis of confidence among lenders. Compounding the problems NewSat had hit a technical breach of its lending covenant that required fresh negotiations and this didn't help.\nCOFACE demanded more equity injections and management changes before any money could be released – $US40 million would be required by November 2014.\nThen on December 16, 2014, Lockheed Martin issued a default notice citing overdue payments worth $US21 million and issued a termination notice on January 22.\nNewSat had flown too close to the sun; its wings began to sear.\nBetrayal Its final nail in the coffin came from a phone call from COFACE in early April. It would not support a covenant waiver and pulled the plug on its $US90 million in funds. The amount Ballintine had to raise leapt from $US40 million to $US130 million.\nBallintine says in mid-April he came close to sealing a deal with a Chinese government enterprise that wanted to buy a 19 per cent stake in the business.\nBut within days receivers McGrathNicol were called in and Ballintine was soon formally removed.\nThe balding 59-year-old is a well-connected master salesman with a penchant for finding unique solutions to funding problems and after a decade of dreaming and with just months until the launch, he refused to surrender. Surprised stakeholders were soon getting calls from Ballintine and senior members of the Saudi royal family, who were seriously considering a bailout plan.\nNew possibilities The phones ran hot with possibilities – European fund managers, Silicon Valley fund managers and the would-be Chinese investors were on the line – all interested to varying degrees. Jabiru-1 was largely completed and would need just $US78 million to complete and the Malaysian pay TV player Measat was back in the mix with an offer to buy NewSat as a package.\nBut all hope died when Lockheed Martin's top brass stopped returning Ballintine's calls. They'd worked out the satellite's remnants could be sold seperately without returning any of NewSat's money.\nAttempts to save the project fell to earth in an ungainly heap. The only remnants even vaguely saleable were the two original teleports that had been the catalysts for Ballintine's original dream of a space-borne fleet with Australian hands at the tiller.\nOn July 10 the teleports were sold to ASX-listed and Hong Kong based rival Speedcast for $12 million – all of which will go towards employee entitlements and the fees for McGrathNicol and PPB Advisory.\nBallintine had fought to the end. \"There are some really decent people whose superannuation and life savings … went into what we were building, so I feel terrible for those people,\" he says. \"They ring me up and we talk about it and I explain as best I can what happened.\"\nJustice The murky question of who will face justice remains unanswered. PPB Advisory eventually found that $1.5 million had been paid to Cresta by the satellite company and is still trying to work out whether Ballintine is telling the truth.\nOf the hundreds of millions of dollars that went into the company, just $10.14 million remains as \"potential recoveries\" with funding required to pursue the matter. The $US170 million spent by Ex-Im Bank is considered to be unrecoverable.\nIt will now be up to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to either fund or investigate the various claims and see if the directors were culpable – but the initial view is that the company never traded insolvent and had prospects of raising the money required to complete the project.\nBut back on Earth the mum-and-dad investors who bought shares worth $280 million, based on a dream of space-borne profits and patriotism, have been left with nothing to show for their leap of faith.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/newsat-leaked-video-reveals-newsat-board-room-stoush-20150826-gj8drm.html"], "published": "2015-08-28T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:09:04.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
