The company said that was in line with its June guidance for pretax normalised earnings of between $NZ520 million and $NZ530 million, which was excluding losses from Virgin Australia. \nOperating revenue rose six per cent to $NZ4.93 billion with passenger sales growth of 6.8 per cent to $NZ4.1 billion. \nMr Luxon says profitable growth had been at the heart of the company's restructuring over the past four years. \n\"We've just had an investment grade rating last week. Of 300 commercial airlines in the world only 30 covered their cost of capital and only seven had an investment grade rating. Air New Zealand is among the top three airlines in the world,\" he said. \nLower fuel prices added a $NZ120 million net benefit to the company during the financial year and Mr Luxon expects ongoing cheaper fuel prices to provide a $NZ300 million benefit in the year ahead under the airline's new hedging, although there will be some currency drag on that. \nThe company has declared a fully imputed dividend of 9.5 cents per share, an increase of 73 per cent on the prior year. \nIt will also pay a bonus of up to $NZ1400 to 8000 staff not on other incentive schemes on the back of the result. \nAir NZ is facing some headwinds ahead with its stranglehold on the domestic regional market set to end with Jetstar's expansion. \nThe national carrier has said it won't be undercut on prices on regional routes and has cut lead-in fares by 11 to 40 per cent on most routes ahead of Jetstar's announcement in September of which regional destinations it will fly to from December. \nMr Luxon said talk about the threatened domestic competition had been a \"bit overblown\". \n\"It's not just Jetstar with its four aircraft, there are a lot of little airlines adding capacity. We have better aircraft at a lower cost and are not pressured on lower pricing,\" he said. \nThere was good demand for the two new routes starting in December - Buenos Aires in Argentina and Houston in Texas - with the airline already considering adding capacity. \nThere was good opportunity for the airline to persuade Australians to use Auckland as a gateway hub to North and South America, particularly for those living outside Sydney, he said. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Economic growth will solve budget woes:RBA AAP \nReserve Bank boss Glenn Stevens believes the budget debate should focus on how to increase tax revenue by lifting …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:11:57.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
