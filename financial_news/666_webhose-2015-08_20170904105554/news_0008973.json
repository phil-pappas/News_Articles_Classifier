In other words, investors will be attracted to the stock market thereby creating some excitement in the market. \n“As we look into 2015, we expect the market to thrive. However, we will continue to select stocks with good fundamentals, healthy profitability and good dividend payout for 2015 which we believe will translate into suitable returns for our shareholders”. \nStory by Ghana/Myjoyonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T03:13:06.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
