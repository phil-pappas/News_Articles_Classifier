The program, which launched this Ramadan, is running until mid-October through each of the company's six restaurants, Aseil, Kalila, Square Meater, Pan Jan, Semsom and Margherita. \n\nThe program involves the local community of Jeddah giving back to its fellow peers, where it will participate in building a better future for the society. Throughout Ramadan, the company contributed SAR 5 from each purchase of an Iftar set menu and is now sharing SAR 2 from purchases of selected items from each of its six restaurants in Jeddah. The total amount will be entrusted to Ektefaa, who will commence a pre-planned training program with individuals that they have selected to take part, eventually leading them to earn a job in the hospitality field with Al Mathaaq. \n\nDr. Youssef El Habbal, CEO of Al Mathaaq Hospitality, said: \"As a Saudi company, we have a responsibility towards our community by investing in the social fabric and supporting the Saudi youth's education, training and employment, providing them a greater chance towards a more prosperous future.\" \n\n\"The current CSR program we have implemented focuses on a fundamental issue within our youth society, where education and training are vital for young Saudis on the hunt for jobs. Our collaboration with Ektefaa, along with the training program they have developed, concentrates on benefiting the youth by developing their employability skills and creating a pool of Saudi talent which will add value to the world of hospitality,\" El Habbal added. \n\nEl Habbal explained, \"With future endeavors, we will continue to raise awareness on some of the social challenges to help build a better community and we hope to continue to forge a reputation as a responsible business, becoming a pioneer within the hospitality industry in corporate social responsibility.\"\n\nAl Mathaaq's education and Saudi youth employment CSR program aims at educating and training the Saudi youth to enhance their opportunities in finding suitable jobs, wherein they contribute to become productive members of the community. Ektefaa have planned and developed the training program that will allow selected individuals to easily enter the field of hospitality and kick-start their future careers. \n\nJawaher Al Qurashi, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors and Director of Public Relations and Marketing at Ektefaa said: \"We, at Ektefaa are enthused about the initiative presented by Al Mathaaq, to help train and employ some of the surveyed youth in Jeddah, allowing them to realize their potential and secure their reach towards self-sufficiency. Al Mathaaq's CSR program, in collaboration with Ektefaa, is a step in the right direction for youth revival and empowerment.\"\n\n\"We hope that many other CSR bodies will follow suit and make use of Ektefaa's huge database of needy families and programs, with the aim of enhancing the potential for the development of this community,\" Al Qurashi added. \n\nCommunity development and social involvement are amongst the key pillars in Al Mathaaq's operational strategy.
