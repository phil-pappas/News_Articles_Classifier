The National Labor Relations Board ruled declined to rule in favor of the students because it has no jurisdiction over the majority of NCAA teams that are state-run, even though the players receive compensation, in the form of scholarships, for playing.The NLRB wrote that \"it would not effectuate the policies of the [National Labor Relations] Act to assert jurisdiction in this case,\" even if the students were ultimately found to be employees, because involvement \"would not serve to promote stability in labor relations.\"[caption id=\"attachment_34617039\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Chris Leak, quarter back for the University of Florida Gators, rushes the football past the Ohio State University Buckeyes during the second quarter of the Tostitos Bowl Championship Series national championship game at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, on Monday, January 8, 2007. Photographer: David Cruz/Bloomberg News.[/caption]Northwestern players who received aid -- 85 athletes out of 112 on the football team -- had petitioned the NLRB to recognize them as a group that could legally form a union. An NLRB regional director had decided on March 26, 2014 that players were employees under the law. Northwestern requested a review, claiming that the students were not \"statutory employees.\"In a statement, Northwestern reiterated that it \"considers its students who participate in NCAA Division I sports, including those who receive athletic scholarships, to be students, first and foremost\" and said that \"unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes.\"The scholarship, consisting of tuition, fees, room, board, and books, was, during the 2013 to 2014 season, calculated to be worth about $61,000.Although run under the rubric of amateur athletics, college football is big business. ESPN charged a reported $1 million per ad during the most recent layoffs.Is the decision fair? There is the opportunity for an education . Northwestern head football coach Pat Fitzgerald said in a statement that the \"group [of students] posted the highest cumulative GPA in program history during the 2014-15 academic year,\" although there was no word about how that cumulative GPA compared to regular students at the school.Perhaps football players at Northwestern are also serious students. But the NCAA seems to be about the sports, and money, first and academic achievement second ... or third or fourth or something further down the line. The NCAA brings in a reported total of $6 billion in annual revenue. Students give up valuable considerations , like the use of their image forever. The players get hurt. The NCAA claims high overall graduation rates , but uses different metrics than the federal government, as Inside Higher Ed reports, so claims as much as a 20 percentage point higher success rate than the feds recognize.There is not only a significant gap in graduation rates between football players and other male students, but the gap is significantly bigger when considering black male students versus white ones. And there are the alleged cases of fraud in which some schools supposedly fill players' schedules with no-show classes that they still manage to pass.In such cases, there's a reasonable question of how much the students actually get out of the experience. Precious few will find their way onto an NFL squad. How will the others make a living? In many states, college coaches are the highest-paid public employees. If groups of young athletes are used to manufacture massive amounts of revenue for educational and sports organizations, maybe it is time to recognize the true business and pay the players accordingly.What is clear is that the NLRB doesn't consider this an issue that it could not revisit, particularly if players in a sport from across the NCAA schools joined in a similar effort. Or there may be room for players on teams, particularly state-run ones, to look for union representation at a state level.", "external_links": ["http://www.nj.com/ledger-dalessandro/index.ssf/2013/03/lawsuit_filed_by_former_nets_forward_ed_obannon_threatens_ncaas_economic_model.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/12/media/espn-college-football-playoff-pays-off/", "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/23/report-finds-academic-fraud-u-north-carolina-lasted-nearly-20-years", "http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-ncaa-athletes-be-paid", "https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/basic-page/node-3034/Northwestern%20Fact%20Sheet%202015-08.pdf", "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/10/29/graduation-rates-athletes-hit-record-high", "http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/34617039/640x0.jpg?fit=scale", "http://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2014/dec/30/jim-moran/moran-says-college-football-players-have-low-gradu/"], "published": "2015-08-18T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T11:42:58.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
