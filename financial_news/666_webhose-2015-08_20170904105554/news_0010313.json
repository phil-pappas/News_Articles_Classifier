The media spruiking of the sharemarket earlier this year is now causing widespread anger.

Chinese equities have lost half their value since then.\nBut it has not acknowledged what has been a source of public anger – that the government had been implicit in encouraging the remarkable bull run which stoked the sharemarket bubble before the crash. There have been concerns too that the government-backed agency tasked with buying shares to support the market – the China Securities Fund – had backfired and in fact allowed insider trading and front-running to flourish.\nWho is to blame?

Critics have questioned the wisdom of these actions, and some voiced concerns about insider trading.\"\nIn a separate investigation, eight people connected to CITIC Securities, the country's largest broker, were being probed by police for \"illegal trading\", official news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday.\nThe investigation involved a former employee of the securities regulator, who was suspected of insider trading and forging documents, Xinhua said.\nThe Caijing reporter, Wang Xiaolu, was taken in for questioning on Tuesday night on suspicion of \"fabricating and spreading false securities and futures trading information\".\n\" Caijing firmly believes that promoting market fairness and transparency, and the healthy development of the securities market through the objective reporting of market information, is the media's responsibility,\" the magazine said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe magazine said it had not been given reasons for Wang's detention, but noted he had authored a cover story published on July 20 which reported that officials were mulling the removal of an emergency government sharemarket support package which was implemented after the first wave of sharp market falls in mid-June.\nOn the afternoon the magazine article was first published, a spokesman of the securities regulator said the report was false. But on August 14, the CSRC signalled it would let the market play a larger role, and the government-backed purchasing of shares appears to have been suspended.\nThe securities regulator has warned media against spreading rumours or false information, and has also turned its attentions to high-frequency traders as part of efforts to soothe investor fears over possible price manipulation.\nEarlier this year, it suspended a number of brokers as part of a probe into high-risk margin lending.\nThe use of borrowed money to trade shares was a key driving force behind the sharemarket rally in Chinese over the past year, and is seen as one of the main dangers posed to the economy by the sharemarket collapse.\n\"The authorities have been too involved in the sharemarket and now they're trying to pass the responsibilities to others,\" said Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology. \"In fact, they have to be responsible for the market crisis.\"\nwith Bloomberg\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Twitter\nFollow FairfaxForeign on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FairfaxForeign", "https://www.facebook.com/FairfaxForeign"], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T05:33:23.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
