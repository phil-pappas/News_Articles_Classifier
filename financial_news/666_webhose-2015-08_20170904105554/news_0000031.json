Rose Powell by James Sherbon After a government review – and an intense period of political argy-bargy – Australia's Renewable Energy Target (RET) was reset in June. The RET, a federal government policy designed to ensure a minimum amount of Australia's electricity comes from renewable sources by 2020, was reduced from the previously legislated 41,000 gigawatt hours to 33,000 GWh.\nThe new target will double the amount of large-scale renewable energy being delivered by the scheme from current levels, and means that by 2020, about 23.5 per cent of Australia's electricity generation in 2020 will be from renewable sources.\nThe RET was created in 2001 by the Howard government and subsequently strengthened by Labor to \"at least 20 per cent by 2020,\" calculated at the time as being 45,000 GWh of electricity. At the time the expanded RET was calculated, the anticipated 2020 electricity usage was 300,000 GWh: the target took 20 per cent of this, minus existing renewable generation of around 15,000 GWh. The expanded RET was then split into a large-scale target of 41,000 GWh and a notional small-scale target of 4,000 GWh.\nBut the waters were muddied by the unforeseen decline in Australia's electricity use since 2010-11, as manufacturing activity has decreased, energy efficiency has increased and installation of residential solar units has lessened drawdown from the grid.\nIf this trend continues, the government says the revised 33,000 GWh target could lead to about 24.5 per cent of Australia's total power usage in 2020 being generated by renewable sources.\nAustralia now uses hydro-electricity and wind energy as its main sources of renewable energy – the former constrained by lack of new dams, but the latter growing strongly. Solar is also increasing, but mainly in distributed production such as rooftop solar PV (photovoltaic) systems, which show up in the data as lower electricity consumption rather than as a generation source.\nAustralia's portfolio of renewable energy resources also includes geothermal, wave, tidal and bio-energy technologies, many of which are technologically immature – and high-cost; but expected advances in technology by 2030, and full accounting for emission costs in fossil-fuel sources, are expected to allow them to contribute meaningfully to Australia's future energy supply.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:16:29.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
