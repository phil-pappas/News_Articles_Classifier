ADVERTISEMENT “As a result, current homeowners are using their increasing housing equity towards the downpayment on their next purchase,\" he said.\nSales have risen 10.3 percent above last year's levels. \nStill, there is only a 4.8-month supply of homes on the market, down from 4.9 months in June, which is pushing up prices and making homebuying more difficult. \nThe percent share of first-time buyers declined in July for the second consecutive month, falling from 30 percent in June to 28 percent — the lowest share since January. \n“The fact that first-time buyers represented a lower share of the market compared to a year ago even though sales are considerably higher is indicative of the challenges many young adults continue to face,” Yun said. \n“Rising rents and flat wage growth make it difficult for many to save for a downpayment, and the dearth of supply in affordable price ranges is limiting their options.” \nTotal housing inventory at the end of July declined 0.4 percent to 2.24 million homes available for sale, and is now 4.7 percent lower than a year ago (2.35 million). \nThe median existing-home price was $234,000, which is 5.6 percent above July 2014. July’s price increase marks the 41st consecutive month of year-over-year gains. \n“Despite the strong growth in sales since this spring, declining affordability could begin to slowly dampen demand,” Yun said. “Realtors in some markets reported slower foot traffic in July in part because of low inventory and concerns about the continued rise in home prices without commensurate income gains.” \nSingle-family home sales increased 2.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.96 million in July, the highest since February 2007. \nThe average interest rate for a 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgage climbed to 4.05 percent in July from 3.98 percent in June — the first time it has moved above 4 percent since November, according to Freddie Mac. \nAnother positive for the market's future growth is the decline in distressed sales, which hit their lowest level since the NAR started tracking them in October 2008. \nForeclosures and short sales declined to 7 percent in July from 8 percent in June. \n“Five years ago, distressed sales represented 33 percent of the market in July,” said NAR President Chris Polychron, executive broker with 1st Choice Realty in Hot Springs, Ark. \n\"For many previously distressed homeowners throughout the country, rising home values in recent years have helped recover equity and the vast improvement in several local job markets means fewer are falling behind on their mortgage payments.” \nAll-cash sales, usually made by investors, increased slightly to 23 percent of transactions in July from 22 percent in June. But they are down from 29 percent a year ago. \nRegionally, sales in the Northeast decreased 2.8 percent, while they were unchanged in the Midwest. \nSales in the South increased 4.1 percent and were up 3.2 percent in the West.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T22:06:35.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
