More Carphone data breach is a wake-up call \nAccording to figures published on Tuesday, more than 25,500 new cases involving these accounts — which include bundled products such as travel insurance and motor breakdown cover in return for a fee — were received by the ombudsman between this January and June, exceeding the total for the whole of 2014. \nClaimants have either been signed up without their permission, have been ineligible for bundled benefits, or their banks have failed to cancel their account when instructed, the ombudsman said. \nRising discontent with packaged accounts, which typically cost between £5 and £25 per month, drove the number of complaints about financial products other than payment protection insurance (PPI) to 79,550 in the first half of 2015 — up 45 per cent compared to the previous six months. \nPPI, which was widely mis-sold with loans, credit cards and mortgages, continues to account for the majority (55 per cent) of cases referred to the ombudsman. The number of new PPI complaints is declining, however, with 10 per cent fewer than in the second half of 2014. \nConsumers warned of sharp rise in current account fraud \nFraudulent applications for current accounts have risen sharply in the past three months, underlining the growing threat of identity theft for banks and their customers. Fraudsters made 81 out of every 10,000 current account applications in the first three months of 2015, but the proportion nearly doubled to 151 in 10,000 in the second quarter. At the end of 2013 it was just 48 in 10,000. \nContinue reading \nCaroline Wayman, chief ombudsman, said the decline “has not been as steady or as marked as generally expected . . . at least in part due to the continued high levels of activity by claims managers in this area”. \nShe also attributed “the substantial increase” in complaints relating to packaged accounts to claims management groups, which bring roughly eight in 10 cases on behalf of individuals. \nVery few complaints about paid-for accounts are successful, however. Only one in 10 was upheld by the ombudsman between April and June. In stark contrast, three-quarters made relating to PPI mis-selling in this most recent period were upheld. \n“Nobody wants another PPI,” said Ms Wayman. “This is why we’re working closely with businesses, claims companies and their regulators, to make sure PPI is sorted as fairly and as quickly as possible for everyone involved, and that lessons are learned to prevent anything like this happening again.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
