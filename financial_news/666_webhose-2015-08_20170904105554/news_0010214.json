The plunge in oil prices over the past year is causing severe financial difficulties for the companies that borrowed heavily and have less productive and higher-cost assets. \nThe tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused. > \nThe OCC, whose work complements the Federal Reserve's supervision of multi-faceted bank holding companies, has rules on how banks should classify loans and make provisions for potential loan losses. \nA spokesman for the regulator said: \"OCC does not make individual credit decisions for national banks and federal savings associations.\" \nBut he added: \"Early identification of troubled loans and mitigation of associated risk is fundamental to the safe and sound operation of national banks and federal savings associations. The OCC encourages banks and thrifts to work with customers to meet their credit needs.\" \nA former OCC official said that although the regulator did not make individual credit decisions, its inspectors could use a variety of tools - and the room for interpretation allowed by some rules - to send banks signals about what they should do. \nTexas, the US's biggest oil-producing state, suffered a wave of bank failures in the 1980s after an oil boom turned into a bust. \nIt is common for periods of financial stress to heighten tensions between banks and their regulators. Extra pressure is emerging from an annual regulatory review under way of syndicated loans of more than $20m. The review will result in a public report on whether banks have a realistic view on the health of their loan portfolios. \nMany oil companies active in shale-producing zones have been slashing jobs and expenses to offset a fall in cash flow because of the low crude price. \nYields on bonds issued by US oil and gas companies have risen sharply as the oil price has fallen, a sign of growing fears of default. \nEarnings reports in Canada last week gave a fresh perspective on oil and gas lending, as banks such as RBC, CIBC and TD Bank warned of more troubles to come as they reported surges in bad loans and falling consumer demand in oil-producing regions. \nCopyright © 2015 The Financial Times Limited.
