She is recognized with this prestigious distinction for leadership in manufacturing. NAPW is the\nnation’s leading networking organization exclusively for professional women, boasting more than 700,000 members and over 200 operating Local Chapters.\n“I’m pleased to recognize Terri with this important honor,” said NAPW President Star Jones. “Her perseverance, work ethic and leadership qualities are an inspiration to all women.”\nWhat sets Terri Warnstorff apart as a leader in the field of manufacturing is her outstanding depth of knowledge, inspiring creativity and personal courage. She brings hands-on expertise in management, logistics and maintenance mechanics, and is no stranger to traveling as she has lived in New York, Virginia, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Arizona and Japan.\nStrong and steadfast, Ms. Warnstorff worked dutifully as an Instructional Aide in the English Department of Danville Community College in Danville, VA, while working towards her Associate’s degree in Science. After receiving her degree, she was chosen to participate in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company’s highly selective program: Maintenance Apprenticeship. This opportunity led her to a 15-year-long employment with Maintenance Mechanic for Goodyear, where she obtained invaluable skills.\nBravely swimming against the tide, Ms. Warnstorff made a major life decision by moving to Phoenix, AZ, where she spent a year working as a Maintenance Mechanic for Borden Pasta and then acquired a position as a “Group Lead” at Sitix, a Japanese-owned company. Her determination to better herself brought her back to college, earning her Bachelor’s in Business Management while simultaneously working at Sitix.\nDuring her tenure at Sitix, she spent ten crucial weeks in Japan where she wrote the Standard Operating Procedures for the company’s equipment as well as interviewed, coached and lead coworkers. “It was while working in this capacity that I learned how different people can be, and how much we can learn from each other,” said Ms. Warnstorff. She is now acting Supervisor of the second shift Endoscope Repair for KARL STORZ .\nAwards & Accomplishments: National Beta Club / National Honor Fraternity of High Schools; Phi Theta Kappa / National Honor Fraternity of Community and Junior Colleges; Mechanic Apprentice Graduate; Group Wizard Award from the University of Phoenix; Who’s Who American Junior Colleges\nAbout NAPW\nNAPW’s mission is to provide an exclusive networking forum to successful professional women where they can aspire, connect and achieve.
