A favorable ruling would validate the Swiss foodmaker’s insistence its products had been tested without finding abnormal levels of lead, said Naveen Trivedi, an analyst at Trust Financial Consultancy Services, before Thursday’s judgment. \nNestle’s India unit on July 29 reported its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years due to the recall and sales halt on its biggest product. \nThe cost of removing the product from the market led to a one-time exceptional loss of 4.52bn rupees — nearly 1.5 times the average profit in the last four quarters, the New Delhi-based company reported. \n“Nestle can easily regain the momentum that’s been lost,” Mr Trivedi said before the judgment. “If they can prove that technically the government lab tests were wrongly done, they can go to court and seek damages.” \nNestle India’s shares rose 2.4pc to 6,381 rupees in Mumbai, after rallying as much as 5pc \nThe judgment came as Nestle reported a small decline in sales and net profits in the first-half due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the noodle recall. \nThe Swiss company behind Nescafe, Haagen Dazs and Perrier says sales fell to 42.8bn Swiss francs (£28bn) from 43bn a year earlier. Net profit slipped to 4.5bn francs from 4.6bn a year earlier. \nHowever, the results did exceed analyst estimates. Underlying sales increased 4.5pc, the company said, compared with consensus forecasts for a 4.2pc gain. \nThe world's largest food company benefitted from accelerating sales in the Americas, led by KitKat chocolate bars and Dolce Gusto coffee. Revenues in the region grew 5.2pc in the first half, compared with 3.7pc growth in the first quarter, driven by pricing. \nA revamp of some of its ailing frozen-food brands has also shown “promising” initial signs. \nChief executive Paul Bulcke says the results were \"solid even in difficult circumstances\" and that confirmed the company's outlook for growth in the full year. \n“Nestle’s results are surprising, they had a few headwinds with the Maggi noodles in India and a negative currency effect,” said Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. “Lower commodity costs surely provided some relief.” \nThe bottler of San Pellegrino water reiterated its forecast that underly sales will increase about 5pc in the full year, with improvements in margins and underlying earnings. \nSales have missed a long-term goal for average 5 percent to 6 percent annual growth in the past two years. \nTo bolster growth, Nestle has expanded into skin health, having last year spent $5bn on acquisitions in the sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:48:34.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
