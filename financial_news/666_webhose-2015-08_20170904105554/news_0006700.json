Sales had been lower only in December 2014, when the downturn in demand was accentuated by seasonal factors. \n“While the story on a month-by-month basis shows a slight bounceback in demand, it remains far below the level seen before the pension changes were announced,” Iress said. “Despite the June improvement, annuity activity is still 36pc below the level of two years ago.” \nThe main alternative to buying an annuity, “income drawdown”, is growing in popularity, the report said. Statistics from the Association of British Insurers show that the number of drawdown contracts in the first quarter was higher 72pc than a year ago. \n“With an increasing number of investment products hitting the market now all the changes are in play, drawdown will continue to become more commonplace,” it said. “Annuity sales won’t rebound to their historic peak, but the moderate climb in interest in June does highlight how they remain an important, and often appropriate, option for retirees. \n• Five scenarios where annuities are still the best bet \nAnnuity rates have also recovered slightly. The average rate for a standard single-life annuity at age 65 reached a six-month high of 5.1pc in June, compared with 4.86pc in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T12:16:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
