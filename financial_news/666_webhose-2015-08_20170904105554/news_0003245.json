Bloomberg by Lucille Keen Looking for a new job?\nYou're not alone, according to research from employment social networking site LinkedIn which has found the average number of active job seekers in Australia has increased to 31 per cent, up from 22 per cent last year.\nThe LinkedIn Talent Trends 2015 Report, based on a survey of 1400 Australian LinkedIn members, found when it comes to what entices people to accept a new job, 41 per cent of Australian professionals cited compensation as the main factor.\nThis was followed by 36 per cent of respondents saying a better work/life was the determining factor, and 29 per cent saying the company's culture was most important.\nDigital jobs boom LinkedIn Talent Solutions director Jason Laufer, whose job is to consult to companies on the way they change the way companies hire, said new skill sectors such as digital, big data, user experience design, cloud, social and mobile are the driving forces behind the increase in job seekers.\n\"There's a huge talent pool out there that has been untapped,\" Mr Laufer said.\n\"Our biggest surprise was the growth of the technology customer experience which is driving the demand.\"\n Currently 76 of the ASX top 100 companies use LinkedIn to hire talent.\nMr Laufer said organisations who could not compete on remuneration could still attract candidates through a good company culture.\nTargeting the passive job seekers The report also found 69 per cent of Australian professionals were currently passive and are interested in hearing from a recruiter, even if they are satisfied with their current role.\n\"So really seven in ten people are considering moving roles, but might not be actively looking for a job at the moment,\" Mr Laufer said.\nHe said organisations were using LinkedIn to target certain professionals and the company had seen an increase in the number of \"sponsored jobs\", where companies use the platform to narrow down the field.\nHe said 45 per cent of professionals use LinkedIn to network for career opportunities.\nIt also found that both active and passive talent are pro-active and spending time on activities to strengthen their professional brand, with 45 per cent of Australian professionals surveyed claiming networked for professional purposes and 38 per cent explored professional development activities.\n\"There are candidates in the market who aren't necessarily looking but would move if it was the right organisational culture, remuneration and other factors,\" he said.\nHow to stand out on LinkedIn Mr Laufer insists an up-to-date profile picture on the site is necessary as is a comprehensive summary of experience and skills.\nHe added it was important to build a professional brand on LinkedIn.\n\"You also need to show your experience outside of your job, like volunteering,\" Mr Laufer said.\nThe interview The report found candidates are using the interview process to size-up their potential employer as much as companies using interviews to vet potential employees.\nFor 76 per cent of those surveyed, the interview experience was a major factor in deciding whether they join the organisation or continue searching and 70 per cent of professional candidates want to meet their future manager during an interview and 57 per cent said a post interview follow-up helped improve the experience.\nFinance and engineering jobs are out there The good news for Australian executives looking for work is that the start of the new financial year has seen a solid return to growth with finance and engineering jobs particularly pushing national demand for Australian executives to over 5 per cent according to E.L Consult's Executive Demand Index.\nSearch firm E.L Consult managing director Grant Montgomery said the increase in demand was a good forward indicator for the Australian economy and expects that executive employment will trend up for a least the next three months.\n\"The level of executive demand which is a good predictor of business and consumer spending growth as well as general employment levels has now turned around after two consecutive months of falls.\n\"New South Wales's, whose proportion of total new positions has risen from 32 percent in June 2011 to 45 percent in June 2015, has now piped 50 percent of the national demand reflecting the relatively strong state of its economy,\" Mr Montgomery said.\n\"At the same time Western Australia's executive demand has halved from 13 percent in 2011 to 6 percent in July making it the worst performing state overall.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T06:08:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
