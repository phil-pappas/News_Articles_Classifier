A total of 20,800 had arrears of between 5pc and 7.5pc of their mortgage balance, while 10,300 were overdue on payments amounting to between 7.5pc and 10pc, while a further 23,400 had arrears of more than 10pc. \n\"Across all measures, mortgage arrears and repossessions are continuing to improve. We continue to see some amplification of the downward trend in repossessions, which may bring into question our repossessions forecast for 2015 as a whole,\" said the CML's director general Paul Smee. \n\"This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for home owners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low-level arrears for stretched households in particular.\" \nThe figures come as increasing numbers of homeowners are remortgaging their properties in an effort to lock in low interest rates before the Bank of England decides to start making borrowing more expensive .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:03:05.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
