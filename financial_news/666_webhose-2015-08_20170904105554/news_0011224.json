Cox | Submitted On August 20, 2015 \nForex markets have grown quickly in terms of overall popularity but many traders lack some of the basic knowledge that is needed before any real-money trades are placed. If newer traders do not take the time and energy that is needed to fully research these topics, it can be very easy to encounter significant losses in a very short amount of time. To avoid this, a few key points should be remembered and the first part of the process is to select a reputable Forex broker. \nWhen looking to find a reputable Forex broker, the first point to consider is whether or not the offering deals with fixed spreads or variable spreads. When a dealer offers fixed spreads, it essentially means that the fees charged in each trade will not change depending on the conditions of the market. When a dealer offers variable spreads, there is no guarantee made on the spread costs that are seen at any given time. This usually means that spreads will increase during periods of high market volatility, and then decrease during periods of low market volatility. \nBroker Reviews \nOnce you have chosen the broker spread type that is most appropriate for your trading style, it is a good idea to start looking at some of the most commonly travelled market sites so that you can read the experiences other traders have had with a particular broker. I have been trading in the foreign exchange markets for more than 10 years and one of the most stable brokers I have used is FiboGroup Europe , which offers some of the most flexible spread arrangements available in the market. \nIn addition to this, FiboGroup offers a wide selection of market research materials that can be used for real-money positioning. This can be very helpful because there is really no substitute for good old fashioned educational when dealing with the financial markets. So it is always a good idea for traders to read a wide variety of broker reviews so that you can determine whether or not a specific broker is going to be able to structure a trading agreement that is actually suitable for your investment goals. \nWith all of this in mind, it becomes much easier to get started when you are trading within the foreign exchange arena. If you have not conducted your proper research in these areas, it can be a big mistake to start trading in these markets using real money. But once you have found a broker that we well-reviewed and meets your trading cost expectations, it becomes much easier to limit potential losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T16:12:10.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
