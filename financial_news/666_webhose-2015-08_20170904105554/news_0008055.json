The SPX closed higher last week, marking six consecutive weeks alternating between gains and losses,\" Jonathan Krinsky, the Chief Market Technician at investment firm, MKM Partners, based in Stamford, Conn., wrote in an Aug. 16 note to clients. \"It remains in the narrowest trading range in history, and as a result, the SPX's weekly Bollinger Bands are as narrow as they have been in over twenty years.\" \nThe S&P 500 index is up 2.07% this year. The Index has not registered a 5% pullback all year. \"Since 1928, there have only been five years without such an occurrence, and only one in the last 50 years ('95),\" Krinsky wrote.

From a technical standpoint, the stocks all have charts that are generally \"below all of their rising moving averages, and have poor relative strength vs. the S&P 500. The presumption is they continue to underperform in the intermediate-term,\" Krinsky wrote. \nHere's the list. And when you're done be sure to check out the 26 stocks to buy , according to MKM Partners. TheStreet added ratings from TheStreet Ratings for another perspective. \nTheStreet Ratings , TheStreet' s proprietary ratings tool, projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends. Based on 32 major data points, TheStreet Ratings uses a quantitative approach to rating over 4,300 stocks to predict return potential for the next year. The model is both objective, using elements such as volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows, and subjective, including expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. \nBuying an S&P 500 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 16.56% return in 2014 beating the S&P 500 Total Return Index by 304 basis points. Buying a Russell 2000 stock that TheStreet Ratings rated a \"buy\" yielded a 9.5% return in 2014, beating the Russell 2000 index, including dividends reinvested, by 460 basis points last year. \nNote: Year-to-date returns are based on Aug. 17, 2015 closing prices. \nIndustry: Utilities: Non-Telecom/Independent Power Producers & Energy Traders Market Cap: $8.7 billion Year-to-date return: -6.5% \nThe AES Corporation operates as a diversified power generation and utility company. It owns and/or operates power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. \nTheStreet Ratings: Hold, C+ TheStreet Said: \"We rate AES CORP (AES) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed - some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. Among the primary strengths of the company is its respectable return on equity which we feel is likely to continue. At the same time, however, we also find weaknesses including unimpressive growth in net income, generally higher debt management risk and weak operating cash flow.\" \nHighlights from the analysis by TheStreet Ratings Team goes as follows: The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. In comparison to the other companies in the Independent Power Producers & Energy Traders industry and the overall market, AES CORP's return on equity significantly exceeds that of the industry average and is above that of the S&P 500. AES CORP's earnings per share declined by 50.0% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. This company has reported somewhat volatile earnings recently. But, we feel it is poised for EPS growth in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, AES CORP increased its bottom line by earning $1.09 versus $0.37 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($1.27 versus $1.09). AES, with its decline in revenue, slightly underperformed the industry average of 9.9%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues fell by 10.5%. The declining revenue appears to have seeped down to the company's bottom line, decreasing earnings per share. The debt-to-equity ratio is very high at 5.37 and currently higher than the industry average, implying increased risk associated with the management of debt levels within the company. Along with the unfavorable debt-to-equity ratio, AES maintains a poor quick ratio of 0.71, which illustrates the inability to avoid short-term cash problems. The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has significantly underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Independent Power Producers & Energy Traders industry. The net income has significantly decreased by 48.1% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from $133.00 million to $69.00 million.
