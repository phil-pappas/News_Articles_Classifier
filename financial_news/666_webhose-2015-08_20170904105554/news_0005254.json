I am planning to sell it for Rs 13 lakh. What will be the cost of acquisition?\n— Pradeep Solanki\nAs per Section 55 of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 (the Act), where a capital asset became the property of the assessee before April 1, 1981, the assessee has the option to take the higher of fair market value of the asset as on April 1, 1981, or the actual cost of the asset as the cost of acquisition. Thus, you may take Rs 50,000, or the fair market value of the plot as on April 1, 1981, whichever is higher, as the cost of acquisition.\nIt may be noted that as per Section 55A of the I-T Act where the assessing officer is of opinion that value adopted by the assessee as on April 1, 1981, is higher than the fair market value as on that date, he can make reference to the valuation officer for determining the fair market value of the property.\nWhat are the tax implications if I keep my flat unoccupied and stay in a rented house?\n— Akhilesh Prasad\nAs per Section 23 of Income-Tax Act, if a person owns more than one house, then the annual value of one of the houses of his choice can be considered as nil and the annual value of the other house(s) shall be determined as prescribed for the purpose of computation of income from house property. However, in your case, as you own only one house, there shall be no tax implications in this regards, unless the said property is actually rented out.\nI made a cash gift of Rs 7 lakh to my wife in 2013 and she bought jewellery with that money.

In FY15, I earned Rs 5 lakh by writing articles. Am I entitled for a maximum deduction of Rs 3,00,000 under the I-T Act in respect of such income?\n— Abhishek Kumar\nUnder Section 80QQB of the Income-Tax Act, a deduction of actual royalty earned, subject to maximum Rs 3,00,000 is available to the author of a book against such royalty/copyright fees subject to fulfillment of certain specified conditions. The term book, however, does not include brochures, commentaries, diaries, guides, journals, magazines, newspapers, pamphlets, school text-books, tracts and such similar publications. Hence, you are not entitled to avail the benefit of the said deduction. However, actual expenses incurred for earning such income are allowed under Chapter IV of the Act.\nI received a residential flat as a gift from my father in February 2007. The flat was purchased by my father in March 1999 for Rs 10 lakh and now want to sell the flat. From which year would I get the indexation benefits for computing capital gain?\n— Sundar Rao\nWhile computing the capital gains arising on transfer of a capital asset acquired by the taxpayer under a gift or will, indexed cost of acquisition should be computed with reference to year in which the previous owner first held the asset and not the year in which taxpayer became the owner of asset.\nIn this respect, you may rely on the decision of Bombay High court in the case of CIT vs Manjula J Shah and the Delhi Tribunal in the case of Kamal Mishra vs ITO and can claim the indexation benefit considering the base year as financial year 1998-99.\nThe writer is founder of RSM Astute Consulting Group\nSend your queries at fepersonalfinance@expressindia.com\n 18, 2015 12:02 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T02:59:30.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
