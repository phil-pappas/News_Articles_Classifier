Michele Mossop Share on twitter by John Stensholt Nine Entertainment chief executive David Gyngell has defended the conduct of NRL boss Dave Smith and rugby league administrators during recent broadcast rights negotiations.\nMr Smith has come under intense fire from News Corp after the NRL moved to negotiate a free to air agreement instead of dealing with all rights, including pay televisions rights, held News Corp's Fox Sports.\nNews Corp and the other TV networks have said the NRL did not have a tender process or inform other parties, including Telstra, about the Nine bid.\nMr Gyngell told The Australian Financial Review Mr Smith had extracted the maximum value from Nine for the free to air rights, for which the network will pay $925 million over five years for four matches a round from 2018 onwards.\n\"I think Dave Smith did a good job with it but I saw that as someone who has made Nine pay more for rights than at any other time in the history of free to air television in Australia,\" Mr Gyngell said.\nNine also will gain digital streaming rights for the four games, which will be played on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, and Sunday afternoon.\nPay TV rights The NRL still has to negotiate pay TV rights, with Qatari giant beIN Sports understood to be keen to get involved in the bidding, and Fox Sports likely to re-engage with the NRL.\n When asked if he had tried to warn either the NRL that it risked damage to its reputation by excluding News from the rights talks, or if he had told Fox Sports he was doing a deal without them, Mr Gyngell said: \"I really do like the sound of my own voice, but to say that I was out there giving advice to the NRL or Fox Sports or Telstra or anyone, isn't quite right.\"\nMr Gyngell said he had paid a big amount for rugby league, but said it was crucial for Nine to have big sports rights, including cricket.\nThe AFL took advantage of the NRL rights stoush by moving to cut a big deal with News Corp last week, which is paying $1.3 billion of the record $2.508 billion, six-year contract the AFL has signed with Seven West Media, Foxtel and Telstra.\nUnder that deal the AFL eventually will have 4.5 games on average per round on free to air television. The NRL was keen to go close to matching that by having four games on free to air.\nIf it can get competitive tension for pay TV rights, the NRL could eventually reap $1.7-$1.8 billion for its total rights over five years. Though that figure would be less than the AFL on an annual basis, rugby league has lower costs than the AFL.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JohnStensholt"], "published": "2015-08-26T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:07:15.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
