Hill, president of the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association and the owner of funeral homes in Hartford and New Haven. \n\"We're just finding it more and more difficult to help families in need,\" he said, adding how many funeral homes across the state are already absorbing some of the funeral-related costs for the impoverished and people receiving public assistance who are eligible for the state's funeral benefit. \nAccording to the National Funeral Directors Association, the national median cost for an adult funeral in 2012 was $7,045, or $8,343 if a vault is included. Those figures, however, include services like a hearse, memorial cards and staff for a viewing. \nConnecticut began providing a stipend of up to $1,200 in 1984 to help pay funeral and burial expenses for people who die without the ability to cover the costs. That figure was increased to $1,800 in 2006. But this year, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy's budget proposal reduced the benefit to $1,000, noting how it would be more in line with surrounding states, saving $1.7 million a year. \nUltimately, the final two-year, $40.3 billion budget set the amount at up to $1,400, which is higher than any nearby state, according to Connecticut's Department of Social Services. Connecticut's new budget also increased the amount that a deceased person's family can contribute from $2,800 to $3,800 and still be qualified for the stipend. \nConnecticut spent about $4.5 million for 2,557 funerals and burials in fiscal year 2014. DSS said the payments ranged from under $250 to $1,800, which accounted for 82 percent of the grants. The final benefit amount can be reduced if the deceased has financial assets. \nNicole Paquette, a past president of the state funeral directors association and a licensed funeral director and embalmer for 20 years, was surprised to learn the benefit might be reduced. \n\"I thought, 'Wow, the state of Connecticut is really in a bad way,'\" Paquette said. \"There are other barrels to pick from. This is a group that has no representation in the legislature. Who is going to represent the indigent population? In a way, it's morally wrong.\" \nPaquette, who works for Windsor-based Carmon Community Funeral Homes, expects funeral homes will still provide the service, despite the $400 reduction. She said funeral homes often become advocates for the indigent, especially if there are no surviving relatives. The homes petition the probate court to receive custody and control of the body. They also track down whether there's a family grave or if the deceased was a veteran, qualifying them to be buried at the State Veterans Cemetery in Middletown. \n\"They ultimately need to be buried, have some kind of dignified service and rest in peace,\" she said. \nConsidering the charges to open and close a gravesite start at $1,000, Paquette said the option of a casket burial is out of the question when only the state stipend is available. Instead, a simple cremation is provided. She told state lawmakers at a hearing in February that it was already challenging to stretch the $1,800 to provide limited services. \nHill has made it a mission to educate people about the importance of planning for final arrangements. In the economically depressed north end section of Hartford, where he's owned a funeral home for the past three years, Hill appears at churches and senior centers to encourage people buy life insurance or set aside enough money to over final expenses. He warns them not to depend on the state to cover the bill, saying that's only meant to help provide some assistance with the total cost. \nHill acknowledges the turnout can be hit or miss. \n\"The funeral business is a tough sell. You have to come to grips with your own demise,\" he said. \"I understand it, I really do. But when people are sitting down trying to make funeral arrangements for a loved one and they're faced with the cost associated with the event, the lightbulb comes on.\" \nThink your friends should see this?
