Marina Neil by John Kerin Prime Minister Tony Abbott has denied he pushed the US to request Australia extend its airstrikes in to Syria.\nFairfax Media, citing government sources, reported on Wednesday that the driving force behind the US request which Mr Abbott said on Monday \"came some weeks ago\" was the Prime Minister's office and that Mr Abbott had initiated the phone call.\nBut Mr Abbott, providing further details on a phone call he had with President Obama in early August, said the US President had rung him from Air Force One primarily to discuss advancing the proposed US led Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal.\nHe said it was in those circumstances that the discussion moved on to Australia's involvement in Iraq and President Obama had told Mr Abbott he would be glad to have Australia extend its air campaign in to Syria.\n\"All I know is that I was on the other end of the phone line, the President was on Air Force One, the President had initiated this phone call to talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and after I initially expressed my condolences for the terrorist shootings in Chattanooga, the President then raised with me the Syrian situation.\n\"He said that he would be very glad if Australia would do more, including air strikes, and I said that I was happy to consider that request and our officials would talk and now this request has come from the Pentagon,\" Mr Abbott said.\nMr Abbott says he will take \"the next week or so\" to consider Australia's response to the US request.\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop strongly hinted on Sunday that despite a messy civil war in Syria Australia would likely have legal backing to extend its air campaign because the area of Syria occupied by Islamic State-Daesh was an ungoverned space.\n She suggested that though the Abbott government would act on its own independent advice extending airstrikes was likely to be legal under the principle of ensuring the collective self defence of Iraq and its people - a principle being relied on by the US and Canada and other middle Eastern States involved in Syrian airstrikes.\nLabor Leader Bill Shorten says he will await more information from government about the legal basis for Australia's expanded role.\nFormer Labor Foreign Minister Bob Carr said on Wednesday the extension of airstrikes in to Syria was justified because Australia had a \"moral obligation\" to stop Islamic State/Daesh committing atrocities against civilians.\n\"The West has got a moral obligation to act where it can be argued there's a chance of saving civilian populations from mass atrocity crimes that seem to follow quickly when IS takes control of territory,\" Mr Carr told the ABC.\nBut Mr Carr conceded the legal situation was unclear and it would hard to operate without the backing for a resolution from the United Nations Security Council.\nBut he said there were legal arguments to support action in Syria.\n\"I'm not saying its ironclad, I'm not saying it can be applied to what's happening in Syria clearly and unequivocally,\" he said.\nThe RAAF has six fighters stationed in the Middle East carrying out bombing raids in Iraq.\nA Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft is supporting US and allied airstrikes in Iraq and Syria and a KC30 air to air refueller is refuelling allied aircraft which are carrying out bombing raids in Iraq and Syria.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-pushed-for-us-request-to-join-syrian-air-strikes-20150825-gj7kfh.html"], "published": "2015-08-26T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:11:25.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
