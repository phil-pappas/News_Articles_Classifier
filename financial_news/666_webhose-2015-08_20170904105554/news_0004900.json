The Graduate Engineering programmes are conducted by Etihad Engineering in partnership with the Higher Colleges of Technology in Abu Dhabi and the Abu Dhabi Polytechnic.\n\nThe initial two-year, college-based part of the programme will be followed by a further two years of practical, on-the-job training. The comprehensive programme will allow trainees to obtain a B1 (Engineering License in Airframe and Engines) or B2 (Avionics) License in Aviation Engineering Technology, accredited by both the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA).\n\nJeff Wilkinson, Senior Vice President of Technical for Etihad Airways, said, \"This is a great opportunity for young people from our equity partners to immerse themselves within an organisation of engineering excellence. In doing so, they will acquire the knowledge, skills and experience which will enable them, and the organisation they represent, to grow personally and professionally.\"\n\nThe UAE and Italy already share strong links through a partnership between Etihad Airways and Alitalia, with the airlines acting as the official global carriers for Expo Milano 2015. The carriers have played a key role in bringing international visitors to the event, with an estimated eight million attendees travelling to the conference by air.\n\nThe training opportunity is an extension of the close working relationship between the two nations and is providing development opportunities for young Italians in the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:48:57.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
