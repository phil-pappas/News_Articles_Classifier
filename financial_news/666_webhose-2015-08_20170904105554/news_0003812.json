Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Jamie Freed Emirates, the largest foreign carrier to and from Australia and an alliance partner of Qantas Airways, will shake up its local management team for the third time in two years as Australasian head Rob Gurney departs for a new role in the United States.\nThe new job will place Mr Gurney at the forefront of a nasty dispute between the Gulf carriers and the three biggest US airlines , which have accused Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways of receiving billions of dollars of unfair subsidies and want their rights to fly to the US to be restricted.\nIt also comes as Emirates continues to grow in the Americas. On Thursday, the Dubai-based carrier announced plans to fly from Dubai non-stop to Panama City, Panama from February. The flight will pip Qantas's Dallas-Sydney flight as the longest in the world, based on distance.\nBarry Brown, the former Australasian head who had been promoted to a more senior Dubai-based role overseeing operations from the Middle East to Australia to Hawaii in 2013 , will return to Australia to run its local operations from September. He will continue to report directly to Emirates chief commercial officer Thierry Antinoria.\nUnusually, Emirates did not distribute a public announcement of the management changes as it had for previous changes, although they were confirmed by a spokesman for the airline on Friday.\nMr Gurney, a former Helloworld chief executive and senior Qantas executive, had only been in his role since October, when he replaced Bryan Banston. Mr Gurney will become the carrier's senior vice president North America based in New York, reporting to Hubert Frach, divisional senior vice president of commercial operations west. Mr Gurney, who has a house in Los Angeles, has been a regular visitor to the US even when heading the Australasian operations.\nOne of his key tasks locally had been managing the carrier's relationship with Qantas. Emirates and Qantas were once fierce competitors, but they have had a close alliance on flights to Europe, the Middle East and Asia since 2013.\nEarlier this week, Emirates also announced plans to boost its capacity to and from Australia , by upgrading its daily Melbourne-Singapore-Dubai flight to its flagship A380 product from the current Boeing 777-300ER. It will now offer six daily A380 flights from points in Australia.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.theage.com.au/business/aviation/qantas-and-virgin-try-to-have-it-both-ways-as-aviation-battle-heats-up-20150611-ghm5gm?skin=smart-phone", "https://twitter.com/Jamie_Freed", "http://www.traveller.com.au/emirates-to-snare-worlds-longest-flight-title-from-qantas-with-boeing-777200lr-jetliner-on-dubaipanama-route-giyv8l"], "published": "2015-08-14T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:06:00.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
