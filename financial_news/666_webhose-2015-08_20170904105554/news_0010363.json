The wonderfully named iRobot company may find that its name is a grave liability in the future. \nCompanies with the word \"robot\" in their names may be the obvious early targets: ABB's ABB Robotics , FANUC Robotics , Future Robot , KUKA Robotics and Softbank Robotics . \nWe can expect a rapid series of name changes as the awareness of job losses spreads. But humans now are far more sophisticated than they were in the early days of industrialization in Britain. It will be a trivial matter for hackers sympathetic to the people who lose jobs to track down every company in the supply chain of robotics. \nThe more interesting development will be the reaction in the political sphere. You can expect to see left-leaning governments take up the concerns of the middle- and low-income workers who will be most affected by robotics-related job losses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:29:58.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
