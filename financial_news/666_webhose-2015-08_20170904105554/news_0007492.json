It also published a photo of Sana'. \nThe bin Laden family is one of the most prominent business dynasties in the kingdom. \nA spokeswoman for the British police on Friday told Reuters that there were four people on the aircraft when it crashed, but it did not state their identities. \nWithout identifying the victims, the Saudi Ambassador to Britain offered condolences to the bin Laden family on the embassy's Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) account and said the mission was working with British authorities to investigate the incident and organise the speedy transfer of the bodies for burial in the kingdom. \nOsama bin Laden, the accused mastermind of the 2001 attacks on the United States, was killed by U.S. special forces in a raid on his hideout in Pakistan in 2011.
