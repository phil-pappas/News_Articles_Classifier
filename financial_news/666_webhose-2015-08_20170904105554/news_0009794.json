[ Latest interest rates predictions] \nJulian Hodge Bank has launched a market-leading one-year fixed-rate cash Isa that pays 1.8pc, overtaking a previous version that paid 1.75pc and which shared top spot in the best-buy tables with accounts from Tesco Bank, Holmesdale Bank and Shawbrook Bank. \nMeanwhile, West Bromwich Building Society has upped rates on its easy-access savings account the WeBSave Easy Saver, which is outside of an Isa. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) pays 0.75pc on balances above £1,000, 1.10pc on £5,000 or more and 1.55pc on £15,000 or more. \n• Calculator: How your investments might grow with monthly saving \nThe account is not the best around. That comes from RCI Bank and pays 1.65pc on balances above £100. \nThe latest rises come despite news that am increase in the Bank of England rate from 0.5 pc is now not expected before October 2016, a shift from the position of August 2016 a week ago and March 2016 a month ago. \nThe latest setback has been the turmoil in the Chinese stock markets and fears that demand in the global economy may be faltering. Commodity prices, which have been driven by growth in China, have fallen and this could reduce inflation in the UK, something that makes a rate rise harder to justify. \nThe Julian Hodge Bank cash Isa requires a minimum deposit of £5,000, while transfers from previous years’ Isas are allowed and accounts can be opened by post. \n• The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \nThe leading one-year cash Isa accounts all come small, or “challenger”, banks that are hoping to break the dominance of the traditional high street giants. \nIn fact, the major banking names Lloyds, Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) , HSBC, Santander are RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) are largely absent from the best-buy tables for any type of savings account. \nNationwide, the UK’s largest building society, provides the leading variable rate cash Isa, paying 1.6pc, and First Direct and M&S Bank, both arms of HSBC, offer the leading regular savings accounts, both paying 6pc. \nBeside these the best paying accounts in all categories come from small building societies and challenger banks. \nSusan Hannums, director at independent savings advisers Savingschampion.co.uk, said: “ Fixed rate ISAs are continuing to be improved by providers and we will hopefully see more market leaders launched in the coming days and weeks, as it increasingly looks as if savers may be getting a second bite of the cash ISA cherry, after such an underwhelming ISA season this year.” \n• Reader service: Open an ISA, SIPP or trading account with Telegraph Investor", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T13:58:09.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
