They are my retailer of choice. I respect what they are trying to do with regards to sustainability and farming for the future, and I'm appalled at how they, and other retailers, think girls should dress,\" she said. \n\"Because I respect Woolworths, and because they are my retailer of choice, I really expect better from them. I would hope they'd be industry leaders in this, and other, regards,\" she added. \nChaplin said she was relieved to find that there were so many parents who felt the same way as she does about how children should dress. \n\"I really worried that I was in the minority, and that other parents didn't mind - thinking that otherwise Woolworths wouldn't stock those clothes.

The retailer was inundated with requests to attend the sessions immediately after posting about it. (Update: Woolworths has now added two more sessions in Durban on Wednesday. Each focus group is limited to six people.) \nAsked what she would like to come from the affair, Chaplin said she would like Woolworths to change its clothes and the way it views girls. \n\"Blur those gender lines a little. Stock clothes that encourage girls to live their lives to the fullest, not sit on the sidelines looking pretty, waiting for some prince to come and rescue them!\" she said. \n\"I want my little warrior princess to grow up knowing that she can be anything and do anything. And I want the messages she's exposed to along the way to support that. Girls shouldn't have to wear tummy-exposing t-shirts that say 'Sweet,' when boys get to wear t-shirts that say 'Life is better when you explore.'\" South Africa \nTwice last year, President Jacob Zuma said South Africa was ready for a woman president and quite enigmatically hinted … see more » Copyright © 2015 The Daily Vox.
