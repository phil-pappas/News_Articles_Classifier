Rachel Morrison by John McDonald Dope is the surprise of the year. One might be excused for expecting an updated blaxploitation film, a mawkish coming-of-age saga, or a typically vulgar, sentimental teen comedy.\nInstead, Rick Famuyiwa​ has given us a movie that is fast and funny, with a clever plot and crisp dialogue.\nWhy can't Australian directors make films like this?\nInglewood, California, is a place where black kids grow up in poor, crime-ridden neighbourhoods, with no prospects. Success in Inglewood means being a prosperous drug dealer, but Malcolm (Shameik​ Moore) is the bright boy at school who has set his sights on Harvard.\nWheeler dealer: bad means good for the kids in the hood. In this story he finds that the path to university requires an unexpected detour through crime.\nWe recognise Malcolm right away as that stock character of American high school comedies – the nerd. Raised solely by his mother, his personal style consists of a flat-top hairdo, a shirt buttoned to the neck and a pair of gleaming, oversized sneakers.\nMalcolm is a straight-A student with two equally nerdy friends: Jib (Tony Revolori, the bellboy from The Grand Budapest Hotel ), and Diggy (Kiersey Clemons) – a gay girl who dresses and acts like a boy.\nThe technical term used in this film is \"geek\". The three geeks share the same musical interests, and even have a punk-style band, although Malcolm's passion is for '80s and '90s rap. For his application to Harvard he has written an essay on Ice Cube's Today Was a Good Day . The school counsellor, Mr Bailey (Rick Fox), advises him to get a serious topic, and to set his academic aspirations at a more realistic level.\n The rapping crew lean back on the footpath in the film 'Dope'. It's sobering to think that a song by a '90s rap artist now qualifies as a \"classic\".\nLife in Inglewood is a perpetual struggle for survival in which you might be relieved of your shoes or bike at any time. In avoiding one of these encounters, Malcolm and his friends meet Dom (A$AP Rocky), a friendly drug dealer who offers protection in return for a favour.\nMalcolm must go ask a girl, Nakia (Zöe Kravitz), to come along to a party Dom is giving. She agrees to attend if geeky Malcolm will also be present.\nThe three friends go to the party, which degenerates into a shoot-out and police raid. To save his skin, Dom hides his drug stash and a gun in Malcolm's backpack. It is only when the school metal detector goes off the next day that Malcolm finds what he's carrying.\nRaw deal Having been unwittingly drawn into the drug scene, Malcolm can't simply give back the goods. Dom is now behind bars, and a group of heavies are after the dope. When he tries to drop it off with a man named AJ, he finds that his chances of getting to Harvard are now vitally dependent on his ability to deal.\nThis he does in an ingenious, geeky manner, with the help of a hacker named Will (Blake Anderson) whom the friends met at a band camp years ago.\nI can't say any more about the story without spoiling it. The refreshing part of the film is its unapologetic amorality. Famuyiwa implies that drugs are such an intrinsic part of American life they offer the opportunity for a small business success story.\nHe also suggests there is very little chance for a student from a place such as Inglewood to get into a top college, no matter how good his grades. In such circumstances one must apply Machiavelli's famous dictum: the end justifies the means.\nThere's an improvised feel to Dope , as if Famuyiwa has taken the opportunity to insert favourite details of popular culture whenever he can. The music conversations have the ring of truth, and could only have been scripted by a fan.\nThe film is both an homage and a spoof of movies such as John Singleton's Boyz n the Hood (1991), and similar tales of life in America's poor, predominantly black suburbs, with Famuyiwa's directorial style often seeming closer to Quentin Tarantino than Spike Lee. Like the former, he has a knack for combining violence and comedy.\nThe characters are all stereotypes but nonetheless engaging, partly due to the quality of the acting.\nThe action moves so quickly one never has time to dwell too long on the implications of the story, although there is a dark, cynical aspect to this cinematic romp.\nIt is a portrait of a capitalistic world that rewards initiative on either side of the law. It's a world in which you have to be bad to be good, where doing wrong is the only way to ensure the right outcome for yourself.\nNo wonder the word \"bad\" means \"good\" in ghetto vernacular, and that \"dope\" can mean both stupid or cool.\nFabergé: the firm that laid golden eggs And now, a word from our sponsor. That could be the opening line of Fabergé: A Life of its Own , an overview of a fascinating subject that manages to sound like an extended advertisement for the brand.\nThe film is credited to no fewer than seven countries – the home nations of leading Fabergé collectors. They must be suitably pleased to see a full-length documentary that will help drive the value of their expensive purchases to even greater heights.\nThe blandness of Peter Mark's film is frustrating because the House of Fabergé makes for a great story. Its founder, Carl Peter Fabergé, was born in St Petersburg in 1846, under the reign of Tsar Nicholas I. By 1885, he was established as jeweller \"by appointment\" to the Crown. Until his company was nationalised by the Bolsheviks in 1918, Fabergé would run the largest, most prestigious jewellery business in Russia, if not the world.\nMark suggests the key to Fabergé's success was that he was as much an artist as a businessman. His customers recognised an exacting eye for craftsmanship and would pay huge sums to acquire his pieces.\nFabergé's best clients were always the Russian monarchs and nobles who enjoyed a fantasy life of wealth and privilege in a land of crushing poverty.\nThe court had long traditions of gift-giving, but this became a mania during the twilight years of the Romanovs, with expensive gifts changing hands on every possible occasion. The tsar had to be the most generous of all.\nFabergé produced exquisite small pieces that circulated among the nobility, and rare, spectacular objects for the royal family. The most famous were the easter eggs the tsars gave as presents to their wives and mothers. These eggs were made of precious materials, and always contained a \"surprise\".\nThe first egg, of 1885, was made from gold covered in white enamel. Inside was a golden yolk, which in turn opened to reveal a multicoloured golden hen. Inside the hen, a small replica of the imperial crown was concealed.\nOther famous eggs included the Memory of Azov (1891), which commemorated a long voyage undertaken by the young Nicholas II, before he became tsar. Inside a lustrous, dark green shell there lay a tiny golden replica of the boat on which Nicholas had travelled.\nThe Peacock egg of 1908 contained a small mechanical peacock that could walk and spread its tail.\nReclaiming the brand At the height of his fame, Fabergé employed 300 craftsmen at his St Petersburg headquarters, with masters running their own small firms under the company umbrella.\nThere was also a branch in Moscow that made pieces in a distinctly Russian style, and a shop in Bond Street, London, that sold jewellery and carved animals to the kings and queens of Europe. Edward VII and his wife, Alexandra, were keen clients; as was Edward's favourite mistress, Mrs Keppel.\nBy the beginning of World War I, Fabergé represented a dream of luxury that was largely nostalgic. In an era of modernist upheaval the firm's elaborate neoclassicism looked like a memento of another age.\nThe years following the revolution found the Bolsheviks selling off most of their Fabergé treasures to foreign collectors. Among the most avid purchasers was Armand Hammer, who peddled his collection around the United States, leaning heavily on the tragic, romantic story of the last tsar and his family.\nNot only did Hammer help create a craze for Fabergé among wealthy Americans, he encouraged his friend, Sam Rubin, to use the name for a new brand of perfume. This opened the door to a bewildering range of \"Fabergé\" products, including shampoo, toilet paper and \"the great smell of Brut 33\".\nIn 2009, a group of investors bought up all the Fabergé trademarks and licences, with the idea of restoring the brand's status as a maker of high-end jewellery. This is presented as a happy ending, but it was really an exercise in clearing away the trash to capitalise on the firm's history and reputation.\nThe new Fabergé is once more making rare and expensive easter eggs to be sold to billionaire clients, while older examples keep turning up in unusual places. The most recent story concerns the third imperial egg of 1887, which was bought at an auction in a Midwestern American town by a local scrap dealer, and sold for a $US30 million profit.\nThe only problem with this triumphant conclusion is that the glories of Fabergé belong to a particular moment in time, and every new creation – regardless of its rarity and value – feels like a pastiche.\nCarl Peter Fabergé may have seen himself as an artist but for today's super rich he survives only as a label.\nDope\nWritten & directed by Rick Famuyiwa\nStarring Shameik​ Moore, Tony Revolori, Kiersey​ Clemons, A$AP Rocky, Zoë Kravitz, Blake Anderson, Chanel Iman, Rick Fox, Roger Guenveur​ Smith\nUS, rated MA 15+, 103 mins\nFabergé: A Life of its Own\nWritten & directed by Patrick Mark\nUK/US/Switzerland/Russia/Monaco/Germany/\nFrance, rated G, 87 mins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T21:59:51.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
