The S&P 500 also plunged more than 3 per cent and closed at 1979.89, down 64.84 points. European markets also closed sharply lower with the German DAX closing lower by 2.95 per cent, while the FTSE was down 2.83 and the French CAC down 3.19%.\nThe single biggest reason for the fall was the sharp slowdown in growth rate in China, which is a major market for companies from US to Europe. \nThe Chinese PMI data which was reported on Friday was weaker than reported confirming trends of a sharp slowdown. \nThe other reason for the sharp fall was the slump in commodity prices, including oil and fears that the US Federal Reserve may hike interest rates in Sept. \nMarkets may open lower once again next week as the trend is likely to continue. \nGoodReturns.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-22T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T06:38:49.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
