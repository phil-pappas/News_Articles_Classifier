Agreement broke down on the finer points of how to make the retirement incomes system more sustainable. Louie Douvis by Sally Rose The National Reform Summit has urged the government to stop clinging to its promise not to make any changes to superannuation and open the door to a comprehensive review of retirement income policy.\nCalls for a review to consider potential changes to super taxes, age pension rules, health and housing together received unanimous support on Wednesday.\nThose that backed calls to enshrine in law the purpose of super to provide for retirement income and then consider any future changes to the rules within the context of a broader retirement incomes policy review included: Business Council of Australia president Catherine Livingstone, Councils on the Ageing Australia chief executive Ian Yates, and Australian Council of Trade Unions chief executive Tony Sheldon.\n\"It is a complex system with interdependencies and changes to any part must be approached with caution,\" Ms Livingstone said.\nHowever, agreement broke down on the finer points of how to make the retirement incomes system more sustainable, amid debate over whether tax concessions on superannuation are too generous and need to be better targeted.\n\"Martin Parkinson, like his predecessor and successor, as head of Treasury has highlighted the need to recognise that tax concessions on superannuation are unsustainable,\" COTA boss Mr Yates said.\nACTU's Mr Sheldon said there was an urgent need to lift the super adequacy of low income workers, casual workers and contractors.\n\"This raises a simple question of how much super contribution should people be making to have enough in retirement and there is some evidence that is upwards of 15 per cent.\"\n The Committee for Sustainable Retirement Incomes Policy's Andrew Podger disagreed.\n\"Whether we need to increase mandated savings or not is a dubious point. If we implemented the Henry review right, we might be able to get by with a super guarantee of 10 per cent,\" he said.\nThe super guarantee is stalled at 9.5 per cent, with plans for it to rise to 12 per cent.\nCentre for Independent Studies Fellow Simon Cowan called for the family home to be included in the age pension asset eligibility test.\nHe said the current exclusion of the home from the asset test disadvantaged the poorest 25 per cent of age pensioners who do not own their own home.\n\"There is scope to unlock some of the $65 billion worth of wealth pensioners hold in their homes through reverse mortgages. This could reduce the annual cost to government of delivering the age pension by $14.5 billion, and it would mean 2.37 million pensioners would have an average increase in annual retirement income of just under $6000.\"\nAge discrimination commissioner Susan Ryan said the gender gap in super adequacy required \"special attention\" and proposed that all parental leave and carer's leave, whether paid by employers or the government, should have the super guarantee paid as part of it.\nThe Grattan Institute's John Daley said more needed to be done to bring down the cost of running the superannuation industry, which he estimates at $21 billion a year.\n\"That's the equivalent of more than 1 per cent of gross domestic or more than half of what we spend on age pensions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T02:39:56.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
