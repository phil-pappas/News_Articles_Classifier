Uncertainty surrounding the general election and the Greek debt crisis clipped appetite for new shares, LSE Group said. The amount raised on the group’s British and Italian markets through new stock issues fell 18pc year-on-year to £23.1bn. \nLSE Group’s capital markets nevertheless saw revenues rise 4pc to £170m, or a fall of 1pc including adverse currency movements, with fees from secondary trading boosting the total. \nLSE Group has spent the last few months rolling up its index providers to create FTSE Russell, which posted revenues of £171m as more institutions pay for financial data. The firm said its open-access model had encouraged tie-ups with rival markets, such as the recent deal with the Chicago Mercentile Exchange to index US futures contracts. \nMeanwhile, Russell Investment Management, the other part of last year’s Russell acquisition , generated revenue of £498m. The division is up for sale and LSE Group said it had received “a number of expressions of interest”. China's CITIC (HKSE: 0267-OL.HK - news ) is reportedly the frontrunner to take over the business. \n“The decision to sell has been made after a careful and thorough analysis and decided on a range of factors, not short term or seasonal factors, or even long term structural growth,” said Xavier Rolet, chief executive. \n“We think it’s a very good asset and where the industry is converging today, but as a company we are an infrastructure provider and that decision will not change.” \nThe LSE’s clearing house LCH.Clearnet, which suffered from the loss of a contract with the London Metals Exchange last September, posted a14pc fall in revenues to £149.1m. \nThe LSE also said it was delaying plans to introduce a third, mid-day auction to the markets that would pause equities trading to enable institutions to place large orders without immediately moving the market. The shake-up is intended to attract big investors away from trading in dark pools, and will now be introduced in the first quarter of 2016. \nMr Rolet said the technology was in place, but banks and inter-dealers were reluctant to change their trading practices in November as scheduled, because they expected to be scrambling to comply with the new Mifid II directive to harmonise European market practices, which comes into force in early 2016. \n“The whole industry is waiting and will have to implement [the rules] in record time,” he added. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in LSE Group rose more than 2pc in early trading. The firm said it would pay an interim dividend of 10.8p, up from 9.7p last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T13:17:48.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
