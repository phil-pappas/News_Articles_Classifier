GM shares are down about 5.0 percent since Monday, and are now nearly 9.0 percent below an important benchmark, their $33-a-share initial public offering price. Ford shares are down about 3.0 percent since Monday. \nSTANDING BY THEIR BETS \nDespite falling stock prices, fund managers contacted by Reuters who had large positions in U.S. companies dependent on China for revenue growth said that, while they were not cutting ties yet, they remain wary. \n“I’m still a bull. I think long-term we’ll see a lot more stimulus, building bridges and infrastructure to build demand like they did in the past,” said Gary Black, co portfolio manager of the Calamos Hedged Equity fund. \nHowever, Black, whose company owns 13 of the 20 large-capitalization companies Goldman Sachs identified as the most dependent on China for revenue, added that he is also looking to add technology and media firms such as Google that do not have exposure in China. \nThe group Goldman identified as most reliant on China includes Micron Technology, Applied Materials, and Mead Johnson Nutrition. \nGerry Frigon, president and chief investment officer for Taylor Frigon Capital Management in San Luis Obispo, Calif, which manages $175 million, said that he has not sold any of his holdings of China-dependent companies such as Yum Brands based on the devaluation of China’s currency. \n“We view these kinds of issues as kind of short-term blips along the way to a transformation to a consumer society that is not going to stop,” Frigon said. \nChris Carter, portfolio manager of the $442 million Buffalo Growth Fund, meanwhile, said he has sold some auto parts suppliers that do a lot of business in China, though he declined to name them. \nBy contrast, U.S. auto parts makers could benefit from a cheaper yuan to the extent that they export components from China to customers in the U.S. or Europe, but it could also make vehicle parts made by Chinese rivals more competitive. \nJohnson Controls Inc, which is in the process of spinning off its automobile components businesses, plans to “closely monitor these currency movements and related China growth projections,” company spokesperson Fraser Engerman told Reuters. However, he said, the devaluation “has no impact on our commitment to grow our business in China both long-term and short-term.” \nStill, JCI shares are down about 5.0 percent since Monday. \nSemiconductor maker Skyworks Solutions, which Goldman Sachs estimates receives 83 percent of its revenue from China, has seen its stock fall about 20 percent since June. \nYet Robert Crosby, portfolio manager of the $6.3 billion Victory Munder Mid-Cap Core Growth Fund, said he would be more inclined to add to his holdings of the stock than sell it. \n\"I think the sell-off is almost a gift-wrapped opportunity,\" he said. \n(Corrects paragraph 14 to add dropped words \"whose company\") \n(Reporting By Joe White, Meredith Davis, Tariro Mzezawa, Ross Kerber, Bernie Woodall, Rodrigo Campos, David Randall; editing by David Gaffen and Clive McKeef)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T07:27:29.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
