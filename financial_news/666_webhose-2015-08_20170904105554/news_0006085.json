John Woudstra by Trevor Hoey Companies involved in the production and distribution of consumer food products have been under the spotlight for some 12 months now and while some have not lived up to expectations two standouts are Select Harvests and Tassal Group.\nKey features setting them aside from industry peers are their ability to identify ways in which to enhance their businesses and at the same time dilute risks that are often difficult to mitigate in the course of farming and cropping.\nSelect Harvests Weather conditions provided some challenges for almond producer Select Harvests in the first half of calendar 2014. A wet harvest substantially diminished yield and quality leading to reduced volumes and increased costs.\nImportantly, management has taken steps to acquire new landholdings with existing plantations, as well as surplus acreage to plant its own crop.\nSelect Harvests currently has approximately 13,000 acres of almond trees with 60 per cent owned and 40 per cent under lease. The group also has an unplanted land bank of 5000 acres.\nThe increased acreage has not only provided additional revenue streams, but because the group's orchard portfolio is now spread across various geographic regions in NSW, Victoria and South Australia the risks of crop deterioration resulting from extreme weather events has to some extent been diluted.\nManagement highlighted in mid-July that world almond prices remained firm driven by strong demand and restricted global supply. The United States is the largest global almond producer and consumer.\n News that US crop receipts were down 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis and export shipments were down 9.4 per cent on a year-to-date comparison indicates a continuation of a trend which has emerged in recent years.\nCalifornia is the main growing region in North America and generally their orchards are at a stage of maturity where they have passed optimum yielding conditions. By comparison, most of Select Harvest's crop is at its peak.\nAnalysts at Morgans CIMB were impressed with management's July update and they maintained their buy recommendation while increasing the 12-month price target from $10.00 to $13.35.\nTassal Group Tassal Group's shareholders received a double dose of good news as the fiscal 2015 financial year ticked over. On June 30 the group announced it had extended its fresh salmon supply agreement with Woolworths and would also be supplying product to Aldi.\nThe Woolworths supply agreement which includes distribution to Queensland, NSW and Western Australia was extended for a further three years. The Aldi agreement involves the supply of fresh salmon to the group through De Costi Seafoods in Queensland and NSW, replacing the supply of imported salmon.\nTassal has for some years now been focusing on growing its domestic market supply rather than looking to develop export sales. This has worked in its favour as it has received strong support from major retailers and per capita salmon consumption has increased in Australia.\nThe other promising news emerged only a day after the agreements were signed when management announced it had agreed through its wholly owned subsidiary Tassal Operations to acquire the De Costi Seafoods business.\nConsideration for the acquisition included an upfront payment of $50 million based on current maintainable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $10 million.\nOverseas salmon producers have lost whole harvests in recent years to amoebic gill disease. While Tassal hasn't been confronted with this issue, salmon farming remains a delicate operation and the addition of the De Costi business, which generates earnings from the distribution of a wide range of seafood products provides useful diversification of revenues.\nAnalysts at JPMorgan have an overweight recommendation on the stock with a 12-month price target of $3.92.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T17:00:05.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
