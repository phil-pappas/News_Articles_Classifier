At a time when governments are flailing, its powers are needed more than ever.”\nThe list includes some of the “most thoughtful leaders” in the corporate and nonprofit realms, as well as a number of scholars who bring both perspective and insight to the public discourse on business.\nOn Grameen Bank founded by Muhammad Yunus, Fortune said the bank has demonstrated that “microcredit” could be self-sustaining and even profitable.\nGrameen has loaned USD 17.4 billion to 8.7 million borrowers since 1983, most of them impoverished women.\n“Globally, micro-finance accounts for at least USD 60 billion in loans annually and has reached 135 million people, according to the World Bank one reason Yunus’ accolades include the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize,” Fortune said.\nOn Roshan, it said during the 2009 elections in Afghanistan, Taliban insurgents trained their weapons on cellphone towers belonging to Roshan, the country’s largest telecommunications provider.\nIt said 18 towers worth USD 14 million were bombed but Roshan refused to pay the extortion money that would have protected them from such acts.\n“Perhaps no other company on this list operates under such stress, and yet Roshan has become a foundational cornerstone for a new, developing Afghanistan,” it said.\nFounded by the Aga Khan Development Network in 2003, Roshan has given six million Afghans cellular service; previously many had to cross the Pakistani border for phone access.\nThe company has plowed more than USD 600 million back into the country’s infrastructure, with telemedicine projects, schools, and soup kitchens a part of Roshan’s network of compassion, it added.\n 21, 2015 3:20 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T20:22:39.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
