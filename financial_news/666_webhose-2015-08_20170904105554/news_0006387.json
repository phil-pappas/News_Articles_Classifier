By Ashley Armstrong | Telegraph – 47 minutes ago 0.0001 0.0000 \nThe sprawling Chinese conglomerate Fosun has opened up shop on Little Britain in the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) , a sure fire sign of its insatiable appetite for deals \nThe phrase 'Little Britain’ brings to mind Vicky Pollard and the cast of colourful characters created by Matt Lucas and David Walliams. But the arrival of one of China’s most acquisitive companies in the City street of the same name means that, for international dealmakers at least, Little Britain is taking on a new significance. \nFosun, the sprawling conglomerate run by billionaire Guo Guangchang, has quietly taken an office at 20 Little Britain, near St Pauls. A senior banker commented that Fosun’s decision was “signalling its intention to take part in more European deals”. \nFosun is still a relatively unknown name in the Western world. But Mr Guo has been dubbed “the Warren Buffett of the East” because of his empire-building. His name is becoming more familiar as the pace of Fosun’s acquisitons increase. \nAlready this year Fosun has emerged victorious after a two year battle to take control of French holiday group Club Med; paid £92m for a 5pc stake in travel group Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) ; took control of circus troupe Cirque du Soleil ; and bought out Silver Cross, the traditional pram brand, which has enjoyed a renaissance thanks to being wheeled out by the Duchess of Cambridge and the growing Royal family. \nFor the past two years Fosun has cropped up on every dealmakers’ list of potential bidders to call whenever they are trying to flog a business. This is partly because overseas bidders typically pay a higher premium to gain a foothold in Europe. But the Chinese firm’s growing track record has also gone a long way to boost its credibility. \nFosun has separate deal teams for its healthcare, financial and lifestyle divisions. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) can dispatch small armies of British and American business (Other OTC: ARBU - news ) schooled negotiators to boardroom meetings. One City adviser called Fosun “very savvy and experienced for a Chinese firm”. \nHowever, different time zones and a ten-hour flight to get parties around a deal table has frustrated delicate negotiations. Now Fosun can operate more efficiently in European office hours. Despite repeated calls, it is still not entirely clear who is running the show in the London team. \nAccording to Companies House, Xuetang Qin registered the business at its rented offices, while a team of Oxford-educated Chinese born investment directors and analysts have also been employed. As further evidence that lower-ranking staff still kowtow to their superiors, advisers at Fosun say they do not have the authority to say who has the authority in the office. \nNevertheless Mr Guo’s confidence in London as a financial hub has also been emphasised by Fosun’s recent €500m bid to takeover merchant bank BHF Kleinwort Benson (Brussels: RHJI.BR - news ) . “We believe London as a global financial centre and Frankfurt as financial centre for continental Europe and clearing centre for the Renminbi to be natural choices for Chinese people to invest in Europe” , Mr Guo said on revealing his banking ambitions. \nMr Guo is banking on the growing desire among wealthy Chinese to invest overseas. This has, if anything, become even more pressing during the recent intense stock market volatility. \nThat turbulence has also been prompted by a devaluation of the yuan, making foreign acquisitions more expensive. However, City bankers don’t believe this will be more than a short-term hump. \n“The currency devaluation may make it marginally more expensive but I can’t see it having an impact on Fosun halting its acquisition program,” said Peter Gray at Cavendish who advised on Fosun’s takeover of Silver Cross and its joint venture with Resolution Property. \nAlready this year Chinese companies have bought $23.2bn worth of European businesses, 14 of them in the UK worth $2.1bn, according to Dealogic figures. \nHowever, Miranda Carr at Espirito Santo points out that those looking to raise capital for international expansion may run into difficulty raising funds for their overseas push. In the first half of this year Chinese companies equity fundraisings were 130pc higher than the year before with 424bn yuan raised. In June alone 135bn yuan was raised, but this kind of activity collapsed by half in July when it dropped to just 62bn yuan last month, according to figures from the Peoples Bank of China. \n“Opportunistic purchases might be delayed as it becomes more expensive to fund deals,” said Ms Carr. “But the purchasing power of the reminbi for most private companies is still pretty strong.” \nFosum probably doesn’t think of itself as an opportunistic buyer. It has the much bolder ambition of becoming “a world-class investment group”. Silver Cross may have been a tired pushchair brand to Westerners, but Fosun has plans to transform it into a platform for its nursery and healthcare business that it has set up to cash in on China’s childbirth boom following the scrapping of the country’s one child policy. \nMany credit Fosun’s rapid growth on the peculiar Chinese business practice of “guanxi”. Guanxi literally, and inconsistently, translates to mean relationships, but the word is considered much more of a cultural concept to do with building networks or connections - an Eastern twist on “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours”. Now Fosun has a London office the Chinese conglomerate can become even better acquainted with City-style back scratching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T01:10:47.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
