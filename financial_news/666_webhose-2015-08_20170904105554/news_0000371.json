No more. Doesn’t matter what promotion or new product McDonald’s currently offers up as bait. These days, if your dinner wasn’t stretching its legs in a local field seven minutes ago, it’s hopeless.\nBy the same token, it used to be that the sun could not throw light on Goldman’s secrets. As a point of pride and matter of policy, Goldman never sputtered a public word about its schemes. Strategies were fossilized in the heads of men who would rather be struck dead than emote. Goldman was unimpeachable, unaccountable and unknowable. No more. These days, Goldman is public, preening and punching out the past; it is officially doling out its trading-secret strategies, which are presumably more complex than “buy low, sell high.”\nIronies, again, abound. One can imagine McDonald’s deploying proprietary trading strategies gleaned from Goldman until one can swap a box of McNuggets and two praline McFlurries for the post of United States treasurer, which has basically been a Goldman birthright.\nBut there is a serious lesson at root here too. Some industries (and, yes, newspapers, I’m looking at you) are comically slow to adapt to change. Times were too good for too long; moreover, those in the industry were ambivalent about the changes afoot so only embraced their new world at half speed. Since reinvention is difficult to pull off and comes at a risk, ambivalence is a killer.\nWall Street, though, has already survived a number of enormous shifts in its business, including fee deregulation in the mid-1970s, which meant that full-fee stock trading, once the lifeblood of the industry, all but dried up within a generation.\nNow electronic trading is taking over, so Goldman, ever attuned to potentially ruinous change, is reinventing, even if that means going against all the creepy secrecy it has always held dear. Goldman is essentially transforming itself into a Silicon Valley open-source software creature like Google GOOG, +0.51% and Facebook FB, +0.03% Meanwhile, McDonald’s can’t keep up with Shake Shack SHAK, -9.18%\nAs a result, the days of McDonald’s leading us to early deaths might be nearing an end. But luckily for our great nation, Goldman will remain a vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity for decades to come.\n ", "external_links": ["http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/23/investing/mcdonalds-earnings/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-to-give-out-secret-sauce-on-trading-1439371800"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T19:51:09.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
