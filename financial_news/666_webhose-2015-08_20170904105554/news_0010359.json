However, it suspended synthetic crude oil production and is developing a recovery plan, Canadian Oil Sands said late on Sunday.\nSynthetic crude for September delivery traded as strong as $2 a barrel below U.S. crude futures on Monday morning, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, up from a discount of about $4.60 a barrel last week.\nThe operator of Canada's largest synthetic crude project said on Saturday it was investigating the causes of an early morning fire at an upgrading plant.\nThe fire broke out a few hours after the province's energy regulator announced it was shutting in 95 pipelines operated by Nexen, one of the partners in the project, because of safety issues identified following a large oil-related spill in July.\nSyncrude is a 326,000 barrel-per-day mining and upgrading project, where mined oil sands bitumen is upgraded into refinery-ready synthetic crude. It produced an average of 261,500 bpd this year to date, according to its website.\nThe operations are a joint venture of seven partners: Canadian Oil Sands Ltd, Suncor Energy Inc, Imperial Oil Ltd, Nippon Oil subsidiary Mocal Energy Ltd, Murphy Oil Corp, China's Sinopec , and CNOOC subsidiary Nexen.
