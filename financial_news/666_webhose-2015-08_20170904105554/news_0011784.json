Immediately prior to completion, Paddy Power shareholders would receive a special dividend of 80 million euros ($91.9 million). \nThe new group would be the market leader online in the UK with a share of 16 percent, according to industry data, passing a merged Ladbrokes Coral group on 14 percent, as well as William Hill and privately owned Bet365. \nPaddy Power Chairman Gary McGann would keep his role in the combined group, while its CEO Andy McCue would become COO. Betfair finance chief Alex Gersh would also stay put. Gambling on mergers \nThe gambling sector is seeing a wave of mergers. \nLast month bookmakers Ladbrokes and Gala Coral struck an all-share deal, creating a 2.3 billion pound betting group. 888 and GVC Holdings are locked in a bidding war for online gambling firm Bwin.party Digital Entertainment . \nUnder the proposed merger, Corcoran said both brands will operate side by side in Europe. Paddy Power's portfolio of almost 600 betting shops, more than half of which are in Britain, will also remain part of the plans. \nBetfair is an exclusively online business, best known for its technology which allows gamblers to bet against each other. Alongside its core exchange product, the firm is also targeting a larger share of the broader sports betting market. \nAnalysts pointed to significant scope to cut costs through the removal of duplication within the two businesses. \nDavy Stockbrokers declared \"the two best quality companies in the European online gaming sector are on the verge of merging\". \nPaddy Power is the larger of the two with a market capitalisation of 3.46 billion euros ($4 billion) at Tuesday's close, versus 2.43 billion pounds ($3.81 billion) for Betfair, which has seen its shares rise by 140 percent in a year on the back of strong revenue growth. \nBoth firms also gave trading updates on Wednesday. \nBetfair said core earnings rose 19 percent in the three months to July 31, despite higher UK tax charges. Paddy Power said first half operating profit had grown by a third to 80 million euros against the same regulatory headwinds.
