Simon Bennett by Matthew Smith Investors looking for a catalyst to boost returns in what will be a low earnings growth environment for the foreseeable future should look no further than this month's reporting season.\nWhile many analysts are tipping limited upside surprises given the relatively uninspiring prevailing macroeconomic conditions, there are a couple of listed companies that could be primed for a pop in coming weeks.\nThe two most prominent candidates include JB Hi-Fi and Cabcharge.\nBoth companies show up positively on an earnings screen developed by investment firm Goldman Sachs.\nIn addition, these companies have among the largest short seller interest on the ASX.\nBoth companies have their own story as to why some professional investors are betting their share prices will drop. But there is also competing evidence to suggest reported earnings could take the market by surprise.\nGoldman considered the 10-year earnings reporting track record of JB Hi-Fi and Cabcharge – along with a handful of other ASX200 companies – and found they have a history of beating forecasts.\nBar to surprise The investment firm also points out median sell side analyst forecast could be masking a more favourable view and expectations of these companies coming into earnings season could be exceptionally low, meaning the bar to surprise is relatively easy to clear.\nAcross the board, growth expectations for stocks coming into this reporting season are historically low, according to Matthew Ross, Goldman Sachs portfolio strategy and quant managing director.\nThis year's growth expectations are almost half the lowest growth expectations coming into second-quarter reporting season for the past five years.\n\"Over half the universe I track has been downgraded over the last few months,\" Ross says.\nCompanies struggling It's no surprise to Goldman and other investment firms that companies are struggling to find earnings growth in the current low growth world – in August last year Goldman took the seemingly drastic measure of lowering its long-term risk-free rate and cutting its equity risk-free premiums – the yardsticks it uses to value companies.\nThis was the first time Goldman had changed its method of valuing discount cash flow in some 20 years to reflect the lower growth world we live in, Ross says.\nThe lower expectations Goldmans and the rest of the market have for earnings means \"we won't see a lot of beating, but we won't see a lot of missing, either,\" he says.\nSifting through the market's expectations in search of patterns and incongruities could be just enough to give savvy investors an edge.\nJB Hi-Fi and Cabcharge have the best record for beating expectations, next to Fairfax Media, the owner of The Australian Financial Review .\nGrowth expectations for the two companies are already among the lowest in the market, and earnings' revisions leading into this reporting season has been limited compared to both companies' peers.\nRoss says all these factors, combined with the heavy short interest the respective stocks, could point to a potential surprise on the upside.\nAccording to the most recent ASIC short positions report, Cabcharge and JB Hi-Fi had 12.6 and 6.5 per cent of their respective outstanding shares in the hands of short sellers.\nHit to revenue Short sellers have piled into Cabcharge in the last year as the company has restructured and taken hits to its revenues as competition with new digital competitors has intensified. Still, Cabcharge remains debt-free as its shares have sold off dramatically.\nJB Hi-Fi, a perennial target of short sellers, was punished when it announced its net profit had slipped in February, falling short of analyst forecasts. The company has maintained its full-year profit guidance despite a step-up in sales in the March quarter.\nMost analysts have not adjusted their earnings revisions for JB Hi-Fi coming into this reporting season, according to the Goldman analysis.\nCompanies that also rank high in Goldman's analysis of potential upside surprise candidates this reporting season include Fairfax Media, diversified construction and engineering company Downer, travel retailer Flight Centre and medical solutions manufacturer Ansell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T01:12:59.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
