Here’s five must do activities in New Zealand.\nCatch a thrill at Shotover River\nAt Shotover River in Queenstown, one can literally have the ride of life as you can zip down the canyons in a jet boat, making sharp turns and doing 360 spins. And if that isn’t enough to make your heart drop to your stomach, head upstream to the Canyon Swing, where you will jump from a cliff 109 metres high, flying over the river on a 60m freefall before completing a few massive swings. With over 70 swing styles, travellers can do everything from sit in a deck chair to hang upside down from your feet to shooting down a slide.\nMilford Sound\nTake in the beauty of Milford Sound\nMilford Sound is New Zealand’s top tourist destination. With incredible landscapes of waterfalls, mirrored waters, tall peaks and lush rain forests, this fjord has been named by some as the eighth Wonder of the World (not to mention one of the key filming locations for Lord of the Rings). You’ll spot incredible wildlife like penguins, whales, dolphins and the rare species of blue duck which is native to New Zealand.\nWaitomo Caves\nGo deep in the Waitomo Caves\nA visit to the Waitomo Caves should be high on everyone’s bucket list. The site is home to thousands of glow worms, which are native to New Zealand and radiate their beautiful glow throughout the dark caves. Take a boat tour through Glow-worm Grotto in two million year old caves and marvel at the glowing strands of worms overhead.\nTravellers can also opt to do a heli-hike tour\nHike the Glaciers\nLocated on the South island’s West Coast, this destination for adventure seekers offers up twin glaciers for you to hike: Franz Josef Glacier and Fox Glacier. Travellers can also opt to do a heli-hike tour of Franz Josef glacier, where they’ll take an exciting, scenic flight to the top then strap on their gear and head out on a two-hour guided hike of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Make sure you pack your camera, because this hike will take your senses into overdrive.\nHot springs\nGo for a dip in the hot springs\nAfter experiencing all of the heart-pounding adventure activities that New Zealand has to offer, take some time to relax in the warm water of the natural springs scattered throughout the country. On Contiki’s trips through New Zealand, travellers go on an included excursion to Hanmer Springs, a legendary hot spring location set amidst forests and mountains. The freshwater hot pools range in temperature from 28-42 degrees Celsius, so you can relax your muscles after a few days of climbing glaciers and luging down mountains.\n 10, 2015 5:39 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T09:36:28.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
