If the market drops further, soon-to-be-retirees should actually try to save more money.” \nCox said history shows that if one continues to save during a market crash, it does not take long to make their money back. He added if someone has more than ten years until retirement, they should do nothing different during the current correction. If a person has between ten and two years until retirement, they should make sure they have a diversified portfolio of global stocks and bonds — with a target-date or risk-based fund being good in that regard. 1 of 3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:00:05.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
