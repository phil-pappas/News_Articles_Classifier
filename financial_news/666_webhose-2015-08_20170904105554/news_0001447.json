Changes in the rules around mortgages and the introduction of the new pension freedoms mean that more people than ever before are looking for or are in need of financial advice,” said Ms McDermott. \n“The review is an opportunity to look at how the market is working right across the piece and has the potential to radically change the advice landscape to the benefit of both firms and consumers.” \nTracy McDermott, who becomes interim chief of the Financial Conduct Authority next month, will co-chair the review \nOne key problem in the market currently is that banks used to offer financial advice, but many exited the market when the Retail Distribution Review (RDR) rules came into force at the start of 2013. Advisors were told to charge customers a fee rather than commission, in a bid to remove the incentive to encourage customers to invest as much as possible in the highest-commission products. \nAdvisors also had to be independent of any financial institution, meaning an advisor at one bank could have to recommend more products at a rival institution, making the process less attractive. In addition, the re-training costs were considered too high by some of the banks . \nThe result is a substantial gap in the advice market. However, officials argue that there was a problem in the market long before the RDR changes, as advice was typically only sought by those with substantial wealth. \nAs a result, the government is also keen to encourage more people with any level of financial resources to seek advice when making major decisions. \n“Making sure that our financial services sector supports working people at every stage of their lives is a key part of our long term plan,” said City Minister Harriett Baldwin. \n“That’s why we’ve launched a major new review to explore what more can be done to make sure consumers can access high quality and affordable advice so they can make informed decisions with their hard-earned money.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T03:27:04.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
