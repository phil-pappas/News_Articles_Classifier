China rate cut drags Aust bonds down AAP â€“ 13 minutes ago Print \nThe Australian bond market has sagged after equity markets got a boost from China's interest rate cut. \nSt George senior economist Josephine Horton said bond prices fell sharply across US and European markets overnight in reaction to China's move to ease monetary policy. \nThe Chinese central bank slashed its benchmark interest rate for the fifth time in nine months in a bid to support the country's collapsing sharemarket. \nShanghai shares dived 7.6 per cent on Tuesday, extending their steepest drop in almost two decades and erasing the year's gains, to closing below the key 3,000 point mark for the first time in 2015. \n\"The rate cuts have taken the edge off risk aversion,\" Ms Horton said. \nShe said US housing data and German consumer confidence figures released overnight also supported risk appetite. \nUS home prices growth ticked lower in June, but remained at a solid annual pace of gains, while German business confidence beat expectations by rising slightly in August. \nBut, Ms Horton said, the resulting fall in bond prices was only a partial reversal, given steady increases during the past week. \nAt 0830 AEST on Wednesday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.355 (implying a yield of 2.645 per cent), down from 97.370 (2.630 per cent) on Tuesday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.240 (1.760 per cent), down from 98.250 (1.750 per cent). \nKEY MOVEMENTS: \n* CGS 5.5pct Jan 2018, 1.739pct, unchanged from Tuesday \n* CGS 4.25pct April 2026, 2.670pct, unchanged \nSydney Futures Exchange prices: \n* September 2015 bill futures, 97.930, unchanged \n* December 2015 bill futures, 98.080, unchanged \n(*Closes taken at 1630 AEST previous local session) \nSource: IRESS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T02:02:07.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
