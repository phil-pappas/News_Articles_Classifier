It’s about 100 billion years or so until all starlight stops being produced,” Driver told reporters.\nDriver, who heads up the GAMA team, says the study set out to map and model all of the energy generated within a set volume of space.\nAll energy in the universe was created in the Big Bang with some portion locked up as mass. Stars shine by converting this mass into energy as described by Einstein’s famous equation E=MC2.\n“While most of the energy sloshing around was created in the aftermath of the Big Bang, additional energy is constantly being released by stars as they fuse elements like hydrogen and helium together,” Driver said.\n“This newly released energy is either absorbed by dust as it travels through the host galaxy, or escapes into intergalactic space and travels until it hits something such as another star, planet, or very occasionally a telescope mirror,” he said.\nThe fact that the universe is slowly fading has been known since the late 1990s but this work shows that it’s happening across all wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared, representing the most comprehensive assessment of the energy output of the nearby universe.\n“The universe is fated to decline from here on in, like an old age that lasts forever. The universe has basically plonked itself down on the sofa, pulled up a blanket and is about to nod off for an eternal doze,” Driver added.\n 11, 2015 2:29 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:05:23.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
