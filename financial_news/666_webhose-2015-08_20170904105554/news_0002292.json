Revenue was also below forecasts as the company saw a 10 percent drop in same-store sales. Lumber Liquidators said it's been hurt by allegations about the safety of flooring products made in China, and that it expects California regulators to file a claim against it. \nApple —Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its rating on Apple to \"neutral\" from \"buy,\" saying iPhone growth is decelerating and that Apple Watch, Apple Pay, and Apple Music will take time to ramp up. \nDish Network —The satellite TV operator earned an adjusted 70 cents per share for the second quarter, 25 cents above estimates. However, Dish also reported that it lost 81,000 subscribers during the quarter, compared to 44,000 a year earlier. \nTime Warner —Time Warner earned an adjusted $1.25 per share for its latest quarter, 22 cents above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts on strong TV licensing and video game-related results at the company's Warner Brothers unit. \nPriceline Group —The travel website operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of $12.40 per share, above estimates of $11.98. Revenue was also slightly above analyst forecasts, with a better than expected increase in gross bookings. \nDiscovery Communications —Discovery missed estimates by 4 cents with quarterly profit of 44 cents per share, with revenue slightly below forecasts. The cable programmer was hurt by a stronger dollar, despite growth in international distribution revenue. \nWendy's —The restaurant chain earned 11 cents per share for its latest quarter, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating analyst projections. The company said it continues to make progress with its brand transformation, with same-restaurant sales and profit margins increasing. \nWalt Disney —Disney is putting pressure on the Dow Jones Industrial Average after its quarterly revenue missed estimates even though its profit of $1.45 per share beat expectations by 3 cents. Disney was impacted in part to a weaker euro, which hurt revenue at Disneyland Paris. Disney also noted \"modest\" subscriber losses at ESPN as viewers shift to digital viewing. \nActivision Blizzard —The company reported adjusted quarterly profit of 13 cents per share, beating estimates of 8 cents, and revenue was well above analyst forecasts. The video game maker was helped by increasing sales of games like \"Call of Duty,\" and raised its full-year revenue and profit forecast. \nEtsy —Etsy lost 7 cents per share, 1 cent less than forecasts, and revenue was slightly above expectations. However, the crafts website operator saw higher marketing expenses during the quarter, and said those costs are continuing to increase. \nFirst Solar —First Solar earned 93 cents per share for its latest quarter, swamping estimates of 36 cents, and the solar equipment maker's revenue was also well above forecasts. It also gave an upbeat outlook. \nTravelers —Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman will step down December 1, to be replaced by the head of the insurer's business and international unit, Alan Schnitzer. Fishman will become executive chairman, and said a neuromuscular condition is the reason he has chosen to step down now. \nZillow —Zillow lost 1 cent per share for its latest quarter, far smaller than the loss of 26 cents that analysts had been predicting. The real estate website operator's revenue exceeded estimates, helped by a sizable jump in users as well as the acquisition of rival Trulia. \nDreamWorks —DreamWorks lost 13 cents per share for its latest quarter, half of what analysts were forecasting. The movie studio's revenue exceeded estimates, helped by the success of the movie \"Home.\" \nLendingClub —LendingClub earned an adjusted 3 cents per share for its latest quarter, 1 cent above estimates, and the online lending marketplace also saw revenue exceed forecasts. The company said high satisfaction rates are among the factors helping it cut its customer acquisition costs. \nMotorola Solutions —Motorola got a $1 billion investment from private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, according to the New York Times . Motorola will use the investment to help it expand its communications offerings. \nQuestions? Comments?
