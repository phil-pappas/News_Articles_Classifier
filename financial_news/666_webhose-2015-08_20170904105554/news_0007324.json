Many Puerto Ricans are leaving the island, whose economy has been at or near recession for almost a decade, for the mainland U.S.\nS&P downgraded the University of Puerto Rico, the largest on the island, in June to 'CCC-' because of its significant dependence on revenue from the government. A delay or reduction in appropriations could have a serious effect on the university, according to S&P.\nThe ratings agency also downgraded University of the Sacred Heart, a private institution, this month to 'BBB-' from 'BBB' because of decreases in enrollment and the island's economy.\n\"Declining enrollment could jeopardize tuition revenue if the number of students decreases sharply,\" according to S&P. \"In turn, if management teams are not able to cut expenses to match enrollment levels, operating performance could suffer.\"\nPrivate institutions are vulnerable to the island's economy, making the universities and colleges less affordable and creating enrollment pressure, according to the ratings agency. There are also fewer high school students graduating in Puerto Rico in recent years, S&P said.
