Bloomberg Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates Westpac is tightening credit policies for interest-only mortgages, an area where financial regulators have raised concerns about bank underwriting standards.\nThe country's biggest lender to landlords last week told brokers of changes requiring new interest-only borrowers to be tested against their ability to make principal, and interest and fees payments over the \"residual\" period of the loan after the interest-only period had ended.\nAustralian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman Wayne Byres singled out the issue as a concern in a May speech.\nHe said that if a borrower sought a 30-year loan with a five-year interest-free period, only a minority of banks assessed the borrower's ability to make principal and interest payments over the remaining 25 years â€“ the approach Westpac was adopting.\nInstead, Mr Byres said that \"despite the contractual terms\", most lenders assumed the borrower would make principal and interest payments over the full term of the loan.\nThis assumption allowed banks to \"inflate the hypothetical borrower's apparent surplus income by, in our particular example, around 5 per cent\", Mr Byres said.\nWestpac will also reduce the maximum interest-only period for owner-occupier home loans from 15 years to 10 years.\nThe bank's note to brokers said it was introducing the changes to ensure \"prudent\" risk management in an environment of \"rapidly accelerating house prices\" and \"regulatory developments\".\n \"These changes are required to ensure Westpac continues to apply responsible lending practices in assessing a customer's ability to service existing and proposed debts,\" the bank said.\nInterest-only lending is a part of the home loan market that has entered financial regulators' sights, because of the extra risks for borrowers who do not pay down a loan's principal.\nIt has also been growing quickly.\nMoody's this month repeated its earlier warnings after interest-only loans had reached a record 42 per cent of new loans.\nInterest-only lending is favoured by housing investors, because their interest payments can be deducted from taxable income.\nNational Australia Bank raised interest rates for interest-only customers last month by 0.29 percentage points.\nIt said the move was aimed at curbing investor loan growth.\nHowever, ANZ deputy chief executive Graham Hodges on Friday told a parliamentary inquiry that some customers with interest-only loans attached to offset accounts also paid down their debts more quickly.\nWestpac shares closed at $31.33 on Friday, down from a 12-month high of $39.89 hit in March. The stock has lost 8 per cent in the past year, compared to a 4 per cent fall in the S&P/ASX200 and a 1 per cent rise in financial services stocks in the same period.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/apra-keeps-macroprudential-strictures-on-bank-lending-secret-20150320-1m3nik.html", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/nab-raises-rates-on-interestonly-home-loans-20150727-gildox.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/moodys-says-housing-imbalances-pose-risk-to-banks-20150526-gh9q73.html", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-08-16T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:10:23.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
