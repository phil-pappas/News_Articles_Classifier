Right now, there isn't much of a conviction so it will be a slow grind higher for the dollar.\"\nSpeculators increased bullish bets on the greenback to their highest since early June, according to Reuters calculations and data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. The value of the dollar's net long position climbed to $32.77 billion in the week ended Aug. 4, from $29.79 billion the previous week.\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to trade at $0.7391, with sentiment hurt by a drop in commodities and oil. It was also pegged back by weak data out of China where exports tumbled 8.3 percent in July, their biggest drop in four months and far worse than economists' forecast of a 1.0 percent fall, according to figures released on Saturday.\n\"Chinese trade and inflation data for July disappointed,\" analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note. \"The Aussie is trading lower on the back of the release and in our view there is further scope for weakness especially versus the U.S. dollar and the New Zealand dollar.\" (Editing by Tom Heneghan )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T10:57:00.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
