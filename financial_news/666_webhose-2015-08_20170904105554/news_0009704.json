But irrigation infrastructures cover only 148,000 hectares. \nMozambique has excellent agro-ecological conditions for sustainable agriculture - but much of the potential is unused, Nyusi said, because people have acquired title to land, and then fail to use it for any productive purpose. \nSome people, he accused, have obtained land titles (known as DUATs), but seem to have no viable project to use the land, which is simply lying idle. “We cannot sleep on our wealth, and we will have to do something about it”, he said. \nNyusi also called for a diversification of agricultural production, so that the country ceased to be dependent on just one or two crops. “In agriculture, we have more alternatives, which will make us more sustainable”, he said. \n“Because agriculture is the basis of national development, it is the target of our special attention”, he said. “We created the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, not as a mere semantic exercise, but because we want to transmit the profound message that the fight against hunger and chronic malnutrition is at the centre of our government action”. \nCTA chairperson Rogerio Manuel thanked Nyusi for the government's openness to participate in debates on development.

An approach was therefore needed which “can make the countryside a source of wealth and of the food productivity the country needs”. \nMozambicans, Manuel said, “without depending on the import of agricultural goods, should have the capacity to produce enough food locally”, not just for subsistence but also for the food processing industry.
