EAC is the East African Community; COMESA the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and SADC the Southern Africa Development Community. \nKenya and Uganda are working on framework under which the business community of the two countries can work together to take advantage of the single market of 26 African countries and 700 million people across Eastern and Southern Africa. \nPresident Kenyatta praised the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and its Ugandan partner for signing an MoU on improving trade. \nLast year bilateral trade between the two nations was valued at a tune of $880 million, with Kenyan exports to Uganda standing at $700 million versus imports of $180 million, according to data from President Museveni. \n\"Last year, in keeping with our recent history, the volume of trade between us made Uganda one of Kenya's most vital trading partners,\" said the President. \nHe said if the two countries planned carefully and worked even more closely together then trade volume could triple. \nPresident Kenyatta said international trade and investment are the drivers of international relations and the region needs to take lessons from integration to wider global arena. \nHe said this is the main reason Kenya hosted the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in July 2015 and also plans to host the 10th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in December this year being the first to be held in Africa. \n\"All these initiatives are aimed at strengthening our relations, and our trade, with the rest of the international community. As I said: what we have learned from our relations with you and with the region, we intend to apply more widely,\" said the President.
