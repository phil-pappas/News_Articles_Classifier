Steven Siewert Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell National Australia Bank has signed a commercial arrangement with fintech start-up Simply Wall Street, which aims to make it easier for people to invest in sharemarkets, and will use it to entice back dormant customers.\nThe Simply Wall Street app launched in 2014 and was designed to help new investors begin investing in equities via the Australian Securities Exchange, as well as US and UK sharemarkets. Its new partnership with the NAB Trade division represents a great chance for the start-up to increase user numbers..\nThe app will be used by the bank to reactivate accounts and users who had stopped engaging with its own platform. It represents an interesting move by the bank to harness the work of an emerging start-up, rather than building its own tech to compete.\n\"We've been in discussions with all of the big execution brokers in Australia,\" Simply Wall Street founder and chief executive Al Bentley told Fairfax Media.\n\"They're all trying to work out how to re-engage their lapsed or orphaned users and that's a problem we can help solve.\"\nNew funding The partnership play was key to the start-up's succeeding in closing a new fundraising round. It has raised $600,000 and was led by Michael Quinn, who is the founder of Innovation Capital but led the round as an individual angel investor. The round was made up by individual high net worth investors as well as the Sydney Angel's Sidecar Fund.\nIs is the company's first funding round since graduating from Australia's initial financial technology accelerator program run by AWI Ventures in 2014. This included a $100,000 capital injection used to buy access to the financial information that powers the app's infographics and displays.\n Mr Bentley and his four-person team plan to use funds from the latest round to bring on another developer, as well as finish and launch mobile apps for Apple and Android devices.\nBut the bulk of the money will go towards creating a range of features and strategies to convert 11,000 free users into paying subscribers to the premium version of the app. Included in this version will be the ability to get an instant assessment, through an interactive infographic, of how a portfolio is performing\nHelping investors \"I launched the app after I realised how hard it was to start investing in shares myself – and there have been heaps of those –but our power users are self-managed super fund owners and stockbrokers, which still seems a bit incredible to me,\" Mr Bentley said.\nDespite the infusion of cash and the partnership with NAB Trade as well as several more key alliances in the pipeline, the Simply Wall Street team intends to stay small for at least the next year.\n\"Funding hurries people, and we don't want to rush it. We'd rather stay flexible in case we need to shift what we're doing,\" Mr Bentley said.\nThe team will also be working on securing the data feeds and extending the app to include Chinese, Indian and key European sharemarkets, as only a quarter of the app's users are in Australia.\nThe company hopes to remain based in Sydney but Mr Bentley said they were willing to move to wherever it was best to base the business,. However, Australia made sense at the moment as it enabled the company to take advantage of the federal government's research and development tax rebate.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:04:43.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
