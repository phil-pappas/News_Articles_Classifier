Photo: Rob Homer\nSingaporean internet start-up MyRepublic is raising $150 million to fund its expansion into Australia and other global markets with plans to hire a local managing director by the end of the year.\nMyRepublic has forced prices down in its home market of Singapore by offering super-fast broadband speeds at very low prices. Its outspoken co-founder and chief executive, Malcolm Rodrigues, is highly critical of the Coalition's changes to the $41 billion national broadband network .\nBut despite the criticism, Mr Rodrigues detailed his plans to shake up the Australian internet market by selling products here from mid-2016 onwards. The move could have a major impact on profits at companies like TPG Telecom and Telstra as the NBN becomes their main supplier.\nHe told Fairfax Media that the company's lean operations meant it used a \"1-5-10\" plan. It needs a 1 per cent share of its target market to break-even and expects to hit 5 per cent with a stretch goal of 10 per cent.\nMyRepublic will target five Australian capital cities in its first major push and sell 100-megabit-per-second broadband services with unlimited downloads for $80-$90 per month.\n\"We typically need 10,000-15,000 customers per city [to break even],\" he said. \"The first city will take 18 months [to break even] and the second city might take 15 months with the third city taking 12 months just because you start to get market momentum.\n\"We'll probably put a team on the ground this year and we'll go through all the NBN approvals and testing and then we'll start laying in the infrastructure with some points of interconnect up and running at the beginning of next year.\"\nMyRepublic had originally planned to hit Australia in 2014 and later revised this date to late-2015. But he said both of these targets were delayed because of the NBN's slow construction progress.\nThe telco saves money by focusing on customers directly connected to fibre networks. Despite the delays, however, Mr Rodrigues said NBN would reach enough homes and businesses by the middle of next year to make it worth his investments.\n\"We think we have our strategic partners in place and we're doing a fundraising now for the end of the year,\" he said. \"It's $150 million and that's to fund some of these grow-fast aspirations.\"\nWhile the NBN has many fans and critics, Mr Rodrigues is a man to take seriously. The Toronto, Canada-raised executive was previously a vice president of StarHub International and Wholesale, which went on to win the bid to set up and run Singapore's version of the NBN.\nOne of his fellow co-founders, Greg Mittman, was a senior executive at Alcaltel Lucent - the French company that supplies the NBN in Australia.\nWhen asked about competition during his exit interviews, Telstra's outgoing chief executive David Thodey said it was tier-three disrupters including MyRepublic that the company worried about more than TPG or Optus .\nTelstra also unsuccessfully tried to buy into MyRepublic in 2013.\nMyRepublic has reshaped the Singaporean broadband market and become a credible competitor to giant rivals including Singtel, which owns Optus, despite running on a shoestring budget. It forced an increase in competition by offering 1-gigabit-per-second plans for just $49.99 per month.\nNomura Securities analyst Sachin Gupta described MyRepublic as a small but decently established service provider that consistently executed on its promises in a note to clients earlier this year.\n\"Exploiting NBN structures in various markets is its key objective and now it is looking to expand into NZ, Australia and various other ASEAN markets gradually,\" he said. \"Its brand has gained a lot of traction and features well on various forums, press and social networking sites too, we find â€“ although lack of bundling is a drawback.\"\nBut MyRepublic will have a fight on its hands in Australia thanks to industry consolidation, which has created a market dominated by just four big telco players. Telstra alone has more than 50 per cent of the broadband market and low-cost operator TPG is merging with iiNet to become Australia's second-biggest fixed-line internet supplier .", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/why-tpg-telecoms-david-teoh-bought-iinet-20150727-gil299", "http://www.afr.com/business/telecommunications/new-entrant-to-open-door-to-unlimited-nbn-data-plans-20130819-jh9td", "https://myrepublic.com.sg/"], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:43:33.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
