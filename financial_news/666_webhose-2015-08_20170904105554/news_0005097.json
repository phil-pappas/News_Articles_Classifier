One is a little-used technique called “bond laddering”. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is a technique used by professional portfolio managers and involves blending bonds in a way that gives exposure to the best current rates while also offering the chance to take advantage of better ones as they become available. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas \n• Savings tricks: our 4-step guide to earning a 6.5pc income \nCash savers can use a similar approach - which also gives them access to regular lump sums without forgoing interest. \n= What is the ladder? = \nA bond ladder is a portfolio of bonds that mature at regular intervals. Bond laddering was designed with investment bonds in mind gilts or corporate - but the logic also works with fixed-rate savings accounts. \nFor example, a five-year savings bond ladder would contain five fixed-rate accounts a one-year, two-year, three-year, four-year, and five-year bond. Money is split equally between the accounts and the saver takes interest from each. \n• Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk \nAfter a year, the one-year bond matures. The saver takes the money and looks for the best five-year account, which will typically pay a better rate of interest than the account that has just matured. \nThe two-year account then becomes the next lowest rung on the ladder. When it matures a year later the saver looks again for the best five-year rate, and so the process goes on. \n= What’s the point? = \nThe ladder is a way for those unable to lock their money away for long periods to get a slice of the better returns that longer-dated bonds provide. \nThe table shows the income a five-year ladder based on the best current savings rates would produce after a year, and then after two years if money is recycled into a five-year bond paying the best current rate. If rates improve, the total will be higher. \nDuration Provider Deposit Rate Year 1 Return Year 2 Return 1 year Charter Savings Bank £10,000 2.06pc £10,208 \n2 year Secure Trust Bank £10,000 2.38pc £10,241 £10,487 3 year Charter Savings Bank £10,000 2.65pc £10,268 £10,544 4 year Charter Savings Bank £10,000 2.75pc £10,278 £10,565 5 year Secure Trust Bank £10,000 3.08pc £10,312 £10,635 Reinvestment of initial one-year bond Secure Trust Bank (if still available) £10,208 3.08pc \n£10,527 \nTOTAL (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) £51,308 (ave rate 2.58pc) £52,757 (ave rate 2.79pc) The ladder ensures that the average interest rate you get steadily improves each year if market rates stay the same or improve. In the example, the rate across the ladder is 2.58pc in the first year, then 2.79pc in the second. \nA real advantage is the knowledge that ready cash will be available if needed. The ladder releases chunks of a saver’s cash at predictable intervals, leaving the saver to extend the ladder or keep the money according to their needs. \n= Why now is a good time to start your ladder = \nMarkets are still waiting for the Bank of England to start increasing rates but there are signs it could happen within months. That will push savings rates higher. \nThe best cash rates are already climbing, albeit slowly, as \"challenger\" banks compete to establish themselves. \nThe ladder means you have the chance to take advantage of improving rates as they emerge, yet also get the best currently available. \n= Take the next step and build a retirement income for just a bit more risk = \nFor those willing to take on an element of risk, the ladder offers greater rewards and can even produce returns to rival annuity or drawdown products. \nYields on bonds issued by governments and companies are normally higher than the returns on savings accounts and should also rise if interest rates go up. \nOrdinary investors rarely hold bonds directly, buying through funds instead. Buying them in a ladder means you own them directly and hold them to maturity. \nThis is a crucial difference because, while the value of units in a fund will go up and down with bond prices, allowing bonds to mature means you know the return when you buy. The only investment risk after that is from inflation and a default by the issuer. \n• Exactly how to earn £1,000 interest using the least possible savings \nPhil Oakley is an investment analyst at ShareScope, a company that provides data and analysis through its SharePad service. He said: “As well as reducing the interest rate risk, bond laddering can help you set up a portfolio with regular and predictable cashflows, provided that the issuer doesn’t go bust, of course.” \nHe has used the technique to construct a 10-year ladder - with bonds maturing every two years using only gilts and bonds from FTSE 100 companies such as Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) and HSBC to minimise risk. The bonds each yield around 4pc to 6pc. \nHis £100,000 ladder produces £4,625 of income a year. That compares with £4,741 from an annuity for a 55-year-old man. Crucially, however, the ladder returns most of his capital to spend or reinvest, while an annuity sees all the capital handed to an insurance company. \nIn his ladder, the bonds return around £89,000 on maturity - lower than the £100,000 spent to buy them because they were bought for more than the initial par price. \nReturns will get even better if rates start to climb. \nYou can get a more detailed explanation of Mr Oakley’s bond ladder here. \n• Calculator: How your money might grow after a lump sum investment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T16:39:58.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
