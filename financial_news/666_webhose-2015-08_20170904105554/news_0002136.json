On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures CLU5, -0.97% dropped 26 cents, or 0.6%, to $44.89 a barrel, on track for its lowest settlement price since March.\nThe latest weekly data showed a fall in U.S. crude oil inventories — usually a bullish sign of strong demand — but the positive effect was overshadowed by an increase in stockpiles of gasoline and other finished products.\nU.S. oil production, meanwhile, rose last week by 52,000 barrels a day to 9.5 million barrels a day.\n“Shale oil producers are lowering costs swifter-than-expected, proving their superior competitiveness within the industry, and consequently surprising with resilient production,” Ruecker said.\n“Taking further into account that we are at the peak of the summer demand season and entering the shoulder autumn months, fundamental support to prices has softened but not the extent the selloff implies,” he said.\nRuecker added that Julius Baer trimmed its forecasts for Brent prices to a range between $55-$60 per barrel “in the near term, but even lower longer term.”\nInvestors have also turned more bearish with Iranian officials asserting that they intended to quickly increase crude oil production, once the international sanctions are lifted following the nuclear deal with Tehran.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama gave a speech in support of the Iran deal, which is currently under review by U.S. lawmakers.\nNymex reformulated gasoline blendstock — the benchmark gasoline contract RBU5, -1.11% —was off 0.2% at $1.67 a gallon. ICE gasoil changed hands at $470.25 a metric ton, down $5.75 from the previous settlement.\nNatural gas NGU15, -1.36% fell 1% to $2.77 per million British thermal units.\nBiman Mukherji and Sara Sjolin contributed to this article\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T16:06:23.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
