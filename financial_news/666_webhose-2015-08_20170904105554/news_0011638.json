Figure out how much you need to live off \nIgnore your accommodation for a second and calculate a sensible amount to live off each week, as well as the bare minimum you could get by on. \nIn addition to food, transport and socialising, split potential big one-off costs across the academic year, and don’t ignore extras like a phone contract or university society costs. \nDon't let lazy budgeting ruin your experience Photo: Alamy \nThe main reason to do this first is it prevents you from a.) setting a hugely wasteful weekly budget if it turns out you have a surplus and b.) setting an impossibly small budget if you anticipate struggling for money. \nIt’s better to know what you need and try to reconcile it with your income through working, than put yourself into a risky position based on an unrealistic assumption of what you can actually live off. \n2. Work out how much you have after accommodation \nNow is the time to tot up how much you will have coming in. Work out how much you have per term, rather than over the whole year, as it is easy to miss a patch where you’ll come up short. \nInclude your maintenance loan for that term, any grants or scholarships and any parental contribution (paid monthly is best to prevent overspending). For grant or scholarship payments that come in at the start of the year, split them across the terms. \nThen deduct your accommodation cost and split the remainder into a weekly amount for each term. This is what you have to work with. \nIf it meets or exceeds your ideal budget, then you’re set. If it just meets your bare minimum requirement, then work out how many hours you could work a week to match your ideal, and decide if it’s worth it. \nIf you’re below the bare minimum do the same, to know how many hours a week you’ll need to work for your budget to be viable. \n3. Decide where to keep your money \nOne of the first things you should do when possible, is open a student account . Most will give you a contactless debit card, online banking and, most importantly, an interest and fee free overdraft. Don’t view this as your personal piggy bank, it's real money and you will have to pay it back eventually. \nHowever, with no interest and no fees, using a student overdraft is the safest place to turn in an emergency when family can’t help. Most graduate accounts let you keep a similar interest free overdraft for a year or two after you finish studying, so don’t panic that you’ll have to pay it all back the day you leave university. \nThere can be other perks too: Santander offer a free four year student railcard, HSBC give students a £60 Amazon gift card for joining, Lloyds offer a free three year NUS Extra card, and Natwest offer a free four year National Express coach card (as do the Royal Bank of Scotland). \nDo your research on bank accounts Photo: PETER DAZELEY \nIf you are sensible and have a good degree of self control, a student account may be the only one you need. \nSchedule payments from whoever is supporting you on a monthly basis, rather than all at once, and check your balance regularly; direct debit payments you have forgotten about can lead to some nasty surprises. \nMoney goes out faster than you think, so don’t build yourself up for a fall by ignoring it and hoping for the best. \nIf you’re more concerned about your ability to hold it all together, then a second account might be in order. You may already have another account, but if not just open a simple current account with no overdraft facility whatsoever. \nMetro Bank are a particularly good option, as they have no account fees and their branches are open seven days a week, 362 days a year. \nUse your student account as your main account and put your allotted weekly amount into the other account every Sunday evening. \nLeave the student account card at home and away you go. Mobile banking on your phone will still enable you to move money in emergencies, but having to stop and think about it that much longer is likely to help you maintain control. \n4. Put it into action! \nYou should anticipate that your budget will change at least slightly when you start university. Numbers on a spreadsheet don’t necessarily match up with real life, so try to have a bit of a contingency in your weekly amount just in case. \nIf your budget has some big gaps , first priority should be securing employment. Think outside the box; bar work and retail will do the job absolutely fine, but you could also tutor or coach a sport, and universities themselves normally have a variety of positions on offer for students. \nKeep track of all your receipts and expenses for the first month to establish a baseline, and don’t assume you know how much you have left without checking your bank balance. Tips for sticking to a budget \n• Don’t do huge food shops, you’ll end up wasting things. • Meal plan and avoid impulse shopping. • Buy non-branded at the supermarket. • Have one day a week where you use up what's in the cupboard. • Treat yourself once a week (no matter how small). • Set a target to save for. • Don’t underestimate how quickly lunches and small purchases can add up. • Figure out when your local supermarkets put out their discounted produce.• Pay rent before anything else when the loan comes in.• Make the most of student discounts; don't get lazy about it. • We don't advocate heavy drinking, but 'pre-drink' if you're heading out and save yourself a fortune. \nAvoid doing enormous food shops Photo: Alamy Useful apps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:32:37.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
