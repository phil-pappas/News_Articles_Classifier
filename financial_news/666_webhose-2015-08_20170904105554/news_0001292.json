The company, which supplies gas and electricity to 240,000 customers from its Warwickshire base, admits problems but claims it is working hard to put them right.\nMargaret Agnew, who lives on the Gower near Swansea, says she has not had a bill since she transferred to Co-operative Energy in January, despite repeated requests. She says she was even visited by a meter reader in June but this still has not produced a bill, much to her frustration.\n“I thought I was alone in this until I read about a reader’s experience in the Guardian. The company are hopeless to get through to by phone or email. No one answers or comes back to you. Perhaps this will prompt them to take action,” she says.\nGarrett Simpson was one of many who joined the company as part of the Big Switch , organised by the consumer group Which? three years ago. The Reading resident said all had been OK until this year when he noticed that his credit balance had mysteriously climbed to over £800. Upon investigation, it soon emerged that he too had not been issued with a bill since December 2014.\nThe website appears to no longer accept meter readings. How can you run an energy firm like this?\nGarrett Simpson, reader “They always issued estimated bills and then upped the direct debits according – always in their favour, and I thought that was the reason my balance was so high. But then it emerged that I hadn’t had a bill. My repeated attempts to get them to produce one drew a blank. Only when I cancelled my direct debit did one arrive. My other big gripe is that the website appears to no longer accept meter readings. How can you run an energy firm like this?” he says.\nDavid Hole, of Somerset, describes a similar website “debacle”.\n“I set up my account over a year ago but since they changed the website I’m unable to enter my meter readings. They say use the 0800 number but it took me three days of trying to get through.”\nMany readers have complained that they expected more from the Co-op which sold itself as being difference to the big six suppliers – but in their experience has turned out to be no better. Npower, Scottish Power, EDF and British Gas have all suffered terrible customer service problems in the past all after installing a new IT system.\nThe much publicised problems at npower and Scottish Power which led to sanctions by the regulator Ofgem – including bans on gathering new customers – continue to be felt today. Guardian Money has advised customers who want to switch supplier to take their business elsewhere while these problems persist.\nPete Westall, group general manager at Co-operative Energy, admits service has not been good enough.\n“After a period of growth, we outgrew our IT system and needed a new platform to provide a better service and experience for our customers. This new system was implemented along with a new online portal for customers in April 2015 following months of testing. Unfortunately, once launched, we had issues with customers being unable to sign into the portal which led to increased phone calls and emails to our customer service team. In addition to this, some specific issues with the system created delays in producing bills and direct debit reviews.\n“These issues have resulted in poor experiences for some of our customers. This is not acceptable to us, and our teams are focused on fixing all the issues as quickly as possible.\nThese issues have resulted in poor experiences for some of our customers\nPete Westall, Co-operative Energy “We’ve increased our customer service team by 40% and implemented a new cloud-based phone system that can handle significantly more calls. We are now in a position where the right infrastructure is in place and colleagues are recruited, trained and resolving issues, and so the situation is improving.”\nThe company has contacted the customers who complained to Money, and says it is working hard to resolve their problems. In most instances they have been offered a £25 payment as a goodwill gesture.\n• Co-operative customers, and anyone else looking for an independent energy supplier should head to Ovo Energy if they value good customer service. Mark Todd, of the switching website Energyhelpline.com, says Ovo comes top of its customer service polls. At Guardian Money we get relatively few complaints about the firm. It’s not the very cheapest supplier, that position is occupied by ExtraEnergy, but at just under £890 a year, Ovo is probably a safer bet and our top pick.", "external_links": ["http://www.ovoenergy.com/compare-switch/save-on-energy-bills/", "https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/scottishpower-accepts-sales-ban-after-failing-ofgem-s-customer-service-target"], "published": "2015-08-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T10:33:45.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
