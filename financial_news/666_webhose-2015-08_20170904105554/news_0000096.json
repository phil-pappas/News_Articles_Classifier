Turnover was $322 million, compared to a daily average in July of $142 million, and included $196 million of Contact. Fonterra Shareholders' Fund, whose units are entitled to the dividends from Fonterra's ordinary shares, rose 5.2 per cent to $4.90 after the dairy company cut its farmgate milk payout forecast as expected, while offering financial support to its farmers and flagging a higher dividend. \"The earnings per share was upgraded to a range of between 40 cents and 50 cents per share from market expectations of 36 cents, implying a dividend of about 31.5 cents,\" said Rickey Ward, JBWere's NZ equity manager. \"On the current price at the time it gives you a dividend yield of above six per cent, so it starts to look like a really high dividend stock with the upgrade.\" Contact fell 1.3 per cent to $5.15, the first decline since Origin sold its controlling stake for $4.65 a share earlier this week, vastly boosting the liquidity and market weighting of the stock. Some 32 million shares changed hands on Friday. ANZ fell 6.8 per cent to $34.13 after the bank followed National Australia Bank in raising equity capital requirements to satisfy regulatory requirements in Australia. Kathmandu Holdings fell 0.6 per cent to $1.74 after Briscoe Group controlling shareholder Rod Duke said his takeover offer, at an implied price of $1.80, \"fully reflects the value of Kathmandu shares\".
