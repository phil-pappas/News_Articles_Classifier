Jim Rice JRZ by Joanna Mather Labor has taken a swipe at the federal government for capitulating to the \"big end of town\" after a freedom of information request revealed Treasurer Joe Hockey has never received any correspondence about exempting private Australian companies from having to reveal their tax affairs .\nNor has Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg received any emails or letters asking him to consider changing a rule that requires the publication of tax paid by companies with turnover of $100 million or more.\nNevertheless, the government is pushing ahead with legislation to exempt about 1000 private Australian companies from the rule, which was brought in by the previous Labor government.\nKidnapping a concern\nConcern that the information might make the wealthy family members who own the companies a target for kidnappers emerged from a Coalition partyroom meeting in March.\nShadow assistant treasurer Andrew Leigh said the government was proposing extra secrecy within the tax laws, \"yet they say that not a single stakeholder or community group have written to them about the need for this change\".\n\"Is this serious reform, or the sort of idea that only comes up after the second glass of wine with their mates at the Melbourne Club?\"\nMr Leigh's office lodged freedom of information requests with Mr Hockey and Mr Frydenberg on July 2.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Information about multinationals and public companies would still be published.\nThis would expose the private companies to a greater level of personal and commercial risk, the draft legislation says.\nThe government is believed to have the support of at least four of the six cross-bench senators it needs to get legislation passed. Bob Day, David Leyonhjelm, Dio Wang and John Madigan have indicated support.\nThe family that owns beef exporter Teys Australia has told the government it is worried it will be targeted by criminals on the basis of \"perceived wealth\" if details of its tax affairs are made public.\nMr Hockey declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T07:40:46.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
