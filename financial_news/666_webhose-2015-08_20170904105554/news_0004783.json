The recent successful conclusion of a new enterprise agreement leaves plenty of low-hanging fruit left yet to drive bottomline growth and improved returns.\nOf course, the pillars of owner disquiet rest still inside the Aurizon portfolio. But they have been moved from a position of supporting centrality to the rail operator's growth strategy.\nPlans to build the rail link that would introduce Galilee Basin coal to the Aurizon network have been shelved and Hockridge does not expected them to be removed from the dust until end the of the decade at the earliest. And while work continues on the even more worrisome West Pilbara iron ore project that was acquired with Baosteel in last year's apparently excessively ill-timed $1.4 billion takeover, Hockridge is actively promoting the idea that it has high hurdles to clear.\nThe next investment gateway for WPIO arrives in December with a meeting of the joint venture's CEOs that will decided whether to proceed to a final investment decision. If the project team gets a green light for further study, then a final decision could be made by the end of FY16. But whatever happens, no one should expect first ore until maybe 2020, Hockridge said.\nFor the record, Aurizon has already sunk $268 million into the WPIO project. Its share of the acquisition cost was $225 million and it has so far invested $43 million in the appraisal work on the rail and port network that sits its responsibility in project. According to Hockridge, the balance of any appraisal work will cost Aurizon a further $80 million should the project pass December's muster.\nImportantly though, that decision is not necessarily the lay down misere that the current iron ore market might imply, and not just because studies in the wake of the Aquila acquisition have reduced the foreshadowed cost from $6 billion to $4.5 billion while expanding potential project production by 30 per cent to 40 million tonnes annually.\n Supply-side conundrum What Hockridge and his owners need to get comfortable with is that the world will actually need new sources of iron ore after say 2020 and that customers might pay the incentive price to get it. In conversation with The Australian Financial Review , Hockridge offers the supply-side conundrum of his Pilbara partner Baosteel to illustrate the demand-side uncertainties at play here.\nIn September, Baosteel will open a new 10 million tonne steel plant. It has plans to double that in two steps. If that happens its total iron ore demand will rise from 70 million tonnes annually to 140mt. And if that happens it mightenjoy the resource security that comes of owning a production network.\nAt the same time, the 10-year outlook for iron ore says that several cornerstone providers, including the legendary Robe River system in WA, are going to shift into serious grade decline. Another Aurizon partner in the West Pilbara is Korea's POSCO. And it is a major customer of Robe product.\nHowever this iron ore story plays out, Hockridge has been offered reminders enough that it was not part of the investment narrative that sustained privatisation back in July 2010. Aurizon's investment thesis was built, instead, around the value that would be extracted from a government-owned rail monopoly by the management driven by the clarifying and motivating prerequisite of public listing. There can be no question that Monday's investor pitch was aimed at demonstrating management's recovered focus on more familiar tracks.\nEssentially, Aurizon offered itself to the market as one of the better defensive exposures to a resources sector then getting to the back end of a once-in-a-generation explosion of demand and price. By defensive I mean that by driving post-privatisation efficiencies and embracing the take-or-pay contract regime embedded across the sector through boom, investors could bank ever more firmly on Aurizon earning, and returning, good money no matter which way the cycle turned.\nMonday's numbers illustrate how, even through last year's tension between management and owners over apparently ill-timed growth strategies, Aurizon has continued to deliver on this promise. While revenues were flat at $3.78 billion, Hockridge was able to boast of a 14 per cent increase in earnings before interest and tax, of a material increase in return on capital employed and of beating a long-standing 75 per cent operation-cost-to-revenue target.\nPossibly even more important in shaping of the recovery of share price momentum that followed, Hockridge was also able to boast of a boardroom change in dividend policy that sets a 70 per cent dividend distribution as a standing minimum but raised the potential that the ratio could hit 100 per cent of earnings.\nThe very obvious message here is that Aurizon has tempered its growth story in response to investor rejection and the equally obvious cycling in commodity market and that the company's board now sits more than comfortably with the idea of returning all its earnings to owners if it can't find better things to do with the cash.\nThe value of that promise needs to be seen in the light of the predictable resilience of Aurizon's profit base and of the value that management continues to extract from the aggressive retrofitting of the business that was.\nNetwork business strongest The strongest part of the FY15 result is the network business. This is the monopoly rail track system that secures the earnings of Aurizon's freight service operations. While coal prices and volumes are flat-lining, at best, earnings from Aurizon's price-regulated network business rose 14 per cent. And if the long-delayed network repricing arrives as flagged last year by the Queensland competition regulator, then we should expect the rate of that increase to rise just that little bit more.\nHockridge, meanwhile, does not reject the idea that the best return on investment he will ever make at Aurizon is from whatever it cost for total victory in the battle to introduce modern terms of employment to his pivotal Queensland rail business.\nAccording to Hockridge, just the ability to force redundancies and relocations will save $40 million or so over the coming two years, and that will more than pay for the increased wages that were baked into the agreement that workers finally accepted last month.\nThat means only that the rest of the productivity benefits that will flow from the ability to restructure shifts and operations schedules will flow directly into the bottom line. And, once made, those gains will likely endure.\nThe long-run effect is that Hockridge reckons Aurizon can now very quickly match competitors in coal transport that currently enjoy a cost advantage of up to 15 per cent over the sector leader.\nJust finally, Hockridge was never going to let the theatre of results close without offering some observations \"from the soap box\" on the wider state of his political and investment world.\nHaving spent the past 18 months railing against the state of industrial relations, Hockridge expanded his aim to the state of our nation's appetite for the fight to capture a fair share of new investment in resources projects.\n\"The nation really has got to realise that there are a few things at play here,\" Hockridge opined. \"We no longer have the free ride of the resources boom. Every piece of business and business improvement has to be hard-won. It has to be earned in the context of an increasingly competitive global situation and vastly different market profile. The processes to get those scarce projects to bankability [have] to have due regard for all of that.\n\"The gathering of more and more red and green tape has to be identified in the competitive context. It is not just fundamental project economics. It is just as much about how we stack up against the alternatives.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:09:47.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
