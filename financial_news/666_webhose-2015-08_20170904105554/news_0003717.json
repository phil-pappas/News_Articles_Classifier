The level of intensity at Amazon has long been discussed -- TheStreet reported on this back in April -- and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said, \"Our culture is friendly and intense, but if push comes to shove we'll settle for intense.\" Tesla Surges on Price Target Increase, Rambus Jumps on Strategy Change: Tech Winners & Losers \nBut while many have been debating the impacts of such a culture following the Times' article, investors and analysts don't seem to be at all concerned. \nShares of Amazon closed around $531.80 on Friday. Following the Times' article, shares took a brief dip Monday morning to $527.97, but have since climbed back up. As of Tuesday morning, shares were up to $537.45. \n\"I'm not overly concerned about the Amazon culture stories,\" Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy said. \"Those have been floating around for years, and with a handful of current and former executives speaking out against the NYT article, I think most investors view the story as a non-issue.\" \nThe one issue that could potentially be of interest to investors is whether or not this attention to Amazon's workplace environment could impact retainment, churn, and recruitment. Indeed, Bezos himself sought to address this potential issue with a message to employees on Monday saying he didn't recognize the Amazon portrayed by the article and asking workers to let him know about any such \"callous\" management practices. \nBut Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster doesn't think there will be much change in Amazon's culture. \n\"When [someone comes] to work at Amazon, they know it's a hard place to work,\" he said. \"I don't think the rank and file at Amazon will read the article and start demanding to be treated differently. Amazon has a formula, and they're going to generally stick to that formula.\" \nAnd even if some employees decide to leave Amazon for a friendlier company like Google or Facebook , as long as Amazon keeps reporting positive growth, investors won't care. \n\"As long as the results are there, investors are going to be happy,\" Munster said. \"If the business started to stutter, there would be a demand that they act more like Google or Facebook. If [Amazon keeps] doing what they're doing, [investors would] probably say, 'Don't change a thing.'\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:07:18.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
