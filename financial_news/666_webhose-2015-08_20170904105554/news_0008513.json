Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by Philip Baker When it comes to investing, \"less wrong\" hopefully ends up meaning \"more rich\". That's just one of the many golden rules you sometimes hear.\nNot losing money is another. While it never pays to become too cautious too early, at least that way you leave money on the table for others.\nHowever, there's never much emphasis on being able to buy and sell the asset that drives the return. Liquidity is often taken for granted and the real dilemma is always seen as a question of what to buy, followed by when is the best time to buy. But it shouldn't be that way.\nThis probably applies more to the bond market than the sharemarket, because shares trade on an exchange and you can see the prices.\nBut investors in the retail bond market, in particular the corporate bond market, are hostage to the broker they buy the bonds from in the first place. Bond prices are taken from a broker's daily sheet but when investors go to deal the next day they can move substantially, giving grief to all concerned.\nThere is never quite the same problem about \"getting set\" in the corporate bond market. Primary issues are dealt in an orderly manner, everyone knows the pre-marketing price range and final pricing and, if it's a popular deal, investors might get scaled back.\nIt's the secondary market that is the problem. Often the price offered on the day can differ to the one on the price sheet, even after taking into account any moves in the bond market.\nRoller-coaster ride Related Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements There has been a lot of talk lately about a lack of liquidity in global bond markets. This really all goes back to October 2013, when the yield on the benchmark 10-year US government bond – the benchmark bond in the safest market of all, and the bond that all other bonds are priced off – fell 33 basis points in quick-smart time.\nIt then spiked back to 2.13 per cent, up from 1.86 per cent. The move was so extreme it was described as, mathematically at least, a rise that could only be expected to happen once every 1.6 billon years.\nAn investigation into the move didn't reveal any great reasons behind the roller-coaster ride, and the worrywarts have been warning about liquidity in global bond markets ever since.\nThe concern is that, because yields are so low and with so many investors now exposed to bonds since the global financial crisis, it's going to be very difficult to get out when the time is right to do so.\nLiquidity risk should always be a key factor for investors when they are constructing portfolios, but when it comes to retail investors and corporate bonds it can be difficult.\nAnd bonds are meant to be buy-and-hold investments, although since the GFC investors tend to be more active.\nFor professional investors, liquidity management is a dynamic and vital part of the process that they perform on a daily, and often intraday, basis.\nPIMCO's new boss, Doug Hodge, said in a note to clients that he's not surprised the subject of bond market liquidity has come under increasing focus because banks in the United States are now required to hold more capital to make them safer after the GFC.\nFor that reason they don't tend to hold much inventory of bonds and so secondary trading in them is harder. Or it can take longer to execute or get out of a deal.\n\"Liquidity risk is part of the investment risk that investors knowingly take on when they invest their assets in the capital markets to pursue their investment objectives,\" Hodge says.\nHe points out investors should not confuse investment risk with systemic risk. \"While price moves may be more disjointed – and prices may have to decline more significantly for a market price to be established – price declines are not the same as the system failing.\"\nThe other point is that, if you truly are a long-term investor, these wild price swings can deliver opportunities but they always seem to happen when you are trying to sell and the price falls.\nBuying never seems to be a big deal as investors normally get allocated bonds when they are a primary issue into the marketplace.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-13T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:09:33.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
