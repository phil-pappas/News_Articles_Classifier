Royal Bank of Canada (TSX:RY) pulled out of OBSI in 2008, while TD Bank (TSX:TD) ditched the organization in 2011. Both banks now use the ADR Chambers Banking Ombuds Office to handle disputes.\nLongtime ombudsman Douglas Melville stepped down at the end of May to take up a new role as principal ombudsman and chief executive for the Channel Islands Financial Ombudsman.\nBradley, who is also the chairwoman of the Nova Scotia Securities Commission, will take over her role as OBSI's ombudsman and CEO on Sept. 14.\nIn a statement, Bradley said she is excited to join the organization.\n\"OBSI is widely recognized as Canada's trusted, impartial and effective provider of financial sector dispute-resolution services, with a staff team that is the best in the business,\" she said.\nFollow @alexposadzki on Twitter.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T13:27:45.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
