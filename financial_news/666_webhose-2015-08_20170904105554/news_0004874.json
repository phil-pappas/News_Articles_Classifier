Photo: Jessica Hromas\nAustralia's biggest lenders mortgage insurer warns that delinquencies could rise in mining towns across Western Australia and Queensland, as the resources boom fades amid a weakening economy.\nGenworth Mortgage Insurance Australia chief executive, Ellie Comerford, said there were pockets of stress across the country's housing market despite rising property prices in capital cities such as Sydney.\n\"There's no doubt while all eyes are on Sydney and Melbourne and discussions about the housing growth there [and] whether it's sustainable … really what we're seeing, is other areas where that's not occurring,\" Ms Comerford said.\n\"There are parts of Australia that aren't seeing that unprecedented rise and there is some pressure on the economies really coming off the fact that the mining infrastructure boom is over.\"\nThe comments come after Genworth, which controls around 41 per cent of Australia's LMI market, posted a rise in its loss ratio from 19.6 per cent to 22.1 per cent during the six months to June. This was due primarily to a jump in the number of delinquent loans, including those in the resource-rich states of WA and Queensland.\nMs Comerford's concerns were echoed by one of the country's top banking analysts, CLSA's Brian Johnson, who said housing markets in Brisbane and Perth were at risk of \"regional collapse,\" and Commonwealth Bank would be the most exposed lender to a house price correction in Western Australia. He warned in a note of a \"bifurcated\" market where Sydney and Melbourne remained \"uber expensive\" but Brisbane and Perth \"remain vulnerable to a regional collapse akin to the Queensland's Gold Coast during the GFC.\"\nGenworth reported a net profit of $113 million for the six months ended June 30, a 25 per cent plunge from 2014. The group's reported net profit was affected largely by an unrealised mark to market loss on its bond portfolio.\nThe LMI giant, which has a market valuation of $2.3 billion, declared an interim dividend of 12.5¢ a share and a special payment of 18.5¢ per share for investors.\nThe group's underlying net profits hit $133 million, which was steady from the prior corresponding period.\n\"The business delivered a solid first-half performance in line with the prior period, demonstrating the continued resilience of the business in the face of a dynamic economic environment and mortgage market,\" Ms Comerford said.\nRisk management focus \"The business is responding to these dynamics by focusing on risk management and the execution of our strategic priorities to deliver long-term returns to shareholders.\"\nCLSA insurance analyst Jan van der Schalk argued the group's underlying earnings were affectd by the loss of a major contract with Westpac Banking Corp, and a lower mix of 90 to 95 per cent LVR loans written in the business.\nHe argued there was also increasing pressure for Genworth's biggest client, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, to pull the plug on its contract with the group. CBA accounts for 41 per cent of Genworth's premium revenue.\n\"The special dividend of 18.5¢ reflects both capital release post losing WBC contract as well as lower LVR loans being written. Bottom line is that while they have maintained guidance as below, loss/slowing top line will affect future earnings growth,\" CLSA said.\nMs Comerford, however, said: \"We certainly believe that the appetite to make sure that there is external coverage is still there\" from bank and lender customers.\n\"We still certainly do believe that's something that the lenders are being very vigilant about monitoring particularly in the face of the increased surveillance of all regulators.\"\nGenworth has renewed its contract with National Australia Bank in June for a further two years.\nOther than the unwelcome but \"not altogether surprising\" pick up in WA and Queensland delinquencies, Genworth's results were broadly in line with UBS' expectations.\nRoss Curran, insurance analyst at CBA, said Genworth delivered a chunky special dividend.\nHe said the company remained in control of a strong capital position, and said that the fall in reported NPAT was due to bond weakness associated with the threat of a Greek exit from the eurozone.\nRyan Fisher, analyst from Goldman Sachs, said Genworth still had around $300 million to $500 million in surplus capital above its target range, suggesting there could be further opportunity for capital management initiatives for the rest of 2015.\nThe LMI provider remains cautious about its outlook for sectors that area affected by the slowdown in the mining boom.\nThe insurer reiterated its full-year guidance, and to post net earned premium growth of up to 5 per cent for 2015.\nGenworth shares have risen 6.4 per cent in the past 12 months to $3.51, compared with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200's 2.9 per cent gains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T17:53:27.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
