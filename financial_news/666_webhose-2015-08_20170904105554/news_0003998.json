In the next four days we will be discussing issues around strategic assets liability management and risks in banks, leveraging on GHIB’s rich expertise in the field to empower local banks in cushioning against interest rate volatilities, as well as liquidity and other operational risks.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T20:36:06.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
