AP Share on twitter by Mark Mulligan The first US interest rate rise in almost a decade is already priced into emerging market assets, meaning capital outflows and other disruptions are now down to country specifics, according to a senior strategist at global bond fund firm Pimco.\nTony Crescenzi says capital flight from countries such as Brazil and Russia were now more a reaction to political issues, weak commodity prices and, in the latter instance, the Ukrainian war, than investors positioning for the US Federal Reserve's expected increase in the funds rate as early as next month.\nHe said this global movement of investment capital has been underway since Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, warned markets of the gradual winding down of monetary stimulus, sparking the now famous \"taper tantrum\" of mid-2013.\nHis successor, Janet Yellen, has since been telegraphing the eventual timing of what is called interest rate \"normalisation\".\n\"Markets have been numbed to the first rate hike,\" Mr Crescenzi said during a visit to Sydney on Wednesday.\n\"While this is evident in the US bond market, the way it trades today, it might eventually become evident in the more volatile emerging markets when they finally realise that for two years they've been building in the normalisation of policy and perhaps now it's gone too far,\" he said.\nThis generalisation of emerging markets, and the overreaction in some cases, had thrown up great investing opportunities, he said.\nHe cited Mexico, where the risk yield premium over US Treasuries and other benchmarks seemed unwarranted. This made bonds there cheap, and the possible returns generous.\n \"If one looks at the credit rating of Mexico, it's been consistently improving, even at a time when the US debt picture has worsened, yet yield spreads have continuously widened,\" he said.\n\"This creates attractive opportunities in that market.\n\"In a lot of cases, one has to be careful - but others where markets have become more liquid, we think over time do offer attractive value,\" he said.\nHis comments, from the sidelines of the Portfolio Construction Forum conference, come amid renewed jitters around emerging markets in Asia , in the wake of last week's yuan devaluation by China.\nA growing chorus of commentators have warned of further pressure on Asian currencies and growth rates as the region adjusts to the slowdown in China.\nPimco has been slightly more bearish on Chinese growth rates than many of its peers, seeing it settle at 6 per cent over the next few years from 7 per cent now.\n\"Pimco's confident in the long-term prospects for China and its economy and its ability to manage its transition to a more developed economy,\" he said.\n\"We do think, however, that it's searching for greater quality over quantity, and will need to slow its growth path in the short run.\"\nHe said global markets remained \"fixed on the fixing\" of China's currency, which is set centrally every day and, until recently, pegged to the US dollar. However, the greenback's sharp appreciation since late last year - because of the promise of higher interest rates - had gradually eroded China's export competitiveness.\nImported deflation because of the yuan's relatively strength was also stymieing attempts by Beijing to generate more consumer spending.\nWith the dust settling after the market upheaval of last week, Mr Crescenzi says China's devaluation was unlikely to upset the US Fed's plans to start lifting interest rates.\n\"The only major transmission channel of the move by China would be through the financial markets,\" he said.\n\"The trade channel is too small.\n\"China is aiming for a small to moderate devaluation of its currency and is not on a path to a larger one that could potentially create further volatility in markets,\" Mr Crescenzi said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/china-stocks-plunger-further-as-investors-eye-state-retreat-20150819-gj2q58.html", "https://twitter.com/@MulliganMark"], "published": "2015-08-19T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:04:15.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
