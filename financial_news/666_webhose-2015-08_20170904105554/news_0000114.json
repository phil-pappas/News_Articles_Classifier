This has pleased investors who drove the group's share price up 68 cents, or 11.37 per cent, to $6.66 at 1115 AEST. Acquisitions and expansion of the group's retail and veterinary network in Australia and New Zealand largely drove the turnaround. Greencross opened 65 new retail outlets to take its total to 200 across Australia and New Zealand, and added 21 veterinary clinics to expand its clinic numbers to 132. The group says it has completed the acquisition of 42 City Farmers petcare stores in WA on time and on budget. Chief executive Jeffrey David says Greencross will increase its eight per cent share of the $8.7 billion Australasian petcare market to 20 per cent. \"It was a big year for growth in outlet numbers,\" Mr David said. \"In addition to stores and clinics we also increased our number of grooming salons and our DIY dog washes.\" He said this helped increase the accessibility and affordability of its pet services and products, and strong growth in its customer loyalty program was extending its reach to families. Same store sales growth across the group was up 6.2 per cent for the year with like for like sales growing at the same rate during the first five weeks of fiscal 2016. Mr David said total revenue for the current financial year was up 19 per cent so far. \"We have strengthened our foundations for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth,\" he said. Greencross, which also owns pet shops and warehouses Petbarn and Animates, will open 20 new retail stores and acquire more vet clinics this financial year.
