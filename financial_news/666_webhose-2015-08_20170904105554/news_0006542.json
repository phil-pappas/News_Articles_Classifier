Photo: Bloomberg\nIn case you missed it, The Wall Street Journal had an interesting profile out this week on Mario Gabelli , the $US89 million ($121 million)-a-year founder of Gamco Investors.\nThe story details 73-year-old Gabelli's success over the years as a stock picker and his steadfast commitment to a research-heavy process even as a growing portion of the investing public is throwing in the towel on stock-picking in favour of index investing. Yet there was one juicy tidbit that came and went without much elaboration and, well, let's see if you can find what it is:\n\"Mr Gabelli, who is thin with white hair, spends much of his free time immersing himself in myriad subjects from quarry mines to adult diapers, which he considers a growing market because of the ageing population.\"\nMario Gambelli, Wall Street's highest-paid CEO, is bullish on adult diapers. Photo: Andy Zakeli\nWall Street's highest-paid CEO is bullish on adult diapers! This is an investment theme that could spawn so many think pieces, like ... well, let's not go there (the jokes would be too cheap and easy). Instead, let's take a look at why diapers, both the adult and baby varieties, may smell like roses to investors like Gabelli. (OK, sorry for that one cheap joke.)\nFor one thing, it's not just the huge demographic of Baby Boomers who are following Gabelli into the white-haired years. It's also in emerging markets, where the runway for growth is much larger than the US, where the disposable baby-diaper market is saturated.\nSales of diapers in China and Eastern Europe rose 30 per cent in the most recent quarter at Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies for babies and Depends for their grandparents. And get this - while many multinational corporations like Kimberly-Clark are struggling with the strong dollar's effect on sales, this growth was driven by price increases meant to combat weakening overseas currencies. While diapers may indeed contain elastic, demand for diapers seems to be reasonably inelastic.\nConcentrated and bold bet Gabelli's diaper play, however, is a more concentrated and bold bet. And frankly, it's been disappointing of late. Gamco has amassed a 16 per cent stake in the small-cap Tredegar, which makes the plastic films used in diapers.\nAt first it worked out great: Gabelli took an initial stake of about 6.9 per cent in 1994, and the stock jumped more than 800 per cent by April 1999. The shares crashed hard, however, and never quite reclaimed that peak.\nThe stock is down more than 50 per cent from its most recent high in 2013 as the company's plastic-film business struggled with problems at a plant in Brazil and delays in the startup of a new product line.\nAs for Gabelli, this roughly $US77 million position may not seem like much compared with the $US47 billion Gamco manages or, heck, even the $US89 million that Mario reportedly made last year. Yet it's clear this position is one that's close to Gabelli's heart. While Tredegar's conference calls are usually a short affair since not many analysts cover the stock, Mario himself has been known to make an appearance.\n\"Hi, Mario - how are you doing?\" former CEO Nancy Taylor asked on the earnings call in March.\n\"Not too bad,\" Gabelli replied. \"I missed part of the call, because there are too many conference calls, but always wanted to listen to yours,\" he said before asking how the company was marking certain assets to market.\nThis Tuesday, Tredegar announced that its interim CEO would take over the top job permanently and the president of its film products business would leave the company. The stock promptly fell and is trading at a three-year low.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-picker-mario-gabelli-makes-big-bucks-bucking-trends-1439919917"], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T05:42:23.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
