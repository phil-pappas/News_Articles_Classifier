It’s early morning in Paris. The Eurostar was on strike yesterday – I was late in from London, Christian Louboutin​ late home from Brussels – and taxis are on strike today. The venue: his glorious rooftop apartment, which is packed with treasures that suggest a magpie traveller. The plan: to grab this sliver of time as narrow as one of his 170-millimetre heels, in which to discuss the shoe business – in particular, his shoe business.\nSlender of frame, wide of smile and possessor of elegant feet – this noted because today, chez lui , he is not wearing any shoes – the 52-year-old has built his reputation on an unerring belief in the beauty and power of the high heel. He is probably the world’s most famous shoe designer. There are others, but Manolo Blahnik​ has a smaller business and Jimmy Choo​, which long ago ceased to be the work of the man himself, a far lower penetration on social media.\nWe have known each other for years but the schedule allows for no chit-chat. Only then do I have a hope of making my train back to London and a razor-sharp connection thereafter.\n“Safquat, my butler, will take you to Gare du Nord​ on the Vespa,” announces Louboutin casually, while forking up breakfast eggs. Do I detect Safquat Emdad bracing slightly as he pours the tea? He is half my height and a third of my body weight. Fear not, Emdad; it’s never going to happen.\nHaving conquered the heel market, Christian Louboutin is moving on to lipstick. Alexandra Kinga Fekete On to the job at hand. Louboutin and I have points to cover: shoe economics, lipstick economics. The former is the route via which he made his fortune; the latter, his new business venture. The majority shareholder in a private company that makes more than a million pairs of designer shoes a year, Louboutin branched out into nail varnish last year. This year it’s lipstick, packaged in a case that’s elaborate enough to double as a necklace. He has made these forays not with one of the world’s biggest beauty conglomerates but in partnership with an American independent, Batallure Beauty.\nWho launches into colossal, highly competitive sectors such as these without one of the giants as a partner? “I had been approached by beauty people but after two or three meetings, it was already all about numbers and SKUs [stock-keeping units],” Louboutin says. “When I said, ‘Could we discuss the design?’ no one seemed interested. The starting point has to be designing beautiful things. Period. That’s my interest in it. So I thought, ‘Well, don’t expect a big company to think the way I think. I have to do it my own way.’ Otherwise I have no reason to do it. It’s time consuming. And it’s not that I’m not busy.”\nShoes have given Louboutin the wealth and the freedom to take such risks. Entry price in Australia for a pair of his creations is about $845, with prices rising into the thousands. How much wealth? You do the maths. No really, you do the maths. Louboutin appears not to care for such subjects. He would rather talk about his favourite hobby, the trapeze. “It’s quite dangerous, which is very exciting and gives you a lot of energy,” he says.\nLouboutin makes being daring and creative look like a breeze but the reality is otherwise. “He works incredibly hard; he is an absolute perfectionist, concerned to the millimetre of proportion,” says Martin Grant, the Paris-based Australian designer whose catwalk shows have been accessorised by Louboutin heels for the past decade.\n Louboutin's undulating Mirage heel was inspired by the film 'Lawrence of Arabia'. The shoe comes in five different shades of nude. Fascinated by the stiletto Christian Louboutin was born in Paris, the son of a master cabinetmaker and a homemaker, the only boy in a family of three sisters. Little interested in school, he became fascinated by high heels when, bunking out of the classroom, he visited the city’s museum devoted to African and Oceanic art. There, he was transfixed by a sign at the entrance that featured a stiletto with a red line slashed through it, indicating the need to protect the museum’s wooden floors. This being the 1970s, the era of the wedge, the boy had never seen such a shoe.\nHis fascination with the forbidden soon saw him hanging out backstage with the showgirls at the Folies Bergere. Clad in little more than their heels, they took him on as a cherished mascot. By 14, he was a frequent, under-age visitor to such legendary nightclubs as Les Bains Douches and Le Palace. (Louboutin remains a vigorous dancer; first on the dance floor, last to leave.)\nHardly surprising, then, that it was with shoes that he entered the world of work, including toiling for Charles Jourdanand Roger Vivier, the latter the French master who in 1947 had created the shoes for the debut of Christian Dior.\nThe Love slipper was inspired by a photo of Princess Diana, who had a habit of staring at her feet. \"I wanted her to always have love at her feet,\" Louboutin once said. Christian Louboutin SA was founded by three friends: Louboutin, Bruno Chambelland, who is chief executive, and Henri Seydoux​, who is a silent partner (and father, by the way, of the actress Lea Seydoux). The business began in 1991 with a shoe called the Love; inspired by Princess Diana’s habit of staring at her feet, Louboutin put LO on one toe and VE on the other. In 1992, they opened a little shop down an offbeat Parisian street called Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau​.\nLouboutin had met Chambelland in his under-age nightclub years. He and Seydoux had met long before, when they were schoolboys. “Henri was quite introverted and quite bizarre but also very, very funny,” Louboutin recalls. “We became friends in a childish way, jumping on a bed and the bed breaking.” (To be clear, there are no euphemisms here; Louboutin’s partner in life is Louis Benech​, a landscape designer.) He sums up the success of the partnership nearly 25 years on. “The only thing I cannot cope with is not trusting people. I have a full trust in Bruno and a full trust in Henri. It’s very easy.”\nAsked what lessons he would give those aspiring to start their own business, Louboutin pauses and sips his tea. “Me? I remember Henri said, ‘You have to have a social security number’ and I said, ‘Why? I just want to design shoes.’ If I had had a goal from the beginning, I would have freaked out every day. When you have targets, you spend the day meeting targets, instead of correcting the heel and doing better shoes.\n“So what if, in five years, you don’t do a million pairs of shoes? Does it mean that you have to regret everything you’ve been doing for these years? I don’t regret any day. I won’t drain a lot of energy so it becomes heavy.”\nThat famous red slick on the soles When, in 1992, Louboutin thought his shoes risked looking “gloomy”, he famously added a slick of red nail varnish to the soles. In so doing he launched one of the luxury world’s most recognisable signatures, not least because it is on the outside of the shoe. He could not have imagined the boon this would be two decades later on Instagram, where the best of the selfies – or shoefies – taken by fans are aggregated by the brand then shared with the tagline #LouboutinWorld.\nOn social platforms, Christian Louboutin’s multi-million followers put the brand second only to Nike when it comes to feats of the feet, according to the Stylophane footwear index. The next nearest fashion shoe brand is Jimmy Choo at number 13. The designer himself is inherently “shareable” online, not least because he has a huge sense of fun and gives good pose. There he is sitting astride a camel; here he is mugging for the camera in suits of decidedly loud tweed.\nChristian Louboutin the business grew not via a marketing machine but by women spotting others in fabulous shoes and asking where they could get a pair. Women still buy his shoes like hunter-gatherers but on a much greater scale. Louboutin does flats as well as heels, accessories as well as shoes. He does shoes for men, too, although women still account for more than two-thirds of sales. Louboutin was among the first to offer more than conventional men’s styles, including a bespoke service through which one’s body tattoo could be replicated in embroidery across one’s footwear.\nBut the business balances on heels. For all their seductive appeal, Louboutin shoes are feats of engineering, achieved in collaboration with master craftsmen in Parabiago​, just outside Milan. Men’s styles are made by hand, using traditional, bench-made techniques, in Naples. Louboutin has enormous respect for the artisans who share their know-how with him; on October 25, the day of the patron saint of shoemakers, St Crispin, he will likely be found at one of the factories, toasting those who make his vision reality.\nHis Mirage heel, which undulates, was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia . “At the beginning of the movie, you see a vague shadow of someone on a camel. Or is it a mirage? I love this distortion of an image.” The movie that has most influenced him is the 1967 film Le Streghe ( The Witches ) in which the Italian diva, Silvana Mangano, plays multiple roles. “So I always think, the same woman can be completely different.”\nIt was Louboutin who first spread the message that a nude heel elongates the foot, only to find himself, quite rightly, ticked off by those whose skin colour is not peachy. “I mixed in the reds to match Safquat’s tone,” he says of his butler, who is South Asian. He adds that there’s a lot of gold in the olive skin tone. Today he makes five different shades of nude, from fair (Blush #1) to rich chestnut (Blush #5).\nReal estate devoted to shoes is gigantic The scale of the global designer shoe market is notoriously difficult to measure, given it goes from heels to sneakers to thongs, some of these designer, some not. Evidence of how well designer shoes do online comes from e-tail tsar, Federico Marchetti​ of Yoox Group. Marchetti told the Financial Times in May that when women buy shoes online, in two-thirds of cases they buy only shoes. This realisation led Yoox to set up its own shoe site. As for Louboutin’s online business, which is expected to open to Australian shoppers next year, the breadth on offer suggests it is extremely robust. Net-a-Porter has a strong business with the brand in Australia already.\nIn the world of bricks and mortar, the real estate devoted to shoes is gigantic. London’s Selfridges​, Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Barneys in Rodeo Drive have entire shoe floors. At nearly 3000 square metres and 100,000 pairs of shoes, Saks Fifth Avenue’s is so vast it has its own New York postal code.\nLouboutin’s shoes are the cherry on the cake in all this, at shops-within-shops of jewel box allure. The company operates 105 own-stores globally, up from 88 last year and due to reach 125 in 2016. Within the world’s leading department stores, including David Jones, which has carried the brand since 2006, it sells to 300 “doors”, which is to say, distinctly high-end stockists around the world.\nYet this wholesale side has shrunk from 97 per cent of the total business down to 30 per cent in the past eight years. Make no mistake, the wholesale side is not going down. Rather, own-store retail is rising faster against it. In Australia, the company has two of its own stores operated through a local partnership in Pitt Street, Sydney, and Collins Street, Melbourne, respectively.\nProfit allows luxury to dream After my interview, I call Alexis Mourot, the chief operating officer and general manager of Christian Louboutin, to get a better handle on the facts and figures. He joined the company in 2007 from Marc Jacobs, for which he was director of Europe. How does he find working with the ownership trio? “Easy,” he says. “We have the luxury to do the things the way Christian wants.”\nThat luxury is afforded by profit. Revenue in the 2013 financial year was $US611 million ($830 million), according to Deloitte’s Global Powers of Luxury Goods 2015 report, up 15 per cent on the previous year and with a compound annual growth rate of 23.8 per cent between 2011 and 2013. When I check these figures with Mourot, he laughs. “That’s funny because I don’t even know where those numbers came from. I can tell you those numbers never came from us.” Too high? He pauses, into which I read: “Are you nuts? Too low!”\nHe goes on to say this: “I can tell you that we’ve been growing by high double digits each year. Our business is 70 per cent women’s shoes, 20 per cent men’s shoes. Seven per cent is accessories and leathergoods and 3 per cent is beauty.\n“In terms of countries, North America is accounting for 42 per cent of our business. The European Union and the Middle East is 40 per cent, and Japan, Asia and Australia is 18 per cent. Australia has been wonderful. It took some time to establish a good business, to find good real estate locations and a good team. Now I can tell you we are delighted.”\nThe growth of Louboutin’s business echoes the shift away from shoes being something bought to match one’s dress to becoming a highly focused object of desire. The 1990s witnessed a boom in ready-to-wear and a massive increase in the recognition of designer names. Through the noughties, accessories became a big category, principally “it” bags.\nThen came the global financial crisis, by which time a taste for matching affordable mass market clothes with more expensive accessories had gelled. The it bag started to be overtaken by shoes, which are slightly less expensive but require seasonal updates. Expensive bags don’t wear out, shoes do, unless one strays no further than the red carpet.\nLipstick aims to change the game Christian Louboutin heel index may not rise higher as markets dip; that doesn’t work with skirt lengths any more, either. Yet shoe desire has proved as immune to slumps as vermilion lipstick was to the privations of World War II.\nAnd so to lipstick. Beauty Louboutin’s way is achieved in partnership with Batallure Beauty, co-founded by Robin Burns McNeill, herself a legend, having served as president and chief executive of Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Estée Lauder and Victoria’s Secret Beauty. Like the nail varnish, presented in a vial with a 20.5cm talon-like stopper, mirroring Louboutin’s highest ever heel, the aim is for the look of the lipstick to be game changing. Instead of the standard casing, it looks like an amulet found in King Tut’s tomb.\nAvailable in three textures – satin, matt and sheer – and in 39 colours, the Louboutin lipstick will be launched in Europe and the US in September, with markets such as Australia to follow next year, It is designed to be worn not just on your mouth but for the casing to become jewellery, fit for Queen Nefertiti​. The model and business woman Farida Khelfa​, whom Louboutin has long referred to as his (non-biological) sister, is working the look, wearing her lipstick both on her mouth and on a leather thong around her long neck. Just as lipstick fetishises the mouth, so is the case designed to be a fetish object. “Made to be stolen,” says its creator.\nLipstick economics decrees that a luxury name will make four times more from cosmetic products than the core product on which its renown rests. Not at Christian Louboutin Beauté, however, where there is no plan to bring either lipstick or nail varnish to a supermarket near you. Nor are they cheap. Designed to be treasures, the casings ensure prices are steep; at about $US50 ($69) a pop, the nail varnish is double other designer prices and the lipstick is expected to be about $US90. “We’re not looking at something big,” Mourot explains. “We’re looking at something different.”\nIt’s the same rule when people approach Louboutin with pitches to collaborate. Almost all get a non . Oui has been given a few times, including to Mattel for three shoe collections for Barbie, each in a limited edition at $US250, and to Louis Vuitton for its The Icon and the Iconoclasts project, on which Louboutin worked alongside Karl Lagerfeld, Frank Gehry and artist Cindy Sherman.\nAt his mid-century, Louboutin is neither young nor old, but of the age when big business starts to put in place the foundation stones of a succession strategy. “To be perfectly honest I haven’t yet started to think about that,” he says. “The only thing is that, you know, you hear the good stories.” He refers to the likes of Valentino, who, if social media is to be believed, looks to be having a whale of a time in retirement. “So at least I have in mind how to do it.” Can he really be quite so laissez-faire? In truth that’s a circus trick, like the man on his flying trapeze making it all look effortless. Mourot reveals that, to the contrary, Louboutin is “fully, 200 per cent interested in business. All decisions taken are validated by him.”\nDeloitte ranks Christian Louboutin as 55th among the world’s top 100 luxury brands, putting an independent company way up there with the big guys, who, predictably, have made approaches to acquire it. How does it feel to be regularly propositioned? “Like the young girl who gets invited to the ball and who has a lot of men coming and saying, ‘would you like to dance?’” Louboutin says. “Being approached and having to resist can be scary, can be tempting.” The answer is always non , whether the approaches come from the big luxury groups or other investors. Mourot confirms that “right now, the owners are happy where they are.” He continues: “The business is solid and freedom is great also. So at this stage, there is no further interest to discuss that.”\nInspiration for the spikey \"it\" shoe As the morning light floods the kitchen, Louboutin stretches his limbs like a cat with not a care in the world. But Safquat Emdad is jumpy. He has already signalled that we have 10 minutes left, now he’s signalling eight. It takes almost a full one of those for me to realise he means not eight minutes to wrap up the interview but just eight to reach Gare du Nord, which is surely at least 15 minutes away.\nA panicked last question has to be asked as all three of us run down the stairs and dash outside, grab helmets and jump on two Vespas. Louboutin is going one way, I’m going the other – yes, as circumstance requires, on the back of Emdad’s bike. Quickly, then, to the up-to-the-minute “it shoe”, Electrapump​. In powder blue with unexpected spikes down the heel, I ask if it’s Louboutin’s commentary on the dichotomy of feminine soft and hard power? Or an observation on the spikes of the market, perhaps? Neither, as it turns out.\n“I saw this little girl with a Mohawk. On a little girl, it was very sweet, so I drew this shoe.” He laughs. With that, it’s helmets on, a wave and we’re on our way.\nBecause there are no taxis, the streets are emptier, but for the buses and the oncoming trucks I can see right over Emdad’s head. I would like to report that I did the fastest traverse of Paris ever while wearing Louboutin heels – that would certainly have made it on to #LouboutinWorld. But I’m in my own sneakers, useful as I run the last yards.\n“You did what?” says my husband, incredulous, when I make all the connections and meet him in Edinburgh. “No business like shoe business,” I tell him.\nThe AFR Magazine fashion issue, out Friday August 28, inside The Australian Financial Review .", "external_links": ["http://asia.christianlouboutin.com/hk_en/"], "published": "2015-08-27T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:08:35.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
