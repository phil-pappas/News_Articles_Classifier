Reuters could not independently confirm this. \nReuters visited Corcosa's registered address in Managua but was unable to locate the family. Attempts by Reuters to contact lawyers for Corcosa and Enrique and Vanessa Delgadillo were unsuccessful. \nNicaragua's Chamber of Commerce said its files on the company had not been updated for two years, and that it did not know whether Corcosa remained in business. \nPreviously, Corcosa had paid for rice it received from ADM. \nADM is studying options for executing the arrest warrants in Britain, the United States or other countries, and for seizing assets belonging to Corcosa or the Delgadillo family, Anderson said. \nChristopher Swart of Holman Fenwick Willan, ADM's lawyers, called the case \"another example of the English courts' willingness to engage in international disputes where a link to this jurisdiction can be established\".
