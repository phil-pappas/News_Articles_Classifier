Having a financial hardship, such as debt, can affect every aspect of someone’s life, which is why Clearview has organized this much-needed program. The Consumer Stipend Relief Program allows Clearview Resolution Services to apply available lump sum grants up to 50 percent of a person’s deficiencies. This became available to all consumers on Aug. 10, with a letter for the campaign going out on Aug. 1 as a reminder about this program.\nGetting a financial crisis in order can be overwhelming, so Clearview has stepped up to the plate to clear away that rain cloud overhead and brighten up the skies of those in need. The Consumer Stipend Relief Program lasts for the entire month of August, catering to consumers who are finding themselves in financial trouble or an overwhelming debt.\nClearview Resolution Services hopes this program will make a difference when it comes to making the collections experience a more positive one.
