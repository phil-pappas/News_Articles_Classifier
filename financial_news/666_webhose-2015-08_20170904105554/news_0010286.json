An empirical analysis also suggests that credit growth is positively influenced by deposit growth, GDP growth, easy global liquidity conditions and exchange rate depreciation, whereas inflation dampens real credit growth.\nIn Indiaâ€™s bank-based financial system, credit plays an important role in the overall growth dynamics. Asset quality concerns resulting in risk aversion are considered to be one of the major factors underlying the current slowdown in credit.\nPublic sector banks, which recorded higher NPA ratios, experienced a sharp decline in credit growth.\nOn the other hand, private sector banks with lower NPA ratios posted higher credit growth (Chart 1 and 2).\nAt the aggregate level, the NPA ratio and credit growth exhibited a statistically significant negative correlation of 0.8, based on quarterly data since 2010-11.\n 28, 2015 2:37 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:33:27.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
