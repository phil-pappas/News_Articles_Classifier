Time to catch up on all the things you didn’t have time to read during the week. We’ve compiled a few suggestions. \n#1: Dow Enters Correction Territory \nStocks plummeted on global-growth fears for a second straight day Friday in a plunge that dragged the Dow industrials into correction territory. The global market rout pummeled stocks and commodities as fresh evidence emerged that China’s economy is slowing, spooking investors. The Journal’s Intelligent Investor columnist Jason Zweig has five things investors shouldn’t do now. \n#2: Grad-School Loan Binge Fans Debt Worries \nThe disproportionate role played by postgraduate borrowers has gotten little attention in the national debate over reining in college costs and debt. Postgraduates account for roughly 40% of all student debt but represent just 14% of students in higher education. Propelling the surge are federal programs that allow substantial chunks of those debts to be forgiven. Critics of the system say it makes it easier for graduate schools to raise tuition, and for some high-earning graduates such as doctors to escape debts they can afford to repay. \n#3: Stock-Picking Treasure or Relic? \nInvestors have moved billions of dollars from professional stock pickers like Mario Gabelli toward low-fee funds that simply track baskets of securities. Rather than adapt, Mr. Gabelli, 73 years old, has clung to the way he has done business for the last 40 years. Last year, he made $88.5 million, the most of any chief executive of a publicly traded company on Wall Street. \n#4: Hunt for Chinese Man in U.S. Fuels Political Intrigue \nFor much of 2014, Ling Wancheng was living under an alias in a mansion in a gated community in Loomis, Calif., near Sacramento. He hasn’t been seen there since around October. Mr. Ling is now the focus of political intrigue that threatens to overshadow a visit to the U.S. in September by China’s leader, Xi Jinping. \n#5: Why Istanbul Should Be Called Catstantinople \nIn this ancient city once ruled by sultans and emperors, the real king is the humble alley cat, writes Joe Parkinson. In historic neighborhoods along Istanbul’s Bosporus and Golden Horn waterways, an army of furry-tailed street cats are fed, sheltered and cooed at by an adoring public. Now, Istanbul’s feline fetish is adapting to the digital age.
