Written by: Brian O'Connell 08/05/15 - 2:17 PM EDT More Headlines 10 'Foreign' Cars Still Made In The U.S.A. \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- Younger Americans, especially the group known to demographic analysts as Millennials (ages 18 to 34), are finally starting to earn some money. The average annual income for Millennials varies, but according to Fidelity Investments, the upper end of the demographic has incomes of $64,000 and savings of about $37,000. Despite marshaling significant capital, they're not putting that money to work in the stock market. Some of that investment hesitancy comes from the fact that Millennials carry burdensome student loans debt, with about $35,000 owed in students loans for the college class of 2015 . No matter how much cash they have on hand, ideally, Millennials should steer a good chunk of their earnings into retirement accounts - long-term savings for their golden years. That's actually happening to some degree -- in no small part thanks to 401(k) auto-enrollment -- although the investment engine younger Americans are using isn't just the stock market. Increasingly, they're also turning to young business start-ups. Indeed, Millennails are not so willing to go to Wall Street with their money. A recent Goldman Sachs survey states that 40% of young people don't want to invest in the stock market at all. Apparently, that group is attracted to financial and technology industry startups targeting Millennials, which have raised $2.29 billion in 126 deals, according to ongoing survey data from CB Insights . \"In short, Millennials are leading an exodus away from stock market investing and into startups,\" notes Jon Meved, chief executive officer at OurCrowd, a New York City-based crowd funding firm. Part of the aversion to Wall Street may be distrust stemming from the Great Recession. Only 14% of 18 to 29-year-olds say they trust Wall Street to \" do the right thing all or most of the time .\" For Jake Lane, a 23-year-old growth analyst at LawnStarter, an online lawn care service, the investing mindset of younger Americans is one seeking immediate profits, and that doesn't work with long-term stock investing. \"I think it's all about instant gratification for my generation,\" Lane says. \"Stocks seem antiquated, foreign and time-consuming.\" Properly investing in stocks takes industry knowledge, analytical skills, and patience, and that doesn't sound fun he says. Even professional Millennials who have chosen a finance career agree their peers aren't all that plugged into the stock market. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T21:51:02.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
