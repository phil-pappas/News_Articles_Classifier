Adobe \nIf you’re a graphic designer or photographer, Adobe is a name you’re familiar with. And if not, you should be. I’ve been using Adobe’s Photoshop software for over a decade. I received a free copy of Photoshop 6 in 1999. I found the learning curve to be a bit difficult and didn’t use it much. It wasn’t until the release of Photoshop 7 that I decided to learn a little bit more about the product. I will admit that I still have Photoshop 7 in my software library to this day, just in case. Let’s face, it this software can be expensive and I found during the release of CS3, CS4, CS6 and other versions, this software was just too expensive for me. These versions of this software are considered suites and included more software than just Photoshop. For example Adobe CS6 (Creative Suite 6) included Photoshop Extended, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks, Acrobat, Bridge and Media Encoder. But the software cost on average of $2500.00. And, although there was the option to upgrade, it was still pricey. Adobe Creative Cloud View all 9 photos \nThe answer to my prayers was Adobe CC (Creative Cloud) . Adobe CC allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee for a group of Adobe products for both your desktop, tablet, and smartphone. You can also subscribe to these products separately, but I suggest subscribing to the CC suite, you’ll save lots of money. My current subscription includes Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Dreamweaver, Muse, Flash Professional, Acrobat Pro DC, Audition, Bridge, Edge Animate, Edge Code, Edge Inspect, Edge Reflow, Fireworks, Flash Builder, InCopy, Prelude, Media Encoder, Scout, SpeedGrade, Story Plus, Phone Gap Build, Prelude Live Logger, Gaming SDK, Extension Manager and ExtendScript Toolkit. That’s a lot! \nCurrently you can subscribe to the creative cloud software and receive all that I mentioned above for as little as $49 a month. Being a subscriber or member to the Creative Cloud privies users to software updates and upgrades. It has to be the sexiest software around. \nAs if it couldn’t get sexier, in their 2015 Creative Cloud release, many applications received tons of upgrades. In addition, Adobe added Adobe Stock. Let me tell you why this is different from your average stop photography plan. I am a member of iStockPhoto , for example. Three credits will cost me $33, while 60 credits will cost me $520. Now to Adobe Stock, a single image will cost you $9 (without the CC suite), 10 images will cost you $29 and 750 image will cost you $199 annually (paid over a monthly plan). That equates to .26 per photo. This is good news for creative designers. Users can download a stock photo directly from within a creative cloud application. Adobe will allow designers to use a stock sample (with the Adobe watermark) in projects. If a designer decides the photo is one that they want in their project, they can purchase the original photo from within the project and Adobe will automatically replace the sample with the original so the project won’t have to be recreated. As an author, a book publisher, and a graphic designer, this is great news for me and my business. I can choose from millions of royalty-photos. Currently Adobe Stock has images, illustrations, and vector graphics. At the time of this article, the software does not include videos and animations like iStockPhoto, but Adobe is always improving, so I’m sure videos will part of software soon \nIf you are a designer, photographer, podcaster, animator, or content creator and you’re not an Adobe subscriber, I highly recommend you sign up today. Make sure you add the Adobe Stock application for an additional $29 a month.
