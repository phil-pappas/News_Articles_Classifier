Bloomberg by Jonathan Shapiro On October 6, 2011, the world mourned the passing of Steve Jobs in Palo Alto, California. One of America's the greatest industrialists quite literally touched the lives of billions, but the Apple empire he created in 1976 needed to enter its next phase. The challenge was to avoid becoming a victim of Job's success.\nTim Cook, his successor, would not only have to match expectations of consumers and analysts by dazzling them with new products – he would have to deal with the near-$US76 billion pile of cash that Apple had accumulated. Meeting this challenge is what led the world's most famous tech company to Australia's debt market in mid-August.\nCook quickly learned that even the biggest and best companies were not safe from activist investors and New York's most aggressive hedge fund managers David Einhorn and Carl Icahn mounted campaigns for Apple to release its cash.\nOn April 25, 2013, Cook announced plans to pay back $US100 billion of capital to shareholders over three years. But there was a problem. Most of Apple's cash resides in offshore bank accounts – a result of its global reach and structure aimed at limiting tax.\nFor Apple to pay out that cash directly it would take a 35 per cent hit via the US corporate tax rate. The solution was to use debt to fund capital returns, and that meant the world's most cashed-up corporate would need to borrow – and borrow big – to buy back shares and pay dividends.\nTimed to perfection So within days of its capital return Apple, which had been assigned AA+ and Aa1 ratings from credit rating agencies – made its debut in the bond market. The deal was a record breaker, a $US17 billion ($24 billion) multi-tranche deal that was timed to perfection.\nThe deal was enormous, but as its cash coffers swelled Apple would need to return frequently to the bond market to meet shareholder demands. Apple's annual debt funding task would be around $US20 billion a year, on par with global banks and government agencies that are considered 'frequent borrowers' in the bond markets.\n Apple outlined its plans to spread its debt funding so that it was not reliant on the big US bond funds for capital. That meant looking to new markets and with Goldman Sachs advising the company raised money in euros, yen, Swiss francs and pounds.\nTo the pleasant surprise of many, its next destination would be Australia, a market that proved an important destination for global banks and agencies but was hardly on the radar for large corporations.\nYet it was an attractive option for a number of reasons. Australia was a wholesale market and establishing the documents needed to sell bonds could be done in a few weeks. The Australian market was also open for business at a time when most major investors were on their summer holidays.\nApple's growing treasury team, based at the firm's headquarters in Cupertino, had been monitoring the Australian \"Kangaroo\" bond market. Its advisor Goldman Sachs was confident they could do a worthwhile deal but plans remained highly secretive.\nLaying out a strategy Ahead of the deal, the plan was to lay out a marketing strategy with the view to introducing itself to investors on the Monday and printing a deal by the Friday – without even setting foot in the country. This was a timetable only Apple could pull off by virtue of its immense brand among consumers and bond managers, its remarkable balance sheet and its established presence in other bond markets.\nCommonwealth Bank, which had a role on BHP's heralded return to the Aussie bond market, was given a mandate along with Deutsche Bank on what was certain to be a marque trade.\nOn Monday morning, Apple's banks distributed a note to investors that they'd be holding calls with investors ahead of a possible deal. The following day, Apple's executives held an investor call with 70 analysts dialling in to hear the firm's investor relations team walk through its business and its balance sheet.\nApple was available for follow up calls but few chose to take up the offer. This was a company known to all and with $US200 billion in the bank, 'credit work' wasn't the most taxing.\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the banks began to gather feedback and field shadow orders. At that stage, Apple unveiled its intentions to print a a four-year fixed and floating rate bond, and a seven year bond to cast its net as wide as possible.\nTime to talk price Then it came time to talk price. Apple's large line of US bonds meant it wasn't hard to work out a fair level. But just like its products, Apple's quality bonds weren't going to come cheap.\nApple set the price guidance at rates which were expensive compared to their US bonds. But they looked a great deal compared with Australian major banks bonds which offered a slightly lower yield but had credit ratings two notches below Apple. For Aussie bond funds that are up to their gills in major bank paper, a better-rated global tech bond had appeal.\n\"They think they're special, and maybe they are,\" commented one fund manager who debated whether to buy the bonds.\nThe real buzz came on Thursday morning. Just before 9am the order books were opened and the bids rushed in. By 11am, the order book had swelled to $1.5 billion, a response even seasoned veterans had never seen. By the end of the day, the order book reached about $2.5 billion.\nBy Friday, morning orders had reached $3 billion, compelling Apple to take advantage by squeezing in the pricing by 5 basis points. One or two accounts dropped out but Apple had plenty of interest to print an enormous deal that would smash local records.\nAt 3pm it was official. Apple had printed $2.25 billion, double the previous largest ever deal. And all in the space of five remarkable days for the Australian corporate bond market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:07:50.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
