Our goal is to provide fund clients with system-generated NAVs for Monday by tomorrow night,\" Hassell said on Sunday night.\nThe bank has completed calculating net asset values (NAVs) for all funds through last Thursday with the exception of those of one mutual fund client, Hassell said, without identifying the client.\nAn accounting system BNY Mellon relies on to calculate the prices of clients' mutual funds and ETFs broke down last weekend, disrupting pricing on nearly 5 percent of U.S. mutual funds and ETFs with about $404 billion in assets, according to data from Morningstar and Lipper.\nHassell said the bank still didn't know the root cause of the failure and would seek assistance from independent third-party to work on the issue.\nLast Thursday, financial services software provider SunGard, which hosts an accounting platform that helps the world's largest custody bank calculate NAVs for its funds clients, apologized for the glitch that happened during a systems upgrade.
