Dominic Lorrimer by Max Mason Nine Entertainment Co's 'home of television' will be sold to Hong Kong-based property investor Euro Properties for $147.5 million and turned into apartments.\nThe site, in the Sydney north shore suburb of Willoughby, has been home to the Nine Network for 50 years, dating back to the time of founder Sir Frank Packer.\nThe deal, which is subject to approval from the Foreign Investment Review Board, has a timeline of two years for completion. Nine will then lease the site for up to three years for $10 million per year, pre-tax, before relocating.\nNine said that it expects cash proceeds of around $135 million from the sale.\nNine chief financial officer Simon Kelly said the move from Willoughby is significant.\n\"Our relocation to state of the art facilities will enable us to further optimise our operations as we evolve our business model in a digital world,\" Mr Kelly said.\n\"This sale frees up surplus capital which provides us with significant flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities whilst underpinning our program of increased shareholder returns through our previously announced on-market share buyback and enhanced dividend payout policy.\"\nThe move comes a week after Nine signed the biggest sports deal in free-to-air television history to retain its broadcast rights to the National Rugby League in an agreement worth $189 million annually.\n However, the AFL is expected to announce a $2 billion six year rights deal with Seven and Foxtel in the coming days.\nNine has faced tough community opposition to sell the property with discussions to sell the land for redevelopment starting 10 years ago and given up on. The latest talks started around two years ago.\nThe transmission tower that sits nearby is independently-owned by TX Australia, is located on a separate block, and will stay. The three transmissions dishes on the site will be demolished once the network leaves.\nIn early January, Nine chief executive David Gyngell, whose father Bruce was the first person on Australian television, received the news that NSW Planning Assessment Commission (PAC) and the NSW Land and Environment Court had allowed an increase in the maximum number of apartments to 400 units, up from the previously approved 350 units. Among the significant details contained in the court's determination are a 6 per cent reduction in overall floor space allowing more open space and less site coverage.\nThe apartments will be housed in five planned buildings will be limited to a maximum height of eight storeys. Two rows of terrace houses also form part of the plan.\nThis will be the second such deal for Nine, which in 2010 sold its former Bendigo Street, Richmond site in Melbourne to Lend Lease, for a reported $50 million. The first stage sold out quickly and the second of three stages, of what is now a $450 million development was launched late last year.\nwith Carolyn Cummins", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/nine-holds-onto-nrl-television-rights-20150809-giva5s"], "published": "2015-08-18T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:09:44.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
