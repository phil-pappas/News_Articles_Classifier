Peter Rae by Dominic White Paul McIntyre The Sharp family from north Sydney suburb Mosman could be Foxtel's worst nightmare .\nThe week that US streaming service Netflix launched in Australia, the long-time Foxtel household cut its $106-a-month cable-television bill by three-quarters by ditching its drama, movies and kids packs, among others.\n\"As soon as Netflix came out I took the free month trial and I was struck by how high quality their own-produced content is, how much it interests me and how easy it is to use,\" said lawyer, husband and 33-year-old father of two Andrew Sharp. \"It brought into focus the fact that I had been paying a lot of money for hundreds of channels that I wasn't watching.\"\nMr Sharp is among 1.6 million Australians who have signed up to Netflix within six months of its launch , according to Citi, which puts local rival Stan, owned by Nine Entertainment Co and Fairfax Media, owner of The Australian Financial Review , on 332,000 sign ups, ahead of Foxtel and Seven West Media's Presto on 193,000.\nThe Netflix effect? TV viewers notched up another record fall in broadcast viewing time in the June quarter over the same time last year. Bloomberg Citi predicts that more homes will have an SVOD service than the 2.6 million that currently take Foxtel within three years. That would make it one of the fastest take-ups of a new consumer technology in Australian history.\nThe Sharps pay $22.50 a month for basic Foxtel as part of their Telstra bundle plus $12 for Netflix, which offers ritzy original shows with Hollywood stars such as House of Cards and the new Wet Hot American Summer on demand, as well as a deep library of older movies and shows.\nIn the United States they call it \"cord-shaving\", and it worries Wall Street.\nUS media shares tank Major media company share prices tanked by $50 billion there last week amid weak results and fears younger viewers and families are defecting from traditional linear, cable television to ad-free subscription video on demand (SVOD), compounding a weak advertising market.\nLachlan Murdoch responded to the market panic in his first results call as co-chairman of 21st Century Fox. He said the \"scale and speed of rapid change\" in the media and entertainment sector will be \"overwhelming for some\" in the industry.\nAs media investors in Australia anxiously await reporting season, starting this week with Foxtel's 50 per cent owner News Corp among others, they are wondering how companies here will be affected by the SVOD revolution.\nAnd it is not just Foxtel under the spotlight . Free-to-air linear television viewing in Australia dropped below 90 hours a month for the first time ever one month after Netflix's launch.\nLocal media CEOs insist the Netflix hype is overstated. Australia is very different market, cable penetration is 30 per cent (versus 90 per cent in the US) and sport, the protectorate of free-to-air broadcasters and dominion of most Foxtel subscribers, dominates ratings. Netflix says it has no plans to buy sports rights. It is a nuanced and complex picture.\nBut a revolution it certainly is.\nStan CEO Mike Sneesby puts SVOD's popularity down to the fact its programming is shorn of the scheduling requirements that encumber regular television networks.\n\"Free-to-air television is about drawing the biggest, broadest audiences you can in the right time slot and catering to that time slot, typically 8.30 on a Sunday night, while meeting the classification requirements,\" he says.\n\"When you ignore all that and ask 'how do I make the most appealing TV show?', more people watch and you end up with a show that typically has more sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.\"\nTuning out April 1 this year was no day for fools in TV land. For the first time since television people meters were introduced in 1991, and probably since the 1970s, the amount of time Australians spent watching broadcast TV fell below 90 hours per month.\nBroadcast still dwarfs the time spent on any other video service, channel or device by a multiple of 12. But the trend will excite those predicting the demise of TV as we know it – average viewing time hit 89.3 hours per month in the three months ended March 31.\n\"There is more a la carte viewing. People are taking control and using these [on demand] services to binge view, to watch an entire series and it does take a few minutes a day from TV,\" says OzTAM's CEO Doug Peiffer. \"It's definitely changing.\"\nEarly signals from OzTAM for the June quarter suggest more bad news. Yet to be released figures show TV viewers notched up another record fall in broadcast viewing time in the June quarter over the same time last year – down about six hours a month.\nCold weather means TV viewing picks up during winter so the three months to June will likely see a return to around 91 hours a month. But the underlying time allocation to broadcast viewing is still down around 7 per cent compared to the winter months of 2014.\nAs tempting as it might be to slate the blame onto Netflix and others such as Google's YouTube , the real story is not so clean cut.\nThe TV ratings system does not cover any broadcast content that is watched on any screen or device other than the big one in the lounge room – no smartphones, desktops, laptops or tablets are in the current TV ratings mix despite every broadcaster now seeing large volumes of \"catch-up\" streaming of their content and all sorts of recuts for different online platforms and services.\nThe TV industry is racing to address the gap this year and when it does, viewing declines will likely reverse a little. \"It should level out in the high 80s,\" says Peiffer of monthly viewing hours for broadcast.\nBut he adds: \"Anything could change that – if Netflix gave free subscriptions for six months we could see a bit more impact.\"\nThe new prime time Meanwhile, viewing habits on Stan, launched in January, are revealing a \"new primetime\", says Sneesby. \"It sits alongside FTA but it's later in the evening, from 9pm. While there may be a little impact on viewing times, it's also coming from parts in the day that are not generating most of the value for FTA networks. We're complimentary to FTA.\"\nBut Citi analyst Justin Diddams says that is the free-to-air networks (rather than the more profitable Foxtel) whose earnings growth could be crimped the most by SVOD.\nFree-to-airs will have to invest in expensive, risky, cutting-edge content to keep their linear channels relevant, he says.\nThe sight of fierce free-to-air rivals Seven West Media and Nine scrapping in the courts last week is symptomatic of a wider malaise, say some. Seven tried unsuccessfully to prevent Nine screening its new cooking show The Hotplate – which Seven alleges is a rip-off of its My Kitchen Rules .\nSpoilt for digital choice, viewers are growing more discerning, and fatigued by same-genre reality shows, making some media buyers and advertisers question the formats.\nTim Worner, chief executive of Seven West Media, says the OzTAM viewing trends are \"no real surprise\". \"The number of viewing options in the market has increased. I do not think the currently similarity of some free-to-air content has helped in the current television season,\" he says.\n\"But let's just stop for a moment and acknowledge the power of free-to-air television as the most dominant viewing option. Right now, free-to-air reaches 85 per cent of Aussies each week [20 million Australians] and records a 76 per cent share of TV viewing across the entire day, increasing to over 80 per cent at night.\"\nNine CEO David Gyngell concurs: \"Overseas experience has shown that these [SVOD] services actually encourage more big-screen viewing and after the initial exploration, viewers revert back to free-to-air as their core and supplement with other services.\"\nGyngell says that certain genres are better suited to SVOD such as \"serialised drama and niche content\" and believes that type of viewing will migrate to SVOD platforms over time. \"However, SVOD doesn't provide the bulk of what people want to watch: news, sport, large format reality and most importantly Australian content.\"\nNine and Seven have had their share prices hammered since Nine put out a profit warning two months ago, and some experts believe the sector is oversold by investors and advertisers alike.\nBut both networks have a delicate balance to manage as they try not to talk up their own SVOD services at the expense of their main free-air businesses: Seven has joined Foxtel on its Presto SVOD platform.\nPresto is trailing second-placed Stan by some distance (see graphic) amid sledging by rivals that Foxtel is not pushing it hard for fear it could encourage cord-shaving.\nCiti predicts Stan will still run at a loss – to the tune of $42 million – in 2018. Others, say Stan's ability to offset new production costs with international distribution deals will help its cash flows.\nFoxtel chief executive Richard Freudenstein downplays talk of chord-shaving, listing Foxtel's sports rights and considerable exclusive cable content including HBO series such as Game of Thrones. He is more blunt.\n\"SVOD in Australia is not a game for the faint-hearted. Everyone is investing considerable amounts of money to grow their subscriber base quickly. If Stan wants to be part of that, their shareholders are going to to have to be willing to commit long term.\"\nBut Gyngell says, boldly, that he sees \"no reason why Stan won't be head to head with Netflix over time\".\nAnd Fairfax Media CEO Greg Hywood suggests that it is in fact Foxtel, with its world-leading average revenues per user of more than $100, which has the most to fear from the SVOD revolution.\n\"WIth SVOD you are talking about paying around $10 a month against cable at around $120. Cable will continue but its ability to completely dominate that market will go because there's a cheaper alternative,\" he says.\nThe true impact on the sector it yet to be played out, says Nikko Asset Management portfolio manager Michael Maughan. \"Given that SVOD is currently at that magic price point of zero dollars [for the first month], free is a pretty compelling proposition, so we are not going to know what the longer-term impact of this is going to be for at least six months to probably more like 12.\"\nSee afr.com for part two on Monday.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/media-and-marketing/foxtel-in-spotlight-over-customer-spindown-20150716-gie1zg.html"], "published": "2015-08-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T20:06:33.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
