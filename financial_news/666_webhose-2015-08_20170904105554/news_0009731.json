The company expects the start-up this year of its third hub in the UK, the Laggan-Tormore project in the Shetlands. \nHowever, North Sea oil and gas has come under pressure over the last year amid higher costs and lower prices for crude. Thousands of jobs have been lost offshore of Aberdeen and Total is one of a number of major oil and gas companies to offload ageing assets over the last year. \nThis week, Maersk Oil said it would seek approval to close its Janice facility, which produces around 7,000 barrels per day (bpd) from three North Sea oilfields. The Danish operator said that 200 jobs could be lost offshore from the closure. \nBrent crude has fallen 56pc over the last 12 months to around $44 per barrel putting pressure on operators in the North Sea to cut costs. \nIn March, George Osborne unveiled measures worth £1.3bn over five years aimed at boosting flagging North Sea oil production by 15pc by the end of the decade. \nThe effective tax rate on production from older oil and gas fields was reduced from 80pc to 75pc, while on newer fields it would be cut from 60pc to 50pc. This was intended to help safeguard jobs offshore and encourage companies to invest more in developing new fields. \nThe Chancellor also unveiled plans to partially fund new exploration work to help increase the region’s reserves. \nDespite the challenges, North Sea production is expected to increase for the first time in 15 years . Offshore watchdog Oil and Gas UK has said that output from the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) over the first six months of this year could be 2.5pc higher than the same period last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T19:37:40.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
