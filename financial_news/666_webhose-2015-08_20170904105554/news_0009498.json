Joe Armao Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Durkin It was something straight out of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four or a World War II movie, rather than a federal government agency media release.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott's newly formed Border Force heralded that its troops would be patrolling the streets of Melbourne on Friday and Saturday night, arm in arm with Victoria Police, the Sheriff's office and public transport officials, stopping people at random and checking their visa papers, in a multi-agency crackdown codenamed Operation Fortitude.\n\"ABF officers will be positioned at various locations around the CBD speaking with any individual we cross paths with,\" ABF Regional Commander Victoria and Tasmania, Don Smith, proudly threatened.\nThe crackdown came just a week after Melbourne was named the world's most liveable city for a fifth year in a row, and as the city was gearing up for a weekend of events to celebrate its 180th birthday. When news of the story broke by mid-Friday morning, most people honestly thought it was a joke.\n\"I literally thought border force was a joke. I read it on twitter and I thought it was a satirical tweet....\" @Rinbaaki wrote. \"Please tell me this is some sort of April Fools Day joke,\" @Nicholas_Reece tweeted.\nOnce reality set in, up to 200 protesters mobilised with megaphones and banners to gatecrash a press conference with representatives of Operation Fortitude which was scheduled for 2pm at Melbourne's busiest intersection – the steps of Flinders Street station.\n\"Refugees are welcome, Border Force is not,\" chanted a crowd including the Socialist Alliance, RMIT Student Union and others free on a Friday afternoon.\nThe press conference was scrapped and by 2.30pm, Border Force had issued a \"clarifying statement\".\n But by this stage, Victoria's new Police Commissioner Graham Ashton – leading the operation – was clearly fuming at the \"clumsily worded\" and pre-emptive Border Force press release and just 15 minutes later he had canned the whole operation.\n\"Victoria Police has made a decision not to go ahead with this weekend's Operation Fortitude,\" it posted on Facebook around 2.45pm.\nTony Abbott – who needs this controversy like a hole in the head – must have been thanking his lucky stars he was still on a plane returning from the Torres Strait Islands. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton was also ducking and weaving on Friday.\nBut with the goals wide open, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten apparently stepped off a plane without the full story and fluffed his opportunity by essentially backing the crackdown.\n\"Labor obviously believes in targeting crime,\" Shorten told reporters. Shorten's biggest shot was that, \"if you're going to do a blitz, I don't know why you'd necessarily telegraph it to the media first.\"\nAnd so it was left to the little known Commissioner of Border Force, Roman Quaedvlieg, to eat the proverbial sandwich, although he kept plenty of leftovers for those further down the line.\n\"Read through the lay persons' eyes, which I absolutely openly acknowledge, it's clumsily worded [media release]... it was misunderstood... misconstrued... the minister's office was not involved, it was circulated at a regional level in Victoria... it was at the lower levels of the organisation\".", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108544913517269724355/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/patrickdurkin"], "published": "2015-08-28T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:07:17.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
