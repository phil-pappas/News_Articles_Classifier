He hinted at further spending cuts if economic conditions worsen, including a steeper drop in oil prices.\n\nThe company said it was selling a 33 percent stake in the Showa Shell refinery in Japan to Idemitsu for about 1.4 billion.\n\nBG DEAL\n\nShell also reassured wary investors its bumper BG buy will not break the bank. If the deal goes through in early 2016 as planned, capital investments in 2016 will be 35 billion, Shell said, lower than the 42 to 40 billion analysts had expected.\n\n\"With progress on the deal on track this is a new emerging business which can pay dividends whatever the oil price environment,\" said analysts at Bernstein, who rate the stock as \"outperform\".\n\nShell is still awaiting regulatory approvals for the deal from the European Union, China and Australia, after Brazil, the United States and South Korea cleared it.\n\nThe deal is expected to generate pretax benefits of around 2.5 billion per year starting 2018. The tie-up will turn Shell into the world's leading liquefied natural gas company and one of the largest deepwater oil producers with a focus on Brazil.\n\nShell's second-quarter \"cost of supplies\" earnings, excluding identified items, the company's definition of net income, came in at 3.84 billion, down from 6.13 billion a year earlier and 3.25 billion in the previous quarter. The results beat expectations of 3.18 billion, according to an analyst consensus provided by the company.\n\nShell shares, which fell earlier this week to their lowest this year, were trading up 3.6 percent at 0920 GMT, while the European oil and gas sector was up 1.3 percent.\n\nA sharp decline of around 75 percent in revenue from oil production was once again offset by refining and trading, where earnings more than doubled from a year earlier.\n\nShell maintained its quarterly dividend at 47 cents per share and committed to rewarding shareholders with at least the same payout in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T23:32:08.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
