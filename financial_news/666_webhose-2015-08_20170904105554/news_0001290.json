Powers, Chief Investment Officer at BNP Partners.The firm was reacting to news that FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) formally filed their Ferrari IPO paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission last Thursday. Although the filing did not include specifics like an IPO price, it is thought that the slae will value the luxury sports car maker at 10 billion, considerably more than the 8 billion some commentators had predicted at the time of FCA CEO, Sergio Marchionne's initial announcement of his company's intention to sell a 10% stake.Of the remaining 90% of Ferrari, 10% is owned by Piero Ferrari, the son of the late Enzo Ferrari while 80% is owned by FCA and, according to Mr. Marchionne, is to be distributed among FCA's shareholders.BNP Partnersreiterated its advice to investors to avoid \"backdoor\" routes to Ferrari ownershipincluding the acquisition of shares in FCA warning that its share price would likely fall sharply given the proportion of the company's value its Ferrari stake represents. \"Once its stake is sold, there isn't that much more meat left on the bone,\" Powers concluded.About BNP Partners:At BNP Partners, they define effective wealth management as an overall strategy that seamlessly integrates their clients' personal ROI (return-on-investment) aspirations with their investment management prowess.Whilst today's markets can often demonstrate the type of characteristics that have served to hamper the efforts of many traditional investment methodologies to secure the returns they once did, BNP Partners continue to secure exceptional returns for their esteemed clients utilizing a meticulously applied combination of those same traditional methods whilst diligently complementing them with new, pioneering techniques.
