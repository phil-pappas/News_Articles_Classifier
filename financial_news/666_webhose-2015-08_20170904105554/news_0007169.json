Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) operated MLNG Dua via a production sharing contract signed with Petronas since 1993. \nMalaysia is the world's second-largest exporter of LNG, according to the U.S Energy Information Administration. LNG revenues made up some 2.7 percent of the Southeast Asia nation's gross domestic product, according to World Bank data.
