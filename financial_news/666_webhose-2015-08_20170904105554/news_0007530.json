Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) cheaper onshore developments have stalled as companies reassess their yearly budgets. \nIn Wednesday's sale, five companies submitted 33 bids on 33 tracts covering 190,080 acres (76,923 hectares) in the western region, BOEM said. \nAustralia's BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) was the most active with 26 bids. BP made one bid, Colombia's Ecopetrol made four, three of which were made jointly with Anadarko Petroleum, and Houston-based Peregrine Oil and Gas made two. \nLast year saw 93 bids on 81 tracts totaling $110 million in high bids. In 2012, when oil prices fluctuated between $100 and $80 a barrel, there were 131 bids on 116 tracts, with high bids hitting $133 million, a BOEM spokesman said. \n(Reporting By Edward McAllister; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T22:00:40.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
