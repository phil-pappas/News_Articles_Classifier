The book and periodical-publishing division will be combined into a business with about $3.5 billion in sales. Edgar Online, Bowne Financial and the financial-printing operations will form a third, with about $1 billion in sales.\n“We recognize that parts of the current portfolio will be more successful pursuing different strategies, and that these particular businesses offer the scale, expertise, product and service mix and other resources to excel as standalone companies,” Chief Executive Officer Thomas Quinlan said in the statement.\nRR Donnelley bought Edgar in 2012 and Bowne in 2010. Its most recent purchase was the $293.9 million takeover of book publisher Courier Corp. in June. The group’s split will enable each business to follow its own capital structure and investment policy and enable a more focused planning for each brand, the company said.\nRR Donnelley plans to spin off to its shareholders the financial-communications and publishing companies in a tax-free transaction by the end of 2016, according to the statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T14:45:55.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
