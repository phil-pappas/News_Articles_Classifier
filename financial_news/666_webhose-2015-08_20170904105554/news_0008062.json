But Mr Dixon is not rushing in.\nInstead, his team is focused on a program for the Australian firm to prepare staff for when that day comes.\n Crucial step This was a crucial step before saying goodbye to rankings, Mr Dixon said.\n\"We need to increase the quality of discussions, get them happening more frequently, and define the behaviours that lead to a high-quality outcome,\" he said.\nMr Dixon's warnings are not without foundation.\nDeloitte introduced fortnightly \"check-ins\" between staff and managers as a substitute for formal bi-annual reviews.\nA blog post from one employee in Deloitte's US firm, which starts dismantling annual reviews before its Australian sister firm, highlights the potential for these more informal arrangements to deteriorate into short-term goals, rather than long-term career modelling .\n\"The check-ins are supposed to be about your strengths and not about the current project. Sounds good, except it always turns into \"get this to me by X day this week,\" the anonymous blogger wrote.\n\"This system isn't revolutionary, it's about saving time. Saving time means more time to fill with chargeable hours.\"\nEngagement levels dipped This type of backlash is exactly what Mr Dixon seeks to avoid. Ernst & Young's employee engagement levels measured by IBM Kenexa dipped a few years ago and have not recovered completely.\nSince Ernst & Young formally opened its \"Counselling at EY\" career program in April more than 300 staff have put their hand up to be counsellors â€“ 80 per cent of them equity partners. These volunteers will be split into groups of 10 and assigned a group of up to 25 candidates to mentor.\nWhile it will not replace Ernst & Young's bi-annual review process, the scheme is meant to \"dial down the importance of ratings\", Mr Dixon said.\nTo show it is serious Ernst & Young has linked mentors' performance in the program to remuneration in an effort to hold them accountable and reward those doing it right.\nThe company's global assessment process for partners has a line item called \"people engagement and teaming\". For partners who opt to lead one of Ernst & Young's career counselling \"families\", their success in that role will become the most important determination of performance around that metric.\n\"It is still a bit diluted, but they have to be able to draw a relatively straight line to compensation, otherwise it's not going to achieve the desired outcomes,\" Mr Dixon said.\nThis initiative has been picked up by Ernst & Young's Shanghai-based regional head of human resources Bin Wolfe as a talent priority.", "external_links": ["http://goingconcern.com/post/least-one-person-not-impressed-deloittes-new-performance-evaluations", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace-relations/goodbye-rankings-accenture-gives-annual-performance-reviews-the-flick-20150721-gihn7y.html"], "published": "2015-08-18T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:15:47.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
