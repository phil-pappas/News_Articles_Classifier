Photo: Jessica Hromas\nSantos has insisted it is \"confident in the company's outlook\" after the stock took an extraordinary 9 per cent hit on Friday sending it to its lowest price in 11 years.\nThe spanking took place amid spiralling concerns that Santos cannot avoid an equity raising in what is looking increasingly like a prolonged slump in oil prices.\nWhile shares across the energy sector were hit by a 2.1 per cent drop in crude futures in New York on Friday, Santos was worst affected amid revived concerns that it will be forced to call on shareholders to relieve pressure on its balance sheet.\nFriday's close of $5.99 was the lowest for Santos since 2004 and the stock is now down 58 per cent from a year ago, wiping more than $8 billion from its market value.\nAdvertisement Santos has insisted it does not need to raise equity but the market is not convinced, analysts and portfolio managers said on Friday.\n\"Management is finding it very difficult to gain traction in terms of the stated position that they have enough flexibility to manage the current debt position, and I'm not sure that's washing particularly well with investors at this stage,\" Tim Schroeders, at Pengana Capital, said.\nA spokesman for the company didn't directly address the equity raising issue, saying: \"We note the fall in our share price today along with other energy stocks, however, we remain confident in the company's outlook and have more than $2 billion in available liquidity.\"\n\"Santos has and continues to take positive steps to strengthen the company's operating position in the lower oil price environment,\" he added, pointing to spending that is running more than 50 per cent below 2014 levels so far this year and production costs for the first half that are tracking below guidance.\nSantos's balance sheet has been squeezed by its funding commitment for the $US18.5 billion ($25 billion) GLNG liquefied natural gas project in Queensland, which is finally due to begin production this half. But sales prices for LNG have slumped, following the oil price lower, so cash flows from the venture are set to fall significantly short of what might have been expected a year ago in the absence of an oil price recovery.\nThe Santos spokesman said progress towards start-up of the GLNG venture on Curtis Island in Gladstone harbour was \"excellent.\"\n\"Our flagship GLNG project is progressing well as we move toward first LNG around the end of the third quarter.\"\nSantos is due to report first half results next Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T19:44:36.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
