Plenary usually implements the strategy at the beginning of the financial year.\n\"It's a great way of building up the super balance of a partner on a lower income or with a lower balance, such as a spouse out of the workforce for several years raising children,\" Cratchley says.\nA scheme member is able to split 85 per cent of concessional contributions each year with a partner.\nFor example, during the 2014-15 financial year, Jack, aged 60, salary-sacrificed $25,000 to his SMSF. The maximum amount that Jack can split with his spouse, Jill, 50, who does not work, is 85 per cent of his concessional contributions up to the concessional cap amount.\n In this case, the figure is 85 per cent of $25,000, or $21,250, says the SMSF Association.\nIt does not get Jack out of paying the 15 per cent contributions tax. But in this case it enables Jack and Jill to maximise the amount that could be withdrawn tax-free if either one, or both, stopped work between the ages of 55 and 65.\n\"We are generally moving into an older spouse's account so they have more benefits to rollover into a pension at 60,\" says Cratchley.\n\"Then these assets would be 100 per cent tax-free on the earnings. This would also allow the older spouse to draw a larger pre-retirement pension – which is limited to 10 per cent of the account balance – allowing the couple to salary-sacrifice more, without taking a cash flow hit.\"\nThose aged between 55 and 60 can withdraw only the first $185,000 tax-free.\nBy having two funds they could withdraw $370,000 tax-free between them.\nIt is possible to split both this and last year's concessional contributions – but not contributions made prior to that.\n\"This is especially important if you are making changes to super arrangements as you can't split contributions made to a former fund,\" says Cratchley.\n\"So if you move your super, you need to split last year's contributions, split the contributions made so far in the current year, then roll over the super and then split the contributions made to the new fund at the start of the next financial year,\" he says.\nSplitting can also be used to gain early access to the super of the spouse who reaches pension age first, which can help preserve accumulated funds as the working partner continues to contribute.\nThere is no immediate tax or planning advantage from balancing the super accounts of members, according to advisers.\nBut it might be a strategic move to put large super savings out-of-reach of future cash-strapped federal governments looking for easy revenue sources to balance their books by restricting lump sum withdrawals or putting a special tax on higher balances.\n\"Balancing a couple's accounts would limit any fall-out from future government policy aimed at taxing members with high account balances, or high incomes,\" argues Cratchley.\nMore than 20 years after Australia set up compulsory retirement savings, more than four out of five retirees are eligible for a full – or part – pension.\n\"By splitting contributions to a younger spouse it improves your Centrelink position,\" says AMP financial planner Andrew Heaven of WealthPartners Financial Solutions.\n\"It's not an instant fix, but it can be valuable if used as part of a long-term strategic plan for retirement.\"\nSuper splitting is done by completing a short form that is usually supplied by the pension provider. Alternatively, a certified financial adviser should know how it is done and who is eligible.\nThere are several amounts that cannot be split. They include benefits rolled over from another fund and lump sums paid from a foreign superannuation fund.\nHOW TO AVOID A SPLITTING HEADACHE Joshua Cratchley, a certified financial planner, on the upside and downside of super splitting.\nGreat for couples where there is a reasonable age difference, say five years; Can help access age pension entitlements while preserving capital; Can help fund the insurance premiums of a partner with a low account balance and maximise a couple's personal cashflow; Can allow a couple to access superannuation benefits tax free sooner; Could help balance spouse's super accounts and limit fall out from future rule changes aimed at taxing members with high account balances or high incomes; Can only split 85 per cent of concessional (pre-tax) contributions Can only split the previous financial year's and the current financial year's concessional contributions. As of August 2015 can split 2014-15 contributions and the contributions received since 1 July 2015. Cannot split non-concessional (after-tax) contributions Cannot split contributions with a spouse who has met a super condition of release and therefore can access superannuation in full. Typically this would arise upon retirement or when reach 65.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:47:55.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
