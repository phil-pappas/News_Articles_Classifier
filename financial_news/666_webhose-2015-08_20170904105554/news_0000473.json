Approximately 400 delivery boys are on strike since Monday, reportedly stalling 4,000-5,000 packages that remain undelivered.\nThe delivery staff are on strike demanding toilet facilities at delivery hubs, proper working hours, extra allowances for overtime, a six-day week, work schedules, etc.\nFlipkart said that out of the 20 delivery hubs in Mumbai, only one hub has gone on strike.\nThe delivery boys on strike are affiliated with the Maharashtra Navnirman Kamgar Sena in Mumbai, a source told FE.\nA Flipkart spokesperson claimed that the number of delivery staff on strike is minuscule and that they account for just 50% of workforce of a delivery hub. “They are being motivated by people with misguided interests,” the Flipkart spokesperson said.\nEkart Logistics handles all the last-mile deliveries for Flipkart and Myntra. A Myntra spokesperson said the companies themselves do not indulge in delivery mechanism as Ekart handles all aspects of it.\nAn Ekart spokesperson said: “Our operations in Mumbai are running normally. We have 19 delivery hubs in Mumbai and our team of field executives are ensuring that all the shipments are reaching the customers in the quickest possible way. A few workers (less than 2%) have been misguided by motivated interest, However, this has not affected any deliveries. Our delivery team has one of the best salary and benefits structure in the industry and we provide the best facilities to our staff. Contrary to some reports, all our delivery hubs have all standard amenities including toilets.”\nDelivery is considered the backbone of the billion-dollar e-commerce market, which can either make or break an e-commerce firm. To make faster deliveries Flipkart had recently tied up with Mumbai’s dabbawallas for the last-mile deliveries in the city.\nFirst Published on August 01, 2015 12:55 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:23:49.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
