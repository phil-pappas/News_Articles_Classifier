Where we would have expected 15,000-20,00 people we got 1,500,\" he said. \nMr Burke said the rain cost the company between five and seven million dollars in profit and stopped what would have been a record year across the group. \nThe company expects an improvement in the 2016 financial year. \n\"Based on law of averages, and there's some science to long range weather forecasts, that this year with good weather, we should be looking to perform at more normalised level,\" said Mr Burke. \nThe company hopes to boost ticket sales by dropping prices and encouraging people to buy tickets as early as possible. \nWeather woes weren't the only thing hitting the bottom line. \nReturns from the Las Vegas Wet `n' Wild dropped 12 per cent when a rival water park opened nearby. \nBut box office hits including the Imitation Game, American Sniper and 50 Shades of Grey helped the cinema division increase earnings by 14 per cent. \nMr Burke said the outlook was very positive for the upcoming year with the final instalment of the Hunger Games franchise and new James Bond and Star Wars movies slated for release. \nThe company expects to keep increasing overall spend per person by introducing hot food at the candy bar. \nDistribution rights to the hugely popular Game of Thrones and The Hobbit couldn't offset the company's film distribution business with earnings down 17 per cent. \nWhile the DVD market declined, the company's television earnings lifted 21 cent thanks to a multi-year agreement with Netflix. \nTHEME PARK WASHOUT \n* Net profits: down four per cent to $43.2 million \n* Income: up four per cent to $1 billion \n* Final dividend: steady at 14 cents a share. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook China delivers Blackmores a record profit AAP \nShares in vitamin and supplement maker Blackmores have jumped more than seven per cent after the company announced â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T11:59:14.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
