The funding will help support the FSRI's mission to increase firefighter knowledge and reduce injuries and deaths in the fire service and the communities they serve. UL's FSRI has received $11 million in grants over the past 10 years. The Fire Prevention and Safety Grants are part of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants with support projects that enhance the safety of the public and firefighters from fire and related hazards. The primary goal of these grants is to reduce injury and prevent deaths in the fire service and the communities which they serve . Over the past 30 years, despite advances in technology, the rate of firefighter deaths inside structures has continually risen. While firefighting techniques have been passed down through generations, science is vital to keep pace with new hazards and save lives, as the modern fire environment responds less effectively to certain tactics. In particular, current firefighting training lacks visual, hands-on components that enable new recruits to experience how their tactics can affect fire behavior in a structure. The newly-awarded grant will allow the FSRI to build upon the past 10 years of research to help bridge the gap between fire dynamics in training environments and actual emergencies. \"DHS-funded studies have helped save the lives of firefighters,\" said Steve Kerber , director of FSRI. \"As building and product materials change, the hazards change, making firefighting even more complex. The work FSRI will conduct through this new grant will enhance the hands-on training opportunities that firefighters can receive, leading to better decision-making on the fire ground, and more effective and efficient firefighting.\" UL plans to expand upon previous research studies that examined fire dynamics, fire service tactics and hands-on firefighter training, including:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T17:09:00.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
