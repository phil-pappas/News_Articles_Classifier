The consumer price index rose 0.1% from June's 0%, beating expectations that it would remain unchanged, the Office for National Statistics revealed. Core inflation rose 1.2% in July compared to a year ago, more than the 0.9% growth predicted, and up from the prior month's 0.8% gain. \nWhile inflation remains well below the BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) 's target of 2%, policymaker Kristin Forbes has said the central should not wait until that point for a rate hike as it could hurt economic recovery. \n\"Monday's comments from BoE's Kristin Forbes couldn't have come at a better time, highlighting that there's a two-year lag between interest rate changes and inflation, meaning rates will need to rise well before CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) goes anywhere near 2%,\" said IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) analyst John Mahoney. \nMahoney added that rising UK core inflation highlighted the fact that it's only a matter of time before rates in both the UK and US will rise in expectation of higher inflation. \nHowever, Danske Bank (Copenhagen: DANSKE.CO - news ) said it sees CPI remaining low for the rest of the year and did not rule out inflation turning negative in coming months. \n\"We think the BoE wants to see CPI inflation stabilise/move higher before hiking and hence most MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) members are unlikely to feel comfortable with the near-term inflation outlook,\" analysts said, adding that it predicts a rate increase in February. \nMeanwhile, Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to on Wednesday face rebellion within her centre-right party when it votes on a third bailout package for Greece. Greece needs the €86bn package to make a debt repayment to the European Central Bank on 20 August. \nIn the US, a report showed housing starts rose 0.2% in July, less than the 0.5% that was predicted by analysts and marking at slowdown on the previous month's 12.3% growth. \nIn another drag to the market, miners continued to slide, with BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGY - news ) in the red as copper hit a six-year low on concerns China's stock market rout could destabilise its economy and hurt demand for the metal. \nGlencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) edged lower ahead of its half-year results on Wednesday on reports the company is reviewing its Eland platinum mine in South Africa for a possible closure due to falling prices. \nCairn Energy (LSE: CNE.L - news ) tumbled as it posted a wider loss after tax in the first half, reflecting a £177m impairment charge. \nEngineer Wood Group fell as it reported a 19.3% decline in first half revenue and slashed its costs and workforce amid the crashing oil prices. \nPersimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) dropped despite reporting a 31% rise in first-half pre-tax profit, driven by solid revenue growth. \nWilliam Hill (Other OTC: WIMHF - news ) jumped after Numis upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold' and raised its price target to 480p from 400p, saying the recent share price fall has created a buying opportunity. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,182.58 +0.18% FTSE 100 6,526.29 -0.37% FTSE 250 17,616.94 +0.05% FTSE 100 - Risers Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (GLEN) 176.10p +3.59% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,245.00p +1.65% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 550.00p +1.29% easyJet (EZJ) 1,745.00p +1.16% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 1,003.00p +1.01% Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) (SL.) 442.20p +1.00% Merlin Entertainments (LSE: MERL.L - news ) (MERL) 401.50p +0.83% AstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) (AZN) 4,310.00p +0.75% Wolseley (EUREX: WLYH.EX - news ) (WOS) 4,332.00p +0.74% United Utilities Group (UU.) 904.50p +0.72% FTSE 100 - Fallers Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 561.50p -2.09% Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) (BDEV) 640.50p -1.91% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,112.50p -1.85% Tesco (TSCO) 198.60p -1.78% Anglo American (AAL) 741.90p -1.76% Persimmon (PSN) 2,084.00p -1.74% Fresnillo (Amsterdam: FN6.AS - news ) (FRES) 659.50p -1.71% GKN (GKN (LSE: GKN.L - news ) ) 294.90p -1.67% Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) 'B' (RDSB) 1,782.50p -1.63% Royal Dutch Shell 'A' (RDSA) 1,764.00p -1.62% FTSE 250 - Risers OneSavings Bank (Stuttgart: 2OS.SG - news ) (OSB) 328.00p +4.13% PayPoint (PAY) 1,038.00p +3.80% Telecom Plus (LSE: TEP.L - news ) (TEP) 1,145.00p +3.62% UDG Healthcare Public Limited Company (UDG) 539.50p +3.06% Redefine International (RDI) 55.50p +2.97% Just Retirement Group (JRG) 186.30p +2.93% Zoopla Property Group (WI) (ZPLA) 272.10p +2.68% Cranswick (CWK) 1,697.00p +2.41% Balfour Beatty (Other OTC: BAFBF - news ) (BBY) 270.00p +2.27% Allied Minds (Other OTC: ALLWF - news ) (ALM) 465.80p +2.26% FTSE 250 - Fallers Lonmin (LMI) 33.01p -7.64% Cairn Energy (CNE) 143.20p -7.25% Evraz (EVR) 86.95p -5.59% Fidelity China Special Situations (FCSS) 128.40p -4.46% Templeton Emerging Markets Inv Trust (TEM) 425.40p -3.01% Bovis Homes Group (BVS) 1,129.00p -2.92% Tullow Oil (LSE: TLW.L - news ) (TLW) 211.10p -2.85% Aggreko (EUREX: AGKF.EX - news ) (AGK) 1,064.00p -2.56% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 146.20p -2.47% Murray International Trust (MYI) 835.00p -2.34% FTSE TechMARK - Risers UCW Limited (UCW) A$0.01 +8.33% Sepura (SEPU) 161.00p +2.71% Torotrak (TRK) 6.25p +1.96% KCOM Group (LSE: KCOM.L - news ) (KCOM) 94.00p +1.90% Dialight (DIA (Amsterdam: DI6.AS - news ) ) 556.50p +1.18% Consort Medical (Other OTC: CSRMF - news ) (CSRT) 952.50p +1.11% NCC Group (LSE: NCC.L - news ) (NCC (BSE: NCC6.BO - news ) ) 247.00p +0.82% RM (RM (LSE: RM.L - news ) .) 176.50p +0.71% Triad Group (Stuttgart: TD8.SG - news ) (TRD) 36.25p +0.69% BATM Advanced Communications Ltd (Other OTC: BTAVF - news ) .
