Louise Kennerley by Robert Harley Peter Hay, the chairman of Federation Centres, knew the surprise replacement of chief executive, Steven Sewell , would bring an adverse reaction from investors and analysts.\nHe knows investors and analysts rate Sewell far more highly than they rate the new chief executive, Angus McNaughton.\nBut he and the board think McNaughton, not Sewell, is the executive to lead the second-biggest shopping centre operation in the country and deliver the benefits promised in the merger with the Novion Property Group.\n\"All 10 directors eventually came to the same conclusion,\" he says. \"Big decisions need unanimity.\"\nWhich includes the Gandel Group's two board members.\nHay, is a former chief executive of Freehills, and current chairman of Newcrest Mining, who stepped up from being a director of Novion Property Group to become chairman of the merged Federation/Novion in May.\nï»¿ McNaughton is an experienced property executive who rose to head Colonial First State's property operation in 2011, managed the complex exit of the Commonwealth Bank, and then headed Novion through to its merger with Federation. His skills, which Hay would have noted, are in management behind the scenes.\nSewell is a high-profile executive who started in property with QIC, became a fund manager at Macquarie Group, moved to Charter Hall as chief executive of Charter Hall Retail REIT and in February 2012 took over the recapitalised Centro and turned it into Federation.\n All the while, and particularly in the merger with Novion, he demonstrated both vision and a fine grasp of the sector, from the nuances of the mall floor, to the complexities of its capital needs.\nThe fine grasp seems to have eluded Sewell in his relations with the new board. And the board has chosen the manager over the maverick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:14:43.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
