Germany's DAX was down 1.4 percent. Markets in Britain were closed for a holiday. \nAsian shares closed lower. MSCI (NYSE: MSCI - news ) 's main index of Asia-Pacific shares excluding Japan was down 0.5 percent and headed for its biggest monthly losses in three years. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index closed 1.3 percent lower, hit by weak Japanese industrial output data. \nChinese shares had another volatile session. The CSI300 index ended up 0.7 percent, after falling 4 percent at one point. The index was still down 11.8 percent for August. The Shanghai Composite lost 0.8 percent on the day and 12.5 percent for the month \nThe dollar lost ground against both the euro and the yen as investors trimmed bets against low-yielding currencies used to invest in higher-yielding ones in so-called carry trades. \n\"Stocks markets are in focus and absence of risk appetite is acting as a headwind to the dollar,\" said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea. \"Having said that, with a September rate hike back in focus, I am biased towards more downside in the euro against the dollar.\" \nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies was last down 0.1 percent. The euro was up 0.3 percent at $1.1211 and the yen up 0.4 percent at 121.26 to the dollar. \nThe uncertainty about when the Fed might raise rates kept yields on German government bonds, the euro zone benchmark, close to last week's highs. Ten-year yields were last flat on the day at 0.72 percent. \nBrent crude fell as investors took profits after oil saw its biggest two-day rally for six years last week. Brent was last down $1.30 a barrel at $48.75 and, despite last week's gains, heading for its fourth consecutive monthly decline. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) struggled over the Fed outlook, last trading around $1,131.80 an ounce in quiet trade with London on holiday. \n\"We think gold will likely come under further pressure as we near the Fed decision, as investors coalesce around the notion that the central bank will indeed move\" and lift interest rates, said INTL FCStone (NasdaqGS: INTL - news ) analyst Edward Meir.
