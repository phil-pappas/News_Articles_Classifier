It will be located in Tigania East. \nAVAIL LAND \nGulf Energy is expected to design, finance, construct and operate the power plant. \n\"The company will also apply and obtain the requisite authorisation from the national government, including the Ministry of Energy and the Energy Regulatory Commission,\" the MOU says. \nOn the other hand, Meru County government through MCIDC is expected to avail land, information and other resources for the project. MCIDC is also tasked with procuring the requisite county approvals for the development, financing, construction and operation of the wind farm. \nBRIDGE GAP \n\"MCIDC will avail or procure rights of access to the possession of the land in adequate size or precise location as proven by technical studies conducted for the term of the power purchase. It will also use its best efforts to assist the project to obtain requisite national government support,\" the MOU says. \nMCIDC communications director Thuranira Thiaine said the project will help bridge the gap in the provision of clean energy. \"It will also create employment and cut the cost of power once complete,\" Mr Thiaine said. \nHUGE POTENTIAL \nThe set up of a similar project in the county is facing opposition from the locals. The construction of a 400-megawatt wind power plant in Tigania West by KenGen is likely to be delayed after some land owners said they have not given their consent for the project to start. The project will sit on about 18,700 acres whose ownership is contested. \nIn June, a South African investor also pledged to pump close to Sh10 billion in a wind power plant in the county. \nWindlab Developments South Africa Managing Director Peter Venn said the potential for wind power in the county was huge and sufficient.
