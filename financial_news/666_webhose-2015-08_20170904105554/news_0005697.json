Unknown by Jonathan Barrett A 32-year-old soldier who dislikes too many PowerPoint presentations will be confirmed as the Liberal candidate in the September 19 byelection for Canning , triggered by the sudden death of Don Randall.\nCaptain Andrew Hastie gained the support of the party’s selection committee at the weekend and the recommendation is expected to be endorsed by the state committee later this week.\nDespite Canning being considered a safe Liberal seat, with an 11.8 per cent margin, the party must contend with any fallout from out-of-favour federal and state Liberal governments, which are both trailing Labor in the polls.\nMr Randall, who died from a suspected heart attack in July, also built a large personal following in the urban and rural electorate that won’t flow automatically to the new candidate.\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday Mr Hastie was the best candidate in a wide field. Mr Hastie, who served in Afghanistan, told the selection committee that as an SAS officer he had “demonstrated capacity to fight for the Australian way of life”.\nThe University of NSW graduate published an article in 2010 where he bemoaned the overuse of PowerPoint presentations in military education.\nHe said students would benefit from more personal tutelage, as opposed to lectures with “slipshod and hurried PowerPoint presentations”.\nBenefit the Liberals Federal Labor member for Perth Alannah MacTiernan said the byelection was a referendum on Tony Abbott. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen Veteran political analyst Harry Phillips, an honorary professor at Edith Cowan University in Perth, said any attention Mr Hastie drew to national security policies would benefit the Liberals.\n“His military background is something that the government would be delighted with,” Mr Phillips said.\n“It plays straight to Abbott’s strengths.”\nForeign Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that Mr Hastie was the best candidate in a wide field.\n“This is a man who has dedicated years of his life serving this country,” Ms Bishop said. “And he’s now prepared to dedicate his life to serving the people of Canning.”\nLabor will decide its candidate at a meeting of the state executive on Sunday.\nWestern Australia Law Society president Matt Keogh has already announced he would seek pre-selection. The Palmer United Party will also field a candidate.\nByelection a referendum Federal Labor member for Perth Alannah MacTiernan, who unsuccessfully contested Canning against Mr Randall in 2010 despite recording a swing towards Labor, said the byelection was a referendum on “Tony Abbott’s assessment that he’s had two great years in government”.\n“We’d like to get a sizeable swing,” Ms MacTiernan said. “Trying to get 11 per cent-plus would be pretty huge.”\nShe said there would be a backlash against the federal government for awarding South Australia, rather than Western Australia, the lion’s share of work for the frigate and offshore patrol boat building program.\nThe seat of Canning, south of Perth, was long considered marginal before Mr Randall turned it into a safe Liberal seat, after winning it in 2001 and the subsequent four elections.\nIn recent years the resources-rich state has become a stronghold of the conservatives at state and national level.\nLabor could manage only one of six federal Senate spots in the 2013 election, compared to three for the Liberals.\nPolitical analyst Professor David Black said the Liberals should hold Canning, although he said there would be a swing against the government.\n“I see it as a contest the Liberals cannot take for granted,” Professor Black said.\n“It’s got the potential to be interesting, but they should retain it.”\nWith John Kerin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:55:52.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
