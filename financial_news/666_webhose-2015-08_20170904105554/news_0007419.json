He still has a week to keep Santa on the job. \n\"We will take care of it. We have already collected half of the sum,\" Kariniemi told AFP. \nEvery year around 300,000 tourists of 100 different nationalities visit Santa's Office -- which claims to be the official one -- in Rovaniemi on the Arctic Circle in Finnish Lapland. \nSanta's Office is part of an amusement park called Santa Claus Village hosting several companies. The Village and the other companies are not affected by the court's proceedings. \nThe head of the Rovaniemi Regional Development Agency, Juha Seppala, said his organisation would make sure Santa is there in the future. \n\"There is no way the Village (Taiwan OTC: 2735.TWO - news ) would be left without Santa Claus. The activities will continue in one way or another,\" he told AFP. \nKariniemi said his company's financial difficulties were due to \"the turbulence in the world\" resulting in a drop in the number of tourists visiting the region. \n\"First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) there were fewer tourists coming from Greece, then from Spain, Italy and Portugal, and eventually from Russia,\" he explained, referring to the economic downturn in those countries. \nIn January Finnish Border Guards reported a 33-percent drop from December 2013 to December 2014 in border crossings between Finland and its eastern neighbour Russia, which sends the most tourists to Finland, and has been affected by the fall of the ruble.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T19:56:47.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
