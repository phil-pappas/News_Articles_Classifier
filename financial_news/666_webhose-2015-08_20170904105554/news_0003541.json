With net inflows of over Rs10,000 crore in each month of the June 2015 quarter, the net inflow in July 2015 dropped to Rs6,133 crore. It is also to be noted that the data includes inflows from arbitrage schemes as well. We had highlighted here that arbitrage schemes accounted for nearly 25% of the equity mutual fund inflows for the six months ended June 2015. According to data from ICRA Online, approximately Rs3,500 crore flowed in to arbitrage schemes in July 2015. This means that over half of the net inflows in July 2015 were contributed by arbitrage schemes. Arbitrage schemes are labelled equity schemes by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI), but they should be classified separately as they only take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities available in the equity market. Hence, arbitrage schemes are considered an alternative to low-risk liquid schemes. Grouping these schemes along with other equity diversified schemes is incorrect. Over Rs700 crore each flowed into ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage and Reliance Arbitrage Advantage. Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused Multicap 35 attracted an inflow of over Rs500 crore in July 2015. About Rs200 crore flowed out of IDFC Premier Equity, probably, on concerns of the future performance of the schemes. About Rs180 crore each flowed out of HDFC Equity and HDFC Top 200. Redemptions of equity schemes in July 2015 increased substantially to Rs7,794 crore according to AMFI data. Sales too, fell to its lowest since March 2015. Equity schemes (including arbitrage schemes) reported sales of Rs13,927 crore in July 2015. Two new fund offers brought in Rs148 crore in July 2015. Mutual fund folios increased to 3.55 million as on 31 July 2015 from 3.31 million an on 30 June 2015. While the CNX Nifty index was up 1.96% in July, equity assets under management increased by 5.72% to Rs3.93 lakh crore from Rs3.72 lakh crore. Gold exchange traded fund (ETFs) have lost their sheen due to the continuous decline in gold price. The ETF reported a net outflow in each of that past 12 months. In July as much as Rs50 crore flowed out from gold ETFs. As, much as, Rs826 crore was redeemed from gold ETFs over the past year. Gold ETF AUM declined by 23% to Rs5,957 crore from Rs7,773 crore a year ago. The number of folios too fell by 5% to 460,850 folios from 485,394 folios a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T16:59:13.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
