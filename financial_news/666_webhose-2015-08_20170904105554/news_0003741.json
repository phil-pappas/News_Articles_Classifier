UAE Exchange and Majid Al Futtaim both said they do not comment on market speculation. \n(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh and David French; Editing by David Goodman) UAE Exchange", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T17:33:52.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
