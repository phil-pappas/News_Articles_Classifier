Andrew Meares Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle There is a growing sense of crisis around the Prime Minister's leadership of the government, after he was challenged by one of his most senior cabinet ministers over his stance on same sex marriage amid increasing concerns about Tony Abbott's political strategy.\nA special joint party meeting of Liberal and National MPs and senators has been called for 3.15 this afternoon, after an acrimonious meeting of the Liberal Party this morning .\nAfter a push by same sex marriage advocates for the debate to be held as soon as possible, Mr Abbott rejected a push for a debate in the Liberal Party room, saying that the only way the policy could be changed was by a decision of the joint party room.\nMembers of the National Party are much more deeply opposed to supporting same sex marriage than Liberals, meaning a joint party room decision would favour the status quo.\nEducation Minister Christopher Pyne has defended a family Christmas trip to Sydney. Andrew Meares Mr Abbott's stance prompted senior cabinet minister and House Leader Christopher Pyne to enter the debate saying that the Liberal Party should make its own decisions and not be \"branch stacked\" by the National Party.\nDeputy Leader Julie Bishop also intervened in the debate arguing that there should not be any distraction from \"bread and butter\" issues ahead of the Canning by-election, an intervention which angered many of her colleagues.\nLiberal backbencher Brett Whiteley then intervened to say the best way to deal with the debate was to put it off.\nMeeting a 'shambles' The Prime Minister's position on same sex marriage has further alienated colleagues, and deepened divisions within the parliamentary party.\nOne described the Liberal Party meeting as a \"shambles\", arguing that if Mr Abbott had \"come in and said as a Liberal Party we should have a free vote\", that would have been accepted.\n\"By looking as if he's trying to avoid the vote he looks like he is both trying to stifle the debate and impose his own will on the party, instead of consulting as he promised\", a source said.\nThe move was seen as further eroding his standing with the party. The fact that Mr Abbott's candidate for Speaker of the House did not succeed in Monday's ballot was seen as another indication of his weakening authority in the parliamentary party.\nOne MP said \"things are getting much worse\" with fractures developing not just with the backbench but repeatedly now with the frontbench too.\n\"He's digging in, just stubbornly insisting on his positions, despite everything.\n\"There is widespread exasperation with what is now happening\".\nComplaints about climate policy The mood was therefore not happy when the joint party room met to consider the government's climate change position .\nClimate change sceptic Dennis Jensen complained about the fact that MPs read about the government's position in the media first.\nOthers observed that most of the presentation on the policy betrayed a focus on attacking Labor rather than promoting the Coalition's own policy.\nThe government's focus in the policy is on cutting the cost of electricity, rather than reducing emissions.\nHowever, ministers were not able to tell MPs what the full cost of the new scheme could be.\nThey were told there would be a \"modest allocation\" of extra funds to the government's emissions reduction fund and no allocation has been to pay for the so-called safeguard mechanism.\nThink tanks meantime have estimated that the cost of this policy could run into billions of dollars by 2030 if the government's target was met.\nA 'way forward' Asked about the gay marriage issue at a press conference later, Mr Abbott told reporters the party room meeting was \"brief and spirited\".\n\"What I said pre-election was if this matter were to come up in the next parliament, it would be dealt with by the Coalition party room in the usual way.\"\n\"All of us want a way forward here, whether the way forward is to maintain the existing position or to deal with it in some other way is a matter for the party room. My position hasn't changed so lets see what the party room comes up with later today.\"\nSame sex marriage advocate Warren Entsch has asked for the opportunity to introduce a bill to the main chamber, due to the significance of the legislation.\n\"It is now up to the selection committee to determine when the Bill is brought on and the co‚Äê sponsors will await this decision. The issue of a free vote was raised in the Liberal Party Room today, however it was determined that more time was needed for discussion and this has been deferred to a special Joint Party Room Meeting later today.\n\"The content of the bill will not be discussed until it is tabled in Parliament, which is the appropriate place for debate.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-11T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T08:50:38.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
