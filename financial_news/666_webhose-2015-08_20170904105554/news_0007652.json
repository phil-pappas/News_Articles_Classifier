However, energy, which makes up a smaller proportion of the business, declined by 18pc. \nThe performance was in line with expectations according to Stephen Young, chief executive, and puts the company on track to hit its forecast of \"low to mid-single digit\" organic revenue growth for the full year. \nThe company has been investing over the past few years to improve its production processes and make it more competitive, with new systems now in place at 36 of Meggitt's 45 sites. The company said that the introduction of these more efficient systems has improved the quality of its products by 86pc and boosted the number of deliveries made on time by 10pc. \nMr Young said that the new operating process will take \"several years to fully optimise\" but is expected to result in significant long-term cost savings. \n\"We are investing significant sums in research and development and new product introduction, both of which remain near cyclical highs,\" he said. \"These investments are delivering highly visible, good quality revenue streams extending out for many decades.\" \nMeggitt is investing heavily in R&D and improving its production systems \nThe company said it invested 9.9pc of revenue in research and development, and this, combined with new production processes and the decline in the energy division, meant the operating margin dropped from 21.1pc to 20.2pc. \nThe interim dividend, payable on October 2, was increased by 8pc to 4.6p. \nThe company also announced two new orders for equipment that will be used by British troops. \nMeggitt’s US-based Defence Systems unit has been awarded a $42.1m (£27m) contract by Lockheed Martin UK to design an build an ammunition handling system for the British Army’s new “Scout” armoured vehicles. \nThe system will feed the 40mm cannons in Scout vehicles using Meggitt’s “linkless” technology meaning that rounds are not joined to each other, minimising the risk of the weapon jamming. \nThe company will also upgrade the Ministry of Defence’s training systems as part of a £10.2m deal. Meggitt will modernise simulators, pictured above, where troops learn how to use different weapon systems.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T11:11:12.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
