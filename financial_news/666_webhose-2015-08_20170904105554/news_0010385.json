Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rowan Dean In a landmark speech at a Victorian University this week, former prime minister Julia Gillard shocked the nation with her honest and forthright admission that since leaving office she has had a dramatic change of heart and now fully supports the idea of Kevin Rudd.\nMs Gillard's stunning about-turn was delivered during a heartfelt speech in which she conceded that her previous stance on the issue of Kevin Rudd, whom she once believed to be a dysfunctional, chaotic, psychopathic, loopy narcissist, was a mistake.\nHer change of heart has surprised many observers, who recall how Australia's most famous feminist and first female prime minister had been strongly opposed to giving any support whatsoever to Kevin Rudd throughout her entire time in Parliament, going so far as to twice vote against Mr Rudd in caucus as well as stabbing him in the back at every available opportunity.\nMs Gillard now concedes that such an attitude was \"odd\" and \"idiosyncratic\" and that it made more sense for her to re-consider her previous opposition in the light of the global shift in favour of Mr Rudd, who has now been legally recognised as a CNN host in many diverse countries across the globe.\n\"At the toime Oi was obviously of the foim opinion that anyone, even someone such as moiself, would make a better proime minister than Mr Rudd but now of course we all know the complete opposite is true and now Oi would definitely not vote in favour of moiself ever agoin.\"\nOn the issue of holding a national Plibersek on same-sex marriage, Ms Gillard was equally scathing. \"Oi foimly believe that a Plibersek is the last thing this nation noids,\" she explained, admitting that although a Plibersek has \"superficial appeal\" there is \"no logic\" to it.\n\"The last thing our society needs is for the people to have a free and democratic vote. Look how they stuffed it up in 2010.\"\nIn other news this week, the Australian Monarchist Society announced their campaign to find a new national court jester to distract the masses with. \"Every successful monarchy needs a preposterously absurd court jester to give people a really good belly laugh,\" a spokesman for the Monarchist Society said. \"Which is why we believe we need a referendum to find one. So far, we've had some great comedians put their hands up for the job; one is this hilarious character who sometimes puts a red bandana on his head and sometimes takes it off, which is pretty funny all by itself. And the other is the federal Treasurer. Apparently he's got oodles of free time on his hands now he's not allowed on Q&A any more.\n A commentator for the government said: \"We haven't seen such a comical republican movement since Mr Turnbull and Thomas Keneally led their hilarious troupe of failed actors, chardonnay luvvies and media celebrities back in the late '90s. They had the nation in stitches too.\"\nWhen asked whether he had the appropriate credentials for the official role of National Court Jester, Mr Hockey was adamant he was fully qualified. \"I've been rehearsing for this job all my life,\" he quipped, lighting up an exploding cigar. \"Who can forget my 'poor people don't drive cars' gag, that had the entire country in tears for weeks. If you want someone who can provide endless distractions from our economic woes, I'm your man.\"\nExplosive email exchange Meanwhile, in a worldwide exclusive the Fin this week uncovered an explosive email exchange that has stunned the nation and deepened the crisis surrounding the future of the beleaguered and embattled royal commissioner Dyson Heydon.\n\"Dear Ms Pumperington-Smythe,\nApparently I'm giving some speech next year. Any idea what's it about?\"\n\"Yes you have agreed to deliver a two hour discourse on the transitory judiciary introspections of the legal fraternity on the micro-prima facie processes of adjournment under section XIV of the intra-plenary revocation of statutes 131b â€“ 142a part vi of the Sewers and Plumbing Act 1926 and its relevance to defined boundaries of public interest.\"\n\"Too easy. Will I get dinner?\"\n\"Yes. Are you lacto-intolerant or do you have any special dietary requirements?\"\n\"No. Anything else I should know about it?\"\n\"Not that I can think of.\"\nIn other news this week, the ABC's managing director was forced to send a personal apology to Tony Abbott for an outrageous slur against him that appeared on the national broadcaster's screens during prime time viewing.\n\"Obviously I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the prime minister for the accidental screening of Q&A, The Drum, 7.30, ABC News, ABC News at Noon, ABC News Breakfast, Behind the News, Four Corners, Lateline, ABC Fact Check and any of our other shows that are designed to cause maximum offence to Mr Abbott.\"\nTwitter @rowandean", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/rowandean", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/107339562751475118358/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T12:15:52.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
