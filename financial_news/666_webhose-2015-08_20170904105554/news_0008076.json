A rocket mass heater built from a cast-iron stove insulated with a mixture of clay, sand and straw allows for cooking and heating. \nThe home cost Dunn about $3,000 to build, and the landowner is letting him live rent-free. He says that will help with the high cost of college. \nThe Henniker, New Hampshire, native says living in the home is the “most raw experience that I’ve ever had.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:48:41.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
