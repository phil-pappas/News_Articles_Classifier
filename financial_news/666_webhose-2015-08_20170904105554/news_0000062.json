Heinz Co and packaged food company Kraft Foods Group Inc, said sales fell 4.9 percent at Kraft and 4.1 percent at Heinz in its first quarterly results as a combined company.\nSales at Kraft fell due to weak demand for its beverages and lower pricing, while a strong dollar hurt sales at Heinz.\nKraft's net income rose to $551 million, or 92 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 27, from $482 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.\nNet loss attributable to Heinz shareholders widened to $344 million, or 91 cents per share, from $53 million or 14 cents per share, a year earlier.\nKraft's net revenue fell to $4.52 billion from $4.75 billion, while Heinz's revenue fell to $2.62 billion from $2.73 billion.\nH.J. Heinz Co, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, combined with Kraft Foods Group Inc in July to create the third-largest North American food company.
