So from that, to jump to a conclusion that some curtailment of the power of the RBI has been made or the government has decided to do so would be incorrect,” he added.\nHe further said that the government’s views on the IFC will be revealed when the draft bill is brought before Parliament for consideration and approval.\n“Government’s final mind will be revealed on the draft Bill which comes out before Parliament. This clarifies that there is no decision in government as of now,” Mehrishi said.\nChief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian had earlier said that the revised IFC draft was based on FSLRC report, a position which was contradicted by FSLRC member M Govinda Rao.\nFirst Published on August 03, 2015 4:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T05:58:25.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
