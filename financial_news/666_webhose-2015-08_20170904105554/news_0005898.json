Bruce Rauner has signed several bills affecting veterans including a measure establishing a discount card and another offering property tax breaks for those with military-related disabilities. \nThe Republican governor's office released a statement Sunday saying six bills had been signed in honor of Veterans' Day at the Illinois State Fair. \nOne measure takes effect immediately and says the state's Department of Veterans' Affairs will establish and administer a veterans and military discount card program for use at participating merchants. \nAnother, which also takes effect immediately, provides tax breaks to veterans who make accessibility upgrades to their homes, like wheelchair ramps. Such changes wouldn't increase the assessed valuation of the property for years after improvements are made. \nThe bills are HB2932, HB3425, HB3686, SB107, SB1665 and SB1818. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T20:38:24.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
