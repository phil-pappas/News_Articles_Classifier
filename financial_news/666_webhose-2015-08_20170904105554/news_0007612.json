Anthony Johnson Share on twitter by Misa Han Top lawyers are reluctant for their children to follow in their footsteps as the industry faces mounting concerns about the oversupply of law graduates and mental health issues.\nThe legal profession once attracted children from prominent legal families. Arnold Bloch Leibler managing partner Henry Lanzer's son Jeremy is climbing the corporate ladder within the firm as a senior associate, while senior partner Mark Leibler's son, also named Jeremy, is tipped to be a rising superstar partner at the firm.\nBut with law graduate prospects looking gloom and a profession plagued by stress, lawyers are increasingly becoming reluctant to pull their children into the legal profession.\nClifford Chance Sydney managing partner Mark Pistilli said he would not encourage his two teenage daughters to enter the legal profession.\n\"Assuming they would listen to me, which is a challenge with teenagers, I wouldn't try to talk them out of doing law if they had a passion for it but I likewise wouldn't encourage them to do law if they did not want to,\" he said.\nGraduate oversupply While there were upsides to being a lawyer, including professional recognition, good remuneration and opportunities for travel, Mr Pistilli said there were a number of challenges that worried him as a parent.\n\"There is clearly an oversupply of graduates which means there is going to be some difficulty in finding a position and being trained.\"\n According to the latest data from Graduate Careers Australia, graduate employment levels are at their worst on record, with nearly one in four law graduates still looking for full-time work four months after graduating .\nFor those that do secure a position, the environment can be highly stressful.\n\"As a profession we also have a lot of work to do in terms of mental health, considering the high rates of depression and suicide, and that would concern me as a parent,\" said Mr Pistilli.\n\"As a father of daughters, I would like for there to be much more gender equality both in terms of promotion and pay and I think as an industry we have a long way to go still.\nMarque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley is another who will not push his children into law.\n\"I wouldn't push them into that direction, but I wouldn't seek to talk them out of it either,\" he said. \"But I would make it clear its going to be a tough game to get into.\"\nHumanitarian degree Despite the fierce competition for graduate positions, law is still seen by many as a good generalist degree to have.\nSparke Helmore national managing partner Jesse Webb there was a concern about increased competition in the market given the top notch quality of graduates.\nHe has four sons, and the eldest was now contemplating whether or not to do commerce law as a springboard into other areas in investment banking.\n\"Where are they all going to go,\" he said. \"I tell my sons the same thing, if you have a passion for something, if it's the law, you will do well.\nBut he would still encourage his sons to study law. \"You can do law as a generalist degree, you don't have to practice. Law is a good platform and others have used it to go into fields like investment banking.\"\nAustralian Catholic University vice-chancellor and law academic Greg Craven said a law degree proved to be useful for both his son, a union organiser, and his daughter, who works in human resources, and since the 1980s many Australian graduates studied law as a generalist degree.\nHe had four children, two of whom studied law and the third one who was tossing up between studying law and doing a teaching degree.\n\"To some extent the panic about 'we're producing too many lawyers' is a false panic. I have taught Nicola Roxon, Greg Hunt and John Daley, and the question I'd be asking is: 'do they have inferior lives because they didn't become conveyancing solicitors?'\"\nBut Mr Pistilli said he doubted the usefulness of a law degree as a generalist humanitarian degree. \"I think it's a very significant time commitment if you're not going to work in the industry.\"\nMr Bradley also refuted the view that law is a generalist degree, saying it was a vocation specific degree.\n\"It is useful to know the law in the same way it is useful to know how to do double entry book keeping, but law is designed for a specific task,\" Mr Bradley said.\nWith Joanna Mather", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-08-06T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:07:39.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
