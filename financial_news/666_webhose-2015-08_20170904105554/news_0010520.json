In fact, with a few nifty tricks, you can boost your credit score some 50 to 100 points in no time flat. Especially if you're looking at buying a house somewhere in the near future, you're going to want to aggressively pursue raising your credit score for the best rates possible, says John Heath, managing attorney with LexingtonLaw.
