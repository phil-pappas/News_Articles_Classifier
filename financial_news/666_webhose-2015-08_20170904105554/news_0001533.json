Photo: Glenn Hunt\nSolar companies are starting to blame network owners for ratcheting up costs for new solar customers to slow the rapid uptake of rooftop panels and protect their businesses.\nHuon Hoogesteger, founder of Smart Commercial Solar, which offers solar systems to business customers, said network owners were seeking to hold back the growth of renewable energy because they were \"afraid\" of the potential of the industry to cut their revenues.\nThe network industry rejects the claims, with lead spokesman John Bradley, head of the Energy Networks Association, calling it \"fundamentally wrong\".\n\"Networks are actually keen to support the integration of solar because solar integrated into the network can help to lower our cost of delivering services to customers and help to defer augmentation [of the electricity grid],\" he said.\nAdvertisement The debate reveals the growing tensions between different parts of the energy supply industry as the huge popularity of rooftop solar transforms the way that 1.4 million households and many businesses source their power. Increasing reliance on self-generated power is cutting demand for electricity from the centralised grid and threatens to erode revenues for the owners of billions of dollars of network assets.\nMr Hoogesteger said that a business that wanted to install a 20 kilowatt rooftop PV system costing perhaps $30,000 could face a fee of $10,000 to connect it into the grid. Larger systems could involve extra costs of about $15,000, lengthening the usual 4-6 year payback time for a business by 6-12 months.\nFor systems installed under \"power-purchase agreement\" structures, with no up-front costs, the hike in the supply cost over a 10-year term is 1¢-2¢ per kilowatt hour.\n\"Suddenly we are not able to offer a cash-positive situation for our clients,\" he said. \"We can retail the energy cheaper than normal energy from the grid but sometimes, quite often in metro areas, the cost of connection is making us cost negative. It's a real challenge.\"\nHe said extra costs were also being incurred because some network companies required equipment that already had international approval to be re-certified.\nStress on the grid Mr Bradley defended the costs involved in connecting business solar customers, saying that adding in larger systems could put additional stress on the grid. Additional approval of equipment was often required to ensure the safety of customers and protect reliable supply on the grid.\nKane Thornton,chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the more than 15,000 business customers that had already adopted solar were posing a challenge for several distribution businesses, resulting in \"frustrations\" for some customers keen to use the technology.\n\"Obviously for network businesses this isn't business as usual,\" he said. \"They call them disruptive technologies for a reason. Some businesses are very progressive and have been anticipating this market growth for a while, others are still struggling with it.\"\nThe gradual switch by electricity suppliers towards tariffs that charge more more for use of the grid during peak-demand times rather than basing fees on total electricity consumed is also disadvantaging customers with rooftop panels, Mr Hoogesteger said, while agreeing that some tariff reform was necessary to make charges fairer.\n\"That demand charge is a horrifically expensive charge,\" he said.\n\"It is a good way of doing cost-effective pricing but it's also a great way of limiting the financial viability of alternative technology, be it solar, wind or any other source of intermittent energy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:36:08.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
