It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has fallen every day since China devalued its currency last week. \nBritish stocks roughly tracked falls across the continent as concerns over slowing global growth built up. \nThe FTSE 100 is now around 10 percent below an all time high of 7,122.74 points hit in April. \nStocks struggled to gain ground despite a dovish set of minutes from the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . Federal Reserve, suggesting that investors were concerned about global economic growth and weak inflation that has pushed back a potential interest rate hike. \n\"It's a continuation of the theme we've seen ever since the Chinese devaluation. It's a worrying sign that we're seeing such selling even despite dovish noises from the Fed,\" said Josh Mahoney, market analyst at IG (LSE: IGG.L - news ) . \nMiners however rallied, benefitting from foreign exchange movements. The sector was up 2.6 percent, having sunk to its lowest since 2009 on the Chinese devaluation. \nThe dollar's fall following the Fed minutes helped copper and gold higher and there was relief for miner Kaz Minerals . It surged 9.9 percent after Kazakhstan floated the tenge, sending the currency tumbling. \nThe miner, which has about 45 percent of its cost base denominated in tenge, reported that earnings more than halved in the first half, and that it would not pay an interim dividend. \nWhile the tenge's weakness had also sent shares 6.4 percent higher on Wednesday, they remain down over 25 percent this year, despite the two-day rally. \n\"We would expect local inflation and wage increase demands to offset the weaker currency to undo much of the localised benefit in the months ahead, as happened the last time the tenge devalued,\" analysts at Investec Securities said in a note. \nTop risers on the FTSE 100 were miners with exposure to precious metals, such as Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) and Randgold . Mid-cap Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) rallied 15.5 percent, recovering from recent falls after the drop in the dollar sent platinum higher. \nMondi, British American Tobacco and Hammerson were among the top fallers on the index, all 2-3 percent lower as they went ex-dividend.
