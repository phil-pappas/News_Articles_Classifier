In volume terms, Europe had been the chemicals group's best performing region in the quarter, CEO Ellen Kullman said. \nTruck maker Scania, a unit of Volkswagen AG (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) , said its orders rose 41 percent in the second quarter in Europe, compared to the same period last year, while U.S. rival Paccar Inc (NasdaqGS: PCAR - news ) said orders at its European unit, DAF, were 60 percent higher in the quarter, as growing freight traffic -- a key economic indicator -- drove sales. \nStrengthening customer demand allowed companies including Swedish lock maker Assa Abloy (Other OTC: ASAZY - news ) , packaging maker Smurfit and dairy group Danone (Swiss: 487663.SW - news ) to raise prices or lift margins. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) companies which have still not returned to their pre-financial crisis health, like General Motors (NYSE: GM - news ) , whose European operations are still loss making, said they were increasingly confident the worst was past. \n\"For me it was very, very promising and very optimistic based on the results in the second quarter,\" said Chuck Stevens, the U.S. carmaker's CFO. \nWEAKER EURO, LOWER INTEREST RATES \nDutch-headquartered staffing group Randstad said increased business activity was feeding through to hiring. CFO Robert van de Kraats told Reuters last week that current labour demand was \"consistent with the early phase of a cyclical recovery\". \nJonas Prising, CEO of Milwaukee-based rival Manpower , echoed other companies in highlighting \"very strong performance\" in southern European. \nPrising said the situation in Europe's economy -- which grew at a little over half the rate of the United States last year -- now was \"not unlike the recovery we saw in the U.S. following the great recession\". \nEurope is benefiting from a range of factors. \nThe euro has fallen sharply this year, as Greece's future in the single currency became increasingly uncertain. Down to the wire bailout negotiations, which led to a run on Greek banks and the imposition of capital controls in the country, saw the euro hover near 12-year lows against the dollar in the quarter. \nThe euro's weakness has made Eurozone manufacturers and services providers more competitive outside the bloc and better able to compete against imports internally. \nAnalysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) predicted last week that the currency boost to earnings in the quarter would be the biggest in close to 20 years and industrial groups Daimler AG (Xetra: 710000 - news ) , Siemens AG and Peugeot (Hanover: PEU.HA - news ) SA all highlighted the boost from a weak euro in calls with investors. \nThe increased exports have also supported logistics firms including UPS and Kuehne & Nagel International AG, which said they had added new services that were capitalising on strong demand. \nLower oil prices represented another boost, cutting costs for companies such as Peugeot (Other OTC: PUOGF - news ) or allowing others, such as Thomas Cook (Xetra: A0MR3W - news ) , to pass on lower prices to customers. \nCompanies including HeidelbergCement (Other OTC: HDELY - news ) , Daimler, and Siemens (BSE: SIEMENS4.BO - news ) also credited the ECB's decision to inject masses of liquidity into the economy, which led to low interest rates and customers' easy access to credit, with driving demand. \nGREECE SHRUGGED OFF \nCarlos Tavares, CEO of Peugeot, said the \"tailwinds\" of currency, credit and lower energy costs had left his company struggling to meet consumer demand in the past few months. \n\"We started the year with a very low expectation in terms of volumes and we didn't produce enough cars. In the Q2 we really pushed the accelerator to the highest possible level,\" he added. \nFew CEOs reported concerns about the crisis in Greece. \nThe country is a small market for international companies but some economists predicted fears of economic contagion from a possible Greek economic collapse could weigh on big companies by making consumers and businesses elsewhere in Europe reluctant to spend and invest. \nBut executives reported few if any signs that customers were spooked into postponing buying decisions. \nJamie Dimon, Chief Executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co (Xetra: 850628 - news ) . , said CEOs had also not been deterred from pressing ahead with big strategic decisions. \n\"We don't think Greece has affected the M&A (mergers and acquisitions) dialogue very much,\" he said last month. \n\"European companies coming to America and American companies going to Europe ... those conversations continue\" he added.
