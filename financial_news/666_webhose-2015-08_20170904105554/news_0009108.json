(MTZ) saw a big move last session, as the company’s shares fell by over 6% on the day. The move came on pretty good volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This breaks the recent trend of the company, as the stock is now trading below the volatile price range of $16.39 to $18.43 in the past one-month time frame. \nOn Aug 17, the company reported-second quarter 2015 earnings results that fell significantly from the prior-year quarter level. \nThis slump shouldn’t be too much of a surprise to investors, as the company has seen 2 negative revisions in the past few weeks and its current year earnings consensus has moved lower over the last 30 days. This suggests there may be more trouble down the road. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward to see if this recent slump will continue, as the earnings picture definitely suggests that this might be the case. \nMTZ currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). \nA better-ranked stock in the same sector is Dycom Industries Inc. (DY), holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). \nIs MTZ going up? Or down? Predict to see what others think: Up or Down \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
