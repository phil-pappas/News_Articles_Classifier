Kyerematen-Jimoh queried. \nTechnology experts across Africa note that the internet, mobile telephony and the proliferation of smart devices would further fuel the growth of the data industry on the continent. \nIBM's notes that mobile, social and the Internet of things are each creating exponentially growing waves of data, as cloud transforms the underlying agility and economics. \nTogether with the growth of more traditional transactional data streams these trends are fueling Big Data and re-shaping the dynamics of value creation. \nA big data revolution in Ghana would, therefore, require immediate investment in three core pillars, Kyerematen-Jimoh said. \nShe said 'policymakers must cultivate technical skills in big data and analytics by working with tertiary and vocational institutions, developing courses and degrees to train a workforce of professionals whose expertise can be applied not just in Africa, but to projects around the world.' \nShe said 'business and government must invest in Ghana's emerging start-up ecosystems which increasingly seek to disrupt existing entities and market structures by using data as a new 'natural resource'.' \nShe advocated the need for the education sector to focus on how big data to improve research and development, with a view to coming up with discoveries that can enrich economic, environmental and quality-of-life outcomes not just around the country or the African continent but all over the world. \nIn other parts of the world, she said, researchers are using Big Data for everything from predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases to better understanding what conditions create environmental catastrophes like hurricanes and cyclones. \nAlgeria's UniversitÃ© Dr Yahia Fares Medea has turned to IBM to deliver a high-performance computing solution that would perform computations 700 times faster than before. \nShe said by investing in that sort of big data research, Africa's research institutions could establish themselves as thought leaders in academia, generate insights with vast potential to boost economic and quality-of-life outcomes for both their countries and the world. \nKyerematen-Jimoh said IBM was poised to deepen its ongoing capacity development programmes with the University of Ghana in Legon and expand the support to other tertiary institutions across the country. \nTwo-thirds of IBM Research's work is now devoted to data, analytics and cognitive computing. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:26:29.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
