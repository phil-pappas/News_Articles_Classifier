Photo: Supplied\nThis is my second and final post about my experience being \"reverse mentored\". For the uninitiated, this involves seeking advice and guidance not from someone who's older and wiser, but from someone you respect who is younger than you.\nMy mentor is Ashleigh Ryan , social media consultant and general fount of knowledge on all things digital. This week, I wanted to pick her brains about what's hot in social media.\nAsh says the main social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pintrest and, more recently, Snapchat – remain the top social networks.\nShe says she uses these sites to generate inspiration when she's looking for something to buy and to make sure she's getting a good deal. For instance, she was recently in the market for a pushbike and came across a business whose bikes were well priced. By reading the customer reviews on the business's Facebook page she as able to work out that the bikes, while relatively cheap, were still good quality.\nAdvertisement Ash is also getting married soon and so she's been searching Instagram and Pinterest using the hashtag #huntervalleyweddings – she wants to get married in the Hunter Valley in NSW – to find suppliers such as photographers, who will have tagged their posts with this same hashtag.\nA great tip from Ash is a new Facebook feature, a responsiveness button that allows consumers to indicate how quickly a business replied to a query or comment. \"I often use Facebook to message businesses and if they engage with me quickly, I'm more likely to buy from them.\" This is something every business needs to keep in mind if they want to generate sales through their social media profile.\nEstablishing a social media presence is no longer a nice-to-have, it's a must-have for every business. Aside from responding promptly to customers' queries, one of the most important parts of managing your social media presence is the way you respond to complaints and criticism.\nAsh says when someone makes a complaint via a business's social media page, it's essential to respond immediately. \"You need to own up to any mistakes and give the consumer the opportunity for a refund.\"\nInterestingly, she says in her experience businesses such as the large telcos now respond more quickly to complaints posted on their social media profiles than they do complaints or queries consumers make to a hotline.\nTrolls – people who make disparaging remarks about an individual or business – are something else businesses need to take into account when establishing a social media presence. Ash's advice to a business that is trolled is simply to block the person and report them to the platform they are using to troll the business.\nSo what are some of the great emerging digital tools out there? Ash names PicMonkey as a great site that's like Photoshop for dummies. It allows users to easily edit images they can use on their own site and in social media campaigns.\nAnother great tip is to use Bitly to shorten long website addresses. \"You can also use it to track how many clicks you get on the link,\" she advises.\nWhen it comes to Facebook, Ash is a fan of a new tool that allows businesses to update their cover photo with a call to action, for instance a message encouraging consumers to sign up to their page. The feature also allows businesses to include a link to their website on the cover photo.\nDon't forget to measure how many people come to your page from your Facebook site and compare to other avenues through which people find your site to work out which marketing channel is the most effective.\nFinally, Ash says although she doesn't think any of the major social media pages will go the way of once-dominant platform Myspace and disappear into oblivion, it's sensible to build your database of new and prospective customers through your newsletter email list.\nThat way, even if one of the main social media platforms does disappear, you've already got a database of people who you know are interested in your business, and this reduces your dependency on social media sites over which you ultimately have very little control.\nWhat's your top social media tip?
