In particular, E*TRADE’s Daily Average Revenue Trades (DARTs) came in at 149,283 in July 2015, growing 6.6% MoM from 140,003 in June 2015. However, over a yearly timetable, E*TRADE saw its DARTs wither by -2.9% YoY from 153,671 in July 2014. Despite the uneven performance of DARTs this past month, E*TRADE did secure a healthy growth in its brokerage accounts, yielding an increase of 29,623 gross new accounts in July 2015 – this corresponds to a marginal decline of less than -1% MoM from 29,774 newly added brokerage accounts in June 2015. Overall however, this brings the company’s total accounts to 3.2 million. Furthermore, E*TRADE also saw its customer security holdings by $500 million during July 2015, or 0.2% MoM from June 2015, with its brokerage-related cash incurring a loss of $800 million, to $41.2 billion in July 2015. Last month, E*TRADE made waves after releasing its Q2 financial metrics , having reported a net income of $292 million, or $0.99 per diluted share. The latest figures represented a substantial jump from $40 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in Q1 2015 and $69 million, or $0.24 per diluted share in Q2 2014. Got a news tip?
