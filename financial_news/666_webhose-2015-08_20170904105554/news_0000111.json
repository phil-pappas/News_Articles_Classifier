This has happened despite evidence Sydney's property market is in a bubble.\nOur most valuable asset Dr Lowe's speech - titled National Wealth, Land Values and Monetary Policy - details how land has become the most valuable asset owned by Australians, accounting for 34 per cent of total national assets in June 2014 .\nAlmost three-quarters of the increase in the ratio of net wealth to gross domestic product since the late 1980s is due to higher land prices, as distinct from the value of houses built on that land, which has been relatively unchanged in recent decades.\n\"Most of the extra money that has gone into residential property has not gone into the physical stock of housing, but rather into land,\" Dr Lowe said. \"So our fascination with housing is really, mostly, a fascination with land.\"\nDr Lowe said much of the increase was because Australians have taken advantage of greater access to credit and low official interest rates since the early 1980s to buy better properties than was previously possible.\nWhile this has made many Australians wealthy, it has also driven up the cost of housing, particularly for younger families.\n\"From the perspective of society as a whole, much of what is gained on the one hand is lost on the other: there are windfall gains from higher land prices but then everyone pays more for housing services,\" Dr Lowe said.\nHe noted that while land prices have risen, there has been a similar increase in debt.\nWhile any gains in house prices have a larger impact on household balance sheets than in the past, any movements in interest rates are equally more dramatic, he suggested.\n\"We are still trying to understand fully the implications of all of this.\n\"However, I think it is difficult to escape the conclusion that household balance sheets are, on average, a little more risky than they once were.\n\"Many Australian households also seem to have reached a similar conclusion. This is reflected in the decision by many Australians to take a more prudent approach to their spending over recent years.\"\nEye on household spending Dr Lowe said it was unlikely to be \"in our national interest\" if this prudence suddenly gave way to households spending more than they earn.\n\"This is something we continue to be cognisant of in the setting of monetary policy.\"\nDr Lowe warned that ever-rising prices, relative to incomes, increased the risks in the economy and \"are unlikely to make us better off as a nation.\n\"Rising housing prices are best matched by rising incomes.\"\nThis would be best achieved by finding \"new ideas and better ways\" of driving economic growth.\nHe listed among options efforts to boost Australia's culture of innovation; cutting needless regulation; supporting competition policy; increasing infrastructure investment, particularly in transport.\n\"Done properly, it could help lift the return to other forms of investment in a wide range of industries across the economy.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-dg-2015-08-12.html", "https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-12T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:09:29.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
