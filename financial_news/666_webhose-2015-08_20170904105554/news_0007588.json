We have to give options to our stakeholders.. Perhaps we will come to that stage in a year and two, where we will give options to our stakeholders…(and ask them) you decide,” EPFO Central Provident Fund Commissioner K K Jalan said here.\nSpeaking at an Assocham conference here, Japan further said the people might want such an option going forward as they are becoming more financially literate.\n“We should be prepared. I can assure you that EPFO is preparing itself for all these things in the future,” he said.\nGiving credit to the Finance Ministry for pursuing EPFO to start investments in the stock market, he said, “We have not decided to invest in equity. The Finance Department (Ministry) has forced us to decide. Finance Department decides where the provident funds can invest.”\nElaborating further, he said, “It was the Finance Ministry circular in March that said provident funds must invest its funds in equity. With that circular coming, there was no option for EPFO (but to invest in equity).. therefore we don’t want to take any credit as far as investment in equity is concerned.”\nIn April, the Labour Ministry notified an investment pattern which allows EPFO to invest a minimum of 5 per cent and a maximum of 15 per cent investment in equity or equity related schemes.\nThis followed the Finance Ministry in March bringing out new investment norms for private provident funds in the country. It has provided for 5-15 per cent of funds to be invested in the equity or equity related schemes.\nAccording to a study by CRISIL, if a large number of older people end up having no pension, the government risks having to shoulder the heavy fiscal burden of providing minimum sustenance to them. Such a fiscal burden can rise to 4.1 per cent of GDP, unless retirement sector gets the impetus it deserves.\nJalan also said that a panel on housing for subscribers has given its report and it will be reviewed soon.\nThe panel has suggested ways to facilitate subscribers for purchasing low-cost houses.\n“We have suggested that EPFO can establish the credit worthiness of the subscribers purchasing houses, and his home loan EMIs can be paid through his EPF account,” Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh General Sectreaty Vrijesh Upadhyay said.\nAbout 70 per cent of EPFO subscribers have a basic salary of up to Rs 15,000 per month and the housing scheme is largely targetted at this segment.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 11:27 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T08:09:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
