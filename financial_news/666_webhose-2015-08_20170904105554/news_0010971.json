Not temporary, flash-in-the-pan growth, but sustainable growth.\" \nThe conference Mr Stevens was speaking at was also attended by Treasurer Joe Hockey and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as well as business and union leaders. \nJP Morgan Australia chief economist Stephen Walters said the RBA governor in his speech was essentially asking for help in getting the economy going. \n\"Interest rates cuts can do only so much by encouraging demand to be dragged forward from future periods, but he wants sustainable sources of expansion,\" Mr Walters said. \n\"There are no direct implications for the policy outlook in today's comments but, at a stretch, a case could be made that the governor still sounds pretty content with current policy settings.\" \nThe RBA has cut the cash rate twice this year, in February and May, to a new record low of two per cent. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Economic growth will solve budget woes:RBA AAP \nReserve Bank boss Glenn Stevens believes the budget debate should focus on how to increase tax revenue by lifting â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T08:23:39.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
