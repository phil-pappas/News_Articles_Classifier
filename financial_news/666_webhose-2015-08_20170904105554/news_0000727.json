Nic Kocher Share on twitter by Philip Baker First Orica, then Ansell. Share price falls of about 20 per cent are normally the domain of small-cap stocks, not blue-chip companies in the top 100.\nBut shares in condom and rubber glove maker Ansell fell 20 per cent on Monday , after the company said the outlook for earnings in 2016 would be about 15 per cent below what consensus forecasts had pencilled in.\nBefore this latest result Ansell had been a good performer, rising almost 10 per cent in 2015, compared to a 1 per cent gain in the benchmark S&P ASX 200 index.\nBut that was all before the latest profit result, which on the surface looked like it had hit all the right notes.\nAnsell posted a 20 per cent increase in underlying profit, slightly beating analysts' estimates, but the company used tax losses to lower its tax rate to reach those sorts of numbers and so it didn't take long before investors dumped the stock, pushing it down 20 per cent to almost $20.\nA strong US dollar also played its part in the second half. It was just one of many moving parts including tax, prices for raw materials and even country risk that make forecasting numbers for Ansell a tough job.\nAt the heart of the issue for Ansell is if foreign exchange rates stay about the same in 2016 as they were in the last three months of the 2015 financial year it would lead to a $US55 million ($74.4 million) fall in revenue and $US30 million drop in earnings before interest and tax.\nCurrency moves matter Most analysts thought a lower Australian dollar would help, but the company reports in US dollars and because there are so many factors involved, currency moves do matter.\nThe Australian dollar has fallen 20 per cent against the greenback in the 2015 financial year but against the euro, for example, the greenback has held steady, falling just 1 per cent.\nA strong US dollar has also played havoc with some of the largest companies in the US, crimping their earnings from Europe, Australia and other countries whose currencies have fallen against the greenback.\nIt also shows up the challenges of running a global organisation that is listed in Australia and yet sells its products through a network that spans 35 countries.\nThe weaker euro, along with the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar, which has also suffered at the hand of the greenback, hurt top-line revenue and it couldn't be offset by the benefits of weaker currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Thai baht.\nSales were up 4 per cent and free cash flow down 23 per cent.\nAnsell's plunge follows a 17 per cent sell-off in Orica last week, when the explosives maker shocked investors with a write-down of as much as $1.65 billion.\nShares in Orica were flat in trading on Monday but are down 17 per cent year to date.\nAmong the top 100 Orica and Ansell are both among the top 100 companies on the ASX and trade on a forward price earnings ratio of 12.5 times and 11.5 times respectively.\nLeading into the season analysts were warning that the differentiation between onshore and offshore earnings would be stark again and that investors should focus on the real growth rate in revenue rather than just any windfall, or not, from moves in foreign exchange.\nLarge moves in share prices were also tipped to be a feature of this reporting season and although it's still early days it has certainly played out that way.\nThanks to a buyback, shares in JB Hi-Fi rose almost 10 per cent on Monday to back up that trend.\nThe company has a brighter outlook and expects sales growth will accelerate in 2016 as the consumer electronics retailer wins from a buoyant housing market, which it expects will lead to households spending more on appliances.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-10T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:13:48.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
