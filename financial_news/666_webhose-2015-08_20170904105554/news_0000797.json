David Mariuz On Thursday, the ABC said their board approved the change based on the show's \"editorial processes\" saying \"the program and the wider ABC would benefit by an orderly shift of Q&A into the ABC News Division\".\nMr Abbott said his frontbenchers would now be allowed back on the show straight away and he was giving the ABC \"a bit of a pat on the back for doing the right thing\".\n\"We've seen a bit of common sense after the notorious Q&A program of some weeks back.\" he said.\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten said the move was a small victory for the Prime Minister, saying he was '\"micro-managing the programming decisions of a TV station\" instead of looking at serious economic concerns facing the country.\n Join #QandA w/ @Cmdr_Hadfield @SummersAnne @JoshFrydenberg @SharonBirdMP Jonathan Fine http://t.co/cFoDHTwf3m #auspol pic.twitter.com/w95uLg2nrd\nâ€” ABC Q&A (@QandA) August 7, 2015 The ABC has said the move between divisions will occur \"no later than the 2016 broadcast year\".\nBlocking Adani project 'tragic' Mr Abbott also said he was frustrated by the Mackay Conservation Group's victory in convincing a court to delay Indian energy giant Adani's $16.5 billion Carmichael mine in Central Queensland this week, saying it was \"tragic for the wider world\".\nThe Federal Court on Wednesday set aside Adani's environmental approval for the Carmichael mine after it found the Environment Department failed to provide adequate information to the minister on the impact on threatened species.\n\"This is a very important project, not just for Australia, but for the wider world and if we get to the stage where the rules are such that projects like this can be endlessly frustrated, that's dangerous for our country and it's tragic for the wider world,\" he said.\nMr Abbott said once projects such as Adani's fully comply with high environmental standards, they should be allowed to go ahead, and not face challenges.", "external_links": ["http://about.abc.net.au/statements/abc-board-statement-qa/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/QandA?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JoshFrydenberg", "http://t.co/cFoDHTwf3m", "https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield", "https://twitter.com/SummersAnne", "http://t.co/w95uLg2nrd", "https://twitter.com/QandA/status/629482468345671680", "https://twitter.com/SharonBirdMP", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash"], "published": "2015-08-07T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T10:52:27.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
