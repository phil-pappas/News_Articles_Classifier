REUTERS/Mike â€¦ \nBy Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices resumed their downward trend on Friday pulled lower by weaker global stock markets and a sharp contraction in China's manufacturing activity, with the U.S. benchmark on track for its longest weekly losing streak since 1986. \nActivity in China's factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled, adding to worries about lower demand for crude in the world's second biggest oil consumer. \nAsian stocks fell on Friday morning, following Wall Street down as fears took hold of a China-led deceleration in global growth. \nKey oil benchmarks were trading near 6-1/2 year lows, with the U.S benchmark headed for its eighth straight weekly decline, the longest weekly losing streak since 1986. \nIn late 1985, oil prices slumped to $10 from around $30 over five months as OPEC raised output to regain market share following an increase in non-OPEC production. \nU.S. crude for October delivery was 59 cents lower at $40.73 a barrel at 0328 GMT. The September contract, which expired on Thursday, ended 34 cents higher. The U.S. benchmark hit a 6-1/2 year low of $40.21 a barrel on Thursday. \nBrent was on track for its seventh weekly decline in the past eight, trading 56 cents lower at $46.06 a barrel, after settling 54 cents lower on Thursday. \nThe dollar continued retreating on shrinking expectations of an U.S. interest rate hike in September, providing some support for oil prices. \nU.S. crude inventories continued to rise last week, as imports rose and shale production fell slower than anticipated, despite falling prices. \n\"The only silver lining we are seeing coming from the United States is that refining rates remain high and that crude production continues to fall,\" Singapore-based Philip Futures said in a note to clients. \nDespite the rout in oil prices, some mutual funds keep ploughing money into oil exploration and production companies in the United States in a bet that production will retreat sharply over the next 12 months, setting the stage for a rebound towards $65-70 per barrel. \nA glut of U.S. oil is about to repeat itself north of the border, with traders scrambling to secure more storage space in western Canada as crude stockpiles surge to record highs. \nSpot prices of Western Canada Select (WCS), a marker for heavy, diluted bitumen from Alberta's oil sands sank to a 12-year low near $20 per barrel. \n(Reporting By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen; Editing by Michael Perry)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T07:28:04.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
