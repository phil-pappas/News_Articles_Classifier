Nic Walker by Andrew Fleming Over the past year the S&P/ASX200 index is flat, but resources and energy are both down 25 per cent.\nEvery other sector is up. We were overweight resources and energy a year ago and are more overweight now. Last month the divergence in returns stretched to a record extent.\nCommodity prices have clearly been hit hard, and with them have gone resource securities. Even our positions in the low cost, long life, lowly geared, quality resource names have underperformed aggressively in line with commodity price falls, with BHP and RIO both underperforming by more than 20 per cent over the past year.\nOur assumptions on mid cycle earnings are about to be tested, with reporting season upon us.\nThe earnings and cashflow produced by the resource stocks in our portfolio this half should give us comfort, or pause for thought, with our valuations. That of course doesn't account for the depth and breadth of time that may be spent \"below the curve\" as commodity markets continue to adjust to lower demand levels than had been envisaged.\nOf course, this scenario also has broader implications for the Australian economy and market.\nIn that context, foreign earners have been well sought. All of Aristocrat, CSL, Resmed, Macquarie, Recall and Amcor have outperformed by more than 40 per cent through the past year. Prima facie, buying foreign earnings before, or as the Australian dollar corrects to equilibrium, is a sensible strategy.\nUltimately, however, multiples matter and can't divorce themselves from a sustainable growth rate.\n We have owned most of the names on that list through the past year, but clearly not enough, and we own far less now than we did a year ago, albeit still more than our models suggest to us is now justified purely on valuation grounds.\nResmed, for example, is now trading on 20x EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) for low single digit growth. It is far from the most egregious example of the rerating that has been funnelled into the healthcare and IT sectors globally.\nThe prescience of a regulator The banks continue to exhibit Resmed tendencies – low underlying growth with high multiples.\nBut then came along the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority.\nIt has made much of the need to balance safety with efficiency and competition, In a speech in July, APRA made two interesting points. Firstly, the credit rating for the banks is premised upon a rating agency view that \"… the Australian public sector will stand behind the Australian major banks in times of stress, thereby protecting bank creditors …\".\nSecondly, \"… because the major banks are currently profitable, competitive and efficient, increasing their capital requirements would be unlikely to unduly impair, and might marginally improve, the financial system's competitiveness …\".\nOh, for the prescience of a regulator.\nA week later, ANZ accepted the invitation to treat and increased their rates for investor lending by 27 basis points (bps), citing \"… the criteria we look at when setting rates including our competitive position, our regulatory obligations and …\".\nCBA bowed to the South, thanked ANZ and copied and pasted the announcement a day later, and NAB and Westpac also effectively followed within the week, just to assuage any doubts as to the competitive intensity in the sector.\nThe second tier institutions really got the competitive juices flowing, with AMP lifting their rates by 45bps on existing loans and withdrawing from the market for new loans.\nNo Aldi in that lot.\nAs investments, major Australian banks have two issues – profits are unsustainably high as volumes dissipate and bad debts increase, and multiples are high – but as an example of an industry egregiously using pricing power to protect and enhance industry return, this was breathtaking.\nEquivalent of increasing food prices by 5 per cent There is $1.6 trillion of housing loans in Australia, and almost ⅓ of this is investor loans. A 27bps price increase on this stock is almost $1.5 billion.\nThis price rise by the banks is economically equivalent to Woolworths putting up supermarket prices by almost 5 per cent.\nApart from pricing strategies, bank management have been adroit at raising capital this cycle. Last cycle they raised almost $15 billion at closer to book value than a multiple of it. We are on track to raise the same amount this cycle, but at double the multiple.\nThe tricky issue for Australian bank investors now is how do you price the residual liability arising from the government support, in the event of a downturn, as referred to in the APRA speech?\nIn each of the US and UK markets, penalties levied upon the financial system have risen sequentially every year since the global financial crisis, and are still rising. Government guarantees are not ultimately costless to shareholders, even though the premium is clearly paid in arrears.\nThe sectoral bifurcation I talked about at the start tells you that being long resources or energy was the only way to underperform the ASX during the past year.\nMany of the traits that characterised the market boom of 2006 to 2008, before the global financial crisis, are again in force. Equity markets have risen apace for several years now, at a much faster rate than earnings growth. Three to four years ago, given low bond yields and the prospect of them going lower, and low multiples for equities, we thought buying equities was a credible investment strategy.\nThat is now subject to many caveats.\nHigh multiple stocks, which on the ASX are almost wholly industrial stocks with a healthcare, technology and/or yield tinge, are now at multiples so high they have never before presaged gains for investors.\nAs multiples have dropped in sync with commodity prices, materials stocks offer good value, especially for the higher quality names with long life, low cost reserves, due to the cocktail of better than expected outcomes for volumes, and capital and operating costs dropping dramatically.\nAndrew Fleming is deputy head of Australian equities at Schroders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:12:46.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
