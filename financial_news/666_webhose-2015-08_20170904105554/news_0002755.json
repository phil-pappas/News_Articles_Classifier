Share on twitter by Philip Baker It was the jobs number everyone was waiting for, and in the end, there was something in it for everybody.\nBut can it be trusted?\nThe monthly jobs report can be volatile at the best of times but over the past year or so, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has come under fire for some economic reports that were way out of whack when compared with expectations.\nThursday's employment report for July had traders backtracking very quickly after the good news on the number of jobs created, about 38,000, was quickly wiped out by the unemployment rate jumping to 6.3 per cent, its highest level since 2002.\nSometimes the number of jobs created is seen as a lagging indicator because of the time it takes to hire someone and that's why the unemployment rate is often viewed as a more reliable indicator.\nThe rise to 6.3 per cent perhaps shouldn't be so surprising. Indeed, the low level of unemployment has confounded most in the past year.\nLower dollar On Tuesday, the RBA flagged the issue again when its accompanying statement, released after the bank left the official cash rate on hold at 2 per cent, mentioned the growing conundrum again between what had been the better than expected jobs data and economic growth that was well below the economy's traditional potential rate of just above 3 per cent.\n But it was the bank not calling for a lower Australian dollar in that statement that grabbed all the attention and had some economists taking it as a sign there would be no more rate cuts.\nThursday's report was immediately targeted as the next piece of vital information for those poised to fire up their Excel spreadsheets to determine the first rate rise by the RBA.\nThat's why the $A breached the US74 cent level immediately after the report before falling back to US73.37Â¢ once the unemployment rate was digested.\nThe first rate rise could be the middle of 2016, but those calling for one more rate cut would have been emboldened by the move in the unemployment rate because their forecasts rely on it heading towards 6.5 per cent.\nThe driving force behind the rise is a jump in the number of people looking for work\nAccording to Westpac's Justin Smirk, the participation rate, which rose from 64.8 per cent to 65.1 per cent, is back to the average since March 2008.\nIt's the first time since the beginning of 2013 that the participation rate has been anywhere near its average.\nBut the previous time it was at that level was in September 2012 and Smirk noted that it fell sharply over the two months after that.\nThe report also showed that in the year to date, more than 160,000 jobs had been created, \"marking the best start to a calendar year in seven years\", according to CommSec's Savanth Sebastian.\nBut economists like Nomura's Andrew Ticehurst, who still thinks the RBA is a good chance to cut the official cash rate to 1.75 per cent in November, pointed to the 800,000 Australians now unemployed.\n\"This is the largest number of people unemployed in Australia since 1994, when the economy was clearly emerging from recession,\" he told clients.\n\"A larger pool of unemployed persons is a sign of more spare capacity than previously estimated and a larger than previously understood economic and social challenge, more than a sign of current strength,\" he said.\nThat said, the population was closer to 18 million back in 1994, compared with almost 24 million now.\nStill, the latest unemployment report ensures the debate about whether the RBA will cut rates or not one more time in this cycle rolls on.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-08-06T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:10:58.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
