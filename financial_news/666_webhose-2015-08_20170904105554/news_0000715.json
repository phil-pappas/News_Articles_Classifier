Photo: ALAMY By Ed Monk , Investment Editor 1:12PM BST 10 Aug 2015 Comments \nThe UK fund managers with the best long-term track records for beating the market have been revealed, with women making up more than their fair share of the list. \nNumbers crunched by investing platform TD Direct Investing showed five of the funds on the list of 25 best performers were managed wholly or partly by a woman. \nThat’s despite only an estimated 2pc of fund managers being women, according to Morningstar. \nTD Direct screened 269 UK-focused fund managers with a ten-year track record and ranked them according to their performance over that time. \n• Put an investing question to our experts: moneyexpert@telegraph.co.uk \nManagers who had changed employer but continued to manage according to the same mandate were included. Funds with less than £100m under management were screened out. \nFunds had to then have beaten the FTSE All-Share over ten years. \nFinally, the 25 with the best performance versus other funds of their type made the list, which is published in full below. \n• 10 undervalued dividend shares for income AND growth \nWhile studying past returns will not tell you how the funds will perform from now on, TD Direct Investing said, this filter could help investors identify reliable managers that have performed in all conditions. \nMichelle McGrade, chief investment officer for TD Direct, said: “We wanted to look at a long period of performance that covered different types of markets. Look over ten years covers a bear market in 08/09 and then a period of rising stock markets. \n“Past performance over that period gives an indication of what you can expect.” \nThe appearance of five funds managed or co-managed by women was noteworthy. \nRosemary Banyard, who co-manages the Schroder UK Smaller Companies fund, alongside Andy Brough on the Schroder UK Smaller Companies , Audrey Ryan, manager of the Kames Ethical Equity, and Georgina Brittain, manager of the JPMorgan UK Smaller Companies, were eigth, ninth and tenth respectively on the list of 25. \n“There are fewer well-known women managers and perhaps they hide their light under a bushel,” said Michelle McGrade. \n• Calculator: How your money might grow after a lump sum investment \nTD Direct added that a tendency among women to be more risk averse versus their male counterparts may have contributed to them better protecting investors’ money over the comparison period. \nThe highest returns overall came from managers picking from smaller companies. The Standard Life Investment UK Smaller Companies fund, managed by Harry Nimmo, has given holders an average 14.2pc annual return versus 7.1pc for the FTSE All Share and an average 9.84pc among UK smaller companies funds. \nOld Mutual UK Smaller Companies, managed by Daniel Nichols, came next with a 13.9pc annualised return. \nThe average across the 25 top performers was 9.8pc.
