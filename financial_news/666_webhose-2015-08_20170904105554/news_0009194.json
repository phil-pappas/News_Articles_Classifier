It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is the company's third Global Xpress satellite. \nChief Executive Rupert Pearce told Reuters on Thursday that the company had worked hard to control any launch risks by performing its own rigorous checks. \n(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Keith Weir)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T02:37:12.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
