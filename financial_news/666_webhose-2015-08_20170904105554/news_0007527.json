Arm Holdings, the Cambridge-based chip designer whose technology is used in almost all of the world's smartphones, took fifth place in the publication's ranking of 100 firms across the world. \nArm, which is worth $12.9bn (£8.3bn), had sales growth of 17.5pc in the past 12 months. The FTSE 100 company recently reported a 22pc increase in quarterly revenue to £228.5m, although there have been warnings the firm's growth may level off because of a slowdown in the smartphone sector . \nConsumer goods giant Reckitt Benckiser (Xetra: A0M1W6 - news ) , worth $66.5bn, was the second UK company to make the list, coming in at 53. \nThe company, which owns brands including Durex and Nurofen, has benefited from a boost in sales among its non-prescription cold and flu medicines. However, the firm was told by the UK Competition and Markets Authority that it would have to license out the K-Y lubricant brand it is buying from US giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ - news ) , to overcome worries the deal will lead to rising prices. \nForbes ranked companies by their innovation premium: the difference between their market capitalisation and a net present value of cash flows from existing businesses. To be included, firms needed seven years of public financial data and a market cap of at least $10bn. \nOutsourcer Capita, credit checker Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) , and medical equipment manufacturer Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN.L - news ) were the three remaining UK companies that made the top 100. \nForbes said US-based electric car maker Tesla Motors (Xetra: A1CX3T - news ) has grabbed Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's creative crown. Tesla, which was named the World's Most Innovative Company 2015, is on track to gross $5.5bn this year, up 54pc from 2014, said the authors. Tesla's shares have soared 15-fold since it floated in 2010 to a recent $33bn market capitalisation. \nThe company, which makes luxury all-electric vehicles, is run by Elon Musk, the tech billionaire that also runs SpaceX. \nForbes Most Innovative Companies, top 10: *Tesla Motors, innovation score - 84.82 *Salesforce, innovation score - 77.81 *Alexion Pharmaceuticals (NasdaqGS: ALXN - news ) , innovation score - 72.50 *Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NasdaqGS: REGN - news ) , innovation score - 72.13 *ARM Holdings, innovation score - 69.76 *Unilever Indonesia, innovation score - 67.90 *INCYTE Corporation (NasdaqGS: INCY - news ) , innovation score - 67.85 *Amazon, innovation score - 67.64 *Under Armour (Xetra: U9R.DE - news ) , innovation score - 66.56 *Biomarin Pharmaceutical (NasdaqGS: BMRN - news ) , innovation score - 65.19", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T02:06:22.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
