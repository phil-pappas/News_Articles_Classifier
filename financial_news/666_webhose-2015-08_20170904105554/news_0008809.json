Erin Jonasson by Mark Story Giving employees equity in the business in recognition for good work is popular in some companies, for two reasons. First, it aligns the interests of the employee with the business even more. Second, it doesn't cost the business anything.\nBut they don't call it \"skin in the game\" for nothing. Those granted shares in an employee share scheme or otherwise have a host of issues to consider, ranging from taxation to currency to asset allocation. And if they fail to address them in a timely fashion, they might find themselves feeling the pinch.\nWhile most listed companies lay claim to having some type of employee share scheme, they are usually focused on the executive ranks. At this level share schemes form a critical component of the salary package. Many will be forced to borrow to acquire them.\nIn today's business environment, however, where companies that didn't even exist 10 years ago can suddenly be worth billions of dollars, it has become more common for start-ups to offer them as a means of retaining staff.\nKel Fitzalan, private clients partner with PwC, explains the drawbacks of deferred benefits such as employee equity schemes, or \"golden handcuffs\".\n\"Given that there's no ready market for shares in unlisted companies, execs who work for them may be prevented from selling [their shares] until there's [an initial public offering or trade sale] deal,\" Fitzalan says.\nPrivate firms tend to favour relatively uncomplicated share issues, while their publicly listed counterparts are more likely to use options that allow executives to buy shares at a discount at specific points over the short, medium and long term.\nIf you are employed by a multinational and live in Australia you will also have the issue of currency hanging over your head. Following a volatile few years for the Australian dollar, where it goes next is anyone's guess.\n Andrew Moir is wealth management expert and a director of boutique wealth adviser Evans and Partners. He suggests executives who find themselves holding foreign equities flowing from employee share schemes should consider hedging up to 30 per cent of the total parcel.\n\"For every 1¢ the Australian dollar comes down the closer an exec should be to making a hedging decision,\" Moir advises. \"They can lock in the currency, even if they can't lock in the price.\"\nProhibited deals Hedging aside, executives are generally prohibited from dealing with their entitlements until they are eligible to execute the options, or otherwise vest the entitlement.\nThis includes the use of derivatives to create \"cuff and collar\" arrangements, which were used to protect against volatility in the lead-up to and during the global financial crisis, although these are seldom used today.\nOnce the risk of forfeiting the incentives ends and the entitlements become fully paid ordinary shares, executives will generally have greater flexibility in relation to their shares, including the use of options to protect against the potential of a share price rout.\nAffinity Private chief executive Catherine Robson says great care needs to be exercised to ensure the use of derivative instruments complies with company policies, and don't cause executives to buy or sell shares in their employer outside prescribed trading windows.\nFor \"ordinary\" share scheme participants who aren't bank CEOs, for instance, concerns can be more practical such as having enough cash on hand to deal with the tax consequences or making sure the shares fit into your overall asset allocation and tolerance for risk.\n\"If well managed, there should be no adverse tax outcomes associated with employee share entitlements. And, for busy professionals with limited time, clarity around how these instruments fit within a broader personal investment strategy is essential,\" she says.\nInstead of parking them in a bottom draw for future review, Robson argues that it's critical participants pay attention to the number and types of securities being issued, making sure to fully understand the tax outcomes of either and the potential for things to go wrong.\n\"There can be terrible outcomes where discretionary spending on holidays, cars, and home improvements are made in the expectation of employee share proceeds in the future,\" Robson says.\n\"Where entitlements don't vest or only partially vest it is possible to find yourself over committed when your employer is suffering from poor performance, which can be a perilous position to find yourself in.\"\nStay on top of your lot The challenge for recipients of entitlements, adds Robson is to understand the chronology, the size of cash flows needed, and particularly the tax payable. As is the case for any good comedian, the best outcomes are derived from a sense of good timing, she says.\nShe reminds executives that in most cases, the tax obligation arises when the risk of losing these incentives ends, not when the instruments are actually exercised or sold.\n\"Most executives plan to pay this tax with the sale of shares, rather than drawing on other resources,\" Robson says. \"However, where multiple series of instruments have been issued, it can be easy to lose track of vesting dates and to take no action for some time.\"\nThe trouble with calculating tax on the value at the time of vesting tax is that by the time tax is due to be remitted – potentially 18 months later – there can be material movements in the share price, and the net effect could be disastrous.\nFor example, in highly volatile markets where there's been a major fall in the share price, a high proportion of the vested shares may need to be sold to pay tax; in extreme cases, selling all shares may go nowhere towards fulfilling the tax obligation.\nWhat can further compound timing issues are restrictions that prevent executives from dealing with their employee shares other than during prescribed trading windows.\nAffinity Private's Robson says failure by executives to keep track of vesting dates – that fall within these windows – can mean that a large tax bill on vested shares is payable outside a window and the shares to which the liability relates cannot be liquidated, sometimes for many months.\nWhile ASX-listed companies are good at collecting data on fees and dates for their executives, the challenge, says Robson, is getting independent advice and a tax summary that relates to an individual's personal circumstances.\n\"Mitigate this risk by diarising vesting dates as soon as instruments are issued and when the real risk of forfeiture ends. And, regardless of your personal outlook for the company, sell sufficient instruments to fully provide for tax payable,\" Robson advises.\n\"It's also a good idea to pass on the information you receive from your employer about the scheme to your accountant or financial planner so that they can also build expected receipts and tax payments into your expected cash flow.\"\nRobson also reminds executives that there's also a taxing point on employee shares where they may have terminated their employment but retained the entitlements – even though the shares have not yet vested.\nThis can cause cash flow problems as the tax can be payable before any value can be realised from the shares.\n\"Many employees are unaware of the tax payable as a result of cessation of employment, and fail to inform their accountant and [the] Tax Office, which can result in substantial penalties for non-disclosure,\" Robson advises.\nUnwinding the plan Tax and timing issues aside, it's equally important for executives to be aware of any provisions within which an employee share scheme could be unwound if things don't go according to plan. Most plans will include what are called \"good leaver\" and \"bad leaver\" provisions which detail whether employees may retain their shares or options if they cease employment or are terminated.\nIn some cases, executives may have share entitlements taken away, but most \"good leaver\" issues are around who executives may sell their shares or options to, or whether they will be bought back by the employer and at what value.\nPwC's Fitzalan says that all companies have an obligation to ensure their executives fully understand how an employee share scheme can add to their personal wealth while also being aware of the inherent risks, and urges the chief financial officer and CEO to actively participate in these discussions.\nWhile valuations can be exposed to numerous external influences, he says a good plan should allow individual employees to benefit, regardless of the economic environment.\n\"To ensure all parties' interests align and risks are mitigated, execs should participate with industry specialists and management in designing these plans,\" Fitzalan advises. \"If an ESS [employee share scheme] is planned the right way, execs will only pay tax when shares are issued at a discount.\"\nValuations Given that an incorrect valuation can also have serious tax implications for any rights, options or unlisted shares issued under an employee share scheme, PwC's Fitzalan recommends the company obtains an independent market valuation.\n\"Issuing equity at $1, which could be worth $2 in the eyes of the tax commissioner, means that $2 needs to be included as assessable income. And for those on a higher tax rate, this could mean an extra $1 of tax,\" Fitzalan advises.\nIt's dangerous for executives within private companies to conclude that there should be no tax implications arising from the acquisition of the share options, on the pretext that directors have accurately determined what they believe to be the market value.\nIf an ATO audit is undertaken, the ATO may perform their own valuation on the share options and raise an assessment on the employee on the basis that the employee was issued the options at a discount at the time of grant, Fitzalan explains.\n\"In implementing any plan, we recommend an independent market valuation is obtained to ensure that any discount is calculated correctly … Start-up companies now have the choice to alternatively adopt one of the ATO's 'safe harbour valuation' methods – which may simplify the process,\" Fitzalan says.\nWhen designing an employee share scheme within private companies, he says thought also needs to be given to executives who are not yet able to sell their rights or shares, and consequently unable to fund the tax arising at that time.\nWhere the employees cannot access the start-up concessions but are able to access deferral under the employee share scheme provisions, the employees will be taxed in the seventh or 15th year post grant (depending on the time of issue) if a taxing point has not arisen earlier.\nA lesson in timing Previous volatility experienced by blue-chip stock Macquarie Group (MQG) highlights the massive difference between two executives who manage timing differently.\nIn a prior year, both executives received 10,000 restricted shares; when they vest on February 2, 2011, at a share price of $38.44, both are deemed to have received taxable income of $384,400, being the market value of 10,000 shares. At the highest marginal tax rate at the time (46.5 per cent), this equates to tax payable of $178,746.\nThe first executive immediately sells $178,746 of shares, holding the proceeds as cash until lodgment of his 2011 tax return. Based on the $38.44 share price, he has to sell 4650 shares to provision for tax, leaving him with 5350 shares which based on their price at July 17, 2015 was $446,779.\nBy comparison, the second executive does nothing until her tax return is due. The significant fall in Macquarie's share price – from $38.44 to $19.84 – when she goes to pay the same amount of tax ($178,746) on November 25, 2011, means she has to sell 9009 shares. Based on their price at July 17, 2015, her remaining 991 Macquarie shares are worth $82,727.\nOverall, the opportunity cost of mis-timing her employee entitlements has cost executive No.2 a whopping $364,051. This serves to remind executives of the need to provision for the corresponding tax when they are vested. It also highlights the risk of falsely assuming that blue-chip stocks aren't exposed to wide share price volatility.\nAdmittedly, had the Macquarie share price gone up, executive No.2 would have been rewarded for having waited, but this is an extremely high-risk strategy and not one any executive should realistically contemplate.\nCertainty of outcome Due to recent changes to the regulation of employee share schemes in Australia, employees who receive options on or after July 1, 2015, will now generally be taxed when they exercise those options, rather than paying tax up front which gives greater certainty regarding tax outcomes.\nFitzalan says there's now also greater incentive for executives to join start-ups – those with aggregated turnover of less than $50 million – given the additional concessions now available for incentives issued by start-ups.\nHe reminds start-ups that either an independent market valuation or one which adopts the ATO's \"safe harbour\" valuation methods are important.\nHowever, as with all such plans, valuation costs tend to be the most expensive part of establishing an employee share scheme. \"It was disappointing that value-shifting provisions can still tax founding shareholders, while executives are offered shares at a discount,\" he says.\nUnder the new tax rules, where an employee ceases employment but continues to hold options or shares – most likely due to being a good leaver – they will still be required to pay income tax at the time they cease employment, even though they may not have realised any value from those options or shares they continue to hold. However, the good news is that tax refunds may now be available for other employees.\nRead more of your favourite personal finance stories at www.afr.com/personal-finance", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:27:06.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
