Gracie and Pohlmann were hired in December by the Petrobras board to ensure that the investigation remained independent.\nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP said on Wednesday it had not discussed paying a fine with Petrobras regarding the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision or Department of Justice investigations.\n\"We know of no such discussions by any legal advisors with Petrobras,\" said Michael Diamant, a partner with the law firm, in a statement to Reuters.\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment on the Petrobras statement.\nIn November, the SEC sent a subpoena to Petrobras requesting information about the widening corruption investigations that have ensnared top company executives, major private contractors and senior politicians in Brazil. According to people familiar with the matter, the DOJ, which can bring criminal charges, is also investigating the company.\nPetrobras also said on Wednesday U.S. authorities had not made a decision about the merit of the investigation or eventual fines involved. Petrobras press officials declined to say how they knew about the U.S. government's thinking.
