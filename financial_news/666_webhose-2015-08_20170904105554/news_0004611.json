The British pound is 11.3% stronger against the Euro than it was this time last year. The eurozone is the UK's biggest trade partner. \nA strong pound makes UK exports more expensive so traditional economic theory would lead one to expect a reduction in UK exports. \nHowever, the government tax cuts to the oil and gas industry which were introduced amidst an environment of falling oil prices and rising costs seems to have bolstered overall goods exports, at least in the short term. \nThe overall impact of the Office for National Statistics most recent data means that Britain's trade deficit in goods alone widened to £9.2bn in June from £8.4bn in the prior month; economists had forecast it to rise to £9.3bn. \nThe total trade deficit including services widened to £1.6bn in June from £0.9bn in May. \nThe total deficit is offset by a surplus generated from the export of services such as legal and banking products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T16:58:55.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
