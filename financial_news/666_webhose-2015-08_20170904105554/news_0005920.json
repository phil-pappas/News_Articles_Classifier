It can take up to six months for a new well to begin pumping crude.\n\"Recent rig additions were most likely based on decisions taken when (U.S. crude prices) rallied in May-June, and more importantly when Calendar 2016 and 2017 pricing allowed for hedging at $65 a barrel,\" analysts at CIBC, a bank, said in a note this week, noting a number of producers have indicated that $65 is level where they would consider adding rigs.\n\"Both the spot price and hedging opportunity are long gone now though which makes us question the longevity of rig additions,\" CIBC said.\nU.S. crude oil prices were on track for a seventh straight weekly loss, the longest losing steak since January, on continued oversupply worries from mostly U.S. and OPEC producers and slumping demand from China and much of the rest of the world.\nThe last time oil prices collapsed, from around $107 a barrel in June 2014 to under $44 in January, energy firms slashed spending, cut thousands of jobs and idled around 60 percent of the record high 1,609 oil rigs that were active in October.\nProduction has started to show signs of decline. U.S. crude output dipped to 9.4 million barrels per day last week from 9.5 million bpd in the prior week, according to government data. That is down from average production from mid May to late June of 9.6 million bpd, the most since the early 1970s.
