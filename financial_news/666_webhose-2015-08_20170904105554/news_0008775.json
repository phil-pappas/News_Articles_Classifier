The average annual revenue for the sale of seismic data/component for the period 2010-2013 was US$15.6 million - a 300 percent increase when compared to annual seismic revenue generated for earlier periods, she indicated. \nPresident Sirleaf stressed that it was regrettable that, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2013, NOCAL's revenue for seismic data sale began a precipitous decline, during which total seismic revenue fell by 29 percent from the prior fiscal year and was compounded by the Ebola virus disease of 2014 that led to a reduction in investor interest across all economic sectors for the impacted West African region. \n\"There is no doubt that the current oil price collapse and other external factors, including our recent Ebola challenge contributed to the current financial crisis that the company is facing,\" she noted. \nThe Liberian leader said despite the obvious decline in revenue that began in late 2013, \"NOCAL continued hiring staff at an alarming rate with exorbitant benefits resulting in the current wage bill of over US$7 million per annum.\" \nShe, however, emphasized that the alarming situation at NOCAL prompted her action to instruct its board to take immediate action to ensure that the institution is restructured for organizational efficiency and effectiveness, and to ensure most prudent handling of the country's financial resources, taking into account the Board's Sustainability Action Plan.
