It will rebranded as Oaks Elan Darwin.\nCarlson Rezidor Hotel Group, one of the world's largest hotel groups, also announced at the HotelsWorld 2015 conference plans to increase its commitment to Australasia (Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific islands).\nKicking off its growth plans in Australia is the redesign of the flagship five-star Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel in Sydney. The first phase is the meeting and conference rooms, which are due to be unveiled in late August. This will be followed by the redesign of the 364 rooms.\nCarlson Rezidor Hotel Group, Asia Pacific, president Thorsten Kirschke said the expansion plans would include the Radisson Red brand, an art, design and high tech-inspired hotel.\n\"The tourism outlook is positive, especially in Australia where the forecast is for continued growth and where demand for rooms is projected to outstrip supply over the next three years,\" Mr Kirschke said.\n\"To better position ourselves to seize the opportunities, we are growing our team to include a dedicated Australasia hotel development function based in Sydney and also introducing our full portfolio of brands.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:15:23.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
