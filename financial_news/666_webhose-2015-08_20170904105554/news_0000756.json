The data come over a week after Beijing’s surprise move to devalue China’s currency.\nStock futures zigzagged, dropping sharply in Asian trading hours, recovering some in Europe, but then heading south again as New York began waking up. Futures for the S&P 500 index ESU5, -0.13% fell 3.8 points to 2,021.75, while those for the Dow industrials YMU5, -0.31% slid 72 points, or 0.4%, to 16,850. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 NQU5, -0.36% fell 18.25 points, or 0.4%, to 4,348.50.\nConcerns about a slowdown in global growth, largely centered on China, drove sharp losses for Wall Street on Thursday.

But others say any delay would worry investors, as it would signal the Fed is concerned about global deflationary pressures.\n“With the global growth outlook worsening and the dollar rising, a September hike could exacerbate declining risk appetite. Furthermore, recent developments may have modestly reduced the likelihood that U.S. core inflation will rise toward 2% in the medium term,” said economists at Credit Suisse in a note on Friday. They expect a December hike and say chances of a September increase by the Fed are now below 50%.\nCredit Suisse and others said investors should expect Beijing will respond to the weak manufacturing data with stimulus measures.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T14:48:24.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
