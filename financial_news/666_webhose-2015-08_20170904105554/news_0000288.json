For months, journalists, economists and traders waited in anticipation of what the Bank of England’s deluge of data, including its latest interest rate decision, the minutes of its August meeting and its quarterly healthcheck of the economy, might imply for interest rates in the coming years. \nOn Thursday they were rewarded for their wait with a 47-page healthcheck, accompanied by seven more documents presenting the finer details of the forecasts, including Governor Mark Carney’s third open letter to George Osborne , the Chancellor, explaining why inflation, which stood at zero in June, was so far away from the Bank’s 2pc target. \nWhile markets interpreted the report as “dovish”, with the pound falling against the euro and dollar, the report and Mr Carney were keen to hammer home the fact that the path of rate rises will be very data-dependent, with the recovery in wages, productivity, core inflation which strips out volatile price changes in energy and food and global risks all playing a central role. \nIn the end, there were three main messages: \n= Interest rates are not going up right now = \nThe strong pound, further falls in commodity prices and uncertainty about how the labour market is evolving gives policymakers more reason to wait in the short term. \nThe Bank kept interest rates at 0.5pc and its stock of asset purchases at £375bn. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ), is expected to remain at zero in July and August, and edge up to just 0.1pc in September. \nMr Carney described the near-term outlook for inflation as “muted”, adding: “It wouldn’t be surprising if we have another month or two of negative inflation given the very substantial moves in oil prices and the changes to utility prices as well.” \nFurther ahead, the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) expects CPI inflation to rise to around 0.5pc by December and 1pc in February. \nIn other words, while near-term inflation has been revised down, the Bank expects a quick snap-back as the impact of the dramatic fall in oil prices drops out of the data. \nMr Carney reminded everyone that it was the job of the MPC to get inflation to 2pc and keep it there. \nHe said: \nThis is not about inflation over the course in the next few months...but over the medium term. \nHe said it was the MPC’s job to act before the economy started to overheat as rate hikes take around 18-24 months to have an impact. \n[That way, households can] enjoy lower oil and petrol prices today without being worried about a payback in the medium term. \nThe rapid rise in the pound, which has risen by 20pc on a trade weighted basis since 2013 and 3.5pc since May, is also expected to push down on inflation for “some time to come”. \nHowever, the Bank said the pound’s rapid appreciation was likely to be offset by “positive effects on private demand from lower import prices”. \n= Dissent in the MPC ranks = \nJust one of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for a rate hike this month, leading to the first split vote this year. Economists had expected up to three MPC members to vote for tighter policy. \n\"Hawk\" Ian McCafferty, an external policymaker, felt \"on balance\" that the risks of the Bank overshooting its inflation target were now \"sufficiently to the upside to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate. \nWhile \"some members\" also saw \"upside risks to the inflation forecasts\", Andy Haldane, the Bank's chief economist, remains the MPC's dove, the minutes suggested. With inflation expected to remain close to zero over the next quarter, the minutes said: \nFor one member, the lower near-term outlook for CPI inflation meant that the risk of price and wage expectations falling further remained a significant consideration. \nThis dovecote's not for turning - for now at least. \n= Carney turning hawkish? = \nRate rises may not be imminent, but they haven't been kicked into the long grass either. \nMr Carney, whose comments were more hawkish than the 8-1 vote split may have suggested, insisted that the \"likely timing of the first Bank rate increase is drawing closer\" as he said speculation about the timing of any increase was \"understandable\" and \"another welcome sign of the economy returning to normal\". \nMr Carney said policymakers were never likely to be in a position where there were no headwinds facing the UK or global economy. \n\"Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) time we're in front of you there will be a lot of uncertainties, some of which we haven't predicted but that's not a justification for permanent statis,\" he said. \nThe Governor said in a speech in July that a decision on the first rate rise since 2007 would come into “sharper relief” around the turn of this year . He said on Thursday that this reflected his “personal view”, and that none of the MPC members could \"pre-commit to any future rate increase [at a specific] point in time\". \nWhile the MPC is unlikely to reveal the precise timing of interest rates rises, if Mr Carney is to be taken at his word, rates are going up, and perhaps slightly sooner than market expectations of the second quarter of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T03:12:26.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
