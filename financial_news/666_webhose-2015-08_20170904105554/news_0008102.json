The core year-on-year inflation rate is expected to print at 1.8 percent, unchanged from the prior month. However, US economic news-flow has increasingly tended to outperformed relative to consensus forecasts since mid-May, leaving the door open for an upside surprise . Meanwhile, the account of the Fed’s July sit-down may foreshadow a rate hike in September. The conspicuous absence of dissent from hawkish FOMC members last month hints that withholding tightening may have been a tactical rather than a qualitative decision. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg seem to favor “liftoff” in September while Fed Funds futures continue to price it in for October, meaning a move in July would have almost certainly triggered pandemonium. With that in mind, Fed officials may have acknowledged that the economy is ready for stimulus withdrawal but opted to wait for the sake of smoother normalization. Clues to that effect may help cement September as the consensus time frame and force investors to re-price expec tations baked into asset prices, boosting the US Dollar . It ma likewise weigh on risk appetite as traders consider the pivotal role of expansionary monetary policy in fueling the post-crisis recovery in financial markets , punishing sentiment-geared currencies like the Australian, Canadian and New Zealand Dollars while offering a lift to the Japanese Yen . Needless to say, a stronger CPI print would only encourage this process. New to FX? START HERE !
