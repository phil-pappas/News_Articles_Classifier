Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Agnes King Acquisitions delivered the overwhelming majority of growth at mid-marketing accounting firms in the 12 months to June 30, and the year ahead is expected to dish up more of the same.\nFinancial services giant Findex , William Buck, and PKF were the standout performers in the group.\nFindex's sales rose 21 per cent, to $479 million, largely because of its $200 million takeover of accounting group Crowe Horwath. Chief executive Spiro Paule has flagged more acquisitions in the year ahead.\nWilliam Buck's aggregate fees surged 16 per cent to $91 million in fiscal 2014-15 through a combination of M&A in Sydney and Adelaide, plus a spike in tax, business advisory and wealth management work.\nPKF posted income of $97 million in the same period, a 14 per cent increase, thanks to a series of mergers in Western Australia and Brisbane.\nWhat has delivered growth for accounting firms has also delivered growth for their clients.\n\"Clever clients have sacrificed turnover for profit, honed their focus, and bought out competitors to own that part of the market,\" William Buck chairman Nikolas Hatzistergos said.\nOnly exceptions Grant Thornton and Nexia were the only upper-mid-market accounting firms whose revenue contracted in fiscal 2014-15.\nGrant Thornton's slippage was minor, down 1.7 per cent, to $221.8 million. New chief executive Greg Keith said the dip was because of the sale of its business processing division in October 2014. He expected it to be offset in the current year by the digital solutions business Grant Thornton acquired on July 1.\n\"Had we not sold the business [we] would have seen a slight increase in revenue,\" Mr Keith said.\nHe flagged further acquisitions in the technology space as the global accounting profession shifts from a people-focused business to one that leverages international networks and automation.\nNexia's slippage was more dramatic, with sales declining by 4.5 per cent to $86.3 million across the network. That slump could continue, given the recent loss of Nexia's $20 million Melbourne firm to rival Moore Stephens, unless Nexia can pull off a swift rebuild of its national network.\nIn generating organic growth, RSM Bird Cameron, HLB Mann Judd and BDO were the standout performers.\nPush to agriculture Sales at RSM rose 8 per cent, to $162 million, driven by foreign investors and old-money clients taking an interest in the agriculture sector.\n\"Old wealth and foreign investors are pushing towards agri,\" RSM chief executive Kim Hutchinson said.\n\"But there's a lot of passive money sitting around waiting for something to do,\" he said.\nHLB's aggregate sales rose 4 per cent, to $97 million for the 12 months to June 30, 2015, with corporate advisory work responsible for the bulk of this increase. Tax structuring has been particularly lucrative, a theme that also came through in BDO's results.\nBDO's revenue lifted 6 per cent to $252 million for the 2014-15 financial year.\n\"Clients are consolidating, specialising and focusing their business to preserve profitability,\" BDO chairman Helen Argiris said.\nBDO's new services lines, such as forensic, also boosted its result.\nWhile HLB made no acquisitions in the 2014-15 financial year, Australasian chairman Tony Filter said purchases made in previous years began to pay dividends during the period.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Agi_King"], "published": "2015-08-04T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:42:20.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
