A rate hike for May was fully priced in by the market. \n\"I don't think the market's really re-assessed its view in terms of the timing of the first interest rate move, it's longer dated bonds that have felt the pressure of today's price action,\" said Peck. \nTen-year British bond yields hit the day's high at 1.89 percent, widening the spread versus equivalent German bonds to 124.4 basis points - its highest in two weeks. \nThe 10-year yield was last up 6 basis points on the day at 1.88 percent. \nSept long gilt future 117.50 (-0.42) \nSept 2015 short sterling 99.39 (-0.01) \nMarch 2016 short sterling 99.19 (-0.02) \n10-year yield 1.88 pct (+6 bps) \nKEY MARKET DATA Long Gilt futures Gilt benchmark chain Short Stg futures Cash market quotes Deposit rates Sterling cross rates UK debt speedguide KEY MARKET REPORTS Gilts Sterling Euro Debt Dollar U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .
