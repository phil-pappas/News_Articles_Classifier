It was received from the lower house with no changes, so it will go to Rousseff to be signed into law without delay.\nThe vote puts an end to months of heated debate over the final major piece of legislation in Rousseff's fiscal austerity plan aimed at saving Brazil's threatened investment grade credit rating.
