Peter Braig by Ewin Hannan Mark Ludlow Misa Han Hundreds of unionists in Sydney and Brisbane are pursuing picket lines in support of 97 Hutchison Ports employees sacked by text and email, despite the Fair Work Commission ordering the maritime union cease industrial action.\nUp to 300 protesters at Port Botany in Sydney and 100 union members in Brisbane picketed outside the company's terminals on Tuesday.\nHutchison, in a brief statement, called on the workers and the Maritime Union of Australia to abide by a commission orders on Monday night to cease industrial action.\nBut the union's national secretary, Paddy Crumlin​, said while the union was participating in protests, the MUA was not involved in organising the picket.\nUp to 300 protesters at Port Botany in Sydney and 100 union members in Brisbane picketed outside the company's terminals on Tuesday. Robert Shakespeare Mr Crumlin said he did not believe anyone had ownership of the picket lines.\n\"That's sort of an outpouring of frustration and a response from the community and other unions and many other groups,\" he told ABC's AM program\n\"We're part of it. I mean we've gone out there and said, 'you know, this is outrageous', and people have been down there saying, 'this is not good enough'.\"\nLiberal Senator Mitch Fifield, speaking on behalf of Employment Minister Eric Abetz, told the Senate on Tuesday that it was regrettable that the company has sacked workers via text message and email.\n Hutchison called on the workers to abide by orders to cease industrial action. Robert Shakespeare \"Even when a workforce anticipates that redundancies are likely, as it appears may have occurred in this case, it is still a difficult time for workers and their families when they are told that they are going to be made redundant,\" he said.\n\"It is regrettable that the method of communicating with workers has not helped this already difficult situation.\"\nThe statement was the first time the government has questioned the company's tactics, but the Coalition denied shifting position in the face of criticism from Labor and unions.\nMichael Tubbs​, president of CFMEU Retired Members Association, has been camping out at Port Botany for five days. He said the way in which Hutchison handled the redundancies has been heartless.\n\"It's a new form of corporate industrial relations but not human relations. Sending you a text [to notify termination of employment] shows contempt for the human being. The whole situation's gotta change.\n\"It's become a relation between human being and corporate administration. Human beings are not going to be treated this way.\"\nA show of support Barry Hemsworth, another CFMEU Retired Members Association and retired construction worker who has been a union member for over 40 years: \"We belonged to a union all our lives and for these guys here it would be their first strike. We're here to show support.\"\nHe said the members planned to be at the picket line for a while. \"We'll be here til the next election.\"\nBrisbane worker Hannah Matthewson said she was shocked by the abrupt sacking last Thursday, saying she thought there would be more negotiation with management about redundancies.\nMs Matthewson, who worked at Hutchinson for almost two years, said her father and sister who work for the port operator in Sydney were also sacked by text.\n\"We did know there was going to be down-sizing, but we thought it was going to be a longer process,\" Ms Matthewson said.\n\"We thought we were going to be be getting interviews like they promised us. We thought they were going to start negotiations with the unions like they promised us. I found the whole thing rather cowardly and un-Australian.\"\nMaritime Union of Australia assistant branch secretary Paul Gallagher said workers across the country were keeping a close eye on this dispute.\n\"It's about time we stood up for job security. This is not way to treat workers and workers across the country are going to see this and they are not going to be impressed,\" he said.\n\"My feeling is if we don't fight this they would come around for round two [of redundancies].\"\nHe said Hutchison were attempting to break the unionised workforce and replace them with cheaper casual labour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:07:03.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
