An outage at a key provider of data to the asset-management industry has prevented dozens of U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds from accurately pricing securities, undermining a crucial component of the trading of the funds for investors.\nBank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, +4.47% , which acts as an administrator for asset management firms, said it was having problems with a SunGard Data Systems Inc. system that “has impacted a limited number of fund accounting clients and the processing of net asset values of certain mutual funds and ETFs,” a spokesman said in a statement Wednesday.\n“The SunGard system became available with limited capacity late Tuesday. Our teams have been working together to clear the backlog and we are working with SunGard to resume normal processing as soon as possible,” the bank said.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/securities-pricing-problems-hit-u-s-mutual-funds-etfs-1440601913?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T13:53:56.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
