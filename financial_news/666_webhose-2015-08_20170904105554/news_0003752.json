Mr Tunc accused the bank of not honouring a $544,900 guarantee it issued to his business partner Abdullwalli Shariff in a share sale. \nIn an affidavit filed in court the Central Bank said the winding up petition was unnecessary because it had taken adequate remedial action. \nLiquidating the company it said would send a wrong signal to the industry and prejudice the interests of depositors, shareholders and other creditors. \nHowever, CBK warned that Dubai Bank was living on borrowed time. \n\"The CBK has issued Dubai Bank with various remedial measures it has been directed to take. If these measures do not yield the expected results, the bank will be placed under statutory management,\" the CBK, says in court filings. \nThat has come to pass, but having survived similar threats over the last couple of years what changed? \nThat its placement under receivership has come slightly more than one month after new Central Bank governor Dr Patrick Njoroge reported to office speaks volumes. \nFor years, the market has been awash with tales of the bank's main shareholder Hassan Zubeidi's clout in high places not just at the regulator and its fraud investigations department but also in the political establishment. \nKeen ears in high places, it was whispered were behind the bank being given more chances than the proverbial nine lives of a cat to inject money into the business and run a less controversial operation. \nAudit by the Central Bank consistently found that the bank had been inflating its liquidity ratio, which is the balance between a bank's saleable assets and its liabilities. \nInternally put at 21.4 per cent in March, the audit found it was actually 9.6 per cent; less than half the 20 per cent required of Kenyan banks. An inspection in May also found that Dubai Bank had understated provisions for bad debt in order to put a gloss on its actual profitability. \nWhile ordering the bank to make adequate provisions, Central Bank also penalized the lender for failure to consistently maintain the daily minimum cash ratio, a non interest earning contingency, of six per cent held at the CBK. \nIn the end, failure to pay a cash reserve ratio penalty of Sh5.4 million ($54,000) proved too much for the regulator to take. Informing the decision was the low market share of Dubai Bank which obviated fears of the action setting off systemic risks that would stalk the financial sector. \nBy market share the bank controls only 0.01 per cent of the financial sector. It had lend Sh4.3 billion ($43 million), Sh2.3 billion ($23 million) of it considered dud, and had Sh1.7 billion ($17 million) in deposits, according to the Central Bank's annual report for 2013. It had only 7,000 depositors, being Kenya's second smallest bank, with assets of $34.4 million, and a capitalisation of $10 million. \nThe bank, however, carried a reputation risk on the entire financial sector especially after 2013 when the former managing director Nerea Said took the management to court over wrongful dismissal. She alleged in a case that is still ongoing that weak governance structures condoned by Mr Zubeidi exposed the bank to fraud and other unmitigated risks. \nIn some instances, she alleged the bank lent up to 45 per cent of its core capital to one borrower, against a Central Bank of Kenya ceiling of 25 per cent. \nThe bank's frequent run-ins with businessmen of dubious moral standing also raised suspicions of the management's and owners core values. Dubai Bank (K), the former Bank of Oman and later Mashreq Bank, has had a chequered history since it was established in 1982. \nIts acquisition by the present owners in 2000 saw the bank in the public limelight for the wrong reasons culminating in its receivership. \nAs history from the cyclic collapse of financial institutions in 1986, 1993, and around the turn of the century shows, few enterprises rise from the ashes and we may have seen the last of Dubai Bank. \nVital, however, are the lessons learnt that a regulator can play no-see-no-hear for so long and that only playing by the rules can ascertain a business of continuity.
