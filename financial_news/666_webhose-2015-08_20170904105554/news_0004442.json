The order would extend to victims of domestic violence or workers who needed counseling and sick leave that wasn't taken could also be accrued over the years. Newly Minted Planet Fitness Isn't a Meat Market, and That's a Good Thing \nThe president has been pushing for paid sick-leave expansion since January, but has faced opposition from Republican-controlled Congress. \nThe White House announced at the start of the year that more than 40 million private-sector workers have no kind of paid sick leave option to fall back on. \nObama has put his executive order privilege to work over the recent years when faced with push back from Congress and has applied many of his desired policies to federal contractors. These have included orders for an increased minimum wage, expansions to overtime pay eligibility and protection from workplace discrimination for gay and transgender workers. \nBloomberg News reported that a draft of the order declares that: \"Providing access to paid sick leave will improve the health and performance of employees of federal contractors and bring benefits packages at federal contractors in line with leading firms, ensuring they remain competitive employers in the search for dedicated and talented employees.\" \nThough the order could not be enacted nationwide, it would still affect hundreds of thousands of workers who do business with the government. \nA Labor Department spokesperson announced that although no decisions have yet been made, that the government is exploring ways to expand sick-leave access. \nThe White House has declined to comment on any plans for the executive order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:57:42.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
