Instead of staying at her desk, as her boss had ordered, she fled from the building and into the street with fellow survivors.\nA stranger pulled her into a building lobby just as the north tower collapsed — and it was then that a photographer captured her terrified face in the photo that has since been seen around the world.\nBorders’ life spiraled downward in the years ­after the attacks, as she battled severe depression and became addicted to crack cocaine.\n“I didn’t do a day’s work in nearly 10 years and by 2011 I was a complete mess,” she told The Post in 2011. ­“Every time I saw an aircraft, I panicked.”\nBorders lost custody of her two kids and checked into rehab in April 2011. She got sober and eventually ­regained custody.\nIn a November interview with The Jersey Journal, she revealed she’d recently been diagnosed with stomach cancer and was scheduled to have surgery in December, followed by radiation and chemotherapy.\nWith the trade center ever on her mind, Borders wondered if her illness could be related to what she endured on September 11.\n“I’m saying to myself, ‘Did this thing ignite cancer cells in me?’ ” she told the newspaper.\n“I definitely believe it ­because I haven’t had any illnesses. I don’t have high blood pressure . . . high cholesterol, diabetes.”\nThis article first appeared on NYPost.com\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/08/25/911-dust-lady-succumbs-to-cancer/?link=mktw"], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T16:17:27.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
