I think the market will largely be looking towards December as the most likely date if a rate hike happens this year.\" \nIn currency markets, the dollar gained and dealers sold the yen -- seen as a safe haven during times of market turmoil -- as risk aversion eased. \nIn Tokyo trading, the dollar bought 119.97 yen after crossing the 120 yen mark in earlier trading, and was nearly flat against 119.98 yen in New York. \nThis week it touched a six-month low of 116.18 yen. \nThe euro was stronger at 136.14 from 135.72 yen. The 19-nation euro fetched $1.1348, up from $1.1312 in US trade. \nGold (Other OTC: GDCWF - news ) , also seen as a safe haven when markets are going haywire, traded at $1,127.42, down from $1,131.80 late Wednesday. \nOil rose in Asia as dealers digested a mixed US energy (NasdaqCM: USEG - news ) report showing a dip in crude inventories, but barely any decline in production despite sinking prices. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 87 cents to $39.47 while Brent crude for October rose $1.01 to $44.15 in afternoon trade. \nIn other markets: \n-- Taipei rose 1.41 percent, or 108.96 points, to 7,824.55. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co added 1.22 percent to Tw$124.0 while Hon Hai Precision Industry closed 1.32 percent higher at Tw$84.6. \n-- Wellington closed up 1.02 percent, or 57.17 points, at 5,634.95. \nSpark rose 3.37 percent to NZ$3.225 and Warehouse Group lifted 0.78 percent to NZ$2.60. \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this report --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T10:30:23.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
