Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Simon Evans There's a shrinking set of ASX \"winners\" everyone is chasing.\nThe problem is when the hordes are all hunting for the same sure-fire bet among solid, defensive companies able to steer through tough economic times, their prices go higher as people apply the same, sensible investment logic to the well-loved sectors of healthcare, utilities and infrastructure.\nIs it now time to say a partial goodbye to some of the sharemarket darlings like blood products maker CSL, private hospital operator Ramsay Health Care and Telstra? Or is it sacrilege as the ASX200 hits a seven-month low and the big market swings up and down of 80 or 90 points each day become more common?\nThe chase for defensive winners meant the multiples went higher and higher on good-quality individual stocks, and the gap between those perceived to be in the \"good\" basket and the \"bad\" widened substantially.\nMacquarie Equities strategists led by Jason Todd says the valuation gap has opened up considerably in the past few quarters as investors stepped up the chase for the shrinking pool of winners. The top dogs are now way ahead of the mediocre on a relative basis and the gulf hasn't been this wide since 2002.\nDividend payouts also play a role in the decisions made by investors, but Macquarie believes there will now be an increasingly closer examination of just how much higher some of the blue-chip stocks that have been a staple of many portfolios may go, because they are trading on such lofty multiples.\nThey're saying it may be time to take some money out of the \"market darlings\". That doesn't mean sell the lot, but instead take some profits. They're recommending taking a bit off the table in CSL, Ramsay Health Care, Telstra, building products group James Hardie and packaging group Amcor.\nShare prices in most of that group have come off already in the latest round of souring sentiment on the ASX, but over the past 12 months Ramsay Health Care has gone from $48 to around $63, while Telstra has moved from $5.40 to around $6.24.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The reason for caution around the market darlings at a very broad level revolves around the notion the Australian sharemarket is in its final stages of what has been a four-year bull market run, and there's not much gas left.\nThere's only so far cost-cutting by chief executives can go, and there needs to be a significant lift in revenues and profits from higher demand from customers, not through razor gangs keeping profits up.\nThe capital raisings from big banks means they're under pressure now , but Macquarie says if the Reserve Bank cuts rates again that will be a catalyst for something of a revival among them.\nMacquarie also says history is unforgiving. The broader market currently trades on a one-year forward looking price-earnings ratio of 15.2 times, and only five times in the past 25 years has it traded above 16 to 17 times, for a very short time.\nSo where to now?\nAs the Australian dollar falls more sharply, investors have increasingly been piling in to the \"offshore earners\" and offshore \"growers\" - those companies perceived to deliver an extra earnings kick from having operations in the United States or generating wider benefits when the Australia currency falls 21 per cent over the past year, as it has done from US$0.93 to around US$0.73.\nChemicals and explosives maker Incitec Pivot and London-based funds manager Henderson Group are Macquarie's \"buy\" picks to take advantage of the falling dollar as a good hedge, with those firms also having the ability to provide further upside.\nAnd heaven forbid, it seems counter-intuitive as China gets the economic wobbles from its previous super high-growth status, and commodity prices have tumbled sharply, but Macquarie points to BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto as being \"buys\" because earnings expectations have dropped back to GFC levels, the prospect of policy support in China, and the overall \"risk-reward\" in buying in being more appealing now.\nShares in BHP Billiton, led by chief executive Andrew Mackenzie, plunged 4.3 per cent on Wednesday and are now at $25.20, approaching the low point during the depths of the GFC in 2008 when financial markets seized up.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/103351169357344338991", "https://twitter.com/SimonMEvans"], "published": "2015-08-13T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T10:08:53.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
