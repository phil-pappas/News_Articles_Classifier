After all, who doesnâ€™t want to find stocks that have low PEs, solid outlooks, and decent dividends? \nFortunately for investors looking for this combination, we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value; Valero Energy Corporation (VLO). \nValero Energy in Focus \nVLO may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 8.2, its P/S ratio of 0.3, and its decent dividend yield of 2.47%. These factors suggest that Valero Energy is a pretty good value pick, as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings, and that VLO has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings. \nBut before you think that Valero Energy is just a pure value play, it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well. For current year earnings, the consensus has gone up by 10.2% in the past 30 days, thanks to 9 upward revision in the past one month compared to no lower revision. \nThis estimate strength is actually enough to push VLO to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting it is poised to outperform. So really, Valero Energy is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20, a P/S ratio below one, and a strong Zacks Rank, meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
