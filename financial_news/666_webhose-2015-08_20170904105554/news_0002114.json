Or so go the warnings. \nIt is true that any increase in the Bank of England's leading Bank Rate will be momentous, when it comes, if only because the rate has remained at its historic low of 0.5pc for six long years. But do borrowers really need to race for a fixed-rate mortgage as if it's a Boxing Day sale with reduced stock down to the last few items? \nNo, they don't. In fact, as we outline below, there are several excellent reasons why you should not be in a hurry to fix the cost of your borrowing. \n= 1. Not all fixed rates are currently rising - and some lenders may cut theirs further = \nThe cost of fixed-rate mortgages has fallen consistently for several years. \nThe average two-year fixed rate was 3.67pc in June 2010, according to the Bank of England. In June 2014 it was 2.6pc, and in June this year - the latest month for which the Bank has published data - it dropped to its lowest-ever 1.83pc. \nAbout a month ago, however, just as there was increased speculation about Bank Rate rises, some lenders did withdraw and re-price certain fixed-rate loans . \n• What next for interest rates? Latest predictions \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) and Santander were among the banks pushing up the cost of some deals, with Barclays, for example, increasing the rate on its five-year fix from 2.39pc to 2.59pc. \nBut other lenders continue to cut. Hugh Wade-Jones, of mortgage broker Enness Private Clients, said: \"Banks remain very keen to lend. \nSome rates may be fractionally up, but where one lender withdraws another best-buy usually replaces it. You have several lenders whose rates are much lower than they were six months ago, even though the talk is of rate rises.\" \n= 2. Rate rises might not materialise at all = \nSource: Resolution Foundation \nCan we really trust the \"experts\" who predict an imminent rise in the Bank of England's leading Bank Rate? The graph, above, shows just how wrong economists and those who trade in capital markets have been in their previous predictions of the course of interest rates. \nEach coloured line shows the path the Bank Rate was predicted to take, with the date the prediction was made. The black line, in contrast, traces the actual movements of the Bank Rate. \nIn May 2010, for example, market experts forecast the Bank Rate would rise to over 3pc by 2013. But, as we know, when 2013 came along, the Bank Rate stubbornly remained - as it had been since March 2009 - at 0.5pc. \nDespite being proved wrong, the \"experts\" continued to incorrectly anticipate increases in the Bank Rate. The latest forecast puts the Bank Rate at around 1.5pc in 2018. Will that come to pass? \n= 3. Not all 'variable' rates rise just because Bank Rate rises = \nAbout two in three borrowers have a \"variable rate\" mortgage, which means their rate, and hence their monthly repayments, can rise at any time. \nSome of these variable rates are \"trackers\", which means they track the Bank Rate: if it rises, they will rise, too, by the same fraction of a percentage point. \nOther variable rates, sometimes called \"standard variable rates\" or \"follow-on\" rates, do not track Bank Rate but change at the lenders' discretion. In the past, these have tended to more-or-less follow the Bank Rate, although they may move by more or less than the Bank Rate. \nIf you have a tracker rate, the amount you pay may remain extremely competitive, even if the Bank Rate does rise. \nIf you have a \"standard variable rate\", you could probably do better by switching to another mortgage - but this doesn't have to be a fixed rate. \n= 4. The price you pay to fix your rate may be too high = \nIf you fix your mortgage rate, you are passing on to your lender the risk of any future increase in the cost of borrowing. You pay a price for that - but is it a reasonable one? \nAt the moment, market-leading fixed rates include a two-year deal from the Post Office at 1.65pc and a five-year deal from NatWest at 2.23pc. \nBest-buy variable rates are far lower, including discounted twoyear deals starting at under 1pc (from Furness Building Society, for example). Upfront fees can cloud some of the comparisons, but Mr Wade-Jones said: \"You have to really think rates are going to move to see benefit in any short-term fixed rates.\" This is especially true for those borrowing large loans relative to their home's value, he said. \n= 5. You've got a great historic 'tracker' rate = \nIt's rare in the world of personal finance that you can't get a better deal by switching, but here's one case. If you have a tracker mortgage, your rate will rise if the Bank Rate goes up (as mentioned above). But if you took out your tracker before the financial crisis, particularly in the years 2005 and 2006, you may have a deal that is too good to lose. \n\"There were some incredible tracker mortgages offered,\" recalls mortgage analyst Pete Gettins of broker London & Country. \"Some actually tracked below the Bank Rate for several years - such as Bank Rate minus 0.25 percentage points.\" \nOthers were \"lifetime\" mortgages, offering mouth-watering rates over an indefinite period. One example cited by Mr Gettins was a tracker mortgage from Cheltenham & Gloucester, which promised to charge borrowers Bank Rate plus 0.17pc for the life of the loan. \nSo at today's Bank Rate of 0.5pc, those lucky borrowers pay just 0.67pc. If inflation went sky-high and the Bank Rate shot up to an unthinkable 5pc, these borrowers would pay 5.17pc. \nDitching such an advantageous deal would be a big decision. \n= So when SHOULD you consider fixing your mortgage rate? = \nRather than trying to predict where interest rates are heading, make a decision based on the risks you can afford to take. \nIf you're budgeting carefully and can't accommodate an increase in regular outgoings, then consider taking out a fixed-rate deal. With your mortgage costs guaranteed at a set level every month, you're then free to allocate spending elsewhere. \nBut taking on fixed-rate mortgages can limit your flexibility. \"Long-term fixes of five or more years tie you in to your lender,\" warned Mr Wade-Jones. \"If you need to borrow more, for example, you'll have to go to your provider. And again if you want to move home, you'll be beholden to your existing lender to let you take the loan with you.\" \nFor buy-to-let investors, fixed rates are possibly more attractive. Because landlords often intend to hold the same property for many years, it can help to fix the cost of finance over a longer period in order to generate steady returns. \n• Best fixed-rate mortgages: two, three, five and ten years (Other OTC: UBGXF - news )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:50:58.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
