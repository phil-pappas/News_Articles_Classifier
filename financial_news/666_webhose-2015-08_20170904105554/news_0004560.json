The regime change agenda is evident in the way ZCTU has approached the ongoing labour crisis. \nInstead of joining hands with Government in urging employers to exercise restraint while the Labour Act is being reviewed, ZCTU has announced plans to embark on demonstrations against the Supreme Court ruling and Government! That stance is not only surprising, but stupid for a number of reasons chief among them ZCTU's failure to understand that the Supreme Court just interpreted the law, they did not make it. \nIf ZCTU was a bona fide labour movement not an appendage of the MDC, it would have picked the loopholes in the Labour Act and agitated for its reform. \nSecondly, ZCTU was also complicit in authoring the ongoing labour crisis. \nWe should never be ahistoric in understanding the prevailing economic problems that were spawned by the MDC-T/ZCTU alliance's call for and support for the West's ruinous sanctions regime that contracted the economy by a factor of over 40 percent in addition to costing the country over $42 billion in lost revenue since the turn of the millennium. Sanctions, which the ZCTU/MDC alliance abetted with ruinous job stayaways-cum-lockouts in collusion with some reactionary employers. \nThirdly, Government has not sent any workers home as the welfare of Government employees falls under the purview of the Public Service Act. \nThus the ZCTU, if it was sincere, would see Government as a partner and direct its protests at the private sector that has sent many of the ZCTU's own constituency home. This is not the time for cheap politicking, livelihoods are at stake. \nWe hope workers will rescue their union from wannabe politicians.
