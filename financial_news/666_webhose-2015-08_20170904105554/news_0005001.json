The miner’s cash and available credit is declining toward the $550 million minimum mandated by its loan covenants.\nThe company, which last posted net income in 2011, is among a slew of U.S. coal miners that are struggling amid a plunge in prices. Alpha Natural Resources Inc., Walter Energy Inc., Patriot Coal Corp. and James River Coal Co. have filed for bankruptcy during the past 16 months after the price of coal used in steelmaking dropped 67 percent since 2011.\n“It buys them time,” said Spencer Cutter, a credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The debt exchange cuts their total leverage, the amount of interest and removes the strict covenant.”\nInvestors claiming to hold a majority of the term loan directed Bank of America Corp., the agent for the debt, not to grant approval for the company’s proposal to swap as much as $2.38 billion of borrowings for new obligations. The objection was based on the belief that the plan would result in the issuance of $404 million of new loans, diluting existing lenders’ claims on the company’s assets, three people with knowledge of the matter said last month.\nRefashioned Loan Arch said in a July 29 statement that approval by the holders of the term loan wasn’t required.\nBill Halldin, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment. Logan Bonacorsi, a spokeswoman for St. Louis-based Arch Coal, didn’t respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.\nArch plans to use the debt exchange to refashion the $250 million revolving loan in a way the lenders oppose. Lenders including Oaktree Capital Group LLC, Archview Investment Group and Caspian Capital sent a letter dated July 17 to Bank of America that contended the new credit isn’t revolving because it can’t be re-borrowed once it’s funded, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\nAlyssa Linn, a spokeswoman for Oaktree at Sard Verbinnen & Co., and Peter Carey, a spokesman at Archview, declined to comment. Mina Kim, a spokeswoman for Caspian, didn’t return messages seeking comment.\n‘In Limbo’ The new loans replacing the revolver would instead count as regular borrowing subject to maximum debt limits spelled out in the term-loan agreement with Arch. Under those rules, “it appears to us that their issuance is a breach” of the loan agreement and are “impermissible,” according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg.\nBank of America resigned as agent at the end of July, two other people with knowledge of the matter said, removing itself from a potential feud between the holders of the term loan and lower-ranking creditors. The resignation takes effect on Sept. 1, they said.\n“The resignation put the deal in limbo until they can find a new agent,” Cutter said.\nArch, which announced the exchanges on July 2, is trying to manage $5.1 billion of borrowings while attempting to ride out the slump in coal prices. The swaps would reduce its total debt by about 30 percent and ease an interest burden that amounts to almost $400 million a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nCoal Demand “The biggest thing about the debt exchange is Arch Coal will be able to avoid breaching the terms that will cause the credit line to be terminated,” said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Cutter. “They’re getting closer and closer to breaching it.”\nCoal prices have been under pressure since natural gas began dropping in 2008 as a result of oversupply. Both are used to power electricity generation. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, released Monday, threatens to further erode demand for coal.\n“The industry is in store for at least one to two years of tough times because the demand will remain pressured by natural gas and regulatory issues,” said Ted O’Brien, chief executive officer at Doyle Trading Consultants LLC, a coal-industry research firm in New York. “Even the lower-cost producers have been impacted.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:38:12.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
