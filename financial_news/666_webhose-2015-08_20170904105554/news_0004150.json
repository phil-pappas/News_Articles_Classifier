It's not illegal but it's completely immoral.\" \nOne company was responsible for an $11 billion transfer from Australia to Singapore in one year, Mr Ward said. \nA Senate inquiry into tax avoidance is expected to table its first report in the parliament on Monday. \nIt's understood the report will make more than a dozen recommendations, including that the Australian Tax Office be forced to disclose all avoidance settlements above a certain level, and that a name-and-shame register be created. \nLabor Senator Sam Dastyari, who chaired the inquiry, said the system was \"completely broken\" and privacy provisions were allowing Australia's worst offenders to hide. \nHe said corporates were essentially selling products to themselves, through companies set up in Singapore, to keep their profits down. \n\"When you have a handful of multinational companies able to take Australian taxpayers for a ride, the system has to change,\" Senator Dastyari said. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Firms avoided $31b tax in Aust in a year AAP \nMultinationals trading in Australia funnelled more than $30 billion to Singapore in one year to avoid tax, an investigator â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-16T16:42:23.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
