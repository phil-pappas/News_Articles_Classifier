But the notion that we can just sort of diss the deal and unilaterally walk away as Congress wants to do will have a profound negative impact on people's sense of American leadership and reliability.\"\nKerry appeared to acknowledge that the tone of the Iran debate had taken on a political edge.\nPresident Barack Obama last week accused critics of the deal of making common cause with Iranian hardliners who chant \"Death to America\" and said some had beaten the drum for the Iraq war.\n\"You can squabble maybe with the choice of words,\" Kerry said, when asked about Obama's comments. He stressed his view that the Iran deal should be argued on its merits. \"I think the merits are very, very strong and I think the president does too,\" he said.\nThe agreement gives Tehran some relief from economic sanctions in return for strict limits on a nuclear program that the West has suspected was aimed at creating a nuclear bomb.\nTehran has long denied seeking a nuclear weapon and has insisted on the right to nuclear technology for peaceful means. Obama has never ruled out military force if negotiations failed, and has said that he and future presidents would still have that option if Iran quit the agreement.
