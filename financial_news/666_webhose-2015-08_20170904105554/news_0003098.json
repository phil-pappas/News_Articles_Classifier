The spot market opened at 6.3990 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.3996 in the morning.\nThe Chinese central bank set its rate nearly 2 percent lower on Tuesday, a move it said was aimed at making its foreign exchange system more responsive to market forces.\n\"While assuring a more market-based formation of the daily fixing, the Chinese authorities might have to choose between two possible scenarios,\" Citi analyst Minggao Shen wrote in a note. \"Limited RMB weakness in coming months with calculated interventions or tolerating more depreciation by intervening less. The spot market movement since late yesterday suggests the former is more likely.\"\nThe PBOC reassured investors on Thursday, saying there was no reason for the yuan to fall further given the country's strong economic fundamentals, helping to calm investors who pared holdings of risk assets for fear of a currency war.\nThe dollar was steady against its Japanese counterpart at 124.42, off its two-month high of 125.28 hit on Tuesday. The euro was little changed at $1.1144, having gained 1.6 percent this week.\nThe dollar came under pressure this week as the market instability caused by China's devaluation curbed expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve's long-awaited interest rate increase would come as early as in its Sept. 16-17 meeting.\nBut strong U.S. retail sales data on Thursday provided evidence in support of views that the Fed is on track to hike.\nU.S. retail sales rose in July and were revised up for June, while the trend of weekly jobless claims pointed to a tightening job market.\nIn commodities trading, crude oil futures extended sharp losses that pushed oil prices to levels not seen since early 2009, when the financial crisis was wreaking havoc on markets.\nU.S. crude settled down 3 percent at a new 6-1/2-year low as a big rise in U.S. stockpiles intensified worries over a growing global glut.\nU.S. crude oil was down 0.4 percent at $42.07 a barrel in early Asia trade, while Brent rose 0.06 percent to $49.25, after earlier falling to a low of $49.11, ahead of Friday's expiry of its front-month contract.
