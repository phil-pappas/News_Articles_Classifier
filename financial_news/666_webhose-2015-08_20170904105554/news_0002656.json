That agreement covered only the Australian free-to-air rights and the NRL hopes to yield around $1.7 billion in total.\nSources said the AFL would likely extract a similar amount from its eventual broadcast partners.\nSeven West Media and pay-TV monopoly Foxtel hold the rights but Ten Network Holdings is also pushing hard for a game, while Nine has not ruled itself out of the race.\nOne scenario being talked about is that Seven may end up with three games a week, which would include the best matches of the round, while Foxtel would grab five games and Ten would nab one.\nBut Seven may be reluctant to drop a game from its current four-games-a-week arrangement.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:08:27.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
