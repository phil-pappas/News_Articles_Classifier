Peter Braig Share on twitter by Misa Han The private sector should target students if they want more Indigenous employees on board, a student who has found a banking internship says.\nEli Bates, an Indigenous student from Anaiwan with a second-year marketing degree at Macquarie University, is working one or two days a week at Westpac through a paid, targeted-internship program.\nWhen he finishes university, Bates hopes to work for Westpac full-time in a marketing role but he acknowledges working for Westpac has meant a big transition.\n\"I was working as a pizza delivery boy which is a big step down from working at Westpac in a suit. It is just so different to everything I've done,\" he says.\nHe is one of nearly 1000 indigenous students who are working in the corporate sector through the CareerTrackers program which has 86 corporate partners, including the big four banks, Telstra and top-tier law firms.\nBates says corporations could best tackle under-representation of Indigenous employees by targeting university students.\n\"It's about getting them involved as early as possible, getting them while they're at uni and giving them support. I never planned to be working at a bank,\" he says.\nHe also hopes if more Indigenous kids go to university there will be more opportunities for employment in the corporate sector.\n \"Once more people go to uni, job opportunities will come from there,\" he says.\nStudent mentor Bates is also mentoring high school students through the Cathy Freeman Foundation Horizons Program.\nHigh school students Davina Tilberoo from Woorabinda and Kathleen Haines from Palm Island were in Sydney for a week recently, including a spell at investment bank Credit Suisse to get training on presentation skills, interview techniques and resume tips and visit UNSW.\nCathy Freeman Foundation chief executive Jamie Howden says the non-mining private sector lags behind the government and the mining industry when it comes to Indigenous employee representation.\n\"Mining is often done in areas where there is a high percentage of Indigenous people and they are in close proximity to Indigenous communities. In other industries the link has not been established to the same level,\" Howden says.\nHe says corporations should target Indigenous employment by raising awareness of job opportunities that exist in the sector.\n\"The best way is for indigenous students to engage with corporations â€“ visit the place of operation on site and hear from staff their personal experiences and how they got to work at that particular organisation. Once they visit a place then the pathway becomes a lot more tangible for the students.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-08-11T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:06:30.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
