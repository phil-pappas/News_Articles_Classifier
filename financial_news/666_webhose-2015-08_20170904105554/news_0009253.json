As well as his chairmanships, he currently holds non-executive roles at the insurance group Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) , Capital & Counties Properties (LSE: CAPC.L - news ) and Standard Bank. \nThe appointment comes as Sir Howard departs to chair Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) . \n“I am delighted we have appointed such an experienced chairman, who has played a key role in the development of so many other businesses,” said Clive Bannister, chief executive, on Thursday. \nPhoenix (LSE: PHNX.L - news ) , which was set up to consolidate and run closed pension schemes more efficiently, reported a 50pc fall in operating profit to £135m in the first six months of the year but said cash generation was on track. \nThe firm generated £110m in the first-half, down from a year ago as the group prepared to comply with the forthcoming Solvency II rules on capital , but on course to reach £200m to £250m over the course of 2015. \nPhoenix, like other UK insurers, is awaiting approval for its capital model from the Prudential Regulation Authority ahead of the new rules coming into effect in January. \nThe group won its first investment-grade rating from Fitch Ratings earlier this month, enabling it to lower its debt costs and pay for deal-making through funds raised in the capital markets. \nMr Bannister said Phoenix was scouting further takeovers, despite a pause in the market while insurers are preoccupied with capital levels. “We said there would be a hiatus while Solvency II comes through. People don’t know the value of what they are buying or what they are selling, and the capital requirements associated with them,” he said. \n“We remain convinced that the reasons that people will sell their business remain true: the need for capital, and specialised skills.” \n= Pension changes = \nPhoenix has felt the effect of new freedoms for pensioners , which have knocked sales of ordinary annuities as savers look for more flexible ways to deploy their retirement funds. Phoenix’s sales of ordinary annuities to pensioners on its books fell 47pc on last year, while demand remained strong for enhanced or guaranteed annuities, which offer better rates for certain savers. \nAbout 15,000 Phoenix customers have asked to cash out their entire pension scheme, with an average pot size of £13,000. \nPhoenix kept its dividend payment at 26.7p per share.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:48:14.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
