Announces Intent to Enter Into New Senior Secured Term Loan Facility August 03, 2015 08:48 ET | Source: HD Supply \nATLANTA, Aug. 3, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HD Supply, Inc. (the \"Company\"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: HDS ) today announced its intention to enter into a new Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which the Company intends to use, together with cash on hand and borrowings under its existing Senior Secured Revolving Facility, to refinance its existing Senior Secured Term Loan Facility. The Company expects the new Senior Secured Term Loan Facility will mature in 2021 and will permit the Company to pay down certain existing indebtedness, including using the expected proceeds of the recently announced sale of its Power Solutions business unit to redeem all of its outstanding 11% Senior Secured Second Priority Notes due 2020 (the \"Second Priority Notes\"). The Company currently anticipates that the Power Solutions transaction will be completed in the Company's fiscal third quarter; however, there can be no assurances that the transaction will be completed, as it is subject to market and other customary conditions. The Company expects the new Senior Secured Term Loan Facility will generally contain terms and conditions consistent with its existing Senior Secured Term Loan Facility; however, there can be no assurance that a new facility will be available on terms satisfactory to the Company or that the Company will enter into any such facility. \nThis press release does not constitute a notice of redemption under the indenture governing the Second Priority Notes nor an offer to tender for, or purchase, any Second Priority Notes or any other security. \nAbout HD Supply \nHD Supply is one of the largest industrial distributors in North America.
