Rob Homer by Duncan Hughes Property investors caught with off-the-plan apartments delivering lower rents and capital growth than predicted at purchase need to shop around for the best rates to meet bigger repayments.\nReal estate agents and developers are warning that many investors with off-the-plan apartments coming up to completion could face shortfalls of more than 20 per cent in both rental income and valuations.\n\"The investment lending landscape is rapidly changing,\" says Chris Foster-Ramsay, managing director of Capital Home Loans. \"The banks are capping loan-to-value ratios to 80 per cent, increasing interest rates for investment lending and/or interest-only loans by up to 25 basis points [and some are] completely pulling out of the investment lending market.\"\nThe good news is that competition for the owner-occupier market is expected to intensify, particularly principal and interest loans.\n\"Those who make additional principal and interest repayments over and above the minimum required by the bank and can present a history to their lender will benefit by potentially being able to negotiate better discounts, essentially because they are lower risk,\" adds Foster-Ramsay.\nMortgage brokers estimate there are 90,000 apartments being constructed in Australia that have been sold off the plan but not yet settled. The purchasers of about 20 per cent of these, or 18,000, have paid a deposit of just 10 per cent of the full purchase price, according to analysis of investor statistics from CoreLogic.\nAs little as 10 per cent of the purchase price has been required to secure an apartment and buyers typically arrange finance ahead of settlement as the apartment nears completion – often years later.\nHot water Many investors are finding loans are becoming more expensive and harder to get when they seek financing for the balance of the apartment at settlement, particularly when the apartments are revalued.\nA real-life example has been provided by Beller, a diversified property group with offices in Australia and China. The owner's name and address of the property have been withheld.\nAn off-the-plan apartment was purchased for $485,000 on a 10 per cent deposit ($48,500), which meant 90 per cent, or $400,000, equity was required.\nThe bank valuation at completion of the apartment was $400,000, a 17.5 per cent discount on the purchase price. In addition, bank borrowing has been reduced to 80 per cent of the valuation, which is 80 per cent of $400,000 ($320,000).\nThat means the purchaser has to come up with an extra $116,500.\nThe expected rent for the apartment at the time of sale was $460 a week, which is a net gross rental return of about 5 per cent on the original $485,000 purchase price.\nThe actual rent is $360 a week – that's a return of 3.85, which is 21 per cent discount on the original estimates.\nNational Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group have capped their loan-to-value ratios at 90 per cent.\nWestpac has announced investors will be required to have a minimum of 20 per cent deposit for investment loans.\nDecisions by ING and AMP to tighten, or even cease, new lending reflects their concerns about being swamped by borrowers turned away by major banks.\nBarry Marshall, principal of Barry Marshall Real Estate, a boutique Melbourne-based agency, says thousands of investors who have purchased off-the-plan apartments on higher loan-to-value ratios and lower interest rates than currently on offer from the major lenders will be seeking alternatives.\n\"Investors have to get the money from somewhere,\" Marshall adds.\nSmaller lenders swoop in Smaller lenders, such as Perth-based Bluebay Home Loans, which describes itself as an alternative to the majors, has written to brokers stating it will keep a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 per cent and maintain competitive rates.\n\"No changes here,\" a spokesman said. \"It's lending as usual.\"\nOther lenders, such as Liberty Financial, which has assets valued around $3.5 billion, claims it will take advantage of opportunities created by borrowers seeking an alternative as mainstream banks tighten lending.\n\"There is an opportunity for us to grow and we are well-capitalised to take advantage of these changing times,\" said Peter Riedel, chief financial officer.\n\"Recent regulatory changes have been very positive to redress the imbalance between the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority-regulated and non-regulated lenders. We definitely expect the curb on investment lending will be healthy in redressing the concentration.\"\nA review of the best standard variable rates on offer to cover the funding gap – assuming the investor meets lending criteria – shows shopping around can produce more competitive rates.\nSMSF hurdles Investors facing a funding squeeze on an off-the-plan property in their self-managed superannuation fund need to clear several more hurdles created by contribution caps and legal restrictions on their trust.\nA super fund trustee has entered a legal contract with the seller that is fully enforceable. A trustee cannot walk away from the agreement without serious legal repercussions.\n\"You can top up any shortfalls with super contributions to your concessional cap or non-concessional caps,\" says Aaron Dunn, managing director of The SMSF Academy.\nBut if the concessional contributions cap are exceeded these amounts may be subject to excess contributions tax or refunded and reassessed by the Australian Taxation Office to include the amount within your personal tax returns, along with an interest charge, he says.\nSome lawyers suggest a new contract outside of the fund.\n\"I have seen circumstances where the vendor will allow for a new contract to be drawn up,\" says Dunn. \"In such an instance, you would expect the original deposit to refunded and the new purchaser pay a deposit the new deal,\" he says.\nThose considering this need expert legal and tax guidance to ensure it does not create contract and tax problems.\nOther options might be to seek a top-up loan for the shortfall from a related party, such as another member of the fund.\n\"This can create potential problems in the ranking of the mortgage if there is a default or bankruptcy,\" says Dunn. \"The related party will rank behind the bank in the event of default.\"\nThere will also be additional costs in drawing up a related-party loan agreement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:07:41.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
