Photo: Getty Images\nTo get a real understanding of how tough the free-to-air television networks are doing it, one need look no further than the massive write-downs in the value of their licences that they all have posted this year. It totals about $2 billion.\nNine Entertainment reported on Thursday that even before these write-downs, net profit was down 2.9 per cent and television network earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation had fallen 14.7 per cent in the 2015 financial year.\nIt took a $791 million balance sheet impairment, which was mostly about a decline in licence and goodwill values. But Nine also wrote off $13 million related to a US program supply agreement and took more than $40 million on provisioning charges for loss-making inventory.\nNine's David Gyngell presents the company's results in Sydney on Thursday. Photo: Louie Douvis\nThus, on a statutory basis Nine recorded a near $600 million loss.\nAdvertisement Investors and analysts were not too fussed by the big write-downs from the networks. They are a non-cash impairments, and shouldn't affect the share price and won't influence the dividend.\n(Nine's share price rose by 3.9 per cent by mid afternoon on Thursday, no doubt assisted in part by an announcement it would ramp up the share buyback.)\nBut accountants and auditors care a lot about the book value of assets. There are rules that say that if the assets are not generating a sufficient return they need to be valued appropriately on the balance sheet.\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has also been getting stricter around these rules.\nThus, once Seven took the write-off plunge in the interim period to December it came as no surprise when the other two followed suite.\nDespite pressure on the earnings of all three networks, the two heavyweights of the industry, Nine and Seven, have just paid up massively to retain long-term contracts for exclusive free-to-air coverage of the NRL and AFL respectively.\nNine gave a little more detail around the five-year deal it struck with the NRL. It seems Nine is paying top dollar for the rights to the live free-to-air rights but the company said it would likely claw back $100 million of the $925 million it paid to get four premier games a week, the rights to deliver the games free via digital, plus the finals and the high-rating State of Origin games.\nBoth Nine and Seven have declared over the past week that the advertising market is difficult. These two have been competing hard for years but in the past year have had to deal with the additional challenges of a soft advertising market.\nThe free-to-air metropolitan advertising market is down 1.5 per cent in the year and Nine has only marginally boosted is shares\nThe company said it expects modest growth in the metropolitan free-to-air market in the 2016 financial year and said its rating share had improved markedly since July.\nDespite this ratings bounce, the company is still predicting its share to be marginally down, reflecting \"intensely competitive market\" and timing of major events.\nCiti analyst Justin Diddams concluded from Nine management's commentary that earnings would decline again in 2016.\nIn addition to a generally soft advertising market, Nine and Seven are needing to deal with additional competition for eyeballs from two sources. One arm of the pincer movement is from new video streaming services such as Netflix.\n\"Free-to-air generally underperformed against the general ad market as the industry faced structural headwinds,\" Nine chief executive David Gyngell said.\nThe biggest element to the structural headwinds would be the audience fragmentation resulting from the streaming services.\nThe other arm of the pincer movement is the Ten Network.\nFor several years, Nine and Seven have been supplementing their growth in ratings and revenue by taking share from the beleaguered Ten.\nBut over the past six months in particular Ten has mounted a ratings comeback, depriving the others of that free kick.\nIt's a touchy subject. When Seven boss Tim Worner was asked during the company's results presentation whether Ten was mounting the same kind of comeback that Seven had managed some 10 years earlier, he said definitely not.\nGyngell predicted on Thursday that Ten \"will pick up bits and bumps around MasterChef but will fall into a hole coming in to the end of the year\".\nIt seems only fair to give Ten the final word on its comeback.\nFollowing Gyngell's comments, Ten released this sarcasm-laden statement: \"We're flattered that David took time out of presenting his company's financial results to discuss Ten. Clearly our strong ratings and revenue growth this year has rattled him.\n\"Ten is the only primary channel that is growing in 2015, while Nine is the fastest declining primary channel. We are continuing to focus on improving our performance, launching innovative shows and building on the success of proven hits such as The Bachelor Australia , which is up 28 per cent year on year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:31:38.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
