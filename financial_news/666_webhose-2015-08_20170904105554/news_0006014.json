Adam Berry Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup UberX drivers are unable to pass on the cost of the goods and services tax to consumers because of the automated, no-cash system, forcing them to take a 10 per cent pay cut.\nThe Australian Taxation Office instructed UberX drivers to start paying GST from August 1 , but so far Uber, which said on Friday it would challenge the demand in the Federal Court , has not allowed drivers to raise fares to account for the charge.\nOn Monday, The Australian Financial Review took six UberX rides in Melbourne and surveyed the drivers about how they felt about paying GST and whether they would keep driving for Uber.\n​Most expressed confusion about whether or not they would have to personally cop the 10 per cent GST charge, or if they would eventually be able to raise their fares.\nDriver unsure One driver, who wished to be referred to only as Yi, said he had received two emails from Uber about paying GST but was still unsure about what would happen moving forward.\n\"In my case, I've already hired an accountant to do it. I've got nothing against the government department,\" he said.\n\"But I really hope Uber win [the court case] ... According to Australian taxation laws, if you're a small business and your income is over $75,000 you have to charge GST, but how will I know if I'll make that much?\"\n The 10 per cent cut to Melbourne UberX drivers' pay from the GST is on top of a 15 per cent fare reduction ordered by Uber about two months ago, resulting in drivers taking a 25 per cent cut to their earnings since May.\nOf the six drivers, two said they would stop driving for Uber if they had to keep taking the GST out of their own pockets.\nNo response yet One driver, who wished to remain anonymous, said he had emailed Uber to find out if they would be allowed to charge an extra 10 per cent, but he had not received a response yet.\n\"The fare is so cheap ... we're not making a lot of money. In my opinion, Uber should charge the GST on top of the fare,\" he said.\n\"The system calculates the fare, there's no customer transaction on this system. If the ATO charge 10 per cent, then I don't think anyone will drive. I'll stop even though I do two or three days a week. When you take in the fuel and the car costs, you won't make anything.\"\nHe said consumers should foot the bill, just like when buying a shirt from a shop.\n\"The customers should pay the GST and then the driver pays the GST to the ATO, I'd be fine with that.\n\"Uber aren't clear on what they're doing, they haven't gotten back to me yet.\"\nAccountants consulted Of the drivers surveyed, three of them had already consulted accountants about how to pay the GST.\nA spokesperson for the ATO previously told The Australian Financial Review that the tax office's decision was consistent with current GST law and that drivers had between late May and Saturday to prepare.\nThe decision treats UberX drivers as taxi drivers, who also have to pay the tax.\nUber said in a statement that it recommended drivers consult a tax adviser to determine if they needed to register for GST.\n\"Fares are all inclusive of taxes where applicable.\"\nAnother Uber driver who wished to be anonymous said he started driving for Uber when he lost his job in February and that he would stick with it even if he had to pay 10 per cent GST out of his own earnings.\n\"Everyone has to pay tax, I'll just work harder to pay the GST,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-08-03T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T20:09:22.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
