Photo: Getty Images\nYes, Australian monetary policy is being tightened a bit ahead of the big guns and against the trimming trend of Canada and New Zealand.\nAdvertisement No, the Reserve Bank didn't squeeze in a secret board meeting to approve the hike.\nInstead, it's Australian Prudential Regulation Authority that's providing the excuse and our banks that are grabbing it.\nFor now, the Reserve Bank is content to sit back and observes how it plays, ready to fine-tune or not.\nIt's worth repeating that the RBA targets the average interest rates we actually pay. The official cash rate is a mechanism for that. It's a means, not the end.\nSo with our banks moving pretty much across the board to nudge up interest rates for real estate investors – and with investors accounting for so much of the borrowing market – monetary policy on average has effectively been tightened a number of points.\nAnd, just like a more obvious monetary tightening, this squeeze on investors is designed to reduce activity a little.\nBy how many points we're being tightened, it is not possible to tell. The opaque nature of the market for home loans mean published bank rates mean very little .\nThere are no official figures available for what banks are actually charging for new loans, just some guesswork made months later. (The RBA has observed that there's been a de facto rate cut beyond the cash rate moves over the past year or so, thanks to banks' competition for business.)\nBut with the threat of APRA on their backs, there's no doubting the banks are taking the tightening seriously after largely ignoring the prudential authority's first warning.\nMaking the best of it But the nature of the bank beast means they're making the best of the investor loan story: \"Oh it's not for me, Big Bad APRA made me do it\".\nThe result is that they're happily helping themselves to a fatter profit margin and covering the cost of a little extra capital that's being asked of them.\nBank shareholders – and that's just about all of us – should be pleased even while the occasional real estate speculator is not.\nSome of the differences in the various banks' approaches are interesting, starting with the IT shortcoming that's costing Westpac an embarrassing $1 million a day that their competitors are raking in.\nThe move by the little AMP Bank to totally scrap investor loans is intriguing . I suspect it's more to do with the weighting of its own book and expertise in the area than of broader economic relevance.\nAnd NAB's initiative of penalising all interest-only loans will please the RBA, as the central bankers have specifically worried about the explosion of interest-only borrowing, mainly by investors.\nThat's part of the outworking of our tax system – negative gearing, concessionary capital gains and all that. By encouraging investors not to pay down their loans, they don't build up an equity buffer, should the occasional bubble deflate.\nThe opposite is true of our owner-occupied sector, which tends to pay down mortgages early and build the desirable healthy buffer – healthy for banks, the financial system and individuals.\nIt's one of the problems of the American system of tax-deductable mortgages for owner-occupiers – there's little incentive to pay the loan off, especially when it's non-recourse.\nAmong the many insights into the authorities' housing thinking contained in the RBA's excellent submission to the House of Representatives home ownership inquiry is the finding that there are now more owner-occupiers with mortgages than without and that a large proportion of investors with mortgages are far from young. Waving a rate penalty at interest-only loans might nudge those figures in the direction the RBA prefers.\nManaging the message As for the bigger, global interest rate picture, the biggest market news of the week was what didn't happen – there was no reaction to the US Federal Reserve gently giving the interest rate jaw bone chain another tug on Wednesday night .\nIt's increasingly looking like the Fed will succeed in doing to a rate rise what it did to ending quantitative easing – nudging and massaging the markets into relatively calm acceptance of the reality after a period of being spooked by the possibility.\nWall Street, trading near enough to record highs, hardly appears to be in a funk over the possibility of a little rate rise in September or sometime thereafter .\nIt's taken a while, but the message seems to be getting through – the start of returning interest rates to something nearer normal would actually be a good thing, not a disaster, provided growth is strong enough to handle it.\nThat's part of the reason the RBA hasn't taken an official rate cut off the table here – there's the impact of an effective rate rise to weigh.", "external_links": ["http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/07/monetary-policy-0", "http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/submissions/inquiry-into-home-ownership/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:14:31.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
