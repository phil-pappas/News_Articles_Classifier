Stocksy by Amy Wilson-Chapman Mission and vision statements (please don't stop reading) are boring, right? They mean nothing, right?\nWrong, says HealthTap founder and chief executive Ron Gutman.\nYou won't find HealthTap's vision written on the wall, but you will find his staff chatting about it – even (shock, horror) suggesting the old values may no longer align with the company.\n\"It's not just at the very beginning of the company you define yourself,\" he says. \"But how you keep it going all the time and keep it fresh, and something that is meaningful.\"\nGutman is speaking as part of Stanford University's Entrepreneurship Corner's podcast Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders .\nHealthTap, a digital-health start-up that helps connect medical professionals with patients, is a good example Gutman argues, that shows companies need to keep moulding and adapting their vision statements.\n\"This is the glue that keep its all together,\" he says.\nBut, he gets it. Businesspeople (entrepreneurs or otherwise) typically have no time to ponder values and vision.\n \"We have a team meeting every week and we have a town hall meeting every weekend. And all of us come together and every team meeting we chose one of our values in our vision and credo and have a discussion about it.\n\"Do people still believe in it? Do people still think it's applicable? Maybe we need to change certain things.\"\nTo keep the chatter going, they've named the company's conference rooms after the values.\n\"We don't just put the plaque on the wall that nobody ever looks at. People talk about conference rooms. [People say] 'Let's meet at passion and positive energy, sense of adventure, data and analysis' – these are the names of our rooms in our office.\"\nEntrepreneurial Thought Leaders is a weekly series featuring an array of entrepreneurs who speak at the Californian university, where Gutman is joined by the likes of Rothenberg Ventures founder Mike Rothenberg and ModCloth founder Susan Koger .\nThe podcast is a great way to hear insights, advice and (surprisingly) useful tips from people who have been there, done that and got lessons to share.\nIts downfall (and the reason I almost put it in the \"trash\" pile)? It's a recorded lecture.\nThe talk and following question and answer session go for about an hour in total (without any advertisements – a huge plus). But the Q and A can easily be skipped, as the questions are hard to hear and not that insightful.\nSo if you can get past the Stanford love-in (many of these speakers are former students) and cope with a little less production than the podcasts I've previously recommended, it's definitely worth your time.\nLike Boss on Facebook .
