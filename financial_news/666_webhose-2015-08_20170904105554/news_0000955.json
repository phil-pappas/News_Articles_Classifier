Although the CFPB recently delayed the effective date of the TRID rule until such date, it declined to adopt a formal hold harmless period, despite industry calls for such a period. H.R. 3192 provides that the TRID rule may not be enforced against any person until February 1, 2016, and that no suit may be filed against a person for a violation of the TRID rule occurring before such date, so long as the person has made a good faith effort to comply with the rule. Passed by a vote of 45-13, the bill’ H.R. 1210 , the “Portfolio Lending and Mortgage Access Bill”: The bill would modify the TILA ability to repay provisions by creating a safe harbor for depository institutions without regard to their size for loans that the institution retains in portfolio from origination where any prepayment penalties comply with the phase-out requirements for prepayment penalties on qualified mortgages. The bill would also create a safe harbor from the TILA anti-steering provision (for which the CFPB has not yet proposed implementing regulations) that prohibits a mortgage originator from steering a consumer from a qualified mortgage for which the consumer is qualified to a mortgage that is not a qualifi H.R. 1737 , the “Reforming CFPB Indirect Auto Financing Guidance Act”: The bill would nullify the CFPB’s indirect auto finance guidance issued in March 2013 and require the CFPB to provide for a notice and comment period before issuing any new guidance on indirect auto finance. The bill also includes requirements for the CFPB when proposing and issuing such guidance to make publicly available “all studies, data, methodologies, analyses, and other information” it relied on; consult with the Fed, FTC and DOJ; and conduct a study of the guidance’s impact on consumers and “women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses.” H.R. 1941 , the “Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T22:54:13.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
