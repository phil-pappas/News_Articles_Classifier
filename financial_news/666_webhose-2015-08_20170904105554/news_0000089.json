The materials group climbed 1.4 percent as the price of gold steadied.\nThe most influential weights included First Quantum Minerals Ltd, which fell 3.7 percent to C$9.90, and Encana Corp , which declined 3.3 percent to C$9.09.\nThe overall energy group retreated 0.2 percent, with losses offset by a move higher by Canadian Natural Resources, up 0.8 percent to C$33.05.\nU.S. crude prices were down 0.9 percent to $44.27 a barrel, while Brent crude lost 1.2 percent to $48.95.\n\"In terms of the divergence between commodity prices and the performance of the energy stocks, it's a reflection of some rotation that we're seeing in the market,\" said Craig Fehr, Canadian market strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\"When you consider the declines we've seen in the energy space, there is some value there.\"\nAt 10:40 a.m. (1440 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 38.75 points, or 0.27 percent, at 14,367.16.\nAt the level, the index is on track to notch a 0.7 percent fall in the holiday-shortened week.\nOf the index's 10 main groups, six were in negative territory.\nFehr said dual job reports from Canada and the United States reflected the general trajectory of the economy in both countries, with modest improvements for Canada and signs of a more robust U.S. recovery.\n\"I do think equities can move higher, it's just going to be a more volatile ride and certainly the gains are going to be lower than we've seen in past years,\" he said.
