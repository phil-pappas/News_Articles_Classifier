The government, meantime, has had to scale back its fiscal savings plans in order to prop up the economy. \nStandard (Other OTC: SNDH - news ) and Poor's last month switched the outlook on Brazil's 'BBB-' rating to negative, which means the country's investment-grade ranking is at risk. \n- Sub(e)merging currencies - \nBrazil is in good company in having its money pummelled, with fellow emerging markets like Mexico, South Africa, Colombia and Turkey also witnessing their currencies slide to multi-year lows. \nRussia's central bank has stopped its controversial purchases of foreign currencies to expand its reserves due to a renewed decline of the ruble in recent weeks. \nThe slump in the value of emerging market currencies is in large part due to falling prices of commodities -- affecting oil and metals alike -- which figure heavily in the exports of many emerging market nations. \nMining groups Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) and Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) announced plans to reduce their headcounts by a combined 12,000 employees owing to falling metals prices in a weak global economy. \nFor economist Christopher Dembik at Saxo Banque, most emerging market economies \"have not undertaken the necessary structural reforms, (and) don't have the diversified industry or real consumer market\" to absorb external shocks. \nHe sees deeper problems than the withdrawal of investment funds from emerging markets by investors seeking higher returns in dollar-denominated ventures expected to materialise with a looming rise in US interest rates. \nWhile industrialised nations benefited from long periods of prosperity to adjust and consolidate their economic models, Dembik does not believe today's emerging markets will be so fortunate. \nVolatility in financial markets has compressed business cycles, making it impossible for emerging markets to adopt a similar model. \nHowever, Dembik considers China to be a special case, and he is \"optimistic for the medium- to long-term\" for the country, thanks to its large accumulated private savings and its interventionist government. \nInternational Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde also voiced confidence recently that China could weather the current turmoil battering its stock exchanges. \n\"We believe that the Chinese economy is resilient and strong enough to withstand that kind of significant variation in the markets,\" she said in an online press conference last month. \n- China effect - \nStill, Natixis (Paris: FR0000120685 - news ) investment bank economist Patrick Artus believes \"the significant reduction of China's growth potential (from eight percent annually between 2000-2010 to three percent in the 2020s) will have considerable effects\" beyond its national economy by reducing the global growth rate by one percentage point per year. \nMeanwhile global trade growth has disappointed, as have efforts to reach global and regional free trade deals. \nLudovic Subran, an economist at insurer Euler Hermes (Paris: FR0004254035 - news ) , notes the emergence of an \"anti-globalisation\" trend with growing economic patriotism in the European Union and the United States. \n\"European and American consumers (Other OTC: ANCS - news ) won't save the world, economic and financial patriotism is on the rise,\" he said. \nWhile US President Barack Obama recently received critical authority to negotiate new free trade agreements, it is unclear whether accords with Asia-Pacific nations and the EU will be concluded amid considerable popular opposition. \nSubran noted that the public in several emerging markets were becoming more concerned about inequality, plundering natural resources and economic reforms, and they are changing the game for governments and investors -- including in China. \n\"You can't import capital, have foreign-trained managers, without importing a little bit of democracy as well,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-09T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T10:22:23.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
