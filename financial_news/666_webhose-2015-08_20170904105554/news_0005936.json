The area is renowned for its nature reserve, sub-tropical rainforests and surfing beach.\nEarlier this month, two-time US Open champion Rafter and wife Lara purchased a coastal Byron Bay paddock for a family retreat.\nThe Rafters paid $1.35 million for the 28 hectares grazing property at 146 Midgen Flat Road, Broken Head, well down from its earlier $1.75 million listing.\nIn June a 37-hectare property on Byron Bay Road sold for $1.65 million and in January, a 40-hectare Broken Head block on Owenia Way sold for $1.2 million.\nAccording to Mr Quinn, the Newrybar Swamp Road property has been used to grow sugar cane and more recently macadamia trees and will suit buyers looking for a lifestyle property close to the coast and just a 15-minute drive from the resort town of Byron Bay.\n He said the opportunity to secure a coastal landholding of this size close to Byron Bay was rare.\nEach parcel of land has elevated and sizeable building sites on which to construct a home. The property is surrounded by timber post and wire boundary and internal fencing creating 14 paddocks and a set of stockyards.\nThere are multiple dams on the property.\nThe properties are to be sold by expressions of interest, with the campaign closing on August 27.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-08-16T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:09:39.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
