(Staff photo: Bill Klotz) One worker dead, another injured at Vikings stadium site By: Brian Johnson August 26, 2015 9:14 am 0 \nOne worker died and another was injured Wednesday morning while working on the roof of the new Minnesota Vikings stadium under construction in downtown Minneapolis. \nThe workers, employees of Berwald Roofing, were working on the roof on the north side of the building at about 7:45 Wednesday morning when the accident occurred, said John Wood, senior vice president of Mortenson Construction, which is building the $1.1 billion stadium. \nWood said the workers fell about 50 feet. \nSgt. Stuart Helmer of the Minneapolis Police Department said both workers were taken to nearby Hennepin County Medical Center, but he didn’t know any other details. \n“Emergency responders were there within a matter of a few minutes,” Wood said near the construction site. “The proximity to this hospital obviously ensures that we get immediate response. And I think they did everything possible for both of the individuals.” \nThe extent of the surviving worker’s injuries was unclear. \nThe Minneapolis Fire Department responded to the construction site for a “technical rescue,” according to the department’s Twitter feed. The department reported that one worker fell into a crevice and was trapped with injuries. \nFire department responders used a “rescue basket and ropes along with cables” to tie firefighters off to secure the rescue, the department said. \nNeither worker was identified, pending notification of their families. \nConstruction was halted at the site. Stadium workers were seen leaving the construction site around 9 a.m. as a news helicopter hovered overhead. \nU.S. Bank Stadium, priced at $1.08 billion, is set to open next year. \nFinance & Commerce will report more details as they become available. \nBelow is a gallery of images by Staff Photographer Bill Klotz from the construction site after the accident: Two workers were injured while working on the Vikings stadium construction site.
