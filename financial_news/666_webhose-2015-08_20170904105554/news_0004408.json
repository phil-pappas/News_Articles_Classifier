Getty Images Share on twitter by Dominic White Ten years and one month since he was manoeuvred out of his father's media empire by rival executives, Lachlan Murdoch was back on the global business stage as Rupert's heir apparent this morning, fronting up to Wall Street's big shot media analysts.\n\"James and I appreciate the board's confidence,\" the ageing media tycoon's first-born son told a conference call for cable and film behemoth 21st Century Fox, no doubt conscious of investors' nepotism anxiety over the brothers' dual elevation to Fox's top jobs.\nHis humility seemed genuine: unlike his spikier, quick-witted, younger brother James, Lachlan has a warm public persona.\nAs co-executive chairman (Lachlan) and chief executive (James), the double act has voluminous shoes to fill - those of the finely moustachioed Chase Carey, ever popular with and trusted by The Street.\nFor Lachlan, it's an almighty jump from hosting the lowly Ten Network Holding's annual meeting in a basement auditorium in Sydney less than two years ago.\nBut his chairmanly chops were in evidence in his opening address (it was he, rather than James, who began proceedings, although James got to close them).\nLachlan pointed to the brothers' 25 years of experience in media, while acknowledging that Carey - who's still with the company (for now at least) - has played a pivotal role in Fox's recent successes.\nHe was also quick to recognise the \"rapid change\" the industry is undergoing as more viewers pick video entertainment on demand from \"over-the-top\" players such as Netflix - a trend which many fear is threatening the long-dominant linear cable television viewing that has been so integral Fox's business.\n No doubt conscious of the share price kicking that America's biggest cable companies received on Wednesday over worries that the streaming video powerhouse behind House of Cards is about to eat everyone's lunch, Lachlan declared: \"In this environment it is not enough to simply adapt to change - to succeed in this environment we must lead change\".\nIt was textbook Murdoch, and fewer people have lost money from backing their old dad against the odds down the years than have made a packet.\nBut Lachlan sounded less articulate and more hesitant when unscripted; James - who has always been nimbler in conversation - fielded most of the questions along with CFO John Nallen.\nBoth siblings attempted to reassure investors that, with their Fox shares (and not to add, handsome incentives ), they are perhaps more determined than anyone to steer the good ship Fox successfully through the Netflix storm.\nFacing an awkward, telling question about which of the brothers is actually in charge under their bespoke reporting arrangement - a corporate governance confection, let's face it - Lachlan insisted that \"it is a true 50:50 partnership\".\n\"James and I have been working together for many years, we know each other better than anyone knows us, so as we work towards this transition we have gone with carefully thinking it out, and with our eyes open, and and it is working extraordinarily well,\" he said.\nLachlan and James appear to have put their younger rivalries aside=, but then anyone who has a brother will tell you that brothers have a tendency to rub each other up the wrong way (the narcissism of small differences, as Sigmund Freud called it).\nWhether and for how long that continues will be fascinating for Murdoch-watchers to observe as the family patriarch moves into his mid-80s.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/DomWhiteAFR"], "published": "2015-08-06T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T06:05:03.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
