David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd After burying the $5 billion capital headache imposed on him by the prudential regulator Ian Narev was happy on Wednesday to reveal his growth strategy and explain why Commonwealth Bank of Australia can grow at between 5 and 10 per cent.\nIn an interview with Chanticleer, Narev said the biggest growth opportunity for CBA was in winning over the younger generation of customers who have historically dumped the bank as they have moved into their late 20s and early 30s.\nAbout 46 per cent share of all Australians aged between 18 and 24 named CBA as their main financial institution as of June 2015, up from 44.9 per cent in June 2014, according to Roy Morgan Research.\nBut only 42 per cent of those aged 25 to 34 and 30 per cent of those aged 35 to 49 named CBA as their main financial institution.\nNarev says the bank's leadership in technology on a range of different devices and its commitment to customer satisfaction provides the bank with the chance to hold on to the younger generation and generate higher profits.\n\"I think the result shows the link between happy customers, more MFI and more revenue improvement right across the life cycles,\" he says.\n\"We have got this extraordinary footprint at school and then it starts ebbing away historically as people have their first credit experience.\n\"The big opportunity we have now got is that is the tech savvy segment. So the history which said: 'You outgrow the Commonwealth Bank after school because you don't like it' – we have a really unique opportunity to reverse that.\n \"If you manage to even improve this by a third using the technology then there is real opportunity still in the business. We have been wondering how do we crack that opportunity for years.\n\"Now, the confluence between our technology focus and what drives customer preference in that segment is pretty good.\"\n﻿ Customer satisfaction in CBA's DNA Narev says customer satisfaction is now built into the DNA of CBA after focusing on it as the primary measure of performance for about a decade. The bank relies on data from Roy Morgan and has not embraced the widely used Net Promoter Score system used by fast growing financial institutions such as ING Direct.\n\"We are going to continue to set expectations and are going to describe the business in relation to customers,\" he says.\n\"We are going to measure all of our performance in relation to its impact on customers. That's been a really important part of the DNA of the organisation since 2006.\"\nCBA's $9.1 billion cash profit in 2015 marked a definite slowing in the growth in earnings that has been experienced over the past 15 years.\nThat decline in growth is a function of the slower growth in the economy as well as the more intense competition in retail and business banking.\nThe direct relationship between the growth in the economy and the growth in bank earnings is something that investors need to get their minds around. But there is good reason to remain positive about the ability of banks to deliver sound relative returns.\nWith nominal GDP growth of about 4 to 5 per cent and bond yields at 2.5 per cent, the returns offered by banks of about 5 per cent, not including franking credits, is relatively attractive.\nNarev provides a technical description of how you arrive at a bank profit as a precursor to explaining why he thinks they can deliver earnings growth of between 5 and 10 per cent through the cycle.\n\"When we are talking about EPS growth you break it down business by business and say 'How do you grow?\"' he says\n\"It's system growth times market share growth times margin growth times operating leverage growth times capital productivity growth.\n\"Now it used to be that the banking market said the top line of that, the system, is growing at 12 per cent and therefore if you hold share, lose a bit of margin and don't get any cost productivity you grow at 12 per cent.\"\nA different environment But Narev says that is not the environment we are in now.\n\"On the other hand, you still have a home lending system growing at 6 per cent and a business lending system growing at 4 per cent,\" he says.\n\"If you can grow a little bit of share in the right places, do a reasonable job with margin and go hard on the productivity and manage your capital reasonably well you can still, over a cycle, get solid mid to upper single digit growth.\n\"If you can do that consistently that's what your investors expect of you.\n\"You also have to realise that you can never massively outperform the economy and if the system slows there could be environments where 3 per cent profit growth is good.\n\"At the moment you would have to say we are in an environment of low interest rates which is generally a bit tougher for banking margins, even if it is better for credit quality.\"\nNarev says home-lending growth is at trend, business growth is at sub-trend and \"probably the risk is still that it could get either a bit weaker or a bit stronger\".\n\"We have to just think long term and we don't make reactionary decisions and that's what we are trying to do,\" he says.\nThe end of the resources boom and the much needed arrival of the lower dollar open up interesting opportunities for the Australian economy and for the banking system, according to Narev.\n\"When we were in the resources boom – we were all sitting saying 'Oh God, is it really transmitting into the real economy' because no one could see how it was turning up,\" he says.\n\"What it was best for was the government balance sheet.\n\"The No.1 dynamic to watch now is we now have a dollar at US70c.\n\"If you have an open economy then the demand from the growing parts of the world for who we are, what we do, what we have got within reason it is pretty much unlimited.\n\"So if we really shape the policy environment that opens up the economy to that while protecting the key aspects of social and economic interests that is a pretty good place to be in.\n\"The low dollar has always been what we have always said is the bit of the picture that we need to get this going.\"\nBrookfield out to please A closer examination of the asset mix of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP) shows that if it is successful in taking over Asciano it will have every reason to list its shares in Australia.\nIf the $9 billion takeover of Asciano goes ahead about 60 per cent of BIP's total assets under management will be in Australia. That may not stay that way for long given BIP is looking at a number of other transactions around the world.\nThere is a precedent for separate listings of BIP securities in different jurisdictions. It is listed in New York and Canada.\nA local listing for BIP would not only make it easier to execute the scrip takeover offer for Asciano it would send a positive signal to the 3000 employees it already has in its Australian operations in Western Australia and Queensland.\nAdding Asciano to its portfolio will add more than 8000 employees across Australia.\nHowever, there is obviously considerable scepticism in the market about the deal proceeding as Asciano shares closed at $8.15 on Wednesday and the Brookfield bid is $9.05. Add in the potential for a distribution of franking credits as part of the offer and the stock is trading at a 15 per cent discount to its estimated takeover valuation.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\nTony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-08-12T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T15:11:04.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
