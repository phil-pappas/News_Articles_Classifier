Photo: Eddie Jim\nA former hospitality worker has won a substantial payout from burger chain Grill'd after allegations she was sacked for speaking out against a low-paying wage agreement.\nKahlani Pyrah, 20, gained national attention this year for taking on her employers at a Grill'd Melbourne outlet. She launched legal action alleging she was fired for seeking to have the company's WorkChoices-era pay deal scrapped and replaced with full award entitlements.\nMs Pyrah was due to appear in the Federal Court this week to make her unfair dismissal case, but the trial was called off after the parties reached a confidential settlement.\nThe young worker said she was pleased with the outcome and what she had achieved.\nAdvertisement \"I was able to set a positive example to hospitality workers that you can stand up for better wages and fair treatment and win,\" she said.\n\"I wanted to overturn Grill'd below-award wages and I succeeded ... that means thousands of Grill'd workers will get a pay rise.\"\nMs Pyrah will not return to her job at Grill'd Camberwell and has taken up a role with hospitality union United Voice as a bargaining agent.\nA Grill'd spokesman said the company maintained that an allegation of workplace bullying was the reason for Ms Pyrah's dismissal.\nThe out-of-court settlement comes as the national burger chain continues negotiations for higher-paying workplace deals. Grill'd last month vowed to \"modernise\" agreements affecting 60 company-run stores and the Camberwell franchise after facing a bitter backlash for paying staff flat hourly rates with no penalty rates or overtime, meaning their overall pay was often less than the award.\nBut the proposed new pay and conditions are already facing strong resistance, despite the company's claim that they boost wages.\nUnited Voice state secretary Jess Walsh said the union would argue against the proposal at the Fair Work Commission, which is required to test whether it leaves individual workers \"better off overall\" when compared to the fast food industry award, the basic wages safety net.\n\"Grill'd needs to pay weekend rates,\" Ms Walsh said.\n\"A staff member working a Sunday shift could be thousands of dollars worse off a year under the rates being proposed.\"\nMs Walsh also said it was concerning that Grill'd wanted to retain compulsory traineeships for all employees, which allow young staff to be paid as little as $11.50 an hour.\n\"We will be telling the Fair Work Commission that this pay deal is bad for Grill'd staff and should not be approved,\" she said.\nGrill'd has indicated it wants to continue mandating a retail traineeship program as a requirement of employment at its stores, allowing it to pay staff cut-rate wages. Grill'd claims traineeships are a crucial component of the business.\nBut the company has hit back at the union's calls for penalty rates, saying they \"show a lack of understanding of the Grill'd business\".\n\"Introducing penalty rates versus the proposed all-inclusive rate would actually save Grill'd millions and reduce staff pay for the majority,\" he said.\n\"Importantly, our staff have reaffirmed that the flexibility they receive through the all-inclusive rate structure is one of the most important benefits of working at Grill'd and this would be lost under a penalty rate structure.\"\nMs Pyrah said she holds \"serious concerns\" about the pay deal being proposed for company-run Grill'd stores.\n\"I am worried Grill'd is trying to avoid paying weekend rates and using traineeships to pay staff even less,\" she said.\n\"My message to Grill'd workers is that you are entitled to award pay rates and you should accept nothing less.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T04:49:33.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
