Waiting too long would risk undermining the recovery, especially if interest rates then need to be increased faster than the gradual path which we expect.\"\nForbes, a U.S. academic and member of the BoE's rate-setting MPC, said that with inflation around zero, there was no need to act before the Bank was confident it was heading back towards 2 percent within two years as forecast.\nShe also said China's yuan devaluation and falling energy and commodity prices meant there was a \"bit more time\" before inflationary pressures build in Britain, but she would be looking closely for signs of stronger domestic price pressures.\nThe BoE slashed interest rates to 0.5 percent during the financial crisis in 2009 and has kept them there since.\nInvestors were taken by surprise earlier this month when the Bank said just one of its nine policymakers - Ian McCafferty -had voted for a rate hike at their August meeting. Most economists in a Reuters poll had expected two or even three members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to vote for a rate hike.\nAt its quarterly inflation report update on the same day, the Bank stressed that a recent strengthening of the pound and a renewed fall in oil prices would push down inflation until at least the middle of next year and said the impact of the rise in sterling could persist even longer.\n* Here is a link to the full article: here\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan , editing by Larry King)", "external_links": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/bank-of-england/11803024/Kristin-Forbes-Avoiding-sunburn-and-other-considerations-for-interest-rates.html"], "published": "2015-08-17T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T01:04:45.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
