Michael Pascoe comments.\nPT4M20S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Here's a reason for the Reserve Bank to leave rates unchanged tomorrow: the nation's chief financial officers are at least considering a walk on the wild side.\nThe elusive \"animal spirits\" might be stirring at last.\nA survey of some 250 mid-market chief financial officers from companies with turnover of between $3 million and $300 million found a marked increase in their appetite for risk compared with this time last year.\nAnd the CFOs perceived the same trend in the rest of the C-suite.\nAdvertisement Remember that these are CFOs: a group characterised by the story of the optimist seeing the glass half-full, the pessimist seeing it half-empty and the CFO saying, \"you have a glass twice as big as you need. Downsize\".\nThe survey, commissioned by American Express, asked the CFOs how they rated their personal appetite for risk. Last year 30 per cent answered either high or very high. This year it was 36 per cent.\nLast year the CFOs thought 32 per cent of other senior decision makers in their enterprise had either high or very high risk appetites. This year the perception was 38 per cent.\nAnd with that, 80 per cent claimed their companies had a level of acceptance of trying new ideas and innovation without fear of failure, up from 73 per cent last year.\nThis, along with the non-resources component of the NAB's business confidence survey picking up and holding up since May, is the key determinant of where monetary policy is head – global madness notwithstanding.\nNo movement In the midst of last week's interesting market times, some folks suggested tomorrow's RBA board meeting might be \"live\", meaning the possibility of a rate movement is on the table. That possibility is always at least in the room, but by week's end the possibility of knee-jerk monetary policy reaction to market gyrations had been firmly discounted. Nobody is expecting a movement this month.\nAnd the various economists' surveys seem to be getting cooler on the idea of another rate cut at all. The commentariat appears to be coming round to the view that the RBA is seeing more of the same for the Australian economy at least until late next year and that monetary policy therefore will be more of the same as well.\nIt was the downturn in non-mining investment that prompted the RBA to cut rates in February and again in May. The hoped-for and expected transition to increased non-mining investment just wasn't happening.\nAs far as the countable numbers go, it's still not happening. Last week's ABS June quarter capex survey does not bode well for this financial year.\nThe ABS figures are flawed as they don't count about half of our non-mining capex, but as an indication of what's happening, or not happening, the federal budget's forecast of 2 per cent growth in non-mining investment for the last financial year has not happened and his forecast of 4 per cent growth for this financial year is not looking good either.\nWe get the 2014-15 capex count in the national accounts on Wednesday. At the three-quarter mark, it was down 2 per cent.\nLess investment Last week's survey had the country's chief financial officers expecting to invest less this year than they did at the same time last year. It's not a good result.\nBut animal spirits can be flighty things. There's a good deal of the herd in them – as the RBA has pointed out in the past by finding much of the decision by CEOs to invest is based on looking over their shoulder at their competition. So if key players begin to be more prepared to take a risk, to employ another worker, invest in a new, more efficient machine, there's a good chance the herd will follow.\nLet's hope so. As the just-completed reporting season demonstrated, you can't keep downsizing your way to executive bonuses indefinitely.\nMichael Pascoe was paid to chair the American Express survey results event.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T22:24:48.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
