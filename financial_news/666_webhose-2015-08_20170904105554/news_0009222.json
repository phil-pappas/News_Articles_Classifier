The contract is currently being renegotiated with the federal government.\nIt emerged on Friday that Transfield's largest shareholder, funds management firm Allan Gray, has the company under review in light of alleged human rights abuses.\nHESTA has already sold its 3.5 percent stake in the company, worth $23 million, citing concern about \"social governance issues\".\n\"We understood there were concerns from some of our investors so we are not at all surprised that one of our investors has chosen to take this action,\" Ms Smith-Gander told AFR Weekend .\n\"Transfield stands by its standards of governance but I am not sure that industry funds are held to the same standards of governance and transparency.\n\"There is a conversation going on about this and I think it's a very important conversation and a definite area for reform.\"\n The comments about governance are a reference to the Abbott government's plan to mandate that all super fund boards be comprised of one-third independent directors and an independent chair.\nHowever, HESTA operates under the equal representation model, which means half of its trustees are drawn from unions and the other half from health sector employees. The HESTA website lists Angela Emslie as the fund's independent chairwoman. She was appointed in 2013.\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is responsible for super policy, said he hoped to table the new governance laws in federal parliament next week.\nWhen asked about HESTA's divestment decision, he said the onus was on the fund to explain its strategy to members.\n\"You would hope that HESTA was making decisions based on the best economic interests of its members,\" he said. \"If I was a member of HESTA I would want to know they were making decisions in my best financial interests.\"\nJason Beddow, the managing director of the $5 billion listed investment company Argo Investments and one of Transfield's major investors, warned that divestment on ethical groups was fraught.\n\"We have 80,000 shareholders and get plenty of correspondence from people who are against this or that but if you started making investment decisions based on every individual concern, we wouldn't be able to invest in anything,\" he said.\nMr Beddow said they would meet with Transfield management over the next week to assess the issue but was agnostic about other campaigns such as the fossil fuel debate and ethical divestment.\n\"It depends who you are managing money for. If its [not-for-profits] or universities who want to invest that way I don't really have a concern as long as they are consistent.\"\nHESTA said it was in the best financial interests of members to sell out of Transfield, arguing its operation of the contentious detention centres would inevitably erode the company's value in the face of future potential litigation.\n\"We do not, and should not, make investment decisions in response to activist member campaignism,\" HESTA chief executive Debby Blakey has said.\nAllan Gray holds an almost 19 per cent stake in Transfield Services, worth roughly $107 million.\nThe boutique $4.4 billion funds management firm is listed on the HESTA website as one of 19 Australian equity houses with a mandate to manage part of its domestic shares portfolio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T13:16:18.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
