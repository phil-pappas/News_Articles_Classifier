Photo: Louie Douvis\nFormer Telstra CEO David Thodey, the man who said his salary package was too big to justify , will receive almost $14.5 million for his last year in the role.\nAccording to Telstra's annual report, released Thursday along with the telco's full annual results, Mr Thodey took home $2.65 million in base salary and $3.4 million as a short-term cash bonus. The largest contributor to his pay package was $7.5 million worth of long-term bonuses.\nHe also received $913,577 worth of shares that he could access under the short-term bonus plan. The report also revealed Mr Thodey, who now chairs the CSIRO , had received almost $12,000 worth of home security and car parking services.\nUnder the terms of his contract, Mr Thodey will continue his employment until August 21, six months after his resignation. The report disclosed that he will continue to be paid for that period, and for 2016, he will receive a short-term incentive payment of $377,534. The board opted to allow him to keep nearly a third of the performance rights allocated to him under the 2015 long-term incentive plan.\nMr Thodey told Fairfax Media in May that executive remuneration was out of whack when compared to the broader community.\n\"I can't sit here and defend my salary against all the guys who are out there working every day and I wouldn't try to,\" he said.\n\"I think there's a real issue with income disparity between what an average person gets and some of the really big salaries.\"\nMr Thodey's successor Andy Penn will receive a slightly lower fixed salary than Mr Thodey. Mr Penn will be paid $2.325 million in base salary, which the company said was set between the 25th percentile and median of the top 20 ASX companies.\nUnder the short term and long term bonus structure, Mr Penn can receive a maximum of 200 per cent of his $2.325 million salary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T04:43:06.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
