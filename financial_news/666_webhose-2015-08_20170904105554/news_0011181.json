AngloGold Ashanti has responded to lower gold prices by cutting overhead expenditure by more than two-thirds since the end of 2012, whilst lowering all-in sustaining costs by about a quarter over the same period. \nIn addition, the group has introduced two new, low-cost mines, closed higher-cost assets, removed unprofitable ounces from its portfolio and sold CC&V for $820m, plus a net smelter returns royalty to reduce net debt. \nIt is now intensifying efficiency efforts to complement cost benefits from weakening local currencies and falling oil prices. \nAssuming the offer is fully taken up, AngloGold Ashanti's annual cash interest expense will decline by about $69m to about $170m. \nThe company will continue to have significant sources of liquidity, including undrawn headroom in its various revolving credit facilities of about $1.1 billion, and cash of approximately $400 million (all calculated at current exchange rates). And these could be utilised to weather gold price volatility and unforeseen interruptions in production if required. \nAngloGold Ashanti is the world's third-largest gold mining company measured by production. \nAs at 31 December 2014 (before the sale of CC&V) AngloGold Ashanti had an attributable Ore Reserve of 57.5 million ounces of gold and an attributable Mineral Resource of 232.0 million ounces of gold. For the year ended 31 December 2014, it incurred interest costs of US$278 million. \nAt the end of the second quarter of 2015, AngloGold Ashanti's Net Debt was $3.076bn. \nA business desk report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-25T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T01:31:36.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
