Current liabilities decreased by Ksh28 million to Ksh3.09 billion. \nNMG, which is the publisher of this newspaper, also owns newspapers, television and radio stations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda. \nDivisions that strongly boosted the company's half-year results included the Business Daily, whose revenue increased eight per cent and NTV Uganda, whose income went up 16 per cent. \nThe interim dividend of Ksh2.50 for every ordinary share held translates into a total payout of Ksh471.4 million. \nThe company expressed optimism about the second half of the year, as it expects no significant disruptions and a further boost in earnings from Tanzania's General Election slated for October.
