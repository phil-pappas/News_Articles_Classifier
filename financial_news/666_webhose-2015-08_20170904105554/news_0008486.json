Though these figures are disturbing, we are still ready to take them in a positive way. Counting the number of Hindus living in India today, the country is still a Hindu nation that still has the poison of secularism in it,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece, ‘Saamana’.\n“Why is the population of Muslims increasing? If one thinks about it, one will know there is politics of religion behind it. Certain forces have already started thinking about Islamisation of the country and thereby to bring the Mughal rule back. We will not be surprised, if, in the next 50 years, Mughal rule returns to the country riding on the secularism bogie,” it said.\nIt further asked 96 crore Hindus to unite and counter these (hostile) “forces” and said that activities taking place in “masjids and madrasas” should be stopped.\n“Muslim population is increasing because there are no stringent rules of family planning. One man can have four wives and raise twenty-five children. If Hindus feel that this needs to be stopped, they need to use the might of their numbers to force the government to do so,” it said.\nIt further said that vote-bank politics needed to stop to ensure that Muslim youths get proper education and good jobs.\n“Muslims today are seeing the condition of Pakistan. They should now come together with Hindus for the cause of development. They should not look at Hindus as a religion but as an Indian culture and bow before the motherland,” Shiv Sena said.\n 27, 2015 4:29 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T18:28:12.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
