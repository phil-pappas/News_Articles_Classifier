In a rising market, by contrast, simply storing fuel adds to its value, helping pay down fees. \nRISKY BUSINESS \nTrade houses ability to manage risks around a buyers terms and conditions, along with managing payment, have helped them increase their market share of LNG. \n\"They use their balance sheet, they're willing to go places other people aren't, they're willing to take risks that major oil companies aren't,\" Feer said. \nOil major Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) is fronting a significant chunk of supply for Trafigura's various positions into Latin America and Egypt, say trade sources, showing how traders are partnering suppliers wary of exposure to potentially risky new buyers. \nShell declined to comment. \n\"In countries like Egypt some of the traders are more comfortable taking the credit risk,\" said Noel Tomnay, head of global gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie. \nAlong with Egypt, new importers of LNG this year include Pakistan and Jordan. \nOil majors are prepared to pay traders to shoulder counterparty risk, particularly when they are dealing with less creditworthy buyers. \n\"It's providing insurance for a margin, whether it's for a oil major, or a big producer or a project,\" the source at a rival trading house said. \nTrafigura traded 1.7 million tonnes of LNG in their 2014 financial year which ended on September 30 and traders and analysts said this could have doubled in 2015. \n\"There's going to be a very significant jump in their volumes this year, they clearly have ambition,\" said Feer.
