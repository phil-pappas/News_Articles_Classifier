(TSX:WCM.A)(TSX:WCM.B) (\"Wilmington\" or the \"Corporation\") reported net income attributable to shareholders for the three months ended June 30, 2015 of $0.8 million or $0.09 per share compared to net income of $0.2 million or $0.02 per share for the same period in 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Corporation generated a net income attributable to shareholders of $0.5 million or $0.06 per share compared to a net loss of $17,000 or $0.00 per share for the same period in 2014. \nTo view a full copy of the Corporation's unaudited interim financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 including the Corporation's unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying interim Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\"), please refer to SEDAR's website at www.sedar.com . \nSECOND QUARTER 2015 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS \nThe operating and financial results of the Corporation's investment in associated and controlled entities account for the majority of the Corporation's financial results and are based on the ownership interest in each entity. The following are the operating and financial highlights for the second quarter of 2015 for each of the entities in which the Corporation has an ownership interest: \nSelf-storage facilities The Trust generated funds from operations of $1.1 million in the second quarter which represents an increase of 38% over the $0.8 million generated in the second quarter 2014. A significant portion of the increase reflects the earnings contribution from the three facilities acquired and successfully integrated in the first quarter of 2015; The Trust distributed $236,000 (Q2 2014 - $179,000) to unit holders in the period, representing 4% per annum of invested capital. \nPrivate equity Network Capital Management Inc.'s (\"NCMI\") assets under management of approximately $39.5 million as at June 30, 2015 decreased from approximately $52.8 million as at March 31, 2015 due to the divesture of underlying investments in certain funds and distribution of proceeds to unit holders. A total of $8.6 million was distributed to unit holders during the second quarter of 2015 (Corporation's share - $1.5 million). \nNatural gas assets Shackleton 2011 Limited Partnership (the \"Shackleton Partnership\") generated $0.2 million in funds flow from operations for the second quarter compared to $0.5 million for the second quarter in 2014 as a result of significantly lower natural gas prices and the natural decline of production volumes; Northpoint Resources Ltd. (\"Northpoint\") generated a negative funds flow from operations of $0.5 million in the second quarter compared to a positive $0.5 million in funds flow from operations for the comparable period 2014. The decrease was due to significantly lower natural gas prices realized in 2015 and a decrease in production volumes. Given the severity of the downturn in the energy sector, Northpoint is revising its business plan to address cost cutting measures as well as farm-out drilling strategies to preserve capital and extending debt maturities. \nAs at June 30, 2015, Wilmington had assets under management in its operating platforms of approximately $157 million ($59 million representing Wilmington's share). \nOPERATIONS REVIEW \nSelf - Storage Facilities \nReal Storage Private Trust \nThe Trust (43% owned) owns 23 self-storage facilities comprising 961,421 square feet of net rentable area and an interest in a development project. During the second quarter of 2015, same store occupancy levels averaged 83% compared to 85% in Q2 2014; same store operating margins averaged 57% in Q2 2015 compared to 60% in Q2 2014. The impact of lower occupancy levels and lower margins was offset by rental rate increases and the contribution of the three facilities acquired in the first quarter of 2015. \nThe Trust paid distributions to unit holders in the amount of $236,000 (Corporation's share - $100,000), equivalent to 4% per annum on invested capital during the second quarter of 2015. \nPrivate Equity \nNetwork Capital Management Inc. and Network 2012 Fund \nNCMI (50% owned) had funds under management totaling approximately $39.5 million as at June 30, 2015. The underlying investments in each of the various funds consist of a mix of early stage energy companies and energy service companies. The Corporation invested $8.0 million of capital in the Network 2012 Fund and has received cumulative distributions of $3.0 million to date. NCMI is focused on deployment of capital raised in its most recent fund which closed in the fall of 2014 and continues to monitor investments in its other funds. \nNatural Gas Assets \nShackleton 2011 Limited Partnership \nThe Shackleton Partnership (59% owned) owns and operates a 100% interest in natural gas assets in Southwestern Saskatchewan. The Shackleton Partnership's natural gas production amounted to 536 barrel of oil equivalent per day (\"boe/d\") for three months ended June 30, 2015. The average price realized during the period was $2.69 per mcf and operating netback averaged $1.06 per mcf (realized price of $3.95 per mcf and netbacks of $1.93 per mcf for the comparable period in 2014). The Shackleton Partnership is focused on production optimization through well optimization programs as it continues to weather the depressed natural gas price environment. \nNorthpoint Resources Ltd. \nNorthpoint (38.6% owned) is a privately held natural gas producer with assets in the Altares region of Northeastern British Columbia. In addition and as part of an overall recapitalization plan, in 2013 the Corporation acquired $798,000 (carrying value of nil) of the $5.0 million, 10% debentures issued by Northpoint which mature on August 1, 2017. Northpoint's production for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was impacted by a two week shut down during the quarter and averaged 814 boe/d. The average price realized during the second quarter of 2015 was $3.21 per mcf and operating netbacks averaged $0.08 per mcf (realized price of $4.37 per mcf and netback of $1.97 per mcf for the comparable period in 2014). Northpoint continues to evaluate ways of optimizing its production and improving operating efficiencies during this period of a continued low natural gas price environment. \nOutlook \nThe Corporation continues to execute its long-term strategy of building shareholder value by increasing the Trust's ownership of self-storage facilities through development and acquisition as well as judiciously deploying capital and managing investments in its private equity platform The Corporation's goal of scaling its interest in natural gas assets held through the Shackleton Partnership and Northpoint to the equivalent of 4,000 boe/d is not seen as being viable in the current low natural gas price environment. The Shackleton Partnership and Northpoint combined have production of approximately 1,400 boe/d (Corporation's share - 742 boe/d) and the focus is now on preserving capital and optimizing production. \nFINANCIAL RESULTS \nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (unaudited) (CDN $ Thousands, except per share amounts) For the three months", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-12T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:20:29.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
