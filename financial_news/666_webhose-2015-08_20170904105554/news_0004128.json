Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth The Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance is considering a major reform which would close the loophole that energy giants Chevron, ExxonbMobil and Shell use to claim nearly $3 billion a year of tax-free profits from the funding structure for the Gorgon gas project.\nThe hidden windfall built into the $US56 billion Gorgon project is made possible because the partners – Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell— have loaned $66 billion to their Australian operations at more than 10 times the interest rates that the global groups pay for the funds.\nThe three energy giants charged their Australian subsidiaries $3.1 billion interest in 2014, while their cost of funds appeared to be $200 million to $300 million.\nBut a proposal under review by the corporate tax inquiry would cut the Gorgon partners' allowable interest deductions to just $460 million.\nThe chairman of the corporate tax inquiry, Senator Sam Dastyari, confirmed on Monday that the committee was examining the proposal, which had originally been floated by the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting program (BEPS), to limit the ability of multinationals to load their Australian arms with debt to cut their taxable income.\nAs government members of the committee reportedly pushed back against a number of draft recommendations, chairman Senator Sam Dastyari said the inquiry would look at the proposal in greater detail for the final report.\nGlobal benchmark Under the proposal, multinationals would only be able to claim deductions for interest payments in Australia based on the debt-to-equity ratio of their global operations – a move which would have a devastating impact on the related-party payments by the Gorgon partners.\n Chevron Australia, the Gorgon operator, has a debt to equity ratio of 76.2 per cent—almost 10 times the debt level of its global parent, Chevron Corporation, which has a debt-equity ratio of just 8.5 per cent.\nExxonMobil has a gearing ratio of 11.9 per cent, while its Australian arm is 85 per cent. Royal Dutch Shell, which has 12.2 per cent gearing, has 42 per cent gearing in Shell Australia.\nWhile Chevron Australia has $36 billion in related-party loans, if it was treated as having the same debt-equity ratio as Chevron Corp at 8.5 per cent, only $4 billion of the Australian debt would be counted for tax purposes.\nIts deduction for interest in 2014 would fall from $1.8 billion to just $205 million.\nDrop in deductible interest For the three Gorgon partners taken together, the allowable interest deduction would drop from $3.1 billion to $462 million.\nAn earlier version of the Chevron funding structure, the subject of a current Federal Court case, has been a \"tax product\" marketed to multinationals by accountants, Associate Professor Antony Ting of Sydney University's Law School said on Monday.\nThe gearing restriction, if implemented, \"would largely close the loophole\", Professor Ting said. But he warned it would face an uphill struggle.\n\"The suggestion has met fierce opposition [in the OECD]. The final BEPS report [due next month] is likely to back down on that suggestion, and instead propose a fixed ratio approach [a benchmark ratio on earnings/assets/equity].\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/gorgon_project_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-17T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:04:29.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
