No one ever asked her to move. Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle At the beginning of a new Parliament, MPs are assigned a seat in the House of Representatives.\nIn the days of the Rudd and Gillard governments, when the Coalition found itself staring forlornly at the Treasury benches across the chamber, opposition frontbenchers shuffled, bitterly, in to the House, finding it hard to believe where they were sitting.\nBut not all of them. Bronwyn Bishop, according to one of her colleagues at the time, strutted in with an air of authority well above her lowly portfolio responsibilities: shadow minister for veterans' affairs; shadow minister for seniors and, later, shadow special minister of state.\nAs befitted her station, Bishop had been assigned a spot well down the frontbench pecking order, possibly even on the curved benches in the middle of the chamber where junior frontbenchers are consigned.\nDavid Rowe She was having none of that. With one eye firmly on where the chamber cameras were positioned, and one on the distance to the despatch box – from which frontbenchers speak and move points of order, she marched up towards the Speaker's chair, smiled her most terrifying smile at her colleagues, and plonked herself down in a spot among her seniors. They all sheepishly made way. And that was where she stayed until the 2013 election.\nFinally, after almost 30 years of brazenly pushing her way into camera shot, Bishop this week was left with no choice but to finally disappear .\nBlowback of general resentment The anger and hostility of the community, provoked by her serial and outrageous abuse of entitlements , was only matched by that of MPs on all sides of politics. They found themselves facing a blowback of general resentment against MPs' entitlements, the spectre of tit for tat \"revelations\" and the prospect of a more rigorous expenses system.\n Her Coalition colleagues, however, are even more bitter: her deluded refusal to read the politics of what was happening and stand aside earlier has robbed the government of three precious weeks of the winter break.\nThe momentum that had been building in the government's favour in the wake of Bill Shorten's appearance before the Royal Commission has evaporated.\nThe opportunity to exploit divisions and controversial policies coming out of the ALP national conference has evaporated.\nThere have been plenty of black jokes about senior ministers being in witness protection. There were days when the Prime Minister was nowhere to be seen.\nThis week has seen an attempt to get things going again, with the visit of the cabinet to Adelaide and the announcement of the frigates project. Even the shaming of Labor's Tony Burke over a trip to Uluru in 2012 has not really worked in the government's interests. It has kept the entitlements issue alive and worked against a behind-the-scenes agreement to cease hostilities lest they bring on a conflagration.\nEntitlements review The issue, of course, won't go away. The Prime Minister has called on a \"root and branch\" review of the entitlements system . Bishop still faces investigation and possible action by both the Department of Finance and the Australian Federal Police. But the unresolvable nature of the MP entitlements debate – which ultimately relies on politicians not abusing the system, or even just a bit of political common sense and will to live – means that it is just as likely to continue to flare from time to time.\nHow do you set up a system that can, without fail, only subsidise politicians for the cost of their official duties, when their diaries are always a messy combination of the \"official\", the \"party political\" and the \"personal\", even before politicians get greedy about what they claim?\nParliament's return next week will be dominated by the process of electing Bishop's replacement as Speaker and much palaver about parliamentary standards.\nThis will put on display the Prime Minister's humiliating loss of control over events. Not only can he not make a Captain's Pick for Speaker this time round, he has to make a virtue of being at the mercy of his party room in the decision about who gets this plum job.\nBut this is just a potent symbol of a bigger problem for the Prime Minister and the government, whose policy agenda (whatever that now is) is hobbled in every direction. It has all the political room for manoeuvre of a broom cupboard.\nThe frigates deal is, after all, an attempt to talk South Australia back from the edge of a political cliff. Having dismissed the state's concerns in a most cavalier fashion while the future of the car industry and submarine-building program was up for grabs, the government has discovered a newfound interest in all things crow-eater. But in putting this new investment in South Australia, the government has upset Victoria, which will miss out on work at Williamstown.\nPM naysays IR reform The Productivity Commission emerged this week with its take on industrial relations reform, only to be marginalised within a couple of hours by the Prime Minister who was keen to reassure voters that the government wasn't going anywhere near IR any time soon thanks very much.\nThe government had actually been making some headway on Indigenous affairs, and looking statesmanlike over the referendum on constitutional recognition. But that also went south when it emerged the PM had rejected a push to construct an Indigenous consensus.\nAlso coming up in the next few weeks is the question of what emissions reductions target the government announces ahead of the Paris climate change talks. The Prime Minister really didn't want to talk about that this week either. And it is hard to believe that – given his general position on climate change – there is anything he can announce that will get any widespread endorsement. Things are complicated for the government too on same-sex marriage.\nThe thing is, there are things that the government could be promoting as positives. But the events of recent weeks mean it has lost the upper hand on even these issues.\nConsider the Chinese free-trade agreement. Trade Minister Andrew Robb has been out singing its praises. He even took on Alan Jones on radio this week.\nBut while the government has been urging the private sector, and particularly agricultural groups, to get out and proselytise on the benefits of the agreement, Robb has been virtually left on his own to defend the deal against Labor accusations that it will open the \"floodgates\" to underqualified Chinese labour. Senior ministers arguing the case for the deal, and against the accusations about its impact on the labour market, are nowhere to be seen.\nAnyone would think it must be time to venture back in to the political safety of national security issues.\nLaura Tingle is The Australian Financial Review 's political editor.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-06T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:12:23.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
