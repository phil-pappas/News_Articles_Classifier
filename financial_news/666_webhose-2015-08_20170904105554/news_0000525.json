This new rating demonstrates that the Bank's Management has remained committed to best practice in the areas of corporate governance and risk management.' \nAccording to Moody's, the long-term deposit and issuer ratings of Ba3 reflects the Bank's Systematically Important Bank status in Nigeria as the 5th largest bank in the industry. \nThe Ba3 rating assigned to Access Bank is at the same level as the country's sovereign rating, which is the highest any local bank in Nigeria could attain. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:06:58.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
