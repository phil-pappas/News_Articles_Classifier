The trade-weighted index declined to 69.44 from 69.67. The greenback got a boost from better than expected US non-manufacturing report showing robust activity in the world's biggest economy. Markets are divided on whether the Fed will start raising interest rates from the near-zero policy it's been running since the global financial crisis, and upbeat data is seen as making a hike more likely. Friday's release of non-farm payrolls for July are the next big indicator for the US economy, and will be closely watched after a private payrolls report came in below expectations. \"Overall, these data are consistent with robust economic activity and a further improvement in labour market conditions,\" ANZ Bank said. \"Markets are busy re-pricing Fed expectations, a process that is supporting USD and sending NZD/USD to a new cycle low.\" The kiwi has also been under pressure as slumping global milk prices prompted the Reserve Bank to embark on looser monetary policy in June. This week's latest decline caused local economists to downgrade their expectations for Fonterra's forecast payout to farmers to below $4 per kilogram of milk solids. Fonterra's board will review the price on Friday, which is sitting at $5.25/kgMS. The kiwi fell to 59.63 euro cents from 60.03 cents, declined to 41.60 British pence from 41.96 pence, was little changed at 81.19 yen from 81.15 yen and dropped to 88.39 Australian cents from 88.69 cents ahead of employment data across the Tasman.
