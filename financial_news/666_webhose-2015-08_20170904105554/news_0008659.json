He says most people are thinking about more in the 60% neighborhood, with grants, loans and other sources paying for the remaining 40%. \n\"You're trying to save money for a future major cost,\" says Mark Kantrowitz, senior vice president and publisher of Edvisors.com. \"Saving for the full cost can cause some real sticker shock.\" He compares the cost of college to the cost of a house. No one worries about coming up with the full cost of a house. Instead, they save for a down payment and get a mortgage. Kantrowitz likewise breaks a college education into three parts: past income (savings), current income (salary) and future income (loans). Each should be about a third of the total cost of college. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-31T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:58:54.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
