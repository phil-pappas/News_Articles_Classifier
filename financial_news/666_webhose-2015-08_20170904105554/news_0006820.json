Reuters Share on twitter by Neil Chenoweth The Australian Taxation Office is investigating funding payments for the landmark Gorgon natural gas project that will deliver estimated tax-free profits of more than $60 billion to partners Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell over the life of the development.\nThe three partners book almost $3 billion in profits a year tax free, by charging their Australian arms for related-party loans at more than 10 times the interest rate that the majors paid to third-party lenders in the United States.\nThe energy giants were already a target of the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance, chaired by Senator Sam Dastyari. That inquiry on Monday would file an interim report which was understood to recommend new transparency measures, including public reporting of large tax audits and settlements, a new mandatory tax reporting code for all large companies, and public release of excerpts from confidential country-by-country reporting by multinationals.\nIt was also understood that the report would recommend changes that would force more disclosure by some of Australia's biggest and oldest family companies, including James Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, which would be required to detail related party transactions.\nNext week the inquiry was to move its focus to the $US54 billion ($73 billion) Gorgon project , with Senator Dastyari foreshadowing that the committee would summon executives from the three Gorgon partners for questioning, after Chevron Australia and ExxonMobil Australia revealed their overseas funding arrangements were under review by the ATO.\n\"Frankly they need to front and answer a lot of questions,\" Senator Dastyari told The Australian Financial Review . \"The inter-party loan arrangements don't pass the sniff test and appear to be about minimising tax obligations. This is a worrying development.\"\nWorld's largest Gorgon, which Chevron forecasts would deliver a 13 per cent annual return on equity over the next 40 years, was one of the largest LNG projects in the world.\n Together with the related Wheatstone project, Gorgon had created 17,000 jobs in Australia and would generate more than $380 billion in government revenue between 2009 and 2040, Chevron said.\n\"The Gorgon and Wheatstone projects represent over $80 billion of investment. Chevron Australia's share of this investment is the largest investment by a single company in Australia's history,\" Chevron, which has 47.3 per cent of Gorgon, told the Financial Review . The company declined to comment about the related-party loans.\nIn a curtain-raiser case now before the Federal Court, Chevron Australia was appealing $322 million in assessments on interest payments it made to a US subsidiary a decade ago on a $US2.45 billion loan.\nJustice Richard Edmonds' pending judgment in the case, which was heard last year, was likely to determine how aggressively the ATO could pursue the Gorgon partners, which had $66 billion in related-party loans.\nThe issue at stake was how much energy companies could charge themselves for the risk they carried when they raised US dollar loans for Australian investments.\nInterest of $3.1b In 2014 the three Gorgon partners paid $3.1 billion of interest to related parties overseas, with most of this capitalised to the still-rising debt.\nChevron priced its debt in Australia at the Australian bank bill rate plus a margin, which took the average interest rate for 2014 to 5.25 per cent, on $36.5 billion owing at year's end.\nMuch of the $66 billion that the three Gorgon partners had borrowed from related companies was drawn both from the $US40 billion in cash held by the three global groups, and short-term debt, which last year averaged interest rates of 0.3 per cent.\nExxonMobil Australia had a similar debt structure to Chevron. While Shell's cost of funding was harder to calculate, it appeared that the three Gorgon partners together paid only $200 million to $300 million in 2014 to service their $66 billion debt, delivering an offshore \"profit\" of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion from the Australian interest payments.\n\"It goes to the nub of the issue of the tax debate,\" Michael Croker, head of tax policy for Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and a member of the BEPS advisory committee, said on Sunday.\n\"If you want the big projects, they come at a cost to the revenue base. On the other hand, we really need the impact of these projects.\"\nContinuing profits While US short-term interest rates would rise over the next 40 years of the project, the Australian margin would remain, ensuring continuing profits for the Gorgon partners' parent companies.\nThe partners pay 10 per cent withholding tax on the Australian interest payments, though Shell Australia has reduced some of this by paying $995 million in the last four years to a related company in Luxembourg for cross-currency interest rate swaps â€“ a funding cost that does not attract withholding tax.\n\"Intra-group funding is undertaken in accordance with the 'arm's length principle' set out in local and international tax law, which means the terms and conditions of that funding should mirror those that would be available between independent parties\", a Shell Australia spokesman said.\n\"The use of a cross-currency interest rate swap removes the ups and downs of borrowing in USD but paying tax in AUD. Currently, due to the fall in the Australian dollar, if not for the cross-currency interest rate swap, Shell's local business would potentially have significant tax losses on its USD loans.\"\nExxonMobil declined to comment.\nThe Gorgon partners said the high Australian interest rates were to cover currency fluctuation risk. The Tax Office argued in the Federal Court case that the US dollar loans would be serviced by sales of LNG priced in US dollars, which provided a natural currency hedge.\n\"As one of the Australia's largest investors, Chevron will pay its fair share of tax and, through the Chevron-led Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects, Australia will continue to enjoy the associated economic benefits over the life of the projects,\" Chevron said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/neilchenoweth", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/08aug/gorgon_project_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-08-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T00:06:09.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
