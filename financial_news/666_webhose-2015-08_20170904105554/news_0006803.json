Though Trump has bragged relentlessly about his ties to the school, Wharton has not endeavored in quite the same way. One rare example was in 2007, when Trump was featured in the alumni magazine's list of 125 most influential graduates ; the largely flattering article did note that \"Trump's style has produced doubters.\" \nRichmond said that when he was working at Wharton in the early aughts, Trump was often the subject of campus water-cooler convo, \"but I don't remember being on the road for Wharton and mentioning him as a prominent alum.\" \nIt's not just how often Trump has invoked his alma mater, but that he's done so during the most controversial moments of the campaign. For example, Wharton seemed to be Trump's main argument in his denial that he tried to imply Fox News' Megyn Kelly was menstruating when she asked him a tough debate question two weeks ago. \"On the general belief that any publicity is good, I'm going to say that Trump's invocation of his Wharton background is generally a good thing, and I'll hedge my bets by saying 'mostly positive' rather than 'very positive.'\" -Arnold Rosoff, Emeritus professor of legal studies and business ethics, Wharton \nSure enough, the Trump-Wharton nexus has been treated in mainstream and social media with a nontrivial amount of scorn—directed both at the man and the institution that awarded him a diploma. \n\"Yes, Donald Trump really went to an Ivy League school,\" sneered the headline of a July 17 Washington Post story . \nFollowing Trump's widely condemned remarks questioning the heroism of Sen. John McCain, the comedy website Funny or Die released a parody video profiling Trump's experience as a POW, a \"Prisoner of Wharton.\" <p>Trump&#039;s call to duty</p> <p>Donald Trump&#039;s campaign says he will show up for jury duty in lower Manhattan today.</p> \nWhen Trump mentioned Wharton during his controversial immigration speech in Arizona last month, Austan Goolsbee, President Barack Obama's former top economic advisor, who now instructs at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, tweeted: \"You better believe we will recruit kids to Booth with this.\" \n(Asked by CNBC.com if he was serious, Goolsbee clarified: \"I'm sure it's meaningless in reality.\") \nAn informal survey CNBC.com sent last week to Wharton's faculty produced a fairly even split between respondents who felt that Trump was wounding the school's reputation, positively boosting its exposure, or having no serious effect. (Those who considered him to be an \"embarrassment,\" as one prof put it, were less inclined to speak on the record.) \n\"On the general belief that any publicity is good,\" said Arnold Rosoff, an emeritus professor of legal studies and business ethics, \"I'm going to say that Trump's invocation of his Wharton background is generally a good thing, and I'll hedge my bets by saying 'mostly positive' rather than 'very positive.'\" \nMaurice Schweitzer, who teaches negotiations and management at Wharton, tried to analyze the Trump effect by breaking it down according to the various dimensions of reputation—valence, breadth and consensus. \n\"He's expanding the breadth,\" said Schweitzer. \"He's talking about Wharton, and serious journalists like you are now talking about Wharton. And some people associate Trump with success, and some even like his politics. But, of course, many have negative associations of Trump and he harms our brand when it comes to the work we have done in terms of social impact, diversity and promoting values such as stewardship, leadership and civility.\" ‹", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T21:39:44.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
