Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Australian industries could still be able to offset their carbon pollution by trading international permits, in a sign the Abbott government's new plan to cut emissions by 2030 is going to require additional help.\nIn announcing plans to cut emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by the end of the next decade, Mr Abbott and his ministers said business had been assured that the option of buying such permits had not been shut off and would be re-examined in 2017-18 or later, well after the next federal election.\n\"We have assured business that we will leave that option on the table,\" said Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.\nMr Abbott said he would rather try first to achieve emissions cuts domestically \"rather than get them from other countries\".\nTony Abbott with environment minister Greg Hunt and foreign minister Julie Bishop on Tuesday. Alex Ellinghausen Business groups warn the costs to industry and business will be higher unless they can buy the permits, something Labor has promised as part of its policy.\nAmid scepticism from Labor, industry and environmental groups, Mr Abbott, Environment Minister Greg Hunt and Ms Bishop maintained that Australia could meet its new target, which is lower than that set by most other developed nations, through a combination of measures announced on Tuesday.\n'Technology improvements' key One-third of the post-2020 reductions will rely on the Coalition's existing direct action scheme which uses money from the budget to purchase emissions and include \"safeguards\" which is a market mechanism to ensure emitters stay under a declining emissions cap.\n Mr Abbott said the cost to the budget would be about $200 million a year, or $2 billion over the decade.\nThe next largest contribution would come from yet unknown sources listed by Mr Hunt as \"technology improvements and other sources of abatement\".\nMr Hunt said this could include advances in battery technology to store solar-generated power, as well as \"carry-over\" excess emissions reductions from the pre-2020 period.\nOther reductions would be achieved through such measures as vehicle emissions standards, energy efficiency regulations and changes to the use of ozone and hydrofluorocarbons.\nThe cost to the economy by 2030 would be between 0.2 per cent and 0.3 per cent of gross domestic product, or about $3 billion to $4 billion in today's money, Mr Abbott said.\n\"This is certainly not without cost but the costs are manageable,\" Mr Abbott said.\nMs Bishop will represent Australia at the Paris climate change summit in December but Mr Abbott, who has been criticised for not committing to the summit, said he would attend if other world leaders did so.\nCarbon again election issue The announcement of the policy puts climate change once again front and centre of the next election campaign.\nLabor is promising a low-cost emissions trading scheme which will allow businesses to deal in cheap international permits. But the heavy lifting under Labor will be done through the goal of a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.\nLike the Coalition, Labor believes technology will help deliver much of the increased renewable energy without having to mandate it.\nLabor, which has yet to nominate a 2030 target, says the government's new targets were too low and would not achieve a globally agreed goal to limit the temperature increase to 2°C by 2030.\nOpposition environment spokesman Mark Butler hinted Labor would go to the election with a higher target.\n\"At the end of the day Labor has to get behind a commitment that is credible and consistent with out commitment to the rest if the world,\" he said.\nCost under direct action $250b The Australian Industry Group, which has long been pushing to buy international permits said trying to meet the target through direct action alone would cost between $100 billion and $250 billion. The Climate Institute issued a similar estimate.\nLabor's 50 per cent renewable energy goal would only deliver around a sixth of the emissions cuts sought, the Ai Group says.\n\"The new target is a major step change from anything deliverable by current policies,\" said Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox​.\n\"The numbers are huge and there is a good chance that even tougher targets will be needed to meet the 2 degrees goal shared by all sides of politics to manage the risks of climate change.\nBehind NZ, ahead of China Australia's target of 28 6 per cent, with the option of going to 28 per cent, falls behind the United States (41 per cent), the European Union (34 per cent), and Canada and New Zealand (30 per cent).\nIt is ahead of Japan (25 per cent), Korea (4 per cent) and vastly ahead of China which plans to increase emissions by 150 per cent by 2030.\nMr Abbott and Mr Hunt contended that on a per capita basis, the cuts would be the strongest in the developed world, accounting for 50 per cent per person.\nThe Climate Council called the target \"vastly inadequate\".\n\"Over the next few days, there will be a lot of spin to try and confuse Australians into thinking that we are doing more than we actually are. But no amount of smoke and mirrors will cover up the fact that an emissions reduction target of 40 per cent on 2000 levels by 2030 is the bare minimum and this target is far below that,\" Professor Tim Flannery said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-08-11T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T21:05:17.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
