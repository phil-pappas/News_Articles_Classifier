MUMBAI: Indian banks fear the devaluation of Chinese yuan by 3.5% could aggravate their already bruised balance sheets as the most fragile of the sectors, iron and steel, could be worst hit with dumping from China even though the government has raised import duty. While imports get cheaper, India's exporters, already grappling with an overvalued rupee, will attract more competition in global markets. In terms of the real effective exchange rate, the rupee is overvalued about 10%. \"Steel was already feeling the heat and the devaluation could make it worse,\" said an executive director at a private sector bank who did not want to be identified. \"A lot of capex has happened in the past four to five years. The improvement can come only when the overall demand in the economy picks up.'' Grappling with a tumbling stock market, and a slowing economy due to a collapse in exports, the Peoples Bank of China in the past two days depreciated the Chinese Yuan by 3.5% to make its manufacturers competitive again, and prevent flight of capital. The move is also aimed at making its currency a global one. The Reserve Bank of India in its latest financial stability report singled out the debt-laden iron and steel industry to warn it may become the next Achilles heel for the Indian banking industry. While the industry's share of total bank advances is at 41% of total, steel industry's alone is at 4.61%. Of the total restructured loans, steel sector contributes to more than a tenth of it, said RBI. According to Arundhati Bhattacharya , chairman of the State Bank of India , exports to China could get more difficult expanding the trade deficit with that nation. \"Those exporters who are exporting to China they are having a real big issue, for example, cotton yarn. Cotton yarn had huge exports to China which have come down, other commodities like iron ore even their exports have come down. So you know these are rebalances that are going on in the world.\" SBI exposure to steel sector is little over Rs 75,700 crore while that to textile sector is little over Rs 40,500 crore as on June 2015. China is among the top five countries for Indian exports and India's exports to China declined 19.5% YoY to $11.9 billion in fiscal year 2015. Items with exports over $ 1 bn include cotton, copper and its articles, mineral fuels and oils and organic chemicals. 2  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T02:27:23.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
