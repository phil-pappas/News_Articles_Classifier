Official figures from the Bank of England also show mortgage approvals have risen in most months this year. \nBoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said earlier this month he didn't view the housing market \"with great alarm\". \nA Reuters poll of economists on Wednesday suggested house price growth is likely to slow next year.
