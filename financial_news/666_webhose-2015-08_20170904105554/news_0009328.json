Joe Armao by John Kerin A political brawl over a cancelled Australian border force operation has deepened with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten accusing the Abbott government of shirking responsibility for the \"police state\" tactic and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop moving to further distance the government from the bungle.\nMr Shorten on Sunday said it was not good enough for Abbott government ministers to blame \"mid-level bureaucrats\" for Friday's \"farce \" after a plan for the fledgling immigration authority to conduct random visa checks in Melbourne's CBD had to be abandoned in the wake of spontaneous public protests.\nThe Victorian police pulled the pin on the operation.\nMs Bishop's comments followed Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirming on Sunday his office was sent a briefing note on the operation on Wednesday night but no one had bothered to read it because the operation was considered \"routine\".\nMr Dutton said there had never been any intention for the Border Force to conduct random visa checks during the operation.\nThe spokesman said the information provided was low-level so the note was not reviewed or cleared.\nBut Mr Shorten stepped up his attack on Sunday, saying the tactics of the newly formed Australian Border Force smacked of a police state and the government was attempting to avoid responsibility.\n\"The real issue is Operation Fortitude has become a farce,\" Mr Shorten told reporters on the sidelines of a Labor state conference in Brisbane.\n He said the government was refusing to take responsibility for the error and instead was intent on throwing \"some middle-level bureaucrat under the bus\".\nBut Ms Bishop on Sunday dismissed Mr Shorten's comments as \"complete hyperbole\".\nShe said random visa checks were \"never the intention and that is not government policy\".\n\"This was a poorly worded press release. It was never the intention of border force representatives to randomly stop people in the street.\n\"The Border Force was going to be working with the Victorian police on a whole range of issues, and if people were found to be in breach of their visa conditions, they would have been referred to Border Force... Bill Shorten's reaction is completely and utterly over the top.\"\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott on Saturday also distanced the government from the cancelled operation, saying the agency obviously made a mistake in issuing a poorly worded and over-the-top news release that outlined plans for random spot checks.\n\"We would never stop people randomly on the street and demand their visa details,\" Mr Abbott said.\nHe said press statements were often issued under the authority of agency officials and not the government.\n\"That all happens at arm's length from ministers and at arms length from executive government.\"\nMr Abbott also said those who sought to demean the role of the Australian Border Force should be ashamed of themselves.\nThe Australian Border Force also issued a statement on Saturday, saying \"to be clear, the ABF does not and will not stop people at random in the streets. The ABF does not target on the basis of race, religion of ethnicity.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T18:29:18.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
