The overall financials group climbed 0.5 percent.\nAuto parts maker Magna International Inc gained 2 percent to C$73.73.\nCanada's export sector snapped a five-month losing streak in June, cutting the trade deficit significantly and contributing to a more buoyant tone in the equity market.\n\"A positive export number means potentially positive GDP data, so that means that maybe the consumer is a little bit better off,\" said Bryden Teich, associate portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management.\nBut the bonhomie was broken by retreats in the price of oil, gold, aluminum and copper that weighed on the index's large energy and material sectors.\nNatural gas producer Encana Corp lost 7 percent to C$8.96, miner First Quantum Minerals Ltd fell 6.3 percent to C$9.49, and pipeline company Enbridge Inc declined 1.1 percent to C$58.94.\nOil has fallen 21 percent so far this quarter.\n\"We're trying to figure out which companies can operate and continue to do well in a situation as terrible as this,\" Teich said. He said his firm has positions in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc.\nSix of the index's 10 main groups were in positive territory, with five advancing issues for every four decliners.\n($1=$1.32 Canadian) (Editing by Peter Galloway; Editing by Grant McCool )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T00:27:45.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
