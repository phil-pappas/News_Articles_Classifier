The ASX-listed wine group Australian Vintage has borrowed heavily from a famous Time magazine cover in 2006, which awarded their person of the year to \"You\" in honour of the millions of people around the world who made contributions to user-generated sites on the internet.\nCameron Ferguson, general manager of Australian Vintage's Australian business says the firm spent 15 months in developing its new brand called YOU Wines, including extensive discussions with psychologists and experts on Generation Y in order to try and tap into the digital-savvy younger drinker aged between 18 to 34.\nThis age group is under represented in the consumption of wine compared with cider, spirits and beer. He cited Shopper Tracker research that showed that the 18 to 34 age group makes up 45 per cent of total shoppers in the cider category, 29 per cent in spirits and 22 per cent in beer.\nFerguson says the other alcoholic beverages have been more successful in relating to the Generation Y drinker.\n\"Attracting new, younger consumers to the wine category is essential,\" Mr Ferguson said. It was not enough to rely on old adages that a younger person's tastes would mature over time and they would eventually gravitate to wine.\nAustralian Vintage has struck a deal with Woolworths' Dan Murphys where the new brand at $12.99 per bottle is being sold exclusively through those stores first up. The wines feature bright labels with the word YOU in large letters along with descriptions of character traits it says are related to the Gen Y category.\nThe cabernet sauvignon for example splashes the words and phrases \"Lead the Way\", \"Epic\", \"Distinctive\", \"Friends\" and \"Get Things Done\" across the bottle.\nAustralian Vintage, which is led by chief executive Neil McGuigan, is slowly trying to lift the level of its branded sales and become less reliant on bulk wine sales.\n Its main brands McGuigan Wines, Tempus Two and Nepenthe now make up 60 per cent of the company's total sales. But its share price has been under pressure and now sits at about 40¢. It was trading at 49.5¢ in February, 2015 and has a market capitalisation of about $90 million.\nThe company has just undergone a board transformation, with a former chief executive of the funerals and cremation business, Invocare, Richard Davis, breathing new life into the boardroom after becoming chairman in early June.\nAustralian Vintage marketing manager Scott Burton says there has been previous attempts across the industry in trying to tap into the Gen Y market and the brand was being backed up by a whole range of aspects across digital media including an interactive website.\n\"Certainly most of the past attempts have just been about a funky label,\" he said. Mr Burton won't say what the company is forecasting for sales in the first 12 months. He says the genesis of the name was the famous 2006 Time magazine cover that paid homage to the digital generation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:10:08.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
