PUBLISHED: 17:57, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 | UPDATED: 18:34, Tue, Aug 4, 2015 GETTY The average room in a care home now costs more than double the average pensioner's income \nA third of working Britons say they are reliant on a cash payout from an inheritance to pay off their mortgage and other debts or boost their retirement income. \nBut they could be in for a shock as new research from insurer LV= shows that one in four retired people plans to leave nothing to their heirs. \nMany will give their cash to charity instead, following the lead set by American billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. \nSeparate research shows that where parents do want to leave an inheritance, retirement costs and care home fees are eroding the amount they leave behind. Related articles At last, victory for the Daily Express crusade \nThe number of people leaving significant sums to their children is already falling, LV= added. \nThis spells bad news as one in five workers thinks they would struggle to retire comfortably without the benefit of an inheritance, while a quarter would have to work longer than planned. \nJohn Perks, managing director of LV= Retirement Solutions, says: “People now spend almost as long in retirement as they do in work, so it is worrying to see that so many are reliant on something essentially out of their control to provide them with a comfortable retirement.” \nInstead of depending on a cash windfall, retirees need to start saving. GETTY Industry experts are urging people to start saving in their 20s for a stable retirement “Retirement planning is often at the ­bottom of the to-do list, but it is important that people take steps to secure themselves the lifestyle they aspire to.”\nGrowing numbers of children or grandchildren are seeing their hoped-for inheritance eaten away by expensive care home fees. \nThe average bill for a room in a care home is now £29,389 a year, according to new research from Prestige Nursing + Care. \nThis is more than double the average pensioner income of £14,300, leaving a shortfall of £15,089 a year. \nOver the last year, the average pensioner income has increased by £307, but the annual cost of a care home has leapt by £723. It is terrifying that there are people who have absolutely no savings plan in place for their retirement Nick Hungerford, founder of Nutmeg Government plans to introduce a care cap, limiting the maximum anybody will contribute to their social care costs to £72,000, have been deferred until 2020.\nJonathan Bruce, managing director of Prestige Nursing + Care, says: “It means more people who need residential care will have to bear the brunt of higher costs themselves, especially as council cuts continue to impact eligibility for financial support.” \nRaising the minimum wage will push costs up even higher as care homes have to pay many nurses and care workers more. Bruce says this means even more people will be forced to sell their home to cover the cost of care, again depleting any inheritance. \nNick Hungerford, the founder of investment service Nutmeg, says instead of relying on an inheritance people must build their own savings in a tax-free individual savings account (Isa) or pension to avoid poverty in retirement, adding: “It is terrifying that there are people who have absolutely no savings plan in place for their retirement. \n“That means starting in your 20s, not your 50s, when it is too late for most to build up the budget for a stable – let alone dream – retirement.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T12:14:16.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
