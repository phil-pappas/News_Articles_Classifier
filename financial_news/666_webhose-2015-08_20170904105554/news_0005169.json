It's really what the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people want in the constitution.\" Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Aboriginal leaders say they might be wasting their time supporting recognition after their proposal for Indigenous-only conferences to gain a united position was shot down by Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nNoel Pearson and Patrick Dodson had proposed meetings to decide on an Indigenous consensus on what would be in the constitutional recognition referendum . The move was supported by Indigenous Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda, Labor Senator Nova Peris, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and the Greens.\nLeaders warned, however, that their support for recognition hinged on the proposal for building an Indigenous-only consensus.\n\"If we don't have this convention for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, then I believe we're wasting our time,\" Ms Peris said.\nMr Abbott effectively rejected the proposal, saying Indigenous-only meetings risked creating a list of demands that would break down support for recognition among other Australians.\n\"The risk with an Indigenous-only or even an Indigenous-first process is that it might produce something akin to a log of claims that is unlikely to receive general support,\" he said in a letter to the leaders.\nMr Abbott said he supported building consensus and expected an Indigenous agreement to arise from consultations held in Indigenous areas, but there had to be a \"bipartisan approach\".\n\"I am in favour of building consensus, but strongly believe that this should be a national consensus in favour of a particular form of recognition rather than simply an Indigenous one,\" he said.\n While Mr Pearson said Indigenous people should \"not to drop the bundle over the news\", it affected how Australians approached the Prime Minister's upcoming consultation on recognition.\n\"How do we go to town hall-style meetings without some clarity about where Indigenous Australia stands?\" he said.\nOthers were bitterly disappointed, saying Mr Abbott was ignoring engagement from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\n\"It's hard not to feel some despair right now, when two of our greatest leaders put up a proposal and it's just shot down,\" Mr Gooda said.\nSubstantive change Mr Pearson and Mr Dodson said there was a view growing among leaders at last weekend's Garma cultural festival in Arnhem Land that constitutional change needed to reach beyond the preamble for it to be worth doing.\n\"If there is consensus around anything that I've heard this weekend and I've heard in the lead-up to Garma here is that there's no substantial constituency in Indigenous Australia for just some kind of preamble embroidery,\" Mr Pearson said.\nMr Dodson said the racial discrimination clauses needed to be dealt with.\n\"Unless there is substantive change to our constitution dealing with racial discrimination we continue this historical legacy,\" he said.\nMr Pearson hit out at Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten, saying there was a \"clear absence of leadership\" on the issue.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-03/abbott-stance-puts-indigenous-constitutional-recognition-at-risk/6667662?WT.ac=statenews_nt"], "published": "2015-08-03T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T10:55:03.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
