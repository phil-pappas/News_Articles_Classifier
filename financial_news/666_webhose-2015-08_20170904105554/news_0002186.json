Citi's expense management in the current quarter was further aided by lower legal and related expenses and lower repositioning expenses in Citicorp as compared to the prior-year period, as discussed further below. \n� Continued wind down of Citi Holdings, while maintaining profitability: Citi continued to wind down Citi Holdings, including reducing its assets by $32 billion, or 22%, from the prior-year period. In addition, as previously announced, Citi currently has executed agreements to sell approximately $32 billion of the remaining assets in Citi Holdings, including OneMain Financial, the largest business remaining in Citi Holdings, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. As discussed further below, Citi Holdings also maintained profitability in the second quarter of 2015. \n� Utilization of deferred tax assets (DTAs): Citi utilized approximately $1.5 billion in DTAs during the first half of 2015, including approximately $300 million during the second quarter of 2015 (for additional information, see \"Income Taxes\" below). \nWhile continuing to make progress on these initiatives in the first half of 2015, Citi expects the operating environment during the remainder of 2015 to remain challenging. Overall, economic growth remains uneven across the developed and emerging markets and uncertainty continues as to when interest rates may begin to rise. For more information on these and other trends and risks that could impact Citi's businesses, results of operations and financial condition, see the discussion of each businesses' results of operations, \"Forward-Looking Statements\" and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements below, as well as the \"Risk Factors\" section of Citi's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nSecond Quarter of 2015 Summary Results \nCitigroup Citigroup reported net income of $4.8 billion or $1.51 per diluted share, compared to $181 million or $0.03 per share in the prior-year period. Results in the second quarter of 2015 included $312 million ($196 million after-tax) of CVA/DVA, compared to negative $33 million (negative $20 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014. Second quarter of 2014 results also included the impact of a $3.8 billion charge, which \nconsisted of $3.7 billion of legal expenses and a $55 million loan loss reserve build ($3.7 billion after-tax), to settle legacy RMBS and CDO-related claims, recorded in Citi Holdings. Excluding these items, Citi reported net income of $4.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 billion, or $1.24 per share, in the prior-year period. The 18% increase from the prior-year period was primarily driven by lower expenses, lower net credit losses and a lower effective tax rate (for additional information, see \"Income Taxes\" below), partially offset by lower revenues and a reduced net loan loss reserve release. (Citi's results of operations excluding the impacts of CVA/DVA and the mortgage settlement are non-GAAP financial measures.) Citi's revenues, net of interest expense, were $19.5 billion in the second quarter of 2015, approximately unchanged versus the prior-year period. Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues were $19.2 billion, down 2% from the prior-year period, as Citicorp revenues were approximately unchanged and Citi Holdings revenues decreased 16%. Excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of foreign exchange translation into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes (FX translation), Citigroup revenues increased 3% from the prior-year period, as 5% growth in Citicorp revenues was partially offset by the decrease in Citi Holdings revenues. (Citi's results of operations excluding the impact of FX translation are non-GAAP financial measures.) \nExpenses Citigroup expenses decreased 30% versus the second quarter of 2014 to $10.9 billion. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior-year period, expenses fell 7%, mainly driven by lower legal and related expenses ($360 million compared to $402 million in the prior-year period) and repositioning costs ($61 million compared to $397 million in the prior-year period), as well as the impact of FX translation (which lowered expenses by approximately $681 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior-year period). Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citigroup's expenses declined 1%, mainly driven by the lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs. Excluding the impact of FX translation, which lowered reported expenses by approximately $609 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the prior-year period, Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and related expenses and repositioning costs were largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs. Citicorp expenses in the second quarter of 2015 included legal and related expenses of $297 million, compared to $387 million in the prior-year period, and $34 million of repositioning charges, compared to $354 million in the prior-year period. Citi Holdings' expenses were $1.1 billion, down 78% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, Citi Holdings' expenses decreased 13% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the ongoing decline in Citi Holdings assets. \nCredit Costs and Allowance for Loan Losses Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims of $1.6 billion declined 5% from the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, Citi's total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims declined 2% as a lower net loan loss reserve release was more than offset by lower net credit losses, which declined 12% versus the prior-year period. The decline in net credit losses year-over-year included the impact of classifying OneMain Financial as held-for-sale at the end of the first quarter of 2015. As a result of the held-for-sale accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of OneMain Financial net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue in Citi Holdings during the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of the held-for-sale accounting treatment relating to OneMain Financial, net credit losses of $2.1 billion declined 5% versus the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses declined 17% to $1.8 billion, reflecting continued improvements in both North America Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services in Citicorp and the North America mortgage portfolio within Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of the OneMain Financial classification referenced above. Corporate net credit losses increased to $106 million from $11 million in the prior-year period. The increase related to a limited number of corporate loans, with the vast majority of these net credit losses offset by the release of related, previously-established loan loss reserves. The net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $453 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to a $641 million release in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, the net release of allowance for loan losses and unfunded lending commitments was $453 million compared to $696 million in the prior-year period. Citicorp's net reserve release declined to $282 million from $426 million in prior-year period due to a lower reserve release in North America Global Consumer Banking (GCB), as credit continued to stabilize, partially offset by a larger net reserve release in Institutional Clients Group (ICG), driven by previously-mentioned loan loss reserve releases as well as improvement in the overall corporate portfolio. Citi Holdings' net reserve release decreased 20% to $171 million. Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement, Citi Holdings' net reserve release decreased 37% to $171 million, primarily due to lower releases related to the North America mortgage portfolio, which also had lower net credit losses. For additional information on Citi's credit costs and allowance for loan losses, including delinquency trends in its credit portfolios, see \"Credit Risk\" below. Overall, Citi continues to expect its credit costs could increase during the remainder 2015, driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases. \nCapital Citi continued to grow its regulatory capital during the second quarter of 2015, even as it returned approximately $1.7 billion of capital to its shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases and increased dividends. Citigroup's Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratios, on a fully \nimplemented basis, were 12.5% and 11.4% as of June 30, 2015, respectively, compared to 11.3% and 10.6% as of June 30, 2014 (all based on the Basel III Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage ratio as of June 30, 2015, on a fully implemented basis, was 6.7%, compared to 5.8% as of June 30, 2014. For additional information on Citi's capital ratios and related components, including the impact of Citi's DTAs on its capital ratios, see \"Capital Resources\" and \"Income Taxes\" below. \nCiticorp Citicorp net income increased 27% from the prior-year period to $4.7 billion. CVA/DVA, recorded in ICG, was $303 million ($190 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to negative $32 million (negative $20 million after-tax) in the prior-year period (for a summary of CVA/DVA by business within ICG, see \"Institutional Clients Group\" below). Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp's net income was $4.5 billion, up 22% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower expenses, lower net credit losses and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. Citicorp revenues, net of interest expense, increased 2% from the prior-year period to $17.8 billion. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $17.5 billion in the second quarter of 2015, approximately unchanged from the prior-year period. As referenced above, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of FX translation, Citicorp's revenues grew 5%, mostly driven by growth in ICG. GCB revenues of $8.5 billion decreased 4% versus the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of FX translation, GCB revenues increased 1%, driven by growth in North America GCB and Latin America GCB. North America GCB revenues increased 1% to $4.8 billion as higher retail banking revenues were largely offset by lower revenues in Citi-branded cards. Retail banking revenues increased 11% to $1.3 billion versus the prior-year period, reflecting continued volume growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads. Citi-branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% versus the prior-year period, as the continued impact of lower average loans was partially offset by the impact of 5% growth in purchase sales and an improvement in spreads. Citi retail services revenues were unchanged at $1.6 billion, as spread improvements were offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments. North America GCB average deposits of $171 billion were unchanged year-over-year and average retail loans of $49 billion grew 7%. Average card loans of $106 billion decreased 3%, while purchase sales of $66 billion increased 3% versus the prior-year period. For additional information on the results of operations of North America GCB for the second quarter of 2015, see \"Global Consumer Banking-North America GCB\" below. International GCB revenues (consisting of EMEA GCB, Latin America GCB and Asia GCB) decreased 10% versus the prior-year period to $3.7 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, international GCB revenues increased 1% versus the prior-year period, reflecting a 3% increase in revenues in Latin America GCB and relatively unchanged revenues in Asia GCB (for the impact of FX translation on the second quarter of \n2015 results of operations for each of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB, see the table accompanying the discussion of each respective business' results of operations below). International GCB revenues, excluding the impact of FX translation, mainly reflected modest volume-related growth in Mexico and growth in retail banking (including wealth management) in Asia GCB, partially offset by lower cards revenues and the ongoing impact of regulatory changes in Asia GCB, as well as the impact of the sale of Citi's consumer business in Honduras in Latin America GCB in the prior-year period. For additional information on the results of operations of Latin America GCB and Asia GCB (which includes the results of operations of EMEA GCB for reporting purposes) for the second quarter of 2015, see \"Global Consumer Banking\" below. Year-over-year, international GCB average deposits of $131 billion increased 4%, average retail loans of $101 billion increased 3%, investment sales of $23 billion increased 13%, average card loans of $27 billion increased 2% and card purchase sales of $26 billion increased 5%, all excluding the impact of FX translation. ICG revenues were $8.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015, up 6% from the prior-year period. Excluding CVA/DVA, ICG revenues were $8.6 billion, up 2% from the prior-year period. Banking revenues of $4.4 billion, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans within corporate lending (see below), were largely unchanged from the prior-year period, as growth in the private bank was offset by lower underwriting activity within investment banking as well as the impact of FX translation. Investment banking revenues decreased 4% versus the prior-year period, as a 34% increase in advisory revenues to $258 million was more than offset by a 3% decrease in debt underwriting revenues to $729 million, and a 25% decrease in equity underwriting revenues to $296 million. Private bank revenues, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 13% to $746 million from the prior-year period, driven by increased loan and deposit balances and growth in investments and capital markets products. Corporate lending revenues declined 8% to $379 million, including $66 million of mark-to-market losses on hedges related to accrual loans, compared to a $44 million loss in the prior-year period. Excluding the mark-to-market impact on hedges related to accrual loans in both periods, corporate lending revenues declined 2% versus the prior-year period to $445 million. Excluding the impact of FX translation, corporate lending revenues increased 4% year-over-year, as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. Treasury and trade solutions revenues decreased 1% versus the prior-year period to $2.0 billion. Excluding the impact of FX translation, treasury and trade solutions revenues increased 5%, as continued growth in deposit balances and spreads was partially offset by lower trade revenues. Markets and securities services revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, increased 4% from the prior-year period. Fixed income markets revenues of $3.1 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, decreased 1% from the prior-year period, as continued strength in rates and currencies revenues was more than offset by lower revenues in spread products. Equity markets revenues of $653 million, excluding CVA/ \nDVA, decreased 1% versus the prior year period. The second quarter of 2015 included a charge of $175 million for valuation adjustments related to certain financing transactions. Excluding these adjustments, equity markets revenues would have increased by 26%, mostly reflecting improvement in derivatives. Securities services revenues of $557 million increased 7% versus the prior-year period reflecting increased activity and higher client balances, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. For additional information on the results of operations of ICG for the second quarter of 2015, including the impact of CVA/DVA on the applicable businesses, see \"Institutional Clients Group\" below. Corporate/Other revenues were $370 million, a $281 million increase from the prior-year period primarily driven by gains on debt buybacks and real estate sales in the current quarter, partially offset by hedging activities. For additional information on the results of operations of Corporate/Other for the second quarter of 2015, see \"Corporate/Other\" below. Citicorp end-of-period loans decreased 1% from the prior-year period to $573 billion, as consumer loans decreased 4% while corporate loans increased 2%. Excluding the impact of FX translation, Citicorp loans grew 4%, with 6% growth in corporate loans and 1% growth in consumer loans. \nCiti Holdings Citi Holdings' net income was $163 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss of $3.5 billion in the prior-year period. CVA/DVA was $9 million ($6 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2015, compared to negative $1 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA in both periods and the impact of the mortgage settlement in the prior-year period, Citi Holdings' net income was $157 million in the current quarter, compared to $234 million in the prior-year period, primarily reflecting lower revenues, partially offset by the lower expenses and lower credit costs. Citi Holdings' revenues decreased 16% to $1.7 billion from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the overall wind down of the portfolio as well as the impact of the previously-referenced recording of OneMain Financial net credit losses as a reduction in revenue. For additional information on the results of operations of Citi Holdings in the second quarter of 2015, see \"Citi Holdings\" below. At the end of the current quarter, Citi Holdings' assets were $116 billion, 22% below the prior-year period, and represented approximately 6% of Citi's total GAAP assets and 13% of its risk-weighted assets under Basel III (based on the Advanced Approaches for determining risk-weighted assets). \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA-PAGE 1 Citigroup Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Second Quarter Six Months In millions of dollars, except per-share amounts and ratios 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change Net interest revenue $ 11,822 $ 11,946 (1 )% $ 23,394 $ 23,705 (1 )% Non-interest revenue 7,648 7,479 2 15,812 15,926 (1 )% Revenues, net of interest expense $ 19,470 $ 19,425 - % $ 39,206 $ 39,631 (1 )% Operating expenses 10,928 15,521 (30 ) 21,812 27,670 (21 )% Provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims 1,648 1,730 (5 ) 3,563 3,704 (4 )% Income from continuing operations before income taxes $ 6,894 $ 2,174 NM $ 13,831 $ 8,257 68 % Income taxes 2,036 1,921 6 4,156 4,052 3 % Income from continuing operations $ 4,858 $ 253 NM $ 9,675 $ 4,205 NM Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (1) 6 (22 ) NM 1 15 (93 )% Net income before attribution of noncontrolling interests $ 4,864 $ 231 NM $ 9,676 $ 4,220 NM Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 18 50 (64 ) 60 95 (37 )% Citigroup's net income $ 4,846 $ 181 NM $ 9,616 $ 4,125 NM Less: Preferred dividends-Basic $ 202 $ 100 NM $ 330 $ 224 47 % Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to employee restricted and deferred shares that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends, applicable to basic EPS 64 1 NM 126 64 97 % Income allocated to unrestricted common shareholders for basic and diluted EPS $ 4,580 $ 80 NM $ 9,160 $ 3,837 NM Earnings per share Basic Income from continuing operations $ 1.51 $ 0.03 NM $ 3.03 $ 1.26 NM Net income 1.52 0.03 NM 3.03 1.26 NM Diluted Income from continuing operations $ 1.51 $ 0.03 NM $ 3.02 $ 1.26 NM Net income 1.51 0.03 NM 3.02 1.26 NM Dividends declared per common share 0.05 0.01 NM 0.06 0.02 NM \nStatement continues on the next page, including notes to the table. \nSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA-PAGE 2 Citigroup Inc. and Consolidated Subsidiaries Second Quarter Six Months In millions of dollars, except per-share amounts, ratios and direct staff 2015 2014 % Change 2015 2014 % Change At June 30: Total assets $ 1,829,370 $ 1,909,369 (4 )% Total deposits (2) 908,037 965,725 (6 ) Long-term debt 211,845 226,984 (7 ) Citigroup common stockholders' equity 205,472 202,048 2 Total Citigroup stockholders' equity 219,440 211,016 4 Direct staff (in thousands) 237 244 (3 ) Performance metrics Return on average assets 1.06 % 0.04 % 1.05 % 0.44 % Return on average common stockholders' equity (3) 9.1 0.2 9.2 7.0 Return on average total stockholders' equity (3) 8.9 0.3 9.0 6.9 Efficiency ratio (Operating expenses/Total revenues) 56 80 56 70 Basel III ratios - full implementation Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (4) 11.37 % 10.57 % Tier 1 Capital (4) 12.54 11.35 Total Capital (4) 14.14 12.70 Supplementary Leverage ratio (5) 6.72 5.82 Citigroup common stockholders' equity to assets 11.23 % 10.58 % Total Citigroup stockholders' equity to assets 12.00 11.05 Dividend payout ratio (6) 3 33 Book value per common share $ 68.27 $ 66.64 2 % Ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends 3.05x 1.57x 3.09x 2.08x \n(1) Discontinued operations include Credicard, Citi Capital Advisors and Egg Banking credit card business.
