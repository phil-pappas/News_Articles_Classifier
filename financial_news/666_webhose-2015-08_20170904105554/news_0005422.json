We are not providing any further details at this time,\" it said.\nFIFA was thrown into turmoil in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences.\nThe charges included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering.\nVisa and McDonald's did not initially respond to requests for comment on the meeting.\nFIFA has set up a new Reform Committee, headed by former International Olympic Committee (IOC) director general Francois Carrard.\nHowever, critics say it lacks independence as it is made up mostly of members of the continental confederations who also elect the members of the executive committee.\nThe executive committee is itself one of the main targets for reforms.
