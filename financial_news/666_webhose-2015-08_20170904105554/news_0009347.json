On the material day, a presenter of TBC 1 while reviewing newspapers is said to have misled the public by reading second-lead stories and purporting them to be main stories. \nMr Bgoya noted that while Nipashe's lead story that day was 'Mafuriko Mbeya' which was accompanied by a picture of a crowd of people at a political rally by Chadema presidential candidate Edward Lowassa, the announcer read another story from the same paper with a headline 'Mbarawa atoa elimu ya mtandao.' \n\"And again while reviewing Majira newspaper; the presenter implied that a story headlined 'CCM yapuuza wanaohamia Ukawa' was the main story rather than the lead story of that day which carried a headline \" Mbeya kwafurika\" accompanied a picture of Mr Lowassa's supporters. \n\"What TBC 1 did was violations of sections 6 (2) (b), 6 (2) (c) and 6 (3) of Broadcasting Regulations of 2005,\" he explained. According to Mr Bgoya, the management of TBC 1 was summoned before the committee in which they denied any wrongdoing. \n\"The committee nevertheless has satisfied itself that the television station contravened the regulations and thus a stern warning. Further legal actions will be taken if they repeat the same mistake,\" he warned.
