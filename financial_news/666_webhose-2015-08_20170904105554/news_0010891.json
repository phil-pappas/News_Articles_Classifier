Yet delays have meant that the plant, which South African authorities call the country's largest coal-fired station, will be fully operational some seven years late. \nThe new plant's first unit began operating in March and its 749 megawatts of electricity should help ease the stress on the country's troubled electrical grid. \nAnother coal-fired plant is under construction in Kusile, east of Johannesburg, and it is expected to pump out a flow of electricity similar to Medupi, but that project has also been hampered by major delays. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's too premature to say that it's the end of load shedding with this inauguration,\" energy specialist Chris Yelland told AFP. \n\"On Monday, a unit of the Koeberg power plant will be shut down for maintenance for three months,\" he said, referring to the country's only nuclear station north of Cape Town. \nSouth Africa's ongoing electricity woes have undermined economic growth, disrupting the manufacturing and mining sectors especially hard. \nIn May, Statistics South Africa fingered the rolling power cuts for slowing the country's growth to a disappointing 1.3 percent in the first months of 2015. The country's annual production is about 40,000 megawatts. \nEskom generates more than 95 percent of South Africa's electricity and has been weakened by years of underinvestment, ageing coal-fired infrastructure and governance problems (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-30T21:51:03.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
