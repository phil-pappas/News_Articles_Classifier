ANZ Bank noted that, even after four interest rate cuts since November, the negative producer price index (PPI) was keeping real borrowing costs elevated. \n\"With the PPI at minus 5.4 percent y/y in July, the real interest rate costs could be well above 10 percent,\" it said. \n\"We believe that the traditional monetary policy easing, such as cutting RRR (reserve requirement ratio) and lowering the interest rate, is not sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with China's highly leveraged economy,\" it added. \nSURPRISE DEVALUATION \nConcerns about China's economy intensified after factory activity shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years and the central bank unexpectedly devalued its yuan currency earlier this month. \nThere is, however, little evidence that the stock market mayhem has hit consumer spending so far. \nConfidence among Chinese consumers rose for the third consecutive month in August, according to a Westpac MNI survey, as household finances continued to improve. \nOCBC Bank noted that cuts in the RRR were needed to ease the liquidity pressures created by capital outflows that had been exacerbated by the yuan devaluation. It said it expected at least another 100 basis point cut this year. \nJapanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp highlighted the problem manufacturers in China face, with its sales faltering as the economy slows. It said on Wednesday it needed to adjust its production capacity in the country, which was roughly twice what it could sell. \n\"Currently, there is still downward pressure on China's economic growth,\" the central bank acknowledged on Tuesday. \nInvestors are also concerned that China is growing at a much slower pace than the official 7 percent target for 2015. \nDespite that, a majority of economists predict a continued deceleration - rather than a crash - for China's economy, and most dismiss comparisons with the 2008 global financial crisis or the 1997/98 crisis in Asia. \n\"The upshot is that there is no sign in the recent data of a deepening economic crisis,\" wrote analysts at Capital Economics. \"With policy support gathering force, a rebound in growth still looks the most likely outturn for the next couple of quarters.\" \n(Additional reporting by Pete Sweeney in Hong Kong, Nathaniel Taplin and Kazunori Takada in Shanghai and Koh Gui Qing in Beijing; Writing by Will Waterman; Editing by Alex Richardson)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T11:58:57.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
