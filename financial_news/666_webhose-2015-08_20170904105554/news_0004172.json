Furthermore, UHY will soon also be adding a firm in Tanzania and not to overlook our strong established presence in Kenya, represented by UHY Kenya.” says Ladislav Hornan, chairman of UHY.\nAMO Certified Public Accountants is based in Zambia’s capital Lusaka. The firm provides audit, tax, business consulting, payroll and forensic accounting services to a portfolio of clients based locally and in neighboring South Africa, Mozambique, Botswana and Zimbabwe primarily in the construction, leasing/insurance and wholesale/retail sectors.\nManaging partner Dion Banda of AMO says: “The global presence of the network combined with its reputable brand not only elevates our own corporate culture and status to a strong internationally focused firm but also provides further reassurance to global clients seeking investment in the region.”\nST & Associates, based in Uganda’s capital Kampala, brings to UHY great local knowledge and expertise especially in the oil, gas and minerals sector as the only local independent firm registered with the Uganda Chamber of Mines and Petroleum. The firm provides audit, bookkeeping and tax services to a portfolio of clients in additional sectors such as construction, tourism, manufacturing and Not for Profit/NGO industries.\nChief executive officer Sam Thakkar of ST & Associates says: “Our membership of the UHY global network will enhance our local capabilities and enforce our commitment to support international clients seeking to invest in East Africa.”\nHornan further comments: “Investments in infrastructure, especially in mining, power generation and roads, ensure that growth remains robust in Zambia, creating opportunities for foreign investments. Uganda, as a country still has its challenges, but ‘Uganda Vision 2040’ aspires to transform the country. Currently the country’s capability to manage reform, privatization and development, especially in the oil and gas sector, combined with rapid urbanization and infrastructure programs maintain an upward economic growth pattern. We are delighted AMO and ST & Associates have joined the UHY network reinforcing our African market coverage for the benefit of our international client base and potential investors.”\nThe new member firms will soon be adopting the UHY branding.\nAbout UHY LLP\nUHY LLP, a licensed CPA firm, provides audit and other attest services to publicly traded, privately owned and nonprofit organizations in a number of industry sectors.
