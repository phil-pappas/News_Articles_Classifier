The UNEP study also called for Shell's clean-up methods to be urgently overhauled, including reviewing its methodology and addressing serious delays in responding to spills. \nBut researchers from Amnesty International investigating spill sites in the region have this month found oil on the soil and in nearby water bodies, in areas where Shell contractors are reported to have recently carried out remediation. \nThe fund will be overseen by representatives of the Ogoni people, the United Nations, the oil companies operating in Nigeria and the government itself. According to the government, \"stakeholders\" will pay an initial $10 million into the fund, but it is not clear who these stakeholders will be. \n$10 million is far below the $1 billion that the UNEP said should be paid into the fund to cover the first five years of a clean-up job which could take up to 30 years. The UNEP study recommended that the contributions should be made by both the oil industry and the government. \n\"Ogoniland has been devastated by years of oil spills and Shell's clean-up operations have been utterly ineffective,\" said Mark Dummett. \n\"In 2011 UNEP highlighted numerous serious problems with the way Shell cleans up oil sites. But we have visited multiple sites and found oil pollution lying all around. From what we are seeing, little has changed since then.\" \nBackground \nA government press statement on Wednesday said that President Buhari \"approved several actions to fast-track the long delayed implementation\" of the UNEP report including the establishment of the fund. \nThe establishment of the fund was a key demand of Nigerian and international organizations, including Amnesty International, who wrote a joint letter to President Buhari requesting such action on 4 August 2015 four years after the UNEP's report was published. \nShell was forced to leave Ogoniland in 1993, but its pipelines run through the area and it is responsible for leakages from these pipes. \nOgoniland is only one part of the Niger Delta that has been affected by oil pollution. Royal Dutch Shell and the Italian multinational oil giant ENI have admitted to more than 550 oil spills in the Niger Delta last year, according to an Amnesty International analysis of the companies' latest figures. By contrast, on average, there were only 10 spills a year across the whole of Europe between 1971 and 2011.
