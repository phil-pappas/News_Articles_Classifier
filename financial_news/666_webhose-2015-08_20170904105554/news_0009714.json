Ensure You and Your Spouse Agree... Fully \nIf only one of you wants to go, when stressful situations arise (and they will), they will most likely cause problems in your relationship. Few things are worth that. However, if you have a good relationship, we moving overseas can strengthen bonds. \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nOne married, semi-retired American woman in the 45-64 age group described moving abroad as a \"leap of faith\" that requires \"self-confidence and confidence in your partner/spouse.\" The woman has lived in Nicaragua for more than two years. \"You are often each other's sole support in your new home,\" she said. \"The adventure, fun and experiences are all the more wonderful when you can share them with a loved one or significant other.\" 2. Consider How You Would Cope With Moving To Another Area In Your Own Country \nIf you had to move today from your home to another region within your own country, would it stress you out? Is finding a new dry cleaner or the location of the bank something that fills you with anxiety? If this is the case, you will be even more unhappy moving overseas because every place you'll move will have these issues, plus many more. \nA number of expats emphasized the need to conduct a brutally honest self-assessment. How well do you deal with a different culture and way of doing things? Are you eager to understand and experience new cultures with an open mind, to find what is good in them and accept the rest (even if you don't agree), or do you tend to judge how good or bad everything is based on the standard of what you're used to? The honest answer to this question will largely determine how well you do overseas. 3.
