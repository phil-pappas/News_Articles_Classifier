Jamila Toderas by Joanna Mather and Sally Rose A nurses union has claimed victory for pressuring health super fund HESTA to divest its $23 million stake in detention centre operator Transfield.\nThe HESTA board, which denies that pressure from unions motivated the decision, has been subject to a two-year campaign by the Victorian branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, among others.\nTransfield has contracts to operate contentious offshore detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island, and its shares have risen 45 per cent since it won a $1.2 billion contract in February 2014.\n\"This is a victory for members who were opposed to offshore processing, the detention of children, the elderly and the mentally ill, and disturbed by the serious concerns raised by both the United Nations and the Australian Human Rights Commission,\" Victorian secretary Lisa Fitzpatrick said.\nFirst State Super CIO Richard Brandweiner said the decision did not go to the board. Daniel Munoz \"It also means that both HESTA and First State Super no longer have stock in Transfield Services.\"\nNot discussed by board First State Super is another fund with many nurse members. First State Super Chief Investment Officer Richard Brandweiner told The Australian Financial Review in a statement that the fund had not held Transfield shares \"for some time\".\n\"The matter has not been raised or discussed at the board,\" he said. \"Rather, this was reflective of our normal investment decision-making processes.\"\n The \"HESTA divest\" campaign has a website that encourages people to write to members of the HESTA board. The HESTA board has an independent chairwoman, five union representatives and six employer representatives.\nThe campaign's latest online briefing says HESTA began buying tranches of Transfield shares in March 2014. By December of that year, HESTA had acquired enough safes to become a substantial shareholder, requiring its holding to be disclosed to the Australian Stock Exchange.\n\"HESTA has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of fund members,\" the briefing says.\n\"HESTA's shares in Transfield Services represent losses for its members. HESTA should not be continuing to risk the retirement savings of its members to bolster a company which is involved in running mandatory detention centres.\"\nHESTA chief executive Debby Blakey denied that pressure from unions or other interest groups had motivated the decision to divest from Transfield.\n\"Divesting from Transfield was not a rash decision. We engaged with company for over 18 months, first though Australian Council of Superannuation Investors and later through our investment managers and directly. We followed a formal escalation process as we reviewed the evidence\".\nMembers 'horrified' She also denied that the decision was motivated by morals or politics.\nMs Fitzpatrick said union members were \"horrified\" by Human Rights Commissioner Gillian Triggs' report into children in detention.\nThey were also angry at how Professor Triggs had been treated by the Abbott government and resented new legislation that will impose jail terms on health staff who disclose information about the centres.\n\"I think our members can be very pleased that their concerns have been listened to,\" Ms Fitzpatrick said.\n\"Our members oppose these [centres] on humanitarian grounds and i think they can be very pleased the that major funds that most Victorian nurses have their superannuation with do not have holdings in Transfield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T16:48:33.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
