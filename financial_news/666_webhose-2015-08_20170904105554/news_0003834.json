By Roland Head | Fool.co.uk â€“ 22 minutes ago 3.98 -0.4200 \nTwo of the most closely-watched stocks by private investors are Jubilee Platinum (LSE: JLP) and Gulf Keystone Petroleum (LSE: GKP). \nBoth companies have delivered a roller-coaster ride for shareholders in recent months. Both firms could, arguably, deliver transformative news over the next few months. \nGiven this, is now the time to increase your holding or should you hedge your bets and take some money off the table? \nIn this article I'll take a closer look at both stocks and explain the risks and opportunities which lie ahead. \nGulf Keystone Petroleum \nThe combination of falling oil prices, $527m of costly debt and around $100m of customer arrears has left Gulf Keystone in financial distress. \nLast week's news that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has promised to start paying contractors for oil exports from September onwards came in the nick of time, but most of the share price gains that were triggered by this news have already fallen away. \nWhy is this? I can see two possible reasons. One possibility is that the KRG won't pay at all. I don't think this is likely. \nA second and more likely explanation is that with Brent crude trading below $50 once more, the market has judged that even if the KRG does pay up, the money won't be enough to keep Gulf afloat without additional new financing, or a farm-out deal of some kind. \nThis is my view. The KRG has said it will allocate a portion of the revenue from oil exports to cover oil producers' \"ongoing expenses\" . \nIt seems very likely to me that this won't be enough to help fund the repayment of Gulf's debts, or the investment required to build the facilities needed to expand Shaikan production towards its 100,000 bopd target. \nI wouldn't put new money into Gulf at the moment. \nJubilee Platinum \nJubilee has been raising cash by selling non-core assets and working to raise new debt funding. \nThe firm's goal is fund the development of two surface tailings projects (extracting platinum from mining waste) which the firm said in February could generate annual operating cash flow of $14m. \nThe problem is that these calculations were based on a platinum price of $1,250 per ounce. Platinum is currently trading at just $970 per ounce. In the same presentation, Jubilee also said the platinum price [in February] was \"currently lower than sustainable\" . \nAt the time, platinum was trading at around $1,200 per ounce, 20% higher than today's price. Given that the platinum market appears to be quite well supplied, there's not necessarily any reason to expect a sharp rise in the price of platinum. \nAnother concern is that Jubilee has not yet completed the debt funding it will need to develop its surface projects, although the firm says a final decision is close. \nMy concern is that Jubilee could get the funding it needs, but like Gulf Keystone, be left with production revenues that are insufficient to repay its debt or fund future investment. This could leave shareholders out of pocket, while the firm's lenders are repaid. \nIn my view, now would be a good time to take some money off the table at Jubilee, in case platinum prices stay low for longer than expected. \nUltimately, Gulf Keystone and Jubilee offer the potential for staggering profits -- and painful losses. \nIn my view, the best way to own these companies is alongside other, less volatile shares which offer more reliable returns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T16:17:44.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
