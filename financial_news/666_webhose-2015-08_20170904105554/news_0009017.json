He will take a small group of business leaders, including representatives from Royal Dutch Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) and other companies, with him on the trip, according to the source. \nThe British minister will have meetings with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Ali Akbar Velayati, who is a senior adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. \nWith the business delegation, Hammond will meet the Iranian ministers of industries and business, petroleum and transport. \nEMBASSY RANSACKED \nUntil a new ambassador is announced, the embassy will be led by Ajay Sharma, until now the non-resident chargé d'affaires. \nIranian protesters stormed two British diplomatic compounds in Tehran in November 2011, smashing windows, torching a car and burning the British flag in protest against sanctions imposed by London. \nThere had been regular protests outside the British embassy over the years since the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .-backed shah, but none were as violent as the 2011 storming. \nPrime Minister David Cameron called the attacks \"outrageous and indefensible\" at the time and scolded the Iranian government for failing to defend British staff and protect the imposing building. \nProtesters smashed the stone lion and unicorn on the embassy gates at the ambassadorial residence, where in 1943 a dinner was held for Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- the first meeting between the leaders of Britain, Russia and the United States to discuss their strategy for winning World War Two. \nProtesters looted the embassy and smashed some treasures. A portrait of Queen Victoria was torn in two, the head was cut out of a portrait of Edward VII and a picture of Queen Elizabeth was stolen. \nBritain responded by shutting Iran's embassy in London and expelling its diplomats.
