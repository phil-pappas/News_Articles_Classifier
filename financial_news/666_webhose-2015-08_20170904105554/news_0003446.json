The People’s Bank of China cut the yuan’s daily reference rate by the most in two decades to combat a slump in exports, dragging down Asian currencies and pulling stocks lower in the U.S. and Europe.\n“It weakens the case for the Fed,” said Jim Vogel, head of interest-rate strategy at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. “China was weaker than people thought and it will take longer for commodity demand to pick up.”\nTen-year U.S. note yields fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.15 percent at 9:33 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2.125 percent security due May 2025 climbed 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 3/4.\nU.S. two-year yields, among the most sensitive to interest-rate expectations, declined five basis points to 0.67 percent.\nImporting Deflation “Some of it is about risk aversion and some is about economic expectations,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, which manages $61 billion in assets. “Devaluation of the Chinese yuan is a way for the U.S. to import deflation from China.”\nTraders are pricing in a 46 percent chance the Fed will raise borrowing costs at its September meeting, based on the assumption that the benchmark rate will average 0.375 percent following the increase, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s down from 54 percent on Aug. 7.\nThe probability of the Fed’s rate being lifted further by March slipped to 51 percent from 58 percent at the end of last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Policy makers have kept the U.S. benchmark interest rate near zero since 2008 to support the world’s largest economy.\nThe U.S. is set to auction $64 billion of coupon-bearing debt this week in three parts, beginning with a sale of three-year notes on Tuesday. Such securities were last sold on July 7 with a yield of 0.932 percent and yielded 1.03 percent in pre-auction trading.\n\",\"byline\":\"Susanne Walker Barton and Lucy Meakin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T18:04:33.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
