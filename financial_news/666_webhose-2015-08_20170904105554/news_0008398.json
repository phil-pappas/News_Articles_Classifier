Online is changing some of these disadvantages by offering ways of raising the profile and getting musicians live work. It won't transform things by next Monday but may in the longer term. Russell Southwood spoke to two of the new players in Uganda, Feza and HiPipo. \nFezah is a mobile first platform for booking a band or a DJ for an event: you can be anybody from a venue wanting to put on live music to someone wanting a band at your wedding. Co-founders Ham Namakajjo and Elijah Kitaka have created an Android app (www.fezah.com) where you can look through the profiles of musicians and DJs, listen to samples of their music, see videos of them performing and in time, read booker feedback.

We hold on to the money until the performance has been given and then give it to the artist\". Like physical agents, they take a commission on the performance fee. \n\"We were both colleagues at Google and there was a lot of talk about (Internet) infrastructure and the problems around the relevance and impact of the Internet. We thought how do we help the unemployment problem and basically make some social impact.\" \nTheir first idea was a crowdfunding platform for social projects which wanted to attract projects worth funding:\"We were ahead of our time and the project amounts were to large. So we went back to the drawing board... Elijah has a music background and I'm an amateur DJ so that's why we thought of starting Fezah\". \nThey launched a private beta version in May 2015 and kept it below the radar for a couple of months to ensure the app was stable and to get feedback from initial users. \nCurrently there are 60 artists from Uganda but the number is growing. These musicians range from the very well known to the frankly obscure. One of them - the saxophonist Michael Kitanda - they helped raise money for an album of his during their crowdfunding platform days. \nThey want to expand the platform into Nairobi and Lagos where they already have contacts on the ground and by the end of the year they want to bring in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Their CMO and another of the co-founders is based in Lagos. \nMarketing is done in a targeted physical way with hotels, restaurants and bars and they hope to sell to places with multiple outlets like the Java coffee shops. They have also been targeting brands and corporates through their advertising agencies and working with two agencies that do event planning and product launches. \nAt a consumer level, they are focused on weddings and venues that host them, as there are plenty of them:\"We want to build brand recognition and awareness through Google display ads and Facebook.\" \nSo what happens with payment?:\"We eventually want to integrate it online but payment is currently a bit broken. Right now you can request a booking and we sort it. You can then either pay using mobile money or a bank transfer. The transactions are not in real time. They're hybrid transactions... Longer term, if you want to book an artist, you can do it in a way that is as frictionless as possible\". \n\"The booking layer has not been built yet like the Buy Now button. Ideally you should be able to watch a video on You Tube and if you like this artist, be abe able to have a button that can book them. That's where we see Fezah headed in the future. 90-99% of musicians make money from private events.\" \nInnocent Kawooya runs something that you might easily dismissed as just another music and celebrity blog but is really something more that tag conveys. HiPipo (www.hipipo.com) is by its own description \"a digital music and events company that is developing the first ever social media music entertainment network.\" The website started by offering music as ringtones and is developing MP3 downloads off of its website. It has Top 20 videos, audios and artists. \nIt runs awards events that identify which consumer brands and artists are doing well on social media, things like the Top 20 Artists in East Africa, the Top 20 Corporates in East Africa and Digital Impact Awards Africa. \nLaunched in 2007, the organization has morphed over the years from an award-winning start-up offering free health and education information into the current content marketing events company. It has ambitious plans to take the Digital Impact Awards Africa more widely know across the continent and become a reference site for music across the continent. \nThese kinds of websites begin to offer music lovers a clearer way of understanding which artists are which and a way of getting more information (for which read mostly gossip) about their favorites. Radio DJs may play the music and comment on it but it's often a much narrower window than the totality of what people like out there. Africa's music biz has started the online journey and it will change how business is done and the relationship with music lovers and fans.
