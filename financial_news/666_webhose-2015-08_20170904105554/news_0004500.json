I took his advise and put my life savings into gold at $1,944. \nThis scary short story came from oakvilleon and man I believe I uttered a blood curdling scream when I first read it. Whoever gave that advice really should be in a different line of business. I Know What You Did With your Money! \nThe second horror story goes this way: \nIt was late in 2007, I had just been retired, the decision was to keep my pension plan or get paid out. Adviser said “we can beat those returns”, yah right! \nWayne Stuart left this one, and it really hit a horrified chord with me because I had the same kind of decision to make with my pension money when I got laid off, luckily I got some better advice. \nWayne and Oakvilleon have been informed and soon a boxed copy of Quicken 2013 will be whisking it’s way to them. \nThere were other strong horror stories that I include in this post, for your horrified reading pleasure: \nBought Nortel @ $10 (after it went down from $100). Still “own” it. \nCBor was almost a winner with that one, as I did the same mistake, horrifying! \nThe Debt Collector snarled, “Pay up now; you know we are just going to keep calling until you pay us!” Sure you will, right up until I declare bankruptcy, that is!”, I replied. \nNot as much scary as ironic, in my opinion, but still scary in it’s own way from Denis . \nI knew it was the biggest financial commitment I would ever make in my lifetime. Can we afford the mortgage and other financial commitments of a $2,000,000 house? \nHoly mother of pearl, $2,000,000 house? This nail biter from Adam had me screaming WHY????", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T03:50:22.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
