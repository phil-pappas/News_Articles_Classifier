It was money, he says, that was \"too tempting not to spend\". Manfred Gottschalk 'Far from world best' Half of all Australians of working age were not in the workforce in 1990-91, the time of the last recession.\n\"As a result of that complacency, Australia can no longer claim to be world-best in our policy design, and we are far from world best in our economic performance, notwithstanding that we avoided much of the impact of the global financial crisis.\"\nDr Parkinson writes that unlike the 1980s and 1990s the community doesn't have any \"sense of a burning platform\" to drive the changed needed for future success.\nDr Parkinson argues that while the current situation is not a simple re-run of the late 1970s and early 1980s era, the nation stands at a similar crossroads, at which decisions taken today will affect opportunities over the coming decade. The former treasury boss blames the current structural budget deficit on the flood of revenue that surged into Canberra after 2003, with the commodity boom. It was money, he says, that was \"too tempting not to spend\".\nAs a result, spending has outpaced gross domestic product, with tax cuts under Howard, Costello, Rudd and Swan becoming an \"almost mandatory part of the annual budget\". \"While the outlays increases and tax cuts were permanent, the revenue to pay for them was not.\"\nNow that the terms of trade are in decline, Dr Parkinson predicts that absent productivity improvements, growth in living standards will slow dramatically, and even fall in some years, making the task of budget repair even more difficult.\n\"When voters experience slowing growth in living standards they are likely to look to government to cushion this, yet government at all levels lack the fiscal room to ease the impact on the community,\" he writes.\nDr Parkinson says: \"Climate change poses risks to which financial market regulators and company boards have, to date, given little attention.\" Alex Ellinghausen Dr Parkinson argues that while the current situation is not a simple re-run of the late 1970s and early 1980s era, the nation stands at a similar crossroads, at which decisions taken today will affect opportunities over the coming decade.\nClimate, technology, aging, Asia He lists the biggest long-term trends of coming decades as climate change, water and energy security; aging populations; technological upheaval; and the global economic shift to towards emerging economies, particularly in Asia.\nThe outlook for thermal coal is one of the riskiest areas for the economy, he says, with pressure likely to increase on removing the energy source's \"social licence\".\nOn climate policy, he says â€‹\"both Canada and Australia, like many other countries, are likely to end up with a sub-optimal patch-work quilt of initiatives whereas a coherent, national response could deliver more effective emissions reductions at lower cost.\n\"More generally, climate change poses risks to which financial market regulators and company boards have, to date, given little attention.\"\nOn the growing rise of disruptive technology, Dr Parkinson warns that Australia's ability to respond will depend on its human capital.\n\"This suggests a renewed focus on the teaching of [science, technology, engineering and maths] should be a policy priority.\"\n'True leadership required' Dr Parkinson concludes Australia has been slow to grasp the opportunities of climate change, population ageing, rapid technological change and Asia's relative rise in economic weight.\n\"We are vulnerable to negative developments from all four, and have been slow to pursue countervailing opportunities.\"\nHe says this is despite the fact that the economy's potential growth rate may have slowed from a commonly accepted 3 per cent pace to 2.5 per cent, a concern recently highlighted by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens .\nThe drop means the economy will be around 5 per cent smaller than otherwise over the course of a decade, a gap akin to the loss of GDP from a recession.\nA slower potential growth rate also means Treasurer Joe Hockey's assumptions about a return to budget surplus may be at risk and suggests the structural budget deficit is even larger than currently estimated, he writes.\n\"Our political discourse is failing to provide the public with an explanation of global or national economic developments, or a roadmap for the future.\n\"This vacuum of leadership, and the tendency to talk rather than act, is facilitating the emergence of a wide array of voices on policy directions.\n\"But rather than being a healthy sign of a national discourse, the diffusion and fragmentation of debate is allowing groups to conflate their own personal interests with the national interest.\n\"True leadership from the political class is required to move the debate to the workable centre from where reform in Australia has always been driven.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:08:51.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
