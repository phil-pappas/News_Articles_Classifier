There has been no official report on the number of casualties from the Liberia National Police. The accident, which occurred between Gbartala and Zeanzue highway, involved a bus of the National Transit Authority (NTA) with plate number 5138. FrontPage Africa has gathered that the bus was traveling from Monrovia to Ganta when it skidded off the road and somersaulted. \nEyewitnesses account attributed the cause of the accident to reckless driving. It was further gathered that US$1,200 and eight mobile phones belonging to victims were retrieved from the scene of the accident. The accident comes barely two weeks after six persons died in another accident on the same highway. Passengers in other vehicles slowed down and wailed over the horrible deaths along the roadside. \nThe accident caused a heavy traffic jam, as personnel of the Federation of Road Transport Union (FRTUL) Bong branch stopped vehicular movement on both sides of the highway to avoid further disaster. FRTUL personnel and the police had mounted rescue operation at the scene of the accident. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, while the road was being cleared to create access for vehicles. Also, firefighters arrived later and battled to extinguish the fire caused by the explosion of the bus. \nA passenger, who was travelling to Gbarnga from Monrovia, said they were stuck in traffic for close to four hours because of the accident. \"We were in one spot for about two hours. Movement on both sides of the road was stopped by FRTUL personnel. We had to make a detour through a bush path, through villages to cross the scene of accident,\" he said. \nHighway to the Grave? \nThe Gbarnga-Monrovia highway, still under construction, has become a death trap. It records several ghastly auto accidents almost on a weekly basis with several deaths. Commuters that ply the very busy highway have become endangered due to the high rate of accidents on the road that service Gbarnga, Ganta, Grand Gedeh and sometime Grand Bassa routes via Monrovia. The accident prone highway has now become a source of concern to road users. \nBefore the contract for the construction of the road could commence, the route was dreaded especially during the evening hours due to heavy traffic. Commuters sometimes spend as much as six hours on a journey that would otherwise take three hours. The award of the contract therefore came as a respite. Upon completion, the road would become a 2-lane highway. \nHowever, the road, which has achieved over 45 per cent completion, has become a death trap of some sort. Instead of going at snail speed as it was in the past, commuters hurry along the completed portions of the road at horrendous speed. This is believed to be the major cause of the road accidents that now occur on a weekly basis, with several deaths recorded. \nInvestigations by FrontPageAfrica, however, revealed that majority of the accidents occur on the spots where diversions are made by the construction companies. While these diversions are necessary for the progress of the job, adequate road signs are usually not given and this leads to most of the accidents that have damaged many vehicles. \nAccording to Mr. Jeffery Mantun, a business man that plies the route on a daily basis, the situation worsens at night because drivers barely see the diversions from afar. \"I will say that the construction companies handling the road are not safety conscious, and they should be blamed for what is happening now,\" he said. \"Diversions are supposed to be done in such a way that it will not endanger the lives of road users.\" \nBut on the contrary, Marcus Barrian, a civil engineer, blamed the accidents on the poor driving skills of road users. He said most drivers do not spend enough time to perfect their driving skills before venturing on the road. \"Because of their limited skill in driving and little knowledge of driving rules and road signs, they overtake recklessly, putting themselves and other road users in danger.\" \nIn his reaction, Mr. Daniel Saylay, spokesperson for the Chinese company, CICO, which is one of the construction companies handling the project, also blamed the accidents on the road users, saying there is always a danger sign to indicate diversions. In addition, he said that during construction, men of CICO and other sister agencies assist in directing motorists especially on diversions. He said the company is prepared to address the situation as it is believed that the road would experience more reckless driving upon completion. \nA senior officer in the public relations department, who wanted anonymity, said CICO was poised to handle the imminent challenges. \"We are aware that road crashes could increase after the road is completed. We are going to curtail it; we are planning to increase our presence on that road, which we believe will caution motorists as they drive along the road. Already we have two units along the road, one at Gbartala and the other at Weala, and we will increase our presence when the road is completed,\" the officer said. \nHe stated further that there has always been road signs alerting motorists of diversions and that the command has also stationed ambulance services along the highway road and into the city, to ensure quick response to casualties in case of any road crash. Engineer Barrian, however, has a different solution to the problem. He believes that if government provides efficient public transportation system, it will reduce the number of vehicles on the road, thereby reducing road accidents.
