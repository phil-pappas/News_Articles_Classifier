We will deliver on that promise, to ensure our farmers and regional communities get the support they need.\" \nFarmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said it was fantastic to see the rural economy benefit from the lease of the Port of Melbourne, something he had been lobbying hard for. \nHe also promised to keep Treasurer Tim Pallas to his word that agricultural producers wouldn't see rising costs at the port. \nBut Nationals leader Peter Walsh said the sale could raise up to $7 billion but rural Victorians would see little benefit. \n\"The Port of Melbourne was built off the back of farmers and exporters and the Melbourne-focused Labor government are again short changing regional Victoria,\" he said in a statement. \n\"Regional Victoria has 25 per cent of the state's population and Labor's `scraps off the table' fund is just three per cent of the potential Port of Melbourne sale proceeds.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T13:42:31.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
