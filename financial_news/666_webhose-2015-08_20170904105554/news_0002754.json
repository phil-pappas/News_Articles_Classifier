According to the student group, they were facing hardship since the government promised to allot US$200 to each student of both Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy to be received monthly. \nThe group further said they had also been promised tuition waiver scholarships for the years they are in school. These, too, however, were not forthcoming. They told the front page Africa that the government's intent is to support them so that upon completion of their medical studies they would, in turn, serve the health sector. \nHowever, the students said this process began well as they were regularly receiving stipend. \"It has turned disastrous over the past fourteen months, as we hardly receive any amount from the Fiscal Affairs office of the University of Liberia.\" \"When this stipend payment was renewed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, we received US$200 each. But after a few months, complaint came from Fiscal Affairs office that they were not receiving money from the government,\" The group added. \nThe student group said they were issued checks at one point in time, and were obliged to go to the bank where they found it difficult to cash the checks. From these retrogressive instances, the student group stressed that they hardly receive any money from the UL authority, which usually tells them that the government has not approved their money in the fiscal budget. \nThe concern medical students lamented, their families depend on them to provide the necessary support. However, as people without jobs, due to the full-time nature of their studies, they are financially stranded, thus relying only on what government gives them as stipend. They therefore appealed to the government and UL Administration to exert every effort to pay at least eight out of the 14 months for now, \"so that we too may be able to sponsor our families.\" \nThe group said specifically that students at the Medical college are Liberians, and will always be here to help the government, \"It will send a bad signal to those who want to enter the Medical field, because if they hear of the sufferings we are encountering, they will surely divert to other areas of study and abandon the field that is so cardinal to the survival of Liberians.\" On their welfare on the campus, the group disclosed that there is currently one hand pump functioning on the campus as they go hungry for months and the screens and building are poorly managed by the Liberian Government. \n\"It is disgusting that this is the only medical college in the country and the Government has no interest in it. If you really want to see the mess on this campus come at night and you will see the campus in complete darkness and the money we are depending on to help ourselves is not coming, so we go on days without food because they asked us not to work neither engage in anything that will temper with our studies, the group furthered. \nAt the same time they are calling on their colleague to come and join them because all efforts to get the attention of the President has proof futile. The Liberian government through several speakers at University graduation has called on Liberians to study sciences as the country currently has too many business graduates. \n\"We need Liberians to study the Sciences and avoid the business course, this country need graduates of sciences, mainly Biology, Chemistry or Physics', most Liberian students are swaying away from the sciences because they don't want to put in time to studies\" President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on one of the UL Graduation. It can be recalled The Secretary General of Liberia College of Physicians and Surgeons, Dr. Stephen B. Kennedy, provided statistics of doctors and healthcare professionals working in the country. He said the country has a total of 261 registered medical doctors, 208 are Liberians and 53 are non-Liberians. \nAccording to him, the statistics depicts that there is one medical doctor to 15,000 persons considering the country's population of over 3.5 million people. Dr. Kennedy added that there are two Liberian Specialist Pediatricians in the country, assuming that over one million of the country's population is less than 15 years of age. \nThe statistics, according to him, suggests that there is one Pediatrician to 500, 000 children in the country. He indicated that there are six Obstetrician Gynecologists in the country, noting that for over a decade, only one has been actively involved in training. He said there are only one Orthopedics and Traumatologist and only one Specialist Urologist in Liberia. \nAccording to him, many counties in the country lack specialized doctors and described the shortage of medical doctors as an acute emergency that needs to be immediately addressed.
