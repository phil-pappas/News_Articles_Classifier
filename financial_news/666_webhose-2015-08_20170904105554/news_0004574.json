Daniel Munoz by Geoff Winestock The head of the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption has been forced to defend herself against accusations from Coalition MPs that she mishandled the inquiry into crown prosecutor Margaret Cunneen and even imperilled the conduct of murder trials.\nICAC commissioner Megan Latham came under fire at an annual parliamentary hearing into ICAC on Friday over her role in the aborted ICAC inquiry into allegations that Ms Cunneen improperly coached her son's girlfriend to help the girlfriend pass a breathalyser test.\nNationals MP Trevor Khan said it was \"irresponsible\" that Ms Latham had publicly announced there might be grounds to charge the senior crown prosecutor at a time when Ms Cunneen was conducting a murder trial.\n\"You would have been aware that the press release would have an effect on the appearance or otherwise of Ms Cunneen in upcoming trials,\" she said.\nMs Latham said the impact on Ms Cunneen was \"simply not a question that came within my jurisdiction.\" Ms Latham, a former NSW Supreme Court judge, said ICAC was \"acutely aware\" that naming the subjects of corruption inquiries attracted public attention but ICAC only did so when it was in the public interest.\nLiberal MP Chris Patterson asked Ms Latham, \"How did you get it so wrong?\" and suggested there was a \"perception of a conflict of interest\", apparently alluding to the fact that Ms Latham had once worked with Ms Cunneen as a crown prosecutor. Ms Latham replied, \"I do not accept that.\"\nMedia leaks Liberal MPs were also concerned about allegations that ICAC had leaked to the media information about raids on MPs' offices and homes in previous inquiries.\n Coalition MPs have been upset by ICAC since the resignation of Barry O'Farrell last year but this public criticism over the Cunneen case comes as the powers of the state's unique anti-corruption agency hang in the balance.\nThe Baird government is expected to respond next week to a report by former chief Justice Murray Gleeson on whether to give ICAC back the powers it lost as a result of the High Court decision in the Cunneen case.\nThe inquiry into Ms Cunneen was aborted in April because the High Court ruled that Ms Cunneen's \"sanctions could not constitute corruption\".\nThe judgment restricted ICAC to investigating actions that affected the \"probity\" of public officials in carrying out their duties and stopped ICAC looking at many other cases where officials were misled by others such as the rigging of bids for government contracts.\nAfter the High Court case, ICAC announced it would ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing charges of perverting the course of justice against Ms Cunneen on the basis of the evidence already gathered. But in another blow to the ICAC the DPP decided last month to drop the case.\nICAC's powers could also be undermined by two pending High Court cases. Coal baron Travers Duncan is challenging a corruption finding against him in the inquiry into former MP Eddie Obeid's coal mine. And former Newcastle mayor Jeff McCloy is challenging the NSW donation laws at the centre of last year's ICAC inquiry into Liberal Party campaign funding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-08T06:37:00.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
