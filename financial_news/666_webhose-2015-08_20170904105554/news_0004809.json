West Texas Intermediate crude oil was trading below $45 per barrel Thursday morning, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration released a report on Wednesday afternoon that showed refinery throughputs reached a record high for July. Production at American refineries exceeded 17 million barrels per day of gross inputs during each of the past four weeks. EIA analysts reported that is a level that had not previously been reached or exceeded in any given week since the agency began publishing the data in 1990. Refineries owned by Valero (NYSE: VLO) account for almost one-fifth of those daily production numbers. The San Antonio-based company reported that its refineries ran at 96 percent utilization rates and processed an average of 2.8 million barrels per day during the second quarter. That figure represents an increase of 87,000 barrels per day compared to the same time period in 2014. Lower costs and increased production translated into $1.4 billion in net income for the company during the second quarter, which was more than double the $651 million the company made during the same time period in 2014. \"We saw market conditions that incentivized maximum gasoline production in most regions,\" Valero CEO Joe Gorder said during the company's conference call on its second-quarter results. Meanwhile, Tesoro Corp. , San Antonio's other major refining company, reported similar results during the second quarter. During a Wednesday morning conference call, Tesoro (NYSE: TSO) said its refineries ran at a 92 percent utilization rate and processed an average of 783,000 barrels per day during the quarter. Tesoro reported $586 million in net income income during the second quarter, more than twice the $224 million the company made during the same period in 2014. \nWant San Antonio Manufacturing news in your inbox?
