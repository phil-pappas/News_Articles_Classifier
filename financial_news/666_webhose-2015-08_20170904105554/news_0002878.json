The Topix index advanced 0.6 percent to 1,700.66, on course for its highest close since July 2007, as all but four of its 33 industry groups advanced.

The energy sector should stage a rebound today in Japan on higher oil prices.”\nCrude on Monday climbed from its lowest settlement price in almost five months as Chinese oil imports rose to a record in July. Overseas purchases by China increased to 30.71 million metric tons in July, higher than December’s level of 30.4 million tons, a previous monthly record.\nFutures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little changed after the underlying measure jumped 1.3 percent on Monday in New York.
