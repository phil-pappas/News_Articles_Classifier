Whether online, or through a mobile device, at a kiosk or in a local store, we connect consumers any way that is convenient for them. We also provide bill payment services, issue money orders and process official checks in the U.S and in select countries around the world. We primarily offer services through third-party agents, including retail chains, independent retailers, post offices and other financial institutions. We also offer self-service solutions such as moneygram.com, mobile, account deposit and kiosk-based services. We have Company-operated retail locations in the U.S. and Western Europe. Our global money transfer services are our primary revenue driver, accounting for 88 percent of total revenue for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The market for money transfer services remains very competitive, consisting of a small number of large competitors and a large number of small, niche competitors. We are the second largest money transfer company in the world (based on total face value of remittances in 2014) and we will continue to encounter competition from new technologies that allow consumers to send and receive money in a variety of ways. We manage our revenue and related commission expenses through two reporting segments: Global Funds Transfer and Financial Paper Products. The Global Funds Transfer segment provides global money transfer services in approximately 353,000 agent locations in more than 200 countries and territories. The Global Funds Transfer segment also provides bill payment services to consumers through substantially all of our money transfer agent and Company-operated locations in the U.S., Canada, Puerto Rico, at certain agent locations in select Caribbean and European countries and through self-service solutions. The Financial Paper Products segment provides money order services to consumers through our retail and financial institution locations in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and provides official check services to financial institutions in the U.S. The \"Other\" segment contains corporate items. Our sales efforts are organized based on the nature of the products and services offered. Operating expenses are analyzed on the functional nature of the expense. Business Environment and Trends Our financial results reflect the impact from two full quarters of the Company's lower U.S. to U.S. pricing, a competitive product in the U.S. to U.S. corridor and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted revenue and cash flow in the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. However, the growth in the U.S. Outbound and Non U.S. corridors along with the continued growth of the self-service channel have partially offset this impact. On April 17, 2014, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart\") announced the launch of the Walmart white label money transfer service, a program operated by a competitor of MoneyGram, that allows consumers to transfer money between its U.S. store locations. This program limits consumers to transferring $900 per transaction. The Company's U.S. to U.S. transactions originated at Walmart declined 45 percent and 52 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. We generally compete for money transfer consumers on the basis of trust, convenience, availability of outlets, price, technology and brand recognition. We are monitoring consumer behavior to ensure that we maintain a transaction growth trend. Pricing actions from our competitors may result in pricing changes for our products and services. On October 31, 2014, we introduced lower prices for our money transfer product in the U.S. to U.S. market and, as a result, have seen improvements including a reduction in the decline of transactions over $50 and an increase in average face value per transaction. Table of Contents \nOn an ongoing basis we see a trend among state, federal and international regulators towards enhanced scrutiny of anti-money laundering compliance programs, as well as consumer fraud prevention and education. Compliance with laws and regulations is a highly complex and integral part of our day-to-day operations, thus we have continued to increase our compliance personnel headcount and make investments in our compliance-related technology and infrastructure. In the first quarter of 2013, a compliance monitor was selected pursuant to a requirement of our settlement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (\"MDPA\") and the Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice (\"U.S. DOJ\"). We have received two annual reports from the compliance monitor, which have resulted in us continuing to make investments in various areas of our compliance systems and operations. We incurred $2.8 million and $4.7 million of expense directly related to the compliance monitor for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. 2015 Events Global Transformation Program - In the first quarter of 2014, the Company announced the implementation of the 2014 Global Transformation Program, which consists of three key components: reorganization and restructuring, compliance enhancement and a focus on self-service revenue. Our reorganization and restructuring activities are centered around facilities and headcount rationalization, system efficiencies and headcount right-shoring and outsourcing. The Company projects that these activities will be concluded at or near the end of the 2015 fiscal year. The following figures include Company estimates and are subject to change as the global transformation program continues to be implemented. The Company is estimating it will incur $45 million in cash outlays through 2015 and generate an annual estimated pre-tax savings of $25 million exiting fiscal year 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded total reorganization and restructuring expenses of $4.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively. Our compliance enhancement program is focused on improving our services for the consumers and completing the programs recommended in adherence with our settlement with the MDPA and U.S. DOJ. The Company estimates an additional cost of $25 million to $35 million to complete the compliance enhancement program in 2016. We incurred $10.2 million and $15.7 million of compliance enhancement program expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. We believe that our investment in innovative products and services, particularly self-service solutions such as moneygram.com, mobile, account deposit and kiosk-based services, positions the Company to enhance revenue growth and diversify our product offerings. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the money transfer fee and other revenue from the self-service channel grew 58 percent and 52 percent, respectively, from the same period in 2014 and accounted for $37.0 million and $68.6 million, or 12 percent and 11 percent, of total money transfer fee and other revenue, respectively. Financial Measures and Key Metrics This Form 10-Q includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures that we use to assess our overall performance. GAAP Measures - We utilize certain financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP to assess the Company's overall performance. These measures include, but are not limited to: fee and other revenue, fee and other commission expense, fee and other revenue less commissions, operating income and operating margin. Due to our regulatory capital requirements, we deem certain payment service assets as settlement assets. Settlement assets represent funds received or to be received from agents for unsettled money transfers, money orders and customer payments. Settlement assets include settlement cash and cash equivalents, receivables, net, interest-bearing investments and available-for-sale investments. See Note 1 - Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure. Table of Contents \nNon-GAAP Measures - Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. While we believe that these metrics enhance investors' understanding of our business, these metrics are not necessarily comparable with similarly named metrics of other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures include: EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including agent signing bonus amortization) Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA adjusted for certain significant items) - Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available. Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Adjusted EBITDA less cash interest, cash taxes, cash payments for capital expenditures and cash payments for agent signing bonuses) - Adjusted Free Cash Flow does not reflect cash payments related to the adjustment of certain significant items in Adjusted EBITDA. Constant Currency - Constant currency metrics assume that amounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at rates consistent with those in the prior year. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they are an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the operating performance and value of companies within our industry. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and constant currency figures are financial and performance measures used by management in reviewing results of operations, forecasting, allocating resources or establishing employee incentive programs. Although we believe the above non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' understanding of its business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for the accompanying GAAP financial measures. Since these are non-GAAP measures, the Company believes it is more appropriate to disclose these metrics after discussion and analysis of the GAAP financial measures. Non-Financial Measures We also use certain non-financial measures to assess our overall performance. These measures include, but are not limited to, transaction growth and money transfer agent base. The Company utilizes specific terms as related to our business throughout this document, including the following: Corridor - With regard to a money transfer transaction, the originating \"send\" location and the designated \"receive\" location are referred to as a corridor. Corridor mix - The relative impact of increases or decreases in money transfer transactions in each available corridor versus the comparative prior period. Face value - The principal amount of each completed transaction, excluding any fees related to the transaction. Foreign currency - The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior-year period's currency exchange rates. We use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues and commissions and for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

The following table details the changes in money transfer fee and other revenue from 2014 to 2015, for the three and six months ended June 30: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended For the period ended June 30, 2014 $ 328.2 $ 654.3 Change resulting from: Money transfer volume 18.7 17.7 Foreign currency exchange rate (18.4 ) (33.5 ) Average face value per transaction and pricing (10.5 ) (29.3 ) Corridor mix (3.2 ) (7.0 ) Other 1.7 1.1 For the period ended June 30, 2015 $ 316.5 $ 603.3 \nMoney Transfer Transactions The following table displays the percentage distribution of total money transfer transactions by geographic location (the region originating the transaction) for the three and six months ended June 30: Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2015 2014 2015 2014 U.S. to U.S. 17 % 23 % 18 % 26 % U.S. Outbound 43 % 41 % 43 % 39 % Non-U.S. 40 % 36 % 39 % 35 % \nThe following table displays year over year money transfer transaction growth by geographic location (the region originating the transaction) for the three and six months ended June 30: Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2015 vs 2014 2015 vs 2014 Total transactions 6% 3% U.S. to U.S. (22)% (29)% U.S. Outbound 13% 12% Non-U.S. 16% 15% \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, the U.S. Outbound corridors generated 13 percent transaction growth while accounting for 43 percent of our total money transfer transactions. The success in the U.S. Outbound corridor was primarily driven by sends to Latin America and Africa. Sends to Africa increased 22 percent over the prior year and Latin America had transaction growth of 12 percent. Non-U.S. transactions generated 16 percent transaction growth and accounted for 40 percent of total money transfer transactions. The growth was primarily driven by the Middle East, Africa and the UK. The U.S. to U.S. corridor declined 22 percent and accounted for 17 percent of total money transfer transactions. The decline was primarily driven by a 45 percent decline in Walmart U.S. to U.S. transactions, partially offset by six percent growth in U.S. to U.S. transactions excluding transactions originating at Walmart. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the U.S. Outbound corridors generated 12 percent transaction growth while accounting for 43 percent of our total money transfer transactions. The growth in the U.S. Outbound corridor was primarily driven by sends to Latin America and Africa. Latin America had transaction growth of 12 percent and sends to Africa increased 20 percent over the prior year. Non-U.S. transactions generated 15 percent transaction growth and accounted for 39 percent of total money transfer transactions. The growth was primarily driven by the Middle East and Western Europe regions. The U.S. to U.S. corridor declined 29 percent and accounted for 18 percent of total money transfer transactions. The decline was primarily driven by a 52 percent decline in Walmart U.S. to U.S. transactions, partially offset by five percent growth in U.S. to U.S. transactions excluding transactions originating at Walmart. Table of Contents \nBill Payment Fee and Other Revenue For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, bill payment fee and other revenue decreased by $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as a result of lower average fees resulting from shifts in industry mix, partially offset by transaction growth of one percent and two percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The impact of changes in industry mix reflects our continued growth in new emerging verticals that generate a lower fee per transaction than our traditional verticals. Fee and Other Commissions Expense The following table details the changes in fee and other commissions for the Global Funds Transfer segment from 2014 to 2015, for the three and six months ended June 30: (Amounts in millions) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended For the period ended June 30, 2014 $ 171.5 $ 342.2 Change resulting from: Foreign currency exchange rate (8.7 ) (15.9 ) Money transfer corridor and agent mix (5.2 ) (8.0 ) Bill payment revenue and commission rates (0.6 ) (0.9 ) Signing bonuses 3.2 7.1 Money transfer revenue 3.0 (8.0 ) For the period ended June 30, 2015 $ 163.2 $ 316.5 \nFor the three months ended June 30, 2015, fee and other commissions expense decreased 5 percent, or $8.3 million. The decrease in commission expense was primarily driven by the movement in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in money transfer corridor and agent mix, partially offset by increased signing bonus amortization from our agent expansion and retention efforts. Fee and other commissions expense as a percentage of fee and other revenue decreased to 47.9 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2015, from 48.6 percent for the same period in 2014. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, fee and other commissions expense decreased 8 percent, or $25.7 million. The decrease in commission expense was primarily driven by the movement in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in money transfer corridor and agent mix and the decrease in money transfer revenue, partially offset by increased signing bonus amortization from our agent expansion and retention efforts. Fee and other commissions expense as a percentage of fee and other revenue decreased to 48.5 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2015, from 48.6 percent for the same period in 2014. Financial Paper Products The following discussion provides a summary of fee and other revenue and fee and other commissions expense for the Financial Paper Product segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.
