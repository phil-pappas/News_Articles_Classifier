U.S. crude fell 42 cents to $44.54. \n\"Prices are still facing heavy bearish pressures. This could mean that prices could reach 2015 lows,\" Singapore-based Phillip Futures said, although the brokerage added that it does not expect oil prices to fall below this year's lowest point reached in January. \nThe overall low prices come on the back of weak supply and demand fundamentals, with output from key producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States near record highs just as demand growth slows. \nIn China, the world's No.2 economy and oil consumer, exports tumbled 8.3 percent in July in their biggest fall in four months, threatening the government's 7 percent economic growth target for this year, already the lowest in decades. \n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T06:29:40.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
