The car manufacturer has hiked its prices up to Rs 9000. (HT Photo) \nThe country’s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki India, on Friday said it hiked prices of all its products, barring newly-launched crossover S-Cross, by up to Rs 9,000 citing changes in dealer margins. The hike, which has been in effect since August 11, came within a fortnight of arch rival Hyundai also increasing prices by a much bigger margin of up to Rs 30,000 citing rising cost of raw materials. The average hike in the ex-showroom prices for all Maruti’s products ranges from Rs 3,000 to Rs 9,000, but a company spokesperson said it may be lower for customers as handling and logistics charges for the vehicles have been integrated with the dealer margin. \n“This is just a minor calibration in prices,” he said. The firm’s current portfolio in India ranges from its entry-level car Alto 800 to premium crossover S-Cross, priced between Rs 2.52 lakh to Rs 13.74 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). It has a near 50% share in the country’s passenger vehicle market. The company did not share the exact quantum of increase for each of its cars. Prices of commodities such as steel and aluminium have generally been soft throughout this year and have not necessitated an increase in prices for Maruti in this year so far.
