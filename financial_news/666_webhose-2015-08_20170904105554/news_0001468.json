Financial markets’ obsessive focus on a single report from a single month has always seemed a bit misplaced. Then again, the employment report has for decades provided both inspiration and motivation for the Federal Reserve.\nPolicy makers will study Friday’s jobs report for July for signs of “some further improvement” in the labor market and for any scintilla of evidence that inflation is moving back to its 2% target: the two preconditions for starting to normalize rates. That confidence was dashed by last week’s report on second-quarter employment costs, which showed the smallest increase (0.2%) on record.\nThe 2% year-over-year increase is consistent with the growth rate of a narrower measure of wages.\nThe Fed would interpret an acceleration in wage growth as confirmation that labor markets are tightening and inflation is headed higher. Unfortunately the causality is wrong. Inflation will send a signal as to where it is headed well before wages do.\nThe notion that wages push prices up is one of those bad ideas that keeps coming back to haunt us. On the surface, it makes perfect sense. If employers can’t fill open positions at the going rate, they have to lure workers with higher wages. Higher labor costs mean lower profits, so businesses raise prices to compensate.\nNow think about the implication for a moment. Why would a business passively pay a worker more than his marginal revenue product, or the additional revenue that worker generates? That would mean a reduction in profit margins and eventually operating at a loss.\nThe late Milton Friedman taught us that there is no such thing as “cost-push” inflation. In Friedman’s world, an increase in money-supply growth leads to increased demand for goods and services, which encourages firms to raise output, employment and selling prices. Eventually workers realize that all prices are rising and demand a higher wage. Labor costs follow.\nEven the widely used phrase “wage inflation” is a misnomer. Wages are the price of labor. They happen to be the biggest input cost, especially when it comes to service providers. Higher wages are a symptom of higher inflation, not a cause of it.\nThe Fed has been waiting for wages to send an all-clear signal to let the normalization process commence.\nAt 5.3%, the unemployment rate is in the range of what economists consider to be full employment. However, with labor-force participation at a four-decade low of 62.6%, there is an adequate supply of underemployed workers — part-timers who would like a full-time job and discouraged workers who have stopped looking — who could be drawn back into the labor force or be utilized more fully in a stronger economy. Labor-force growth has been abysmal in the six years since the recession ended, averaging 0.2% compared with 1.7% in the latter half of the 20th century.\nFor that reason, Fed Chair Janet Yellen does not consider the unemployment rate to be a good indicator of labor-market slack.\nInflation is low. Recent inflation readings aren’t likely to re-enforce her confidence that economy-wide prices are moving back to 2%. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.3 percent in the year ended in June. While core inflation has stabilized this year at a 1.3% annual rate of growth, the renewed downtrend in commodity prices may give the Fed pause about a September rate increase, recent comments from officials notwithstanding.\nWith inflation barely rising, wages are not going to send some contrary signal. The weakest U.S. expansion since World War II with the slowest growth in gross domestic product just witnessed the slowest increase in wages and salaries on record. The only surprise would be if wages suddenly showed any sign of life.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1zFt", "https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1xV8", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-feds-lockhart-fed-is-close-to-being-ready-to-raise-short-term-rates-1438709252", "https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1zD6", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20150729a.htm", "https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=1zC4"], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:05:37.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
