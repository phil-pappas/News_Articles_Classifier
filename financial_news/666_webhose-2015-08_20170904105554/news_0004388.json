AvidXchange and Viewpoint have formed a strategic partnership to deliver clients a best-in-class payment automation solution with a strong integration to Viewpoint’s ERP solutions, Vista by Viewpoint and ProContractor by Viewpoint . The companies are working together to create a seamless experience for clients so that they can create AP efficiencies within each system. “We’re excited to offer customers a streamlined payment automation solution that seamlessly integrates with their Viewpoint ERP, helping reduce resource hours spent and lower risk of error,” stated Henry Ferguson, Director of Business Development: OEM/Partners with Viewpoint. According to Ferguson, “With AP payments now being made in one process regardless of type (Check, EFT, virtual card), we are expecting Viewpoint customers to beat the 60% average reduction in the costs associated with processing payments. This is a significant opportunity to improve efficiencies, reduce processing costs and save precious staff time”.\n“Viewpoint was a great choice for us as a partner, because they also have a focus on creating operational efficiencies for their construction industry clients through automation,” commented Michael Praeger, CEO and Co-Founder of AvidXchange. “Our partnership with Viewpoint is a great example of how our solutions are impacting business processes in diverse industries, and we’re looking forward to our solutions helping Viewpoint’s customers create a competitive advantage for themselves with the efficiencies and controls created with AP automation,” added Praeger.\nThe companies plan to work closely together to provide a seamless experience for clients with joint activities, such as educational webinars and conferences, which will help clients realize the benefits of using the solutions together. AvidXchange will have two sessions at Viewpoint’s 2015 User Conference: Collaborate , where attendees can find out more about the benefits of its payment automation solutions. Viewpoint customers can also rely on fast and easy installation, because all AvidXchange solutions come with a 45-day implementation guarantee, which is far more expedient than the traditional 6 to 9 months traditionally required for a back-end payment solution.\nAbout Viewpoint Construction Software\nFor more than 38 years, Viewpoint has been a provider of innovative construction-specific software solutions to the global construction and capital project industries.
