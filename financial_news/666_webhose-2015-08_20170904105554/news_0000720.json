A daily close above the 38.2% Fibonacci expansion at 1.3232 exposes the 50% level at 1.3347. Alternatively, a move below the 23.6% expansion at 1.3090 opens the door for a challenge of the 14.6% expansion at 1.3002. We bought USDCAD at 1.2649 and have since booked profit on half of the position . The rest of the trade will stay open to take advantage of any further gains ahead. The stop-loss has been moved to the breakeven level.
