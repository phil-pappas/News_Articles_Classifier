Around 210 drug dealers used the site. Evidence of some 170,000 transaction messages was discovered. \nUndercover police worked on infiltrating the tough-to-crack network for roughly two years. The investigation started when the Italian postal and communications police discovered the dark net site facilitating the sale of child pornography. \nThe network was shut down when its head administrator’s house has raided. The administrator took a fee from each transaction processed, a similar business model followed by several illegal dark net sites including the original Silk Road. \nMichele Prestipino, a public prosecutor who coordinated the investigation, told a press conference in Rome, “The virtual world of the Dark Web has its own hierarchies and severe rules on access and affiliation. Getting into such a closed community was extremely difficult.” \nInvestigators from Italy’s National Centre for the Fight against Child Pornography Online (CNCPO) coordinated with the Italian State Police, FBI and Europol on the investigation.
