Supplied by Tony Davis\nThe Mercedes-AMG GT, on sale this week, is the replacement for the reborn gullwing SLS.\nIt does without the fascinating lift-up doors, cedes 2.3 litres in engine capacity, and introduces a completely new, more rounded styling direction. But because it is shorter and lighter, it offers similar performance. It also does so at a far less exotic price.\nThe newcomer has an aluminium spaceframe construction and has been widely described as a Porsche 911 competitor. It certainly measures up there in performance – and price.\nThe tail of the Mercedes-AMG GT looks like it might have been borrowed directly from the Porsche 911. At $295,000 plus on-road costs, it is dearer than a 911 Carrera 2 GTS ($289,700) but a whole lot cheaper than, say, a 911 Turbo ($396,400). The SLS, meanwhile, started at $464,000.\nUnlike the \"flat six\" rear-engined Porsche, the AMG's engine is a V8, and is in the front (though only just. It is positioned almost completely behind the front axle line making it technically be a front/mid-engined car).\nProfile elements The large and aggressive nose could only be from Mercedes, but beyond that are profile elements that could be from Jaguar or Aston Martin. The tail looks like it might have been borrowed directly from the Porsche 911.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating... View full Quote: Company Profile ASX Announcements Expand ASX Announcements View all announcements The overall effect is muscular but more understated, doing without the extraordinarily long and flat bonnet of its predecessor. This bonnet is merely very long. It is more tapered too.\nThe cockpit is fairly tight for two, with a solid wall behind the seats, and a very wide centre console. The seats of our car were trimmed in black and red leather, an almost 1950's touch reminiscent of the early SLK roadsters. The red pattern was picked up in the stitching on the dashboard.\nThe eight main buttons stacked four on each side of the centre console are apparently arranged to bring to mind the V8 engine. If they ever do a V12, they'll need to find more space for additional buttons.\nThere is a thick Alcantara-covered steering wheel, with the usual Benz switches on it to control various functions. The Telematics work well, most of the comfort and convenience features function in a very similar manner to other Benzes.\nHard-core, but not To put that point another way, this might be a hard-core sports model, but it doesn't require you to be greatly put out. The default for the seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is auto, but full manual can be achieved at the push of a button. A five position driving mode switch offers comfort, sport, sport-plus, race, and individual driver settings.\nThe individual setting gives you the chance to play race engineer and set up the engine, shocks, gearing, exhaust and level of ESP intervention to best suit the road.\nAnd talking of roads …\nA few weeks ago I tested the new Benz S400 coupe-convertible on the Black Spur Road, north-east of Melbourne, under perfect skies. I vowed to do it again in the new coupe.\nSo today it was another trip up and down the Black Spur, though the perfect skies were missing. The temperature dropped to 4 degrees, with fog and rain and the occasional burst of sun cutting through the tall trees and turning everything into a white glow.\nStill, the car performed much as you would expect it to, feeling wide and surefooted through the winding and often tight corners. And quick. Very, very quick.\nThe barrage of electronic systems, including adaptive damping, the most advanced ESP system known to Benz, and dynamic engine and transmission mounts that stiffen up during enthusiastic driving, did a fine job of keeping drama to a minimum.\nV8 soundscape In sport-plus mode, the car is happy to chuck out its tail to break traction generally, embellishing the experience with an enthusiastic V8 soundscape that includes growling, roaring and barking.\nThere is a button that allows the exhaust flaps to be opened at lower revs, but the company is keen to point out that all the exhaust note is achieved without magnification or electronic boostering.\nThe 4-litre V8 has two turbochargers mounted inside the vee for packaging efficiency and fast response. Further aiding the mission of getting the weight down low is race-style dry sump lubrication.\nThere are two versions of the car available overseas; we take only the more powerful S version, with 375 kilowatts and 650 Nm. That makes the name rather awkwardly Mercedes-AMG GT S.\nThe raw stats point to 0 to 100 km/h in 3.8 seconds. The top speed of 310 km/h is electronically limited, which the cynic in me says means it the actual top speed is 311 km/h.\nThe all-up weight is 1540 kilograms. Not only is the engine is set a long way back, a transaxle arrangement puts more weight in the tail, giving 47/53 weight split, front to rear.\nThe brake rotors are steel, but for another $20,000 or so you can have ceramic.\nEasy going Like the Porsche 911, with which it is being compared, the Mercedes is remarkably easy to live with, despite its supercar performance. Everything is easy to use, works well, and it's no struggle getting in and out. There's even a reasonable amount of luggage space (though no small seats in the back, a la 911).\nThe Australian cars have a glass roof, with a screen you can pull across if you don't want to see the heavens. More extreme wraparound sports seats and other premium features can be specified.\nAn Edition One version brings a big rear spoiler and a few other bibs and bobs ($314,900 plus on-road costs).\nNow about that name. The release says: \"the Mercedes-AMG sports car brand is moving into a new, top-class sports car segment for the company\".\nSo that's it, a quiet move from Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG (the gullwing car) to Mercedes-AMG GT, as Benz attempts to ramp up the prominence of its AMG go-fast division, based in Affalterbach, Germany.\nExactly how Karl Benz feels about being left out of the name is hard to gauge (admittedly he has been dead for 86 years). He's been dropped from the corporate name too, which is now just Daimler AG.\nWhatever the variations in name, the new sportster underscores that no car company has ever stretched one logo so far. The three-pointed star now covers small city hatchbacks through to Mercedes-Maybach limousines, light commercials, serious 4WDs and big, ugly trucks and busses.\nSuch variety under the same badge shouldn't work. It seems to, very well indeed.\nModel: Mercedes-AMG GT S\nPrice (excluding on road costs): $295,000\nEngine: 4-litre twin turbo V8 (petrol)\nPower/torque: 375 kW/650 Nm\nFuel economy (combined cycle): 9.4 L/100 km\nC02: 219 grams per kilometre", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T20:04:35.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
