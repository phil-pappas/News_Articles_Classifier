Preventable diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and stroke are taxing the healthcare system despite being controllable with regular diet and exercise. Furthermore, retiring to a sedentary lifestyle that includes hours of political TV and multiple trips to the fridge are reported to be one of the primary reasons divorce rates are skyrocketing for retired baby boomers and other seniors.The tax would not only infringe on retirees privacy by monitoring the amount of TV they can watch but would also score them on their mood and level of physical activity. It's an unprecedented move that would penalize those who under-perform their peer group and are more susceptible to preventable diseases, divorce, mood swings, and other negative aspects of their life in retirement.Actually, I made the entire thing up. There is no such legislation, but I needed to get your attention because I want to ask you a very important question. What was your first thought when you started reading the story? In other words, would such a bill be directed at you or someone you know?[caption id=\"attachment_ee1ed2c03e4940828fbcd3bde03d0b3c\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] Ready For A Retirement Tax? (photo credit: John Minchillo. freelance, Associated Press)[/caption]I realize it may be a harsh way to make a point… and I’m not doing it to chastise, judge, or poke fun at you but instead to try and tell you something you need to hear and that no one else may have been able to get through to you.You see, as a financial professional I have the opportunity to engage retirees and their families in a variety of discussions on a regular basis. I get to ask married, single, as well as newly divorced retirees how things are going… and the same things keep showing up for guys: Too much couch and TV, weight gain, no social life, mood swings, and limited effort and participation in relationships to name a few.I realize many of the things that may have put you where you're at may not be your fault or were beyond your control, but some aspects of your retirement may be in a rut. Not necessarily in a detrimental way, but more or less like an athlete who’s having a bad season. Could be a nagging injury, not gelling with other players on the team, or an overall lack of focus on the things that are important.Stuff that happens to all of us during different seasons of life… stuff that can start to be remedied with these three solutions which are designed to get you on the other side of the equation – the side where you emerge with a renewed sense of life and purpose in retirement. 1) Make Changes To Your Schedule At Peak Energy Times Whether you want to start exercising, altering your TV watching schedule, or adding a weekly trip to the library, one of the best strategies to consider when making changes is to do so during your peak energy time of the day.You’ve likely heard people classify themselves as early birds or night owls, right? Basically, everyone has periods of the day when they have more energy than others. Since motivation and energy levels are crucial factors to following through with a desired change, try to avoid low energy times where rationalizations to give up or procrastinate can creep in.For example, if you’ve ever tried to start exercising first thing in the morning and you’re not a morning person, you know it’s only a matter of time before you quit. Obviously, retirees have more time than those who are working so use it to your advantage by trying something new when your body and mind are most prepared and capable. 2) Find Something To Fix Guys are hard-wired to fix stuff. Whether it’s a household appliance, struggling business, or person in need, we’re full of suggestions, tools, and strategies to make things better. However, retirement can put a little rust on those abilities and desires. Therefore, take a moment to think about some things that are important to you and you would like to work on or fix.If you’re handy, break out the tools and start knocking out that honey-do list or contact a non-profit organization that may be in need of some light maintenance repairs. If you’re a former athlete, fill a coaching void by being an assistant for a grandchild's baseball, soccer, or flag football team. If your background is in accounting, marketing, or a sales make yourself available as a business mentor or to a local charity in need of some free consulting advice. Giving back and investing in others is one of the quickest ways to awaken your body, mind, and spirit. 3) Get Checked Out While nobody ever says, “My favorite thing about retirement is going to the doctors,” there are things going on in your body that you don’t know about and can’t see or even feel. That means its time to set a regular schedule to get to the Doctors and get things checked out because the best legacy any man can leave is a healthy and happy you.It’s time to make your health a priority and take action to live a stronger, healthier life. Doing so could go a long way to improve your mood and activity levels as well as catch problems before they become serious.On the surface, a monetary tax on a retiree’s lifestyle may seem a little dramatic and over the top, but when you begin to look at some retirees lifestyle and the taxing burden they may be putting on themselves and others, its easy to see both a need and opportunity to make changes.None of this is to say you have to have this perfect little retirement where you work out all morning long, volunteer every afternoon, and then attend family events each night. It’s simply to encourage you to make the most of your time and life in retirement. It's a privileged many people never get.", "external_links": ["http://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/ee1ed2c03e4940828fbcd3bde03d0b3c/640x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "published": "2015-08-31T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T19:46:20.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
