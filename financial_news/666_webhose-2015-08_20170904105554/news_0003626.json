Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Watching your parents age – or getting old yourself – is frightening on many fronts. We all face the threat of losing our faculties, and if it happens, it can happen quite quickly. That's why having your finances in place is essential for the sake of your partner, your kids and your own peace of mind.\nDelaying choices about who you would appoint as enduring power of attorney or how you would like your assets to be split can be fraught with danger, says Justin Hooper, an adviser and managing director of Sentinel Wealth. \"You need to think about this in your 60s, at the latest,\" he says.\nWhether it's you who is wondering how to handle your finances as you get older, or your parents, addressing some of these points with your family is important.\nLet someone else in at 60: while you may think 60 sounds awfully young to think about losing capacity, consider this a trial period where you relinquish some of the management of your financial affairs to family, friends or an adviser to see how they perform, says Hooper. \"Work alongside them for a period of time so you know what they're like and whether you can trust them with your money,\" he advises.\nNo surprises: the last thing you want is a family furore after you've died, so make your intentions known in your early retirement years.\nThink about a testamentary trust: if you're a bit older but have have younger children or grandchildren, you may want to think about staggering their access to your estate, says adviser Andrew Zbik of Omniwealth. A testamentary trust appoints a trustee to manage the money you bequeath for a period of time – perhaps until they are 25 or 30 – then gives the young person gradual control, he says.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-08-06T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T15:55:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
