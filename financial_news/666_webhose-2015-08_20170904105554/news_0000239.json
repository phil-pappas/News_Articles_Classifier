While the stock is already down more than 28% in premarket trade, Winkle said valuation assumptions are still \"significantly reduced\" by the company's new growth trajectory. The analysts said he can't recommend buying the stock until either Keurig's cold-brewing system, KOLD, expected to launch this fall, runs its course, or the direct competitive risk to its K-cup pods starts to moderate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:16:17.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
