The Beijing-based company's net profit plummeted 51 percent year-on-year to $105 million, but was ahead of a 59 percent drop expected by analysts. \nChief executive Yuanqing Yang said Lenovo was facing the \"toughest market environment in recent years\" and would restructure its lagging smartphone business at a one-time cost of $600 million. \nAbout 3,200 people in non-manufacturing positions would also be cut to save $650 million in the second half of 2015. \n(Reporting by Gerry Shih; Editing by Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T03:13:38.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
