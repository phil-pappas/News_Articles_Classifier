Wunderlich's Hogan said the selloff had the characteristics of the S&P's October decline, when the benchmark fell nearly 10 percent on an intraday basis. \nAt its session low on Thursday, the S&P 500 was down 4.3 percent from its record intraday high set in late May. \nDisney slumped 5.4 percent to $100.69 and Time Warner fell 4.4 percent to $74.43, leading a rout in media stocks after a Bernstein downgrade. \nApple fell 1.7 percent to $113.06 after a Gartner report said China smartphone sales fell for the first time ever on a quarterly base in the second quarter. Apple counts China as a key growth market. \nOne bright spot in tech stocks was NetApp (NasdaqGS: NTAP - news ) , up 3.9 percent to $30.93 after the data storage equipment maker's results beat expectations. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,494 to 549, for a 4.54-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,292 issues fell and 530 advanced for a 4.32-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. \nThe S&P 500 was posting 4 new 52-week highs and 38 new lows; the Nasdaq was recording 16 new highs and 192 new lows. \n(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Nick Zieminski)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T23:17:13.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
