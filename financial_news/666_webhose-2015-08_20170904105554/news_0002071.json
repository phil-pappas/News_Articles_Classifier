RICS noted that \" the shortage of housing inventory worsened further during July, with the average number of properties for sale per surveyor slipping to a record low .\" \nWith demand from new homebuyers also heading through the roof, RICS commented that \" all areas of the UK are projected to see sizeable house price gains over the next twelve months .\" Constructing colossal earnings growth \nSuch news will come as music to the ears of housebuilders like Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV) and Crest Nicholson (LSE: CRST), who the City expects to continue ratcheting up double-digit earnings growth in the years ahead. \nAnd this comes as little surprise -- Barratt Developments advised in its latest financial update that total completions leapt 10.8% during the 12 months to June 2015, to 16,447 units, while total forward sales galloped 29.6% higher to £1.8bn. \nCrest Nicholson also noted in June that completions climbed 3% during October-June, to 1,124 homesteads, while forward transactions ascended 26% year-on-year to £436.4m. Although the country's housebuilders are aggressively building up their land banks, the firms simply cannot construct at a rate to meet insatiable buyer demand, a scenario that should keep driving selling prices higher. \nAscendent estate agents \nBut it is not only the construction sector that is benefitting from ascending house prices. Property surveyors Countrywide (LSE: CWD) noted in June that, although uncertainty surrounding the recent general election stunted the number of transactions at its estate agents, that activity should pick up during the second half of the year. \nA steady rise in the number of mortgage approvals certainly lends credibility to this theory -- these hit a 15-month high of 44,488 in June, the British Banking Association (BBA) advised late last month. \nEnjoying the fruits \nAnd the major lenders like Barclays (LSE: BARC) are on the front line to enjoy the fruits of rising employment levels and wage increases on loan numbers, factors that helped drive total loans and advances at Barclays £500m higher in January-June to £217.5bn. \nI fully expect earnings at all the firms I have mentioned to remain supported by surging house prices. \nBut whether or not you fancy stashing your hard-earned cash in any of the firms mentioned above, I strongly recommend you check out this totally exclusive report that selects a broad range of FTSE winners waiting to deliver explosive shareholder returns. \nOur \" 5 Dividend Winners To Retire On \" wealth report highlights a selection of incredible stocks with an excellent record of providing juicy shareholder returns.
