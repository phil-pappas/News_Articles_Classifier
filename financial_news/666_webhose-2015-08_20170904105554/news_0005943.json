Louie Douvis by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell It's time to start studying Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.\nInvestors and analysts will awake to news on Tuesday morning that Asciano's board has recommended an improved cash and scrip bid from Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, worth $9.15 for each Asciano share or about a 40 per cent premium to its pre-offer trading price.\nThe structure is expected to be split roughly 75:25 between cash and scrip, with some flexibility for shareholders to slightly increase or decrease the scrip component of the deal depending on their situation.\nNew York and Toronto-listed Brookfield Infrastructure Partners will apply for an ASX-listing as part of the offer.\nThe deal, agreed by both parties and to be done via a scheme of arrangement, means Asciano shareholders will have to get up to speed with the Canadian giant's operating model and the listed Brookfield Infrastructure Partners' place in the overall corporate structure before deciding whether to accept the offer.\nA few of the fund's holdings will be familiar to both buy and sell-side transport and infrastructure analysts. Brookfield picked up assets from the distressed Babcock & Brown during the credit crisis including the freight rail network in south-western Western Australia and the Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal. But the portfolio also includes investments in far-flung places including Brazil, Chile and France, which will take some understanding by Australian analysts.\nThe deal is expected to be contingent on competition and Foreign Investment Review Board approval.\nAsciano investors are expected to welcome the offer, which includes a slight bump from the previously disclosed $9.05 scrip and cash offer which was foreshadowed by Street Talk last month, and a special dividend. It's understood Asciano shareholders wanted to see their board cap the deal's scrip component.\n Third-party funds close to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, including sovereign wealth funds and large offshore pension funds, are also expected to take a slice of Asciano as part of the deal. A typical Brookfield Infrastructure Partners acquisition sees the listed company take a 40 per cent stake in the asset, while its limited partners take 60 per cent.\nIt's understood a deal was agreed late on Monday. Goldman Sachs and Gresham Partners advised Asciano, while Citi and Macquarie Capital are working for Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:04:46.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
