Here's what you need to know. \nEuropean PMIs are coming. From 8 a.m. London time (3 a.m. ET) European flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) results for August will be released. These business surveys give an indication of the performance of an economy in a given month, with a score over 50 signalling growth. Analysts expect Europe to have cooled slightly, with a PMI of 53.9 falling to 53.8. \nGfK German consumer confidence figures for the September survey are just out, and they're a miss. The survey came in with a score of 9.9, lower than the 10.1 analysts expected . In the August survey (conducted in late July), the reading hit 10.1, following June's 10.2, the highest recorded in 15 years. \nTension between North and South Korea spiked after an exchange of fire. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered his frontline troops onto a war-footing today, as military tensions with South Korea soared following a rare exchange of artillery shells across their heavily fortified border. \nGreece's election is definitely coming. After reports by a number of outlets on Thursday, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras confirmed his resignation yesterday evening . That will soon mean an election is called, probably for September 20. \nChina's factory activity hit a six and a half year low in August, according to a business survey. Activity in China's factory sector shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years in August as domestic and export demand dwindled, a private survey showed, adding to worries that the world's second-largest economy may be slowing sharply . The preliminary Caixin/Markit China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 47.1 in August, well below a Reuters poll median of 47.7 and down from July's final 47.8. \nAsian markets are slumping. As of 6:45 a.m. London time (1:15 a.m. ET), Hong Kong's Hang Seng is down 2.27%, Japan's Nikkei is down 2.78% and the Shanghai Composite is down 2.95%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:41:55.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
