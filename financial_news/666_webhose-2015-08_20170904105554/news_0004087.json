Louise Kennerley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Nick Lenaghan The size of tenants in the national office market is shrinking as start-ups and tech firms proliferate and more businesses move to flexible working styles, requiring less space.\nThe average lease enquiry level in the range up to 1000 square metres has grown as a percentage of total leases.\nIn 2009, it amounted to 71 per cent of total deals. That proportion has grown steadily to 83 per cent, according to a Colliers International report on the CBD office market.\nThe growth of start-up and technology businesses has resulted in a rise in demand for office space in tenancies of less than 500sq m, it found.\nBut that is just one of a number of both cyclical and structural changes behind the increasing demand for smaller spaces.\n\"Owners are responding to these changes with the way that they lease space, develop buildings and plan for the future of their buildings,\" said Colliers' national research Nerida Conisbee.\n\"There are a number of structural issues also occurring,\" she said. \"The first is that there has been significant growth in small-to-medium size enterprises looking for space\".\n\"The second is that we expect to see a wave of part-floor users enter the market over the next two years as a large number of these leases expire.\"\n There had been \"significant\" growth in the number of small-to-medium enterprises looking for space and the number of part-floor users entering the market over the next two years would also rise, Ms Conisbee said.\nAs a result, not only new tenants but existing users needing new space are expected to add to demand for smaller tenancies.\nSignificantly, as more businesses adopt more flexible ways of working the amount of space required for each employee shrinks.\n\"Technology groups in particular have far lower workspace ratios than other groups,\" the report said.\n\"These groups are expected to be a major contributor to office demand and hence this will be a major driver downwards of these ratios.\"\nSimon Hunt, managing director of office leasing, said buildings in the Sydney CBD such as Chifley Tower, MLC Centre, 25 Bligh Street, and 55 Clarence Street have shown the benefits of speculative sub-division and fit-outs that cater to smaller tenants.\nSome 55 per cent of companies wanting office space in Sydney this year have sought space of less than 500sq m, according to Colliers. In Melbourne, secondary-grade buildings were the first to split floors up speculatively in order to attract smaller tenants, but that had spread to prime grade buildings, such as Investa's 120 Collins St, Mr Hunt said.\n\"Owners are recognising where the largest pool of potential tenants lie, and are being proactive in meeting the market,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/115129227206723134737/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/NickLenaghan"], "published": "2015-08-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:10:53.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
