It only costs a few hundred pounds to rent a “virtual office” that redirects mail and phone calls. What could be more respectable than, say, an office in Tower 42, still better known as the former NatWest Tower and an icon of the London skyline?\nOne investor, though, had her suspicions. She had been cold-called, and was convinced she had been defrauded. So she decided to do a bit of her own investigating, and rang the number in Tower 42.\nShe had the sense to tape the conversation – and it has provided vital evidence for prosecution\nThe office was managed by Regus, the self-styled “world’s largest provider of flexible workspace”. Our investor had done her research, and knew that the con-artists only had a mail forwarding facility and not a physical presence in the sksycraper. But the Regus person answering the phone gave her the impression that the company had a team of people occupying level seven of the tower.\nThe caller persisted. Had there been calls from other investors? Had there been complaints? She was again assured by Regus that there had not been “any sort of complaints”.\nBut our caller was cruelly deceived. However, and rather brilliantly, she had the sense to tape the conversation – and it has provided vital evidence for prosecution.\nLast week, Regus was found guilty at the City of London magistrates court and fined £11,000 plus £16,600 costs.\nBut Regus – which made an operating profit of £104.3m in 2014 – was lucky to get off so lightly.\nIt turns out that four months earlier, Regus had been contacted by the City of London Corporation’s trading standards team, worried that their temporary tenant in Tower 42 had the hallmarks of a typical “boiler room” investment scam, involving the sale of worthless or nonexistent commodities like diamonds and wine, or “carbon credits”.\nThere are rules about mail forwarding services (yes, I’m surprised they exist) and for once they are being enforced. Office providers are required by the London Local Authorities Act 2007 to hold detailed records on their client firms. Regus did not – and was found guilty of four breaches of the act.\nServcorp, another multinational provider of temporary offices, has been little better. In December last year the City of London police and trading standards offices called in at its “stunning skyscraper” Dashwood House, just minutes from Liverpool Street station in the heart of the City. They asked to inspect the records Servcorp held on clients, a significant number of whom were suspected of fraudulent activity.\nThe act required Servcorp to keep records open for inspection at all reasonable times. But it couldn’t comply with the request for another two months – and, when it did, its records were inadequate. A fortnight ago it was ordered to pay £21,000 in fines and £11,500 in costs after pleading guilty to seven offences under the act.\nOf course, not every occupant of Servcorp’s space in Dashwood House or Regus’s offices in Tower 42 are crooks. But in both instances Servcorp and Regus were the enablers to fraudsters hoping to dupe the public with prestige office addresses. A quick search of the Financial Conduct Authority’s database unearths seven official warnings about dodgy firms in Dashwood House, and 14 in Tower 42 . We can’t say if every one of them were Regus or Servcorp clients, but it’s not a happy record.\nThe City of London trading standards has said it will “not tolerate office providers which allow suspected boiler room operations to develop in their sites”. In a statement, Regus said these were “isolated incidents” and “enhanced safeguards have been put in place to prevent any future repetition”.\nCynics will say the fraudsters will simply hop over to less high-profile locations – but at least someone’s on their tail.", "external_links": ["http://www.fca.org.uk/search?cx=007702012814746907219%3Aygc2cqogj8ecof=FORID%3A9ie=UTF-8q=dashwood+house", "http://www.fca.org.uk/search?cx=007702012814746907219%3Aygc2cqogj8e&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8&q=dashwood+house", "http://www.fca.org.uk/search?cx=007702012814746907219%3Aygc2cqogj8ecof=FORID%3A9ie=UTF-8q=tower42", "http://www.fca.org.uk/search?cx=007702012814746907219%3Aygc2cqogj8e&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8&q=tower42"], "published": "2015-08-01T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:42:38.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
