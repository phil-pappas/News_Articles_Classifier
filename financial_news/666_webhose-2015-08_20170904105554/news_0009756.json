Brent Winstone by Jamie Freed Qantas has opened a new domestic business lounge in Perth, complete with an Italian pizza bar, a wine bar, a 'make your own juice' station, a 'plate of the day' and a cocktail hour, as it battles against Virgin Australia to attract passengers to and from the West Australian capital amid the downturn in the resources sector.\nPerth now joins Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Melbourne as the ports where Qantas operates a business lounge separate from the Qantas Club lounge. The business lounges are open to domestic business class passengers and frequent flyers with Platinum or Platinum One status.\n\"The lounge has been designed with our most frequent travellers from WA in mind,\" Qantas Domestic chief executive Andrew David said at the opening of the Perth lounge on Wednesday. \"It accommodates the mix of corporate, leisure and fly-in fly-out workers with business facilities, a sports lounge to relax and socialise, and dining areas with single and communal seating. This lounge sets the new benchmark in business travel and represents the future of the Qantas business lounge in Australia.\"\nMany of the frequent flyers in Perth are linked to the resources industry, where Qantas has major contracts with iron ore miners BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and Gina Rinehart's Roy Hill. Qantas this year banned thongs from its Qantas Club lounges in capital cities following complaints from some fellow passengers , but it does allow customers using the lounge facilities to wear high-visibility work-wear.\nRival Virgin plans to open a new lounge for its passengers plus its VIP lounge, The Club, which is the equivalent of Qantas's Chairman's Lounge when it moves to a new terminal in Perth later this year. But unlike Qantas, Virgin does not distinguish between the equivalent of the Qantas Club and business lounge.\nQantas and Virgin have both been upgrading the A330 aircraft they use to fly between Perth and the East Coast to include new business class seats featuring fully-flat beds, all with aisle access.\nMr David said the majority of Qantas trans-continental flights would be operated by the updated A330s within the next six months, amid complaints from some passengers about the inconsistency of the available aircraft . Virgin plans to have all of its A330 fleet refitted by the end of October.\n\"The interesting thing with Perth is it is not the hot market it used to be,\" said Jamie Pherous, the managing director of Corporate Travel Management, which includes miners and oil and gas producers among its clients. \"[But] competition is great because the customer wins. If you look at our domestic environment [the product] is probably the best anywhere in the world. The worst thing that could never happens is there is no competition. Competition breeds better innovation and better ingenuity which customers like. It is good to see that.\"\n The new Qantas lounge in Perth represents an increase of almost 50 per cent lounge space and has seating for more than 350 people, with distinct areas for passengers to dine, work and relax.", "external_links": ["http://milesdownunder.com/2015/08/review-qantas-a330-business-class-melbourne-to-perth/"], "published": "2015-08-26T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:11:36.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
