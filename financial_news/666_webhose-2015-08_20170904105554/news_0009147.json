Project Isizwe offers a cap of 250MB but it has increased the speed to 15mbps. \nFree wifi internet access aligns with national policy that stipulates universal broadband access by 2020, and the service may yet prove critical to assisting mobile operators with network load. \n\"Wifi has proven to be a complementary solution for mobile operators in their effort to improve their service delivery to their customers and wifi calling is the next step,\" said Michael Fletcher, the sales director for sub-Saharan Africa at Ruckus Wireless. \nThe GSMA's Mobile Economy Sub-Saharan Africa 2014 report found that the mobile ecosystem made a healthy contribution to the gross domestic product of countries in the region. It showed that mobile operators alone contributed $27-billion (about R340-billion today) or 1.9% of the region's GDP, and a further $8-billion in related industries. \nBut beyond economic growth, internet access is regarded as a human right. \n\"For too many people in South Africa, using the internet has turned into a privilege, when it should be a right. We hope that this project will galvanise a nationwide call for free and subsidised internet for all people living in South Africa in under resourced communities,\" said Fatima Hassan, the executive director of Open Society Foundation of South Africa, a partner in the Western Cape wifi rollout. \nSource: News24Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:28:34.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
