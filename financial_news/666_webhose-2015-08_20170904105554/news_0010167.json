Bullish on China woe \nWPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell says he remains a “raging bull” on China despite a stock market meltdown and declining sales growth there for the world’s biggest advertising group. \nA strong performance in North America, where second-quarter sales rose 3.5 per cent, compared with 0.7 per cent growth in emerging markets as WPP grew half-year headline pre-tax profi t by 12.1 per cent to £596million. \nSorrell said: “There are worries about the slowing of growth but that was inevitable .” \nHe added 2015 will be another tough year, but expects a lift from next year’s Rio Olympics, the Euro 2016 football and US presidential election. HSS profit warning \nABOUT £80million was wiped from the value of tool hire company HSS yesterday as it sounded another profit warning to continue its dismal performance since its stock market listing last February at 210p a share. \nHSS shares crashed 50p to 79p after news that its half-year pre-tax loss had widened to £14.1milion from £11.3million, in line with guidance issued in June when it blamed lower customer activity in the run up to the general election and less demand for cooling equipment. \nChief executive Chris Davies said conditions had deteriorated in August and “now expects full-year earnings to be below market expectations”.
