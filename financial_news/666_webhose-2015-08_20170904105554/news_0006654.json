Elsewhere, trading profit is up 9% to €300m, and interim dividend per share has increased by 11.1% to 15c. \nGroup revenue has risen to 4.7% to €3bn. “Business volumes grew by 2.7% in the period reflecting a strong overall performance in American markets, an improved performance in the EMEA region and continuing good growth in Asia despite a slowdown in some regional markets,” the company said. \nThe group’s Ingredients and Flavours division accounted for the bulk of the €3bn figure, coming in at €2.3bn – an increase of 8.6% – with business volumes up by 3% and pricing down 2.8%. \nCurrency featured several times in the group’s half-year results, which recorded a “positive effect of reporting currency of 8.4%”. \nSOLID PERFORMANCES \nOverseas performance came in particularly strongly, according to the company’s statement. “Kerry delivered a solid performance in the Americas region in the period despite some industry sectorial issues in North America and inflationary pressures in Brazil. Sales revenue on a reported basis increased by 18% to €1,080m. Business volumes grew by 3.3% and pricing declined by 2%.” \nKerry Group also made five acquisitions during the period, at a total cost of €155.8m: US-based Kraft Food Ingredients and Insight Beverages, UK ‘hot-to-go’ company Rollover, Turkey-based sweet ingredient provider PST Pastacilik Gida, and it agreed to acquire Costa Rica-based Baltimore Spice. It also disposed of two Australia and UK businesses for €151.3m before costs. \nFrom humble co-operative beginnings in Listowel in 1972, the company floated on the Dublin Stock Exchange in 1986 and has now become a multinational giant, with offices and production facilities as far afield as Malaysia, Belarus and Thailand. Its €13bn valuation encompasses 24,000 employees and 126 production facilities, with Denny, Galtee, LowLow, Dairygold, Cheesestrings, Charleville, Cheesestrings, Shaws ham and Easi Singles among the group’s household-name brands. \nAbout the CEO \nStan McCarthy joined Kerry Group in 1976, as part of their graduate recruitment programme, working as USA financial controller in the group’s Chicago office during the mid-1980s. He has been an executive director of Kerry Group since 1999, and was appointed chief executive at the beginning of 2008. \nA Co.
