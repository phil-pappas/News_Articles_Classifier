Louie Douvis by Matthew Stevens \"I worked for Ron Brierley many years ago,\" Asciano chairman Malcolm Broomhead mused as he pondered the logic of his recommendation of Brookfield Infrastructure's staggering $8.9 billion takeover offer .\n\"He had a view that there were always natural owners for assets. Asciano has been the natural owner of port and rail assets for the past seven years or so. But things change.\"\nThey sure do.\nOn Monday evening Broomhead chaired the board meeting that concluded with acceptance of a rebalance and slightly increased cash and scrip offer from Canada's infrastructure Pac-Men of some mystery, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.\n\"In the end the future of these assets, the businesses, the customers and employees is best served under a different ownership structure. In terms of the duty we owe to the company as a whole, the Brookfield transaction was the right thing to do,\" Broomhead told The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday morning.\n\"I think [Asciano chief executive] John Mullen summed it up really well this morning. The question the board and management kept coming to was 'where to now?' We have tried everything we could. This is really just part of the old Australian story, when you are number one or two in this market you can't grow either because there aren't the opportunities or because the ACCC will not let you. And if you go offshore then you need to get to number one or two in your sector or you get crunched.\"\nBroomhead acknowledges that Brookfield has timed its run \"perfectly\".\n\"The most vulnerable time for any company when it comes to independence is always the moment you start coming out of a slump,\" he observed. Certainly the results Asciano's now likely departing chief executive, John Mullen, presented on Tuesday morning were fully indicative of a company on the cusp of long-term promise fulfilled.\n The critical litmus of Asciano's nascent recovery is free cash flow. For the first time since 2011, the port and train operator has closed a financial year with positive cash flow. The company threw off $108 million in FY15 and the data presented on Tuesday suggests management is confident free cash flow, after sustaining and growth capital investment, will hit close to $300 million this year.\nCondemned to one more year The potential that this sort of cash can be compressed out of a business, which management predicts is condemned to at least one more year of flat or lower revenues, says everything about the quality of the turnaround at Asciano that began with Broomhead's defining decision to invite Mullen to replace founding CEO Mark Rowsthorn in February 2011.\nFrom a distance of five years, the courage and quality of that decision can be too easily overlooked. The chairman thought Rowsthorn was being crushed by the weight of Asciano's post-GFC challenges. But he understood too that Rowsthorn was a senior shareholder of a business that had become almost synonymous with its most senior executive.\nFrom of its release from Toll Holdings in 2007 this had been Mark Rowsthorn's Asciano. And then, suddenly, it was not.\nAlmost immediately Mullen went to market with a five-year plan. Most of its milestones have now been passed. Mullen has delivered four years of double digit compound annual growth of earnings in most part because management has consistently outperformed on the cost out targets. Mullen opened a long-term assault on costs with a $150 million target. That was lifted to $300 million last year and Mullen now reckons on outperforming that number by at least 10 per cent.\nMullen promised too that Asciano's returns would match or better its weighted average cost of capital. With return on capital employed hitting 11.4 per cent in FY15, that ambition too has been achieved.\n\"The big credit goes to John and his management team,\" Broomhead said in deflecting any praise directed his way. All these newly buoyant financial indicators, he said, reflect an underlying cultural change in the company.\n\"It was in a mess when he [Mullen] arrived,\" Broomhead said. \"It was just a conglomerate of assets, a mess. On every level, from safety to customer satisfaction to financial results, from the quality of the assets and their stewardship there has been material improvement. All that work has paid off and it is ready to go into a really strong cash flow phase. That would have moved into improved top line earnings and improved dividend payouts.\"\nA master of understatement If anything, the decision was easier when it came to assessing the interests of the other key stakeholder in all of this, the long-suffering Asciano shareholders. \"I think this is a pretty good price,\" Broomhead suggested. As ever, he is a master of understatement.\nBrookfield is offering $6.94 a share in straight cash for Asciano share along with 0.0387 of a unit Brookfield Infrastructure, which will be listed on ASX in a move to sate any concerns over liquidity and potentially create a new funding pathway for Brookfield's future growth. On current pricing, the paper component of the offer is worth $2.21 a share and that lifts the price to $9.15.\nThen, for those who can take full advantage of franking, there is the potential of an extra 39¢ of value that would come from a proposal to deliver a special 90¢ a share dividend payment as part of the consideration package.\nThe thing to appreciate here is that, before this deal became publicly possible in July, Asciano had never traded anywhere near just the cash component of this offer, left alone the value implied by the combination of BIP paper and tax structuring.\nSure, an all cash offer would have been easier for all. But Broomhead seems comfortable that this was never a possibility and knowingly confident that the Asciano and its adviser Goldman Sachs pushed the linked envelopes of valuation and cash-to-share ratio as far as possible in what was a crowded and tough negotiation. Asciano emerged with an offer increased by 10¢, with a better cash to scrip balance and with the prospect of shareholder access to the franking balance and all of that despite a 5 per cent retreat in the market since Brookfield's approach became public.\nTough, detailed negotiations \"They were tough and detailed negotiations,\" Broomhead said. \"They had a huge number of people in the data room. They were tough negotiators.\"\nBoth Broomhead and Mullen emphasised the \"reverse due diligence\" that Asciano and Goldmans did on Brookfield and Brookfield Infrastructure. We asked the chairman whether he would sit long in the paper on offer.\n\"Yes I would,\" he snapped back. \"We have done a lot of diligence on them. There has been a little bit of misunderstanding about them.\"\nBroomhead said he liked the balance of the BIUP portfolio of assets noting that 40 per cent of EBITDA is generated from utilities and poles and wires in Chile, Canada and Texas with another 40 per cent coming from integrated transportation infrastructure, which includes assets with regulated returns like Queensland's Dalrymple Bay coal terminal. Throw in the energy gas pipelines and telecom networks, and you have \"a really good quality infrastructure\" that is diversified by asset class, geography and predictability of its revenue flows.\n\"And that quality of investment is getting a bit thin on the ground in the Australia,\" he noted.\nBut asset quality is not the issue that will define BIP's attractiveness to Australian investors. The bigger concern is governance. Broomhead said Asciano dug deep on that issue and emerged comfortable.\n\"I feel comfortable with the governance in place,\" he said. \"This is not a Babcock & Brown-type company. This is not a financial investor,\" he said. \"They don't take fees on the deal. They are actually very similar to an individual superannuation fund. In the super fund, if I put my money in, I will have a fund manager who takes a percentage of funds under management.\"\nThat is certainly one way of looking at it. What concerns professional investors is the genesis of the fee off-take and its quantum, and the fact that the BIP units they accept offer little or no ability to influence management's decision making.\nAs we have reported before, Brookfield receives management fees of 1.25 per cent of market capitalisation of BIP, plus net debt. And it holds \"special limited partner units\" that leave it entitled to 15 per cent of distributions above $US1.22 a unit in any one year and 25 per cent of distributions of more than $US1.32. On the face of it, this looks to be a good deal more than I am paying for my super management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:05:07.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
