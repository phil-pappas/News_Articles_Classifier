Since then, India has released consumer price data for July that showed retail inflation at a record low of 3.78%, giving the RBI more room to ease policy.\nDeutsche concurs\nStating that the country will outperform emerging market peers in the current volatile environment, German brokerage Deutsche Bank on Friday said it expects RBI to slash key rates by 0.25% in the September 29 review. “We maintain our view that RBI will most likely cut the policy rate by 0.25% on September 29. Growth-inflation dynamic will continue to remain favourable for RBI to justify a rate cut,” it said in a note.\nThe RBI has cut rates thrice by a cumulative 0.75% this year. With positive inflation data emerging, pressure has been increasing to cut lending rates further, which can boost the recovery.\n 29, 2015 1:16 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-29T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T03:34:42.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
