Photo: Bloomberg\nChina's rate cut raises fresh questions BHP keeps faith with China BHP Billiton's profit result shows why some Australian share market investors were buying again yesterday.\nThe giant group's profit was sharply lower, but its dividend crept up as it maintained its progressive dividend policy. With its shares down about 15 per cent this year it has in fact become a dividend yield play for bargain hunters, along with more conventional blue chip giants.\nBHP was pummelled by lower prices for commodities including oil, iron ore and copper in the year to June. Overall, lower prices served up a $US15.2 billion ($20.75 billion) hit to earnings.\nAdvertisement It continued to cut spending and sell more product to soften the impact, but underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation still fell by 28 per cent to $US21.85 billion ($30.23 billion). Attributable profit halved to $US6.4 billion ($8.86 billion), and fell by 86 per cent to $US1.9 billion ($2.63 billion) including one off writedowns and charges. Free cash flow fell by 26 per cent, to $US6.3 billion ($8.72 billion).\nBHP's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation still represented a sector-leading 50 per cent profit margin on sales but it was a very tough year, and chief executive Andrew Mackenzie isn't promising a sudden reversal.\nHe says he is not concerned that China has lost the plot. Glencore's boss Ivan Glasenberg said last week that China was too hard to read clearly at the moment. Mackenzie says BHP believes that it can read China well, well, and is quite content with where it is headed - towards a more liberal, more consumer-orientated growth mix.\nBHP has however downgraded its forecast of peak Chinese steel production, and Mackenzie's game right now is sweating the assets, by lifting production if the demand is there even as the group bears down on capital and operational spending.\nBHP is finding ways to grow the business for half the amount of capital that it would have expected to invest a few years ago, he says - and if there is a sign that BHP's boss is not just talking the talk, it is the group's dividend.\nBHP's progressive dividend policy commits it to either hold its dividend or lift it every year in US dollar terms, and in the year to June it nudged it slightly higher. An unchanged final dividend of 62 US cents (86 cents) took the total payout for the year to $US1.24 ($1.72) a share, three cents higher than the previous year. Australian shareholders did much better. The decline in the Australian dollar means that their payout has risen by 28 per cent.\nSome of BHP's big shareholders think that times are so tough in the resources sector that the group's board should admit that its progressive dividend was a commodity boom thought-bubble, and abandon it.\nI believe however that BHP's chairman, Jac Nasser, and Mackenzie both see it as part of the group's capital markets branding.\nSince the US import Paul Anderson reshaped the group in the late nineties, BHP's ambition has been to create a portfolio of high quality, long-life assets that enable it to make good money right through the commodity price cycle. Mackenzie has further concentrated the focus with this year's spin-out of second-tier assets into South 32.\nThe progressive dividend policy is a statement of strategic intent, in other words. It will not be discarded casually: and if BHP does retain it, it becomes a yield play for investors looking for value - for example during this market downturn.\nBHP's share rose by 45 cents or 2 per cent on Tuesday ahead of the release of its profit result as investors bargain-hunted, and its $US1.24 a share payout for the year was worth $A1.72 a share - a yield of about 7.4 per cent, and that before franking credits are booked.\nRio Tinto also maintains a progressive dividend policy, and while it is more heavily exposed than BHP to a single commodity, iron ore, its shares also rose on Tuesday, by 3 per cent.\nBoth stocks were picked up as part of a general bounce on the theory that selling in previous days was overdone. Their dividend policies would have played a key role.\nBHP and Rio will never be pure yield plays. The big swing in BHP's earnings in the year to June is evidence of that.\nThey are positioning themselves as the utilities of the resources sector as far as dividends are concerned, however. The commodity price downturn needs to be pretty much complete for them to stay the course, but if they do so, their shares will rated as much for their payout as their earnings potential.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T21:56:12.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
