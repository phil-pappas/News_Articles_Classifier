A senior IMF official said reserve asset managers would need about six months notice to adjust to a change.\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, meets the requirements as a significant currency in terms of international trade, but also has to be judged to be \"freely usable,\" or widely used to make international payments and readily traded on foreign exchange markets.\nThe report shows a mixed performance on financial criteria. Although the currency is increasingly used in cross-border transactions and heavily traded in Asia, it is only thinly traded in North America and is not commonly used in international debt securities. Data was missing for some variables, the report said.\nThe senior IMF official said there was no set checklist of indicators to guide the decision and no \"off-on\" switch on whether the yuan would make the grade at the planned review.\nBut he said politics would play no role in the decision, which will govern the mix of currencies that countries like Greece receive as part of disbursements from the IMF.\n\"They should be able to use it directly or they should be able to sell it immediately,\" the official said.\nIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has said adding the yuan to the basket is a \"question of when.\"\nEuropean members of the Group of Seven major industrialized economies - Germany, Britain, France and Italy - favor adding the yuan to the basket quickly. Japan, like the United States, is more cautious, officials have said.\nThe yuan has made huge strides since Beijing's last push for more formal international recognition of the currency, as global financial leaders were struggling to deal with the fallout of the sub-prime and banking crisis.\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang in March asked Lagarde to push for inclusion, saying Beijing would speed up the convertibility of the yuan on the capital account and open domestic individual cross-border investment and foreign institutional investment in China's capital market.\nEarlier this year, frustrated by the refusal of the U.S. Congress to pass reforms to increase the voting rights of emerging markets in the IMF, Beijing announced it would set up its own investment bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nDespite pressure from Washington, which along with Tokyo, has declined to join AIIB, most U.S. allies in Europe have signed up for the Chinese-led initiative, seen as a rival to the World Bank and Japan-based Asian Development Bank.\nSiddharth Tiwari, director of the IMF's strategy, policy and review department, said in a document released with the report on Tuesday that the IMF executive board would decide on the extension proposal later this month.
