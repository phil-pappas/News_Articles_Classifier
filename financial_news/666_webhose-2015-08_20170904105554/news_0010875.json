GoldmanHedge fund managers that traffic in providing risky loans to distressed companies have a long list of hazards to traverse. Are the company’s assets properly valued? What motivations compel competing creditors? Could the regulatory environment stymie our investment thesis?Recently, a dust-up in struggling miner Molycorp ’s bankruptcy case illustrates yet another question that investors are well-served to consider: is a seemingly lucrative lending opportunity vulnerable to structural subordination? Structural subordination , or structural priming, occurs when a legacy lender at a parent company level sees a new creditor leapfrog to a priority position by lending at an operating company level and obtaining liens on that opco’s unencumbered assets.In the case of Molycorp, distressed hedge fund Oaktree Capital Management provided the company a rescue loan before Molycorp filed for Chapter 11 protection. That loan was made at the parent holding company and was secured only by the parent’s equity interests in its operating subsidiaries.When Molycorp headed to court in late June, its debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan – super-priority financing given to bankrupt companies – threatened to structurally prime Oaktree’s loan by making financing available to Molycorp’s operating subsidiaries, secured by unencumbered assets. Facing the prospect of being pushed further away from the operating subsidiaries’ assets and cash streams, Oaktree vigorously objected to the DIP, arguing that the structural subordination of Oaktree’s loan was tantamount to financial priming .Legally speaking, financial priming is different from structural priming – though the ultimate effect is similar. Financial priming occurs when a new loan jumps ahead of a previous lender in the pecking order by obtaining more senior liens on already encumbered assets.At issue before Judge Christopher Sontchi in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court was whether structural priming entitles the primed lender to the same adequate protection for its potential loss in value that the Bankruptcy Code requires in the event of financial priming.Oaktree’s argument – that it does – presented a novel issue since there aren’t any bankruptcy court precedents to look to for guidance. But the question remains largely unanswered today because Judge Sontchi ultimately granted Oaktree’s DIP objection on wholly different grounds.Despite the lack of a definitive decision, Debtwire ’s legal analyst team thinks that lenders should tread carefully in situations where structural priming is a risk. We view the court as unlikely to equate structural priming with financial priming, especially since the Bankruptcy Code is silent with respect to adequate protection in the event of structural subordination – while making it clear that adequate protection is due in the context of financial priming.Indeed, to avoid having to argue financial priming in the event of DIP structural subordination, lenders should secure loans made to a holding company by the assets of its operating company.Lenders can also minimize structural subordination risk by negotiating subsidiary debt limitations or requiring upstream guarantees. However, those efforts could be insufficient when a company enters bankruptcy and the parent’s operating subsidiaries possess unencumbered assets available for DIP collateral. Richard M.
