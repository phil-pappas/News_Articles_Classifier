Think bigger . \nAccording to AAA, August gas prices hit their lowest levels since 2004 and were down more than 80 cents a gallon from a year earlier. With a wonky Midwest refinery going back online and the nation slowly transitioning away from warm-weather fuels, fuel prices already dampened by oversupply and concerns about China's weakening economy (and ability to burn any of the surplus on its own) is giving U.S. drivers a huge break heading into the holiday weekend. \nJust last year, AAA and the Institute For Highway Safety estimated that 34.7 million U.S. travelers took a Labor Day trip of 50 miles or more, with 86% doing so by car. That was the biggest Labor Day crowd since the recession took hold in 2008, and travel site Expedia noted that it came with a 20% increase in demand for airline tickets, 30% more demand for hotel rooms and 35% more travelers seeking car rentals than the year before.
