In the face of low uranium prices, the company said notching up US$33 million in savings was a key step for Paladin to achieve sustainability\". The Perth-based miner said chief executive John Borshoff would accept a 20 per cent pay cut to his $1.4 million salary and other management and directors will have their pay cut following recent earnings losses. Paladin will cut corporate and exploration costs by $US16 million and defer $US10 million in capital expenditure at its biggest mine, Langer Heinrich.
