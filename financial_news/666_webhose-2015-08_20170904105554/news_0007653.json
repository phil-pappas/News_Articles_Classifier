However, better-than-expected June Australian retail sales, released on Tuesday, gave it a bit of a breather. \nThe Aussie last traded at $0.7296, inching away from a six-year trough of $0.7234 set last week. \nThe Australian dollar's near-term direction still hinged on the outcome of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting at 0430 GMT. \nWhile the RBA is considered almost certain to leave the cash rate unchanged at a record low 2.0 percent, it could try to talk down the currency. \nThe central bank has consistently said the exchange rate was still high, particularly as commodity prices such as iron ore have fallen even more, although RBA Governor Glenn Stevens recently declined to be drawn on whether the currency had fallen enough. \n\"RBA policymakers have made clear they can ease policy further if data were to deteriorate again and, with commodity prices lower and short AUD positioning not yet stretched, even subtle shifts in a dovish direction would likely add to pressure on the AUD,\" analysts at BNP Paribas (Xetra: 887771 - news ) wrote in a report. \n\"We expect AUDUSD to trade down to test 0.70 this year.\" \nThe Canadian dollar last traded at C$1.3170 per USD , after a low of C$1.3176 - a level not seen since August 2004. \n\"The longer that crude takes to recover, the greater the risk to energy capex plans for 2016 which in turn feeds into the Bank of Canada's projections and lowers the hurdle for further easing down the line,\" said Elsa Lignos, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \n\"Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) resistance targets for USD/CAD are 1.3246 and 1.3383 though it will take ongoing crude weakness to maintain the USD/CAD rally.\" \nThe Russian rouble reached a five-month low around 63.618 per USD. \nIn contrast, the G3 currencies marked time ahead of key U.S. jobs data due later in the week. The dollar, which was hit on Friday by soft wage growth data, was steadier at 124.07 yen , while the euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.0943. \nDollar bulls are now counting on non-farm payrolls on Friday to strengthen the chances of a September hike in interest rates. \n\"The market is not just focused on U.S. employment, but some continue to eye wages and inflation as well,\" said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. \n\"I don't see the decline in commodities impacting the Fed's rates decision, but those who do not share such a view see lower commodities as a dollar-bearish factor,\" he said. \nDepending on U.S. indicators released before Friday's payrolls, \"the dollar could experience some volatility,\" Murata said. \nThe New Zealand dollar dipped to $0.6566, holding above a six-year low of $0.6498 plumbed last month.
