Chart - Cre ated Using FXCM Marketscope 2.0 Despite the long-term bearish outlook for EUR/USD, the pair may continue to retrace the decline from June as the bullish momentum in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) gathers pace, with a break/close above 1.1180 (23.6% expansion) to 1.1210 (61.8% retracement) likely to expose the 1.1300 handle (78.6% retracement). With the Euro-Zone Purchasing Manager Indices (PMI) a slower rate of expansion, may see the European Central Bank (ECB) sound more dovish at the September 3 policy meeting especially as concerns surrounding China dampens the outlook for global growth. DailyFX Speculative Sentiment Index (SSI) shows retail crowd remains net-short EUR/USD since March 9, but the ratio appears to be working its way back towards recent extremes as it slips to -2.35 on the back of a 17.4% rise in short positions. USD/CAD USD/CAD appears to have marked a failed run at near-term resistance around 1.3210 (78.6% expansion): failure to preserve the bullish RSI momentum raises the risk for a larger correction in the exchange rate. Beyond forecasts for another 0.2% expansion in Canada Retail Sales, a pickup in the headline & core Consumer Price Index (CPI) may heighten the appeal of the loonie as it limits the Bank of Canada’s (BoC) scope to implement additional monetary support. Break of near-term support around 1.2930 (61.8% expansion) to 1.2960 (23.6% retracement) may spur a move back towards former-resistance around 1.2800 (38.2% expansion).
