Rate hikes are expected to hurt bond prices, which move inversely to yields.\n\"The jobs report - this one and the next one - will be looked over very closely,\" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. Current trading may be \"the quiet before the storm,\" he said.\nBenchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last down 7/32 in price to yield 2.18 percent, from a yield of 2.15 percent late Monday. U.S. 30-year bonds were last down 8/32 in price to yield 2.87 percent, from a yield of 2.86 percent late Monday.\nThree-year notes were last down 2/32 to yield 1 percent, from a yield of 0.97 percent late Monday.\nOn Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index was last up 0.16 percent.
