It's not rule of law. It depends on the subject matter and in this case there is no way we can proceed without being retrospective. \n\"They (Government) would have discriminated against the workers fired on or after July, 17 because before that no workers had been dismissed on notice and when the law is passed, no worker will be dismissed on notice. \n\"So it is these 20 000 or so workers that have been dismissed on notice that would not have received any benefits if it was not retrospective,\" Prof Madhuku said. \nHe said there were instances in the past where laws have been passed in retrospect. \n\"We have examples of laws that have been passed in retrospect where there are social or political implications. An example is the land reform process where people who occupied farms in 2000 benefited from a law that was passed a year later,\" he added. \nFormer Attorney General, Mr Sobusa Gula-Ndebele, concurred. \n\"The general rule in line with the rule of law is that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective effect. However, this does not prevent parliament from enacting statutes with retrospective effect for as long as it is clear that is what it wants to do,\" he said. \nConstitution of Zimbabwe Amendment (No 16) Act of 2000 regularised the stay of new farmers who occupied land in 1999 before the law was passed. \nHarare lawyer Mr Aston Musunga, however, said it was unusual to legislate retrospectively. \n\"It is very unusual for parliament to sit to rectify previous dealings. The correct position is that when an Act is passed in parliament, it starts to govern from the day it is gazetted. \n\"I think it will be challenged in the constitutional court if it is passed because the employers can also argue that their rights are being infringed on since they were acting within the confines of the law when they were dismissing those workers,\" Mr Musunga said. \nAnother lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity said international best practice did not allow for laws to be effected in restrospect. \n\"It is universally accepted that you cannot legislate in retrospect and those provisions in the Bill could be challenged as they may also be infringing on the rights of the employers,\" the lawyer said.
