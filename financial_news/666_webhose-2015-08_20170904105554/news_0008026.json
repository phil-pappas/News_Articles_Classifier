Among some tricks briefcase maize buyers employ is the use of mal-functional scales when buying maize from farmers, yet the FRA only weighs from good scales. \nBy increasing the price of maize, the Government has proved that it is pro-poor and is determined to address challenges being faced by small-scale farmers. \nWe hope that the civil servants who are concerned with effecting payments to the farmers for the maize supplied do their part and ensure that the farmers are paid without delay. \nFarmers ought to be paid on time to ensure that they plan and purchase farming inputs in readiness for the next farming season. \nWe also appreciate the fact that FRA has since started buying maize and so far 65,000 tonnes of grain for the 2015/2016 crop marketing season has been bought. \nThe FRA is targeting to buy about 500,000 for the national strategic reserve. \nWe agree with Agriculture and Livestock Minister Given Lubinda who said the Government had so far procured about 65,000 tonnes of maize as of Monday August 17, 2015. \nIn that regard, Mr Lubinda has, therefore, directed the FRA to pay the farmers within two weeks from the time they deliver the grains. \nThe minister said it was important for FRA to pay the farmers within two weeks of purchase. \nMr Lubinda argued that the floor price announced by FRA was the FRA price and not the market price. \nHe was encouraging the private sector to go out there and buy the maize at the market price, which is higher than what FRA is offering now. \nThe Government should also ensure that it quickly moves into rural areas and buy maize from small-scale farmers in order to beef up the national reserves in view of the global food crisis following the poor rainfall pattern last season. \nThe Zambia Alliance for Agro-ecology and Biodiversity Conservation (ZAABC) has since commended the Government for increasing the buying price of maize by the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) by K5. \nZAABC chairperson Emmanuel Mutamba said despite the increase being minimal, the move by the Government showed goodwill in supporting the interests of small-scale farmers (SSF) considering the cost of production the farmers incurred. \nMr Mutamba said despite the increase to K75, it did not swallow up the production costs of maize which was about K100 per 50kg bag. \nZAABC is, however, concerned about the continued dependence of farmers on Government for the purchase of produce. \nSo far the Government has done well but some farmers should also, as time goes on, wean themselves from Government support and have their own wings to fly than entirely depending on the treasury.
