Dean Sewell by Ben Potter Anti-coal seam gas activists plan to take their fight against gas developers to the supermarket shelves.\nActivists from northern NSW and south-west Queensland have registered a \"Certified Gasfield Free\" trademark and a new company, Gasfield Free Brands.\nThe trademark seeks to cover a vast array of foods, beverages, medical and beauty products and services, from meat, fish poultry and game to grains, beer, coffee, tea and cocoa.\nThe organisers behind the trademark include Phil Laird, a co-ordinator of the Lock the Gate Alliance anti-gas movement, who lives on the NSW coast at Scotts Head and has been prominent in the campaign to prevent gas development in northern NSW.\nMr Laird said he was unable to talk about the trademark and the strategy when contacted on Monday, and asked for questions to be emailed to him.\n\"This is an idea that was flagged with us by several primary producers within our network. All we have done is register it for potential future use,\" he said in an emailed response.\nProjects in limbo The trademark was applied for only two months ago and marks a new front in the campaign to prevent NSW following Queensland and developing onshore gas reserves.\n Activists laid siege to the property of a Bentley farmer who consented to Metgasco drilling on his land until the NSW government withdrew the company's licence.\nThe NSW Supreme Court ruled this year that the revocation ordered by NSW energy minister Anthony Roberts was illegal.\nThe company is in talks with the government about compensation that could exceed $100 million, but the government has threatened the company that a buyback offer expires next month.\nAGL's Gloucester gas project is also in limbo and the company could sell it back to the government at a big loss. Santos is pressing on with its Pilliga forest gas project near Narrabri, NSW, but final approval has been delayed.\nSteve Wright, a director of the gas industry-funded Energy Resource Information Centre, said it was unclear what the trademark strategy was but the move could further divide farming communities already split by the battle over coal seam gas.\nMr Wright said it appeared designed to \"bully people into thinking that they have to have certification\".\n\"What's it mean if you haven't got it?\" he asked.\nAlso unclear is what the definition of \"gasfield free\" will be and how the certification would interact with organic certification â€“ a rigorous and well-established process which includes four audits and takes three years, the Australian Certified Organic website says.\nFarmers and environmental protesters oppose coal seam gas extraction because they say it would damage artesian water sources and destroy the value of agriculture in the rich soils of northern NSW and the Liverpool plains to the north-west.\nBut their campaign was dealt a blow by NSW chief scientist and engineer Mary O'Kane, who said in a report last September that the risks of extracting coal seam gas were no greater than those from coal mining, and could be safely managed with an upgraded regulatory framework.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T23:15:29.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
