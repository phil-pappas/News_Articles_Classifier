Colonel Rabe Abubakar, Acting Director Defence Information, said the need to establish the joint operation became very necessary because criminals, miscreants and common thugs had taken over the forest. \n“In the course of this operation, a significant number of rustlers have been routed and large number of stolen cattle recovered,” Abubakar said. \nHe said the ongoing operation will be sustained until the notorious forest was free of criminals and miscreants who constituted nuisance to the citizenry of the area. \n //cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7704   21 2015.
