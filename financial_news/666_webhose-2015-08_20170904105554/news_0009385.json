However, the market tremors over the past week have been felt by people in the UK and we have seen a clear drop-off in confidence as a result,\" Stephen Harmston, head of YouGov Reports said. \nGlobal share markets were hit this week by worries that the Chinese economy, the most important engine for the world economy, was growing at a much slower pace than Beijing's 7 percent target for 2015.
