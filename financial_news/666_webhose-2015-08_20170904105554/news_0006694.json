In 4Q15, the value share of P&G’s beauty business fell 0.70 points compared to 4Q14. It fell due to lower volumes. It was driven by competition from Unilever (UL) and other international players like Estee Lauder (EL) and L’Oreal (LRLCY). \nGlobally, P&G’s hair care brand Head & Shoulders grew organic sales in the mid-single digits for the 20th year in a row. It continued to build profit and cash. Pantene delivered 4% sales and grew its market share in the US for the first time in several years. \nPersonal care organic sales also fell due to a fall in developing markets—largely due to the impact from trade inventory corrections in China. The beauty, hair, and personal care net revenue for 4Q15 was 10% lower compared to a year ago. It was $4.1 billion. \nEarlier this month, P&G announced its beauty brand merger with Coty (COTY). This will help P&G in its strategic portfolio reshaping. Outlook \nAt the CAGNY Conference held in February, P&G announced that it plans to focus on ten product categories and about 65 brands. After the close of the beauty brand merger, P&G will have a focused portfolio that best leverages its core competencies. \nP&G’s focusing on investing significantly in product innovation and technology, brand building, and sales. P&G has exposure in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).
