The economy had added a healthy average of 211,000 jobs a month so far in 2015, and the U.S. is on track to create more than 2 million new jobs for the fifth year in a row.\nThe average of new claims over the past month, meanwhile, climbed by 5,500 to 271,500, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average smooths out sharp fluctuations in the more volatile weekly report and is seen as a more accurate predictor of labor-market trends.\nAlso, continuing jobless claims totaled 2.25 million in the week ended Aug. 8, down 20,000 from the start of the month. These claims reflect people already receiving unemployment checks\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T18:03:58.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
