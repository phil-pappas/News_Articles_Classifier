Work so far suggested Cumbria was suitable, despite concerns from some in the area, he said. \n“There's a substantial part of the UK that is technically suitable to host a geological disposal facility, but as we found in Cumbria that's only half the problem. \n\"The other half of the problem, the more difficult half, is how we overcome the social and political challenges,” he said. \nFuture (Other OTC: FRNWF - news ) work would also have to consider whether waste could safely be buried in the same areas as fracking may take place, he said. \nThe burial chamber would be between filled with at least six Royal Albert Hall’s worth of nuclear waste before being sealed up a century from now, with the waste remaining radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. \nRichard Shaw, head of radioactive waste at the BGS, said figures of between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of UK geology being suitable had cited been over past decades (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T01:27:49.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
