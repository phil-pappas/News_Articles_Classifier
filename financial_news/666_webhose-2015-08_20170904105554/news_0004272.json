PUBLISHED: 21:03, Mon, Aug 3, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:09, Mon, Aug 3, 2015 PH HSBC chief exec Stuart Gulliver focuses on making \"significant progress\" through the rest of the yea \nEurope’s biggest bank also cheered investors by selling its Brazilian operations for a higher than expected $5.2billion (£3.3billion) as it focuses on more profitable regions and cuts costs including tens of thousands of job losses. \nHSBC is also believed to be close to selling its Turkish business to Dutch lender ING Group. \nEarnings from Asia jumped by nearly a fifth as HSBC enjoyed a boom in business in Hong Kong – where it is considering relocating its headquarters from London to help reduce its tax burden – as investors piled into China’s soaring markets. \nThe proportion of profit coming from Asia increased to 69 per cent from 64 per cent the previous year, with Europe down from 18.3 per cent to 16.2 per cent and North America shrinking from 6.7 per cent to 5.1 per cent. We don’t see anything alarming coming from what has happened recently in China, but there undoubtedly will be some muted impact on our business Stuart Gulliver, HSBC chief executive \nChina’s booming stock markets in the earlier part of this year lifted profits for HSBC’s broking business in Hong Kong via the Stock Connect trading link with Shanghai. \nDespite a recent dramatic sell-off in Chinese stocks, HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver, said: “We don’t see anything alarming coming from what has happened recently in China, but there undoubtedly will be some muted impact on our business both from the sell-off in the stock market and from the more reduced economic activity we have seen.” \nHSBC’s interim profit rose from $12.3billion to $13.6billion, although it has set aside $1.3billion to cover a probe into currency rigging and $147million to cover potential fines and settlements in its private bank. \nIt did not provide an update on any decision to move its headquarters to the Far East – a review is expected to complete by the end of the year – but is pressing on with plans to base its ring-fenced UK high street bank in Birmingham. \nGulliver said: “Our performance in the first half demonstrated the underlying strength of our business. \n“Our diversified, universal model enabled the group to deliver increased profitability in spite of slow global growth. Our focus is on making significant progress during the remainder of the year.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-03T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T00:42:23.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
