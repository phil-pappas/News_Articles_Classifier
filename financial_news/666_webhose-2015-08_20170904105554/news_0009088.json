That attempt became realistic during President (Olusegun) Obasanjo's administration when the government decided to invite mobile telecommunications operators into the country to bid for operating licenses because NITEL was no longer an option. \nThen, MTN, a South African company decided to come to Nigeria to bid. During the bidding, the company sought for partnership with other businesses in Nigeria on a 40-60% basis in favour of the South Africans. Unfortunately, there was push backs apparently because mobile telephony was a new concept in Nigeria, not understood by many people. Also, most foreign investors whom we approached were not sure about the success of operating a telecommunication company in Nigeria. \nEventually, it turned out that the ratio of ownership between MTN South Africa and MTN Nigeria was about 21% for Nigeria investors and about 79% for MTN International, South Africa. Our inability to find Nigerians willing to invest initially explains the ownership structure. \nThe statement that 'success has many friends' came true after few years of our operations. Some of my friends whom I invited earlier started making enquiries, blaming me for not pressurizing them to join in the business. However, after much deliberation, the Nigerian and South African investors entered into a shareholders' agreement and started the bidding. Luckily, we won. We all contributed in terms of equity and within a short period of time, our operations blossomed. \nWhat gave birth to the MTN Foundation? \nAs a company, we want to participate in the lives of people living in the communities where we operate. Every organization has a responsibility and it depends on you to either accept the responsibility or not. We wanted to be a good corporate citizen and that has been the hall mark of all our operations. \nTo harmonise our goal and objectives, we thought about which sectors we can make meaningful impact. A study was carried out in 2003 on our Corporate Social Investment Initiative (CSI). From the results of the study, it was recommended that we focus on three areas of Health, Education and Economic empowerment. We decided to back the process up with sufficient resources both in terms of finances and capacity to execute. \nHow do you sustain the activities of the foundation? \nMTN donates 1% of its profit after tax to the Foundation's activities to carry out CSI activities in Nigeria. \nWe looked for people with impeccable character; people whose values can be emulated; individuals who are not tempted, corrupt and have no skeletons in their cupboards. \nApart from the board members we also have patrons, eminent and experienced Nigerians and state men who watch and serve as the third eye of the MTNF Board. \nWe have endeavoured to touch many aspects of life; in education, we are promoting excellence in schools, promoting excellence in music and providing schools with computers to ensure our children are computer literate. On economic empowerment, we are helping women set up businesses. In the health sector, we have funded the installation of machines that help in the early detection of cancer. With these interventions, we are fulfilling our responsibilities as a company to Nigerians; not only set up to make profits but to enhance and improve the lives of Nigerians. \nTo ensure we achieve our goals, we have decided that anywhere MTN exist, the MTN Foundation must be present. It might interest you to know that MTN contributes 4% of Nigeria's GDP and that speaks volumes in terms of our activities. \nIn essence, I believe giving is an over flow of concern. It is beyond charity but about whatever you can do to alleviate other people's burden.
