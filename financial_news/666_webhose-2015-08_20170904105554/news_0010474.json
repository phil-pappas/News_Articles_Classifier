Louie Douvis by Jessica Sier When Julian Parisi left Goldman Sachs he couldn't wait to shuck his corporate uniform of the everyday suits. Now he is running his family's fresh food business, he channels Sicilian style with casual suede during the day and sharp dinner suits in the evening.\nHow would you describe your style and how did it develop?\nI always drift towards loud colours and comfort. My favourite accessory is without doubt a scarf or a jumper around my neck. I have hundreds of scarves and I wear them every day. Maybe it's a comfort thing? Maybe they remind me of cuddles.\nGrowing up, my mother, seriously, blow-dried my hair every morning until I was ... never mind, but it was for a long while. My family is from Sicily and my parents love fashion. I also have two sisters and a lot of female cousins who care about their presentation.\nAt our family Christmas parties, everyone is there looking like they're about to walk down the catwalk. We take pride in how we dress.\nHow does your style fit in with your professional life?\nWorkwise, I'm just in chinos and a bomber-jacket-type coat. I need to be flexible as I'm running around everywhere. I need to be able to get dirty and not have a heart attack that the Armani is ruined.\nI like suede Tod's, half my shoes are Tod's, whether they're boots or loafers. Shoes are very important for a man. It says a lot about them. If a man is wearing unpolished, ancient, worn away shoes it says he's quite careless.\n While I was at Goldman Sachs I was in a suit every day. Which, like jeans, can be a lazy refuge for men; they retreat into that uniform. But I really do love dressing up.\nIf it's work-related, I'll wear a two-button suit jacket. If it's socially, I'll wear a one-button dinner suit. Beautiful. I have been known to wear my shirts with two buttons done up and I used to have a silk scarf underneath the shirt.\nWhat are your favourite pieces and how do you wear them?\nApart from my hundreds of scarves? I love Persol sunglasses; beautiful Italian design. They collapse in the middle. Also, anything by Tom Ford. That man understands classicism and everything is done very well. I wear an aftershave of his, a tobacco one. It smells like you've just gone and lived next to a tobacco stand. But I think it costs like $1000 a litre.\nI also think it's incredibly important to be well groomed. I like to have a straight blade shave every six weeks. I get massages. I get my eyebrows waxed.\nI'm a very precise sort of person. If you look in my undies drawer, they're all folded and in order. Not OCD [obsessive-compulsive disorder] but I'm organised.\nI've got this theory, and I've been talking about it for a very long time, the underwear a person puts on is reflective of how they feel that day. Your underwear gives you power!\nDo you like to shop?\nI don't really shy away from spending money on clothes; I enjoy that part. But when I shop, I wouldn't just walk into an Armani or a Versace store and need to have something just because of the label.\nBut I don't like browsing while shopping. I like to go for a purpose, if I know I've got an event on I'll enjoy going to buy something I need. I'd never just go to the QVB and walk around looking at stuff. I'm also quite time-poor, so just looking around seems like a waste of time.\nLike Boss on Facebook . Follow Boss on Twitter .
