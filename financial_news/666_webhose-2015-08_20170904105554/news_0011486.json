Two-thirds of that sum went to workers and the rest to the state.\nWorkers accused Tyson of failing to pay them properly for \"K-code time,\" representing pre- and post-shift activities such as putting on and taking off required clothing; cleaning and maintaining equipment; and walking to and from the production line, lockers and wash stations.\nWriting for a three-judge appeals court panel, Circuit Judge Steven Colloton found insufficient evidence of an agreement for Tyson to pay wages sought by the Madison workers, and no evidence of such an agreement for the Dakota City workers.\nHe said the district court misinterpreted the Nebraska Wage Payment and Collection Act, which lets workers sue for unpaid wages. As a result, Colloton said the Tyson workers' claims failed as a matter of law.\nA lawyer for workers in both lawsuits did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Tyson had no immediate comment. The company is based in Springdale, Arkansas.\nTyson is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court a $5.8 million award in a wage dispute at a Storm Lake, Iowa pork processing plant. That case could give the nine justices a chance to curb class actions. A decision is expected by next June.\nThe cases are Gomez et al v. Tyson Foods Inc, 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-3500; and Acosta et al v Tyson Foods Inc in the same court, No. 14-1582.
