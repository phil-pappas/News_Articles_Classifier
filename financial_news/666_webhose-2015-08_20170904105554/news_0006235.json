More UAE flexes military muscle in Yemen \n“The people are split for and against and the debate is causing us problems,” says Fouad Hallaq, an activist from Aleppo city. “The Turkish lira side accuses the other side of betrayal.” \nControl of Aleppo city, which was Syria ’s business hub before its five-year war began, is divided between Mr Assad’s forces and the rebels. Activists in Aleppo advocating a currency switch say it is economically practical because Turkey has become the north’s main trading partner. It is also a way to hit the regime in one of its weakest spots, the economy. \nOpponents say Syria’s impoverished population, most of whom are still paid in Syrian pounds, will be hurt by the move. They argue that sticking with the Syrian currency is a sign of nationalism, not regime loyalty. \nAt the heart of the debate are questions about the extent to which Syria’s opposition is willing to become dependent on Turkey for the sake of disentangling itself from the regime. Turkey, one of the biggest supporters of the rebels , has carved out a powerful zone of economic influence in the north even without the region adopting its lira. \nTurkish exports to Syria initially plummeted after the start of the war, from a high of $1.84bn in 2010 to $498m in 2012, but have since recovered, reaching $1.8bn last year and $740m in the first half of 2015. \nWith northern Syria’s economy ravaged by years of conflict, its crossing with Turkey has become a lifeline. Local markets are dominated by Turkish products or goods sent via Turkey. \nMany opponents believe Syrian traders, who would benefit from adopting the lira, are secretly in cahoots with Turkey’s ruling AK party to push the move, although there is no evidence of this. They call it an “Ottoman occupation of the north”, according to Ahmed al-Ahmed, an Aleppo activist. \nYet Mr Ahmed supports the switch. “I reject remaining under the Assad occupation and I reject the currency the regime wants us to use,” he says. Given how much the currency has devalued, people’s savings are being wiped out anyway, he argues. In depth \nFurther reading \nAleppo traders such as Mohammed Durgham, a member of the Syrian opposition’s local chamber of commerce, says the currency debate is still theoretical. “The main issue is whether the border crossing administration on the Syrian side adopts a switch, and whether the chamber of commerce adopts it,” he says. “The issue needs more study . . . for now, traders are still relying on dollars.” \nMr Durgham says Syrian traders met Turkish officials in southern Turkey to propose a switch a few months ago but did not receive as much interest as expected, with no promises of a strategic currency reserve. \nLast week, the northern Aleppo countryside’s sharia council announced it would begin paying employees in Turkish lira to encourage the switch. Other local authorities have been debating the issue. Many have held back because their salaries are in dollars, as are those of the many Syrians employed by international humanitarian and development groups. \nIn practice, the dollar reigns in Syria’s war economy — the Syrian pound has depreciated about 80 per cent against the US currency. Syrians in regime and opposition-held areas aim to convert their savings to dollars. \nOsama Taljo, the head of opposition-held Aleppo’s city council, says this is exactly why he advocates adopting the lira. “All these [payments] are received in dollars and then transferred to Syrian pounds. In other words, I’m giving the regime dollars,” he says. “Imagine that: the revolution is supporting the regime economically . . . That’s why everyone agrees on replacing the Syrian currency. But should we replace it with US dollars or the Turkish lira?” \nThe dollar is impractical, he says, because there is no way to get nickels, dimes and other units smaller than the greenback into circulation — a necessity for the majority of Syrians now living on the equivalent of less than $2 a day. \nSo far, the currency debate is restricted to Aleppo. Opponents say that with other opposition-held areas sticking to the Syrian pound, life will become only more complicated for their war-torn region. More video \nThe debate has become so heated that opponents such as Mr Hallaq have started labelling lira supporters shabbiha — a term originally used in Syria to describe pro-regime gangs that has increasingly become a catch-all term for thuggish behaviour on both sides. \nAdvocates on either side are taking to social media to make their case. Ahmed Primo, a lira opponent, posted a picture on Facebook of a falafel vendor in Aleppo accepting Syrian pounds for a sandwich. “He sees 150 Syrian [pounds] as a better choice than one Turkish lira,” he wrote, referring to the exchange rate. \n“Tomorrow morning he will wake up to find his 150 Syrian lira have become 150 qirsh [Syrian cents],” a Turkish lira advocate wrote in reply. “I advise him to accept the Turkish lira, that’s what’s better for him.” \nHe might have to think again. On Tuesday, after coalition talks between Turkey’s AK party and the country’s main opposition were declared dead, making early elections all but inevitable, the lira fell to a new low of 2.90 to the dollar. The Turkish currency has now depreciated by nearly 20 per cent against the dollar since the start of the year. \nAdditional reporting by Piotr Zalewski Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
