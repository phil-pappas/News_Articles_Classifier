Some companies increased production following the move.\nThe minister said the split has helped to boost Iraqi crude exports by around 200,000 bpd - 300,000 bpd.\nLower oil revenues are straining Iraq's budget, as it fights an Islamic State insurgency that controls large swathes of territory in its north and west.
