Christopher Pearce Share on twitter by Jacob Greber ï»¿\nFormer prime minister Paul Keating has slapped down his successor John Howard for claiming the success of crucial elements of Labor's 1980s and 1990s economic reform program were due to the Coalition's support.\nMr Keating lashed out at what he described as a \"creeping orthodoxy\" that argues the reformation of Australia's economy during the Labor years was \"some kind of project undertaken with the active co-operation of the then Liberal-National Coalition.\"\n\"Nothing could be further from the truth,\" he writes in Tuesday's The Australian Financial Review . \"The fact is the economy was radically changed; by cheek and by jowl as par of a comprehensive philosophic policy.\n\"This was achieved by 13 years of hard slog. And attempts now at rewriting history, that this was all, in some way, facilitated by the opposition, is simply a piece of gratuitous aggrandisement.\"\nThe retort follows an opinion piece written by Mr Howard in Monday's Financial Review , in which the former Coalition leader urged the current Labor opposition to support economic reform .\n\"My two Labor predecessors as prime minister deserve praise for the economic reforms they achieved,\" Mr Howard said. \"So does the opposition of the period because it gave bipartisan support to so many of those reforms.\"\nMr Keating welcomes the compliment but says the \"opposition's occasional common cause with the then Labor government is not and never was the reason for the changes being made. Or their facilitation.\"\n \"The Liberal and National parties were in office for 34 years between 1949 and 1983, bar the three years of the Whitlam government. During those years they stuck to the old closeted, protected model of the economy.\"\nTrade union help Mr Keating writes that the Labor government of 1983 to 1996 \"completely remodelled the country\" with the help of trade unions under a formalised process.\nWhether it was the decision to float the dollar in 1983, financial deregulation, tariff cuts or labour market deregulation, Mr Keating argues that the real challenge was winning over his own side rather than his political opponents.\nHe lists among the things opposed by Mr Howard during this era: the eight wage increases proposed under the Prices and Incomes Accord; the introduction of Medicare; and compulsory superannuation.\nLikewise on tax reform, Mr Keating says the opposition played no role in his decision to cut \"John Howard's top personal rate from 60 per cent to 47 per cent\", or the company tax rate to 33 per cent from 46 per cent, while introducing dividend imputation.\n\"Did I really need the opposition's support for this? And even then, they opposed the capital gains tax, the fringe benefit tax and other changes to corporate tax welfare,\" he writes.\n\"For without the capital gains tax and the fringe benefit tax, I would not have had Labor caucus support for the massive top rate cut or the company tax cut, let alone imputation.\n\"Without Don Chipp and the Democrats, I would never have got the big tax reform package through.\"\nMr Keating said Mr Howard never understood that \"you can't support some bits of a big tax reform without the balancing bits.\"\nMr Keating said he appreciated Mr Howard's compliment about Labor's record in office: \"As Oscar Wilde said: 'anyone who doesn't like flattery has never been flattered'.\"\n\"But I don't want him employing that sort of charm to either change the history or use it as some sort of battering device against the current opposition.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-08-17T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T19:10:20.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
