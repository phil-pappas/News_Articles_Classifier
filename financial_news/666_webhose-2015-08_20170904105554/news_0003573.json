The players headed straight for the team hotel under strong security cover, where they were welcomed, apart from the Taj Samudra staff, by a sizeable Indian media contingent gathered in the hotel lobby.\nThere were only six of them who had not been part of the Test squad based in Sri Lanka for almost six weeks: Yuvraj Singh, Tamil Nadu's S Badrinath, the Uttar Pradesh duo of Suresh Raina and Praveen Kumar, Baroda allrounder Irfan Pathan and Delhi's Virat Kohli. Yuvraj walked - no, strutted - into the lobby, smiling from behind designer sunglasses. Raina and Praveen shared a joke as they followed, Irfan wore a blank look as he removed his headphones and Badrinath, being Badrinath, was silent. Kohli, the youngest of the group at 18, was in the middle of these men as they entered, also wearing glares and with a backpack over his shoulder.\nThe symbolism was that the young pup was being sheltered by the far more experienced international players, but Kohli looked like he could hold his own. It was an extension of the reputation he had gained in a short span of time by his deeds on and off the field. The determined, tough teenager who took guard the morning after his father had passed away during a Ranji Trophy game for Delhi; the cocky upstart prone to spewing expletives while on the field, not one to shy away from a scrap. Kohli had recently captained the India Under-19 team to the World Cup title in Malaysia, and was being tipped for big things when he touched down in Colombo for his first assignment with the senior team. That first taste of international cricket was far from sweet - he made 159 runs in five ODIs with a fifty in the last - but watching the 18-year-old you got the sense that he had something special.\nSeven summers on, Kohli is back in Sri Lanka for his fifth visit as part of the Indian cricket team, but first with the Test squad - and now he is captain. What memories he has of his first international tour back in 2008 only he can fully know - he once told this writer that sharing a dressing room with his heroes back then was \"unnerving\" - but chances are that Kohli the 26-year-old superstar has pushed that firmly in the past and is ready to seize whatever opportunity he and his side get to achieve India's first Test series win on Lankan soil since 1993.\nKohli still divides opinion. You are either for him or doubt him. There does not seem to be much middle ground. The cries over his attitude have diminished, but still abide. His batting has evolved tremendously but there are times, especially against the away-moving ball, when he resembles the debutant of 2008, unsure of whether to go forward or back during his stay at the crease. For all his success in the Test series in Australia either side of the New Year (692 runs in four matches, with four centuries and a fifty) Kohli still finds his abysmal numbers from the England tour last year thrown at him (134 runs in five Tests). Perhaps they will only subside when he scores a twin centuries in every Test he plays on India's next tour to England. You cannot ignore the criticism that Kohli finds when discussions about how good he is begin.\nFocusing on India v Sri Lanka 2015, and at the helm of a young team vastly out of place in overseas tours, Kohli's challenge is to contribute as player and captain - like all leaders of Test teams must. So far in his short time as Test captain he has shown himself eager to attack, even at the cost of losing a Test (Adelaide 2014). He will have to know when to curb that enthusiasm, especially if he sticks to playing six batsmen.\nKohli wants to play five bowlers so that his team can win Tests. Does he have the five bowlers to do so? It doesn't seem to matter what anyone else thinks, because Kohli believes he does. Rain scuppered his aspirations of beating Bangladesh at Fatullah in June, and the weather forecast for Galle is not too encouraging. The five-bowler approach will be used again in the first Test, and Kohli will back each man picked. Under Kohli, the mood in the Indian camp has been one of quiet intent, fuelled by a determination not to back away from any challenge. The players have been careful not to get drawn into any pre-series banter with the Sri Lankans, but when the first ball is bowled, Kohli will make sure his men stand up and be counted.\nKohli constantly wants to seize the momentum. It is at the heart of his batting. He wants to channel that same aggression into his Test captaincy. In Australia he led because first MS Dhoni was injured and then when Dhoni retired. The one-off in Bangladesh was a damp squib. Now begins Kohli's real job, against a similarly transforming Sri Lankan team which has struggled recently and who will be bidding farewell to Kumar Sangakkara after the second Test in Colombo. India have not won a series in Sri Lanka for 22 years and are not readily fancied to do so on this trip.\nThe stage, then, is set for the upstart Kohli to buck the trend. You know he wants to. He's itching for momentum, personally and collectively for India. The boy who landed in Sri Lanka seven summers ago has matured, and it is once again on those shores that he starts a new chapter of his evolving career. Don't take your eyes off him, irrespective of what your feelings towards Kohli are.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Virat Kohli,Suresh Raina,Kumar Sangakkara,India vs Sri Lanka,Galle ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-08-11T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:23:46.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
