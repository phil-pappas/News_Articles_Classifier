The low inflation environment is expected to continue for some time yet, with wages likely to remain fairly suppressed as US companies do whatever it takes to compete with their foreign peers,\" he added. \nBriefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare agreed that recent events -- including China's currency devaluation and a further slide in oil prices -- may have overtaken the Fed's earlier deliberations. \n\"The major risk with the minutes today is that they will be over-analysed and subject to accusations that (what) was said then may not necessarily apply now,\" he said. \nAwaiting word from the Fed Wall Street was trading lower Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.25 percent at 17,291.67 points in deals around noon. \nThe broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.26 percent to 2,096.92 points, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 1.18 percent at 4,999.53. \nBack in Europe, lawmakers in the German Bundestag lower house approved the 86 billion euro ($95 billion) bailout to Greece by 454 votes to 113. \nAs Europe's biggest economy and contributor to Greek aid, Germany plays a key role in the emergency package approved also by eurozone finance ministers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T19:34:16.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
