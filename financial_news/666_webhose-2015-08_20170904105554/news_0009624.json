The SDF has presented training materials, including computers and sets of screen projectors to support the continuous training of the woodworkers at the Forestry Commission Training Centre (FCTC).\nStory by Kofi Adu Domfeh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-28T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-29T03:12:49.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
