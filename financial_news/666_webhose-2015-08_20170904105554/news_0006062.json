He said the Cessna pilot was practicing so-called \"touch and goes,\" or fast-paced, take-offs and landings.\nFour of the dead were traveling on the Sabreliner, according to the San Diego County Medical Examiner. The fifth victim was the pilot of the Cessna, which had no known passengers, the examiner's office said.\nBAE Systems, a British-based military contractor, on Monday named three employees who were on the Sabreliner.\nCarlos Palos, John Kovach and Jeff Percy died in the crash, along with an unidentified contractor, the company said. A spokesman said the three were based in Mojave, California.\n\"BAE Systems employees send their thoughts and prayers to the family members and co-workers of those killed,\" it said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting investigators as they work to understand how this collision occurred.\"\nAccording to its website, the company has a shipyard in San Diego and has contracts with the U.S. Navy to train pilots.\nDebris from the collision littered a field west of the airport and caused a 2-acre (8,000-sq meter) brush fire that was put out by firefighters, Schuler said.\nNo one was injured on the ground, but a firefighter was taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion, he said.\n\"It appears it was a very violent crash, as you can tell by both aircraft being in multiple pieces,\" Schuler said.\nThe FAA and the NTSB will investigate what caused the crash, an FAA spokesman said.
