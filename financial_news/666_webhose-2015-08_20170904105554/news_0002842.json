Jesse Marlow Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Anne Hyland Data is trumping instinct in businesses from music to sport. Australian business leaders explain whether their careers have been driven by relying on data or instincts.\nPaul Bassat, co-founder Square Peg Capital; co-founder SEEK \"All of us are on a spectrum in terms of how much we rely on intuition and how much we rely on analysis and data to drive decision-making. For me, it's really important for the decision to be data driven as much as possible.\n\"We all tend to underestimate optionality. If there's an important decision and you don't have to make it at a point in time, then another day or two is going to give you a bunch more data and allow you to make a better decision.\nDenis Handlin, chairman and CEO Sony Music Australia and New Zealand; president, Asia Sony Music Entertainment, believes instinct still plays a major part in the music business. Sasha Woolley \"The reality in life generally is you're always making decisions based on an imperfect amount of information. Having data is more a preparedness. What is the information that's available? And let me be quite methodical and structured about the information that's available and what's the story that data is telling me? It provides you with a framework or background to help you reach a conclusion.\"\nStill Bassat says there's always an element of intuition or instinct, especially when making a judgment on people. Square Peg Capital invests in early stage technology companies and the decision to back such groups focuses on the management team and getting a sense of whether they're agile, energised and hungry enough, and can execute.\nDenis Handlin, chairman and CEO Sony Music Australia and New Zealand; president, Asia Sony Music Entertainment \"The music business has operated for decades through instinct and experience when it comes to signing talent and capturing the attention of the public.\n Kerr Neilson CEO and founder of Platinum Asset Management. Photographed in his office at 7 Macquarie Place Sydney. Nic Walker \"Ultimately in this business, it still comes down to instinct and experience of where the public are likely to land and react. Sony Music Australia often breaks new artists ahead of any other market, completely based on instinct and understanding of the likely public reaction.\"\nNonetheless, Handlin acknowledges that data has an important place in the music industry. \"We have always used information to better understand the perception of our artists and achieve results with key media and the public.\"\nThe data, whether through focus groups, market research or from social media or streaming, is gathered and used to analyse trends and music consumption patterns, and helps drive marketing, promotions, brands and sales.\nHandlin says the streaming markets growth has given the industry more in-depth data and provided information about the audience and progress of an artist. He says the algorithms that exist on social media platforms have done the same in helping Sony's artists engage their community better through content. Even the signing of developing musicians often stems from the great numbers Sony sees in the streaming and social media environments.\nGerry Harvey photographed at his offices in Hombush. Nic Walker Kerr Neilson, CEO, Platinum Asset Management \"As humans, we have a desire to make linkages that are often not correct. So often the idea we have is based on all these extra pattern recognitions, and it is that heuristic that we're falling back on, in my experience. It's overconfidence. It's denial of certain evidence if it doesn't conform. I would trust the machine more. I believe in the quant. It's quantification rather than algorithms.\"\nNeilson says he would love to believe our hunches are much more reliable but in his own experience, when he's relied on a gut call, he's often come unstuck. He says while we remember when our hunches are successful, we forget when they're not, which is more often. Hunches are often a factor of time management. \"We're all short of time, or think we are, and rather than going that extra few steps of reducing the likelihood of an incorrect answer we don't. It's simply time management and we take shortcuts sometimes when we shouldn't.\"\nStill, Neilson says it's not all about the data. As the CEO of a funds management company that invests in global markets, he's always interested in a company's management and what his instincts tell him about people. \"We pay a lot of heed to the way CEOs present themselves. Are they highly egocentric folk, who are all about the I and never about the we? That can reveal a lot, such as who else is participating in this decision and is the board really active? What drives him?\"\nGerry Harvey, co-founder of Harvey Norman; Australia's largest racehorse breeder Harvey says his career has been defined by instinct or what he describes as being streetwise.\n\"I have to say it's been a major factor in my life, otherwise I couldn't have got to where I am. I have always spent a lot of time trying to figure out how people work. I marvel at a lot of people I have met over the years – how good they are. I never underestimate anyone.\"\nHe says in his businesses he always wants to have a couple of streetwise people around. \"Sometimes a lot of CEOs forget the importance of being streetwise – we are talking about hunches – and people get confused with all that modern research. You need streetwise people in your organisation who understand how people think. You can't be a top executive by just playing with algorithms.\"\nHarvey doesn't dismiss the importance of research and data. He says it has its place but he fears plenty of companies have lots of data and market research that is never used. \"It's great stuff but I've always argued it's no good unless you act on it. So much of it's not used. What's the point of having it?\"\nHe says for Harvey Norman the data is useful as it may take the business \"in a slightly different direction or help get an edge on the other bloke\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/newsandimages", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/113603699450999731037"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:08:32.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
