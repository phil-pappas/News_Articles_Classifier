Telegraph – 1 hour 33 minutes ago -3.00 \nOur consumer expert helps a retiree after the taxman suddenly starts making deductions \nI am so frustrated that I cannot get a response from HMRC over my tax. I have written three letters and tried to phone several times. I am 85 and my income from three small annuities plus state pension is only £10,082. Since my tax allowance is £10,800 I am not a taxpayer and have not been for many years. \nSuddenly this year HMRC has told two of my annuity providers to deduct tax. My other annuity is not having tax deducted. RM (LSE: RM.L - news ) , Hants \nYou tried to no avail to sort out your problem on your own. I spoke to HMRC and a helpful member of staff quickly called and arranged for the tax issue to be corrected. \nMH of Rutland also wrote in, this time about difficulties concerning a change in circumstances which affected her tax code. Her employer had failed to update information about a company car so that MH’s coding factored in expense payments the employer was allegedly making to MH to use her own car when in fact none were now being made. \nI suggested that MH give the taxman more time to verify the facts. HMRC then issued her with a new tax code and a refund of nearly £400, along with details about how this was calculated. \n• '£500 bill was HMRC's mistake' \n• 'Is this email from HMRC or is it a scam?' \nUseful information may be found via gov.uk under “tax codes”. HMRC’s number is 0300 200 3300. \nTax Help for Older People helps over‑60s with incomes of less than £20,000 a year.
