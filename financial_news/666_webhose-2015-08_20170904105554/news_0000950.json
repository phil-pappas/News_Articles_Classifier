And as it creeps up, it is even more important . . . to generate business in your own distribution channels.\"\nAccor, whose brands include Sofitel, Pullman, Mercure and Ibis, is creating a single AccorHotels app for all the brands. It is also planning packages for loyalty members, such as $20 a day adult drinks and children's meal deals which are not available for those booking through online travel agents.\nRival Hilton Hotels is offering free Wi-Fi for loyalty program members if they book their stay directly.\nAccor has also opened its distribution platform to independent hotels, providing more options for customers in cities where it does not have many of its own rooms available such as Kuala Lumpur.\n\"It will be less for us in Australia than in other parts of the world,\" Mr Issenberg said. \"It will drive traffic to our website. Research has shown us the more traffic that is drawn to our website, the more we convert and the more our existing hotels will benefit.\"\nThe online travel agents are fighting back with loyalty initiatives of their own.\nIn May, Expedia launched Expedia+ in Australia. Travellers can earn points when booking with Expedia and there are benefits such as priority customer care and exclusive hotel amenities. Booking.com gives its top users 10 per cent off rates for standard rooms for booking hotels that are part of the program.\nFor online travel agents, repeat business is valuable because they otherwise have to spend a huge amount of money advertising through groups like Google and Facebook to acquire new customers.\nExpedia chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi last month told analysts his company was investing heavily in its loyalty program and customer service because repeat customers accounted for most of the company's profits.\n\"As far as our loyalty programs, we continue to see very nice traction there,\" he said. \"Hotels.com has got the biggest in the family as far as loyalty goes. There are over 18 million hotels.com rewards members around the globe. I think of those 18 million members since the program started, I think they've stayed in 4.5 million motel rooms for free.\"\nPriceline chief executive Darren Huston last week said his company's most loyal customers were those who had downloaded apps from its brands like Booking.com and Agoda.\n\"Once you have an account, we can store your credit card securely, we can store your name, and it leads to like one-click booking,\" he said.\n\"Then our challenge becomes really, and has been, how do we bring more customers into the franchise? And that's what we use paid marketing for. But, generally speaking, our direct business continues to increase, which is a reflection generally of repeat business.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:40:39.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
