This portfolio has beaten the average rival fund in four out of the past five years. Over the poast five years it's generated a total return of 114pc, compared to the average 70pc. \nMr Moore also explains why he fears some of Britain’s biggest income paying stocks’ dividends are looking vulnerable. \nHow do you go about picking shares? \nI look for companies that are changing their business models for the better. Such change comes in different forms, such as a company restructuring after losing market share, adapting to regulatory changes or making technological improvements. \nWhen these changes are not being factored in by the wider market, I buy. \nI also bet against the crowd when I disagree with its view that a particular change, such as a new competitor, will derail a stock. \nRightmove , the property website, and DS Smith (Other OTC: DITHF - news ) , the recycled packaging maker, are two holdings that have paid off. \nI bought Rightmove (LSE: RMV.L - news ) last summer when its price to earnings ratio slipped from 30 to 20 as investors fretted that the firm would start to lose market share after the launch of a rival called OnTheMarket. \nBut this has not played out and Rightmove’s earnings growth is still in double digits. I bought at £22 and the shares are now worth £36. \nI bought DS Smith at 73p in 2009 and the shares are now more than 400p. The company’s business model has evolved instead of simply providing packages to retailers it is now working with them to reduce costs and this has helped it to gain an edge over its competitors. \nHow is the fund positioned at the moment? \nJust under two thirds of the fund is outside the FTSE 100. When Britain’s economy is performing exceptionally well it makes more sense to back the domestically focused businesses that will benefit from consumers having more money in their pockets to spend. The FTSE 100 is far more international in nature. \nThe fall in oil and commodity prices has put the earnings of some of the biggest companies in the index, such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , under pressure. Unless the situation changes and the oil price improves, future dividends are not guaranteed. \nI am also concerned about the two big drugs firms, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) . Both are losing market share to newer competitors in America. \nDividend cover for these shares is getting smaller and smaller each year, which is a massive issue. The management teams are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that earnings can keep growing, but I think there are too many headwinds and at some point these dividends are really going to come under pressure. \nThese big income payers are not safe bets and I fear a big income hole will open up at some point. The FTSE 100 is littered with vulnerability. \nWhich shares have you been buying and selling recently? \nI have been adding to my holdings in shares that will benefit from an uptick in disposable incomes driven by low inflation and wage growth finally coming through. Favoured positions include Staffline , an Aim-listed recruitment firm that helps the unemployed get back into work, and NewRiver Retail , which owns shopping centres across Britain. \nOn the sale side I have recently offloaded British American Tobacco on concerns that sales in emerging markets are slowing. I also think the rise of e‑cigarettes will damage sales. \nWhich shares do you tend to avoid? \nI do not own banks, preferring financial services companies such as Close Brothers , which did not cut its dividend during the financial crisis. I do not want to risk my investors’ money on banks while they continue to go through regulatory restructuring. \nDo you invest your own money in the fund? \nI do indeed and also invest in the investment trust version of the fund. I invest monthly and so does my wife. \nWhat would you have done if you hadn’t become a fund manager? \nI would have loved to become an economist. \n= Our view = \nFunds that buy dividend-paying shares regularly top the sales charts, proving popular with both financial advisers and DIY investors. \nMost income funds have large holdings in the big five dividend payers: Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) , BP, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline and Vodafone. \nBut others, including Standard Life UK Equity Income Unconstrained, prefer to look outside the FTSE 100. \nJason Hollands of Tilney Bestinvest, the investment shop, is a big fan of the fund and holds it in his Isa. \n“You might assume that a fund with a decent slug of smaller companies and a fairly focused portfolio of 60 stocks is inherently riskier than a more traditional fund,” he said. “But this fund’s volatility has been pretty much bang in line with the FTSE All Share index while delivering outperformance that has been both significant and incredibly consistent.” \nA similar fund worth considering is Ardevora UK Income, Mr Hollands added. \nJeremy Lang, the fund manager, aims to buy mispriced shares that are out of favour. \nRob Pemberton of HFM Columbus, the wealth manager, said the Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) fund should sit alongside funds with contrasting styles such as Woodford Equity Income or Artemis Income, which favour blue chip shares. \nMarlborough Multi Cap Income is seen as a more like-for-like alternative. \nIt buys under-researched small firms that are growing rapidly and pay dividends. \nHow to buy the fund as cheaply as possible \nThe fund has a total cost (the “OCF” or “TER”) of 1.15pc a year, more expensive than other funds, which typically charge 0.9pc. Be sure to buy the right “share class”, which is “P1”. The investment shop through which you buy the fund will also levy a charge some as a percentage of the amount invested, some as a flat annual fee. Our tables will guide you to the cheapest fund shop according to the size of your portfolio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-13T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:57:40.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
