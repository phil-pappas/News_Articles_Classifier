We are committed to accelerate shareholder value creation.\" \nSyngenta said Monsanto's verbal offer lacked details that would have let it properly assess the proposed new entity, which it said would have been 30 percent owned by Syngenta shareholders. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) cited lack of clarity on Monsanto's estimate of total cost and revenue synergies, assumptions on net sales proceeds from seeds and traits, the nature and extent of regulatory covenants Monsanto was prepared to offer, and the assessment of risks and benefits from a tax inversion to Britain.
