Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images \nWhat are you doing this weekend ? Are you interested in helping the Berkeley Humane Society promote an excellent cause? If so, don’t miss Bark and Meow around the Block , which takes place this Saturday, Aug. 15 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Ninth and Carleton Streets in West Berkeley. \nOn tap will be the shelter’s annual Adopt-A-Thon and street fair, featuring reduced adoption fees, tasty food and entertainment for the entire family. Admission is free! In excess of 100 dogs and cats will be available for adoption not only from Berkeley Humane, but more than 20 partner rescues – you’re bound to find your new best friend! In addition, you’ll enjoy great food, beer and wine from local restaurants, breweries and wineries as well as kids’ games and activities, live music and entertainment, a raffle and vendor with pet-related and other products. \n“Our goal,” the Berkeley Humane site proclaims “is to find well-matched homes for as many animals as we can and clear our shelters.” The event is part of a greater effort to “clear the shelters” throughout the country, something achieved through heightened public relations efforts, events such as Bark and Meow and reduced adoption fees. \nAttendees’ pets are also welcome at the event, so long as they’re “well-behaved dogs and fearless cats on leash”, according to the Humane Society. For more information, call (510) 845-7735 ext. 228 or email information@berkeleyhumane.org . \nThe Berkeley-East Bay Humane Society was first founded in 1927 by a trio of three concerned citizens. Originally known as Animal Rescue Haven, the organization has seen its priorities shift with the needs of the community’s animals over the years, eventually adding education programs, community pet support programs and a veterinary hospital. The latter was closed in 2009 in order to focus on providing medical care exclusively for shelter dogs and cats. In the 1970s, the group’s board of directors committed to a revolutionary adoption guarantee model that no healthy or treatable shelter animals in its care would be euthanized – setting the stage for a nationwide movement that continues to develop to this day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T00:10:26.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
