Some risk aversion remained, keeping yields on lower-rated euro zone bonds in Spain, Italy and Portugal a few basis points higher on the day.\n\"The snap election is having an impact on the market because it injects new uncertainty,\" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.\n\"The latest euro zone data has been decent, so maybe that's why you see Bund yields 1 basis point higher, but at the end of the day people think the China story has legs.\"\nSpanish 10-year yields were 2.02 percent, Italy's were 1.86 percent and Portugal's were 2.63 percent.\nThe early elections in Greece, pencilled in for September, put an end to a brief period of relief that Athens had avoided default and signed a third bailout to stay in the euro zone.\n\"In the short term, it creates a lot of uncertainty. It will cause a delay in the reforms demanded by the memorandum of understanding,\" said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk, adding he sees Tsipras comfortably winning the ballot.\n\"However ... the new government should be way more stable than the older one and this should dampen implementation risk in the longer term.\"\nGreek 10-year yields were 35 basis points higher at 9.85 percent, but still some way below their almost 20 percent five weeks ago.\nThe plans for elections also lower the chances of the European Central Bank buying Greek bonds as part of its quantitative easing programme any time soon.\n\"The ECB will be very pragmatic ... It is a political issue,\" said Eric Vanraes, fixed income portfolio manager at EI Sturdza Investment Funds.\nThe one-year euro inflation swap traded at minus 0.05 percent. This suggests financial markets see no prospect for inflation in the euro zone in the coming year.
