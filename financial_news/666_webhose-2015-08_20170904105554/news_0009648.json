The U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3.7% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the spring, faster than the initial estimate of a 2.3% growth rate, but the second-quarter rebound appears unlikely to presage substantial acceleration for the economy. Steady but subdued growth still seems to be the path. Other recent reports have shown gains in consumer confidence, retail sales and home building. U.S. stocks soared for the second day in a row Thursday while U.S. oil prices climbed 10% . The rally lost steam this morning as European shares and U.S. stock futures slipped. The Shanghai Composite Index ended the session 4.8% higher, amid suspected government buying of Chinese stocks. Federal Reserve officials now need to filter a range of conflicting signals before deciding whether to raise short-term interest rates in September. Policy makers from overseas attending the Fed’s annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. this week have a message to the U.S. central bank on raising rates: Get on with it already .\n‘Secret Weapon’ Junaid Hussain, a British citizen in his early 20s and a chief in Islamic State’s electronic army, was killed by a U.S. drone strike on Tuesday in Raqqa, Syria. That the U.S. targeted him directly shows the extent to which digital warfare has upset the balance of power on the modern battlefield. Islamic State communications described him as one of the group’s secret weapons. He helped sharpen the terror group’s defense against Western surveillance, built hacking tools to penetrate computer systems, and was on the leading edge of Islamic State efforts to recruit in the U.S. He would post names, addresses and photos of U.S. troops on his Twitter feed and suggest followers find and kill the person. In August, Islamic State’s so-called hacking division claimed responsibility for hacking into the social-media accounts of hundreds of U.S. military members. Mr. Hussain appears to have institutionalized Islamic State’s interest in fostering an electronic army.\nA Broken Bric Not long ago, Brazil stood as the leading example of how a developing nation could rise toward global prominence on the force of a China-driven commodity boom. Now it is demonstrating how resource-rich nations often end their booms with spectacular busts. Brazil’s stock market is down 22% in the past year and economists are voicing fears of prolonged stagnation. Rich in iron ore, soybeans and beef, not to mention oil, Brazil was uniquely poised to benefit from China’s rise. Its annual trade with China, only around $2 billion in 2000, soared to $83 billion in 2013. Today Brazil’s pain from China’s slowdown goes to the heart of the country’s real economy. Big antigovernment protests decry the corruption that a sweeping investigation is uncovering, and many call for President Dilma Rousseff’s ouster. But old habits die hard: Brazil continues to look to China for help. Meanwhile, the eurozone’s heavy reliance on exports leaves the region vulnerable as emerging markets including Brazil stumble.\nBidding Wars In the San Francisco Bay Area’s hot real-estate market , selling a house is easy. The trick is getting $100,000 or more over the asking price. The area’s latest market boom has been driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs. A scarcity of listings has sent prices to new highs: In June median sales prices were up to $1.177 million—a 12.1% jump from June 2014. Buyers often make offers on numerous properties—anywhere from two to 20—before finally winning one. For sellers, agents say the right price tag and attractive staging are key to sparking a bidding war. One couple spent about $20,000 on repainting, recarpeting and staging by an interior designer before listing their 1,800-square-foot, loft-style condominium in San Francisco. The home went into contract nine days after it was listed, at $70,000 over the asking price.\nTOP STORIES U.S. Ruling Clears Way for Unions\nMembers of Hurricane Katrina Diaspora in Houston Look Back at the Past 10 Years\nWORLD Ukraine Secures Debt-Relief Deal, Finance Ministry Says\nAnger Over Garbage in Lebanon Blossoms into Demands for Reform\nBUSINESS Google Rebuffs European Union on Antitrust Charges\nIndia Embraces Luxury as China Turns Cool\nMARKETS Stock Halts Added to Monday’s Market Chaos\nHow Do You Short China?\nToday’s Video Life Aquatic ENLARGE Mermaid enthusiasts are strapping on monofins and spandex tails and hitting the water.

It’s plain stupid to prolong an equity asset bubble created by zero interest rates over seven years. Did we not learn anything from the bursting of the bubble seven years ago?” J.J. Burns of Ireland weighed in: “I do not believe that the Fed should increase interest rates in September. I believe the U.S. and international economies are still too vulnerable to slipping into recession.” Joel Hentges of Quote: : “Raise the rates so we can focus on the future and remove another uncertainty from the equation.” William E. Dove of Alabama commented: “With respect to raising interest rates, the Fed is damned if they don’t and damned if they do…I predict the Fed will keep interest rates low and not rock the economic boat at least through the presidential election in Nov. 2016. After the 2016 election, hang on to your hats.”\nThis daily briefing is named \"The 10-Point\" after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary \"What's News\" digest of top stories.
