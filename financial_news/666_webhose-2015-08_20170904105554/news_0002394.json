Federal land managers who oversee the flats say they don't have any evidence that the salt is being depleted and point to the anomaly of heavy rains around the time of the event this year and last. \"The main international racetrack used to be 13 miles in length,\" said Stuart Gosswein with Save the Salt, a group of race aficionados that has raised the alarm. \"Now we can't even find seven miles.\" The white, treeless landscape rimmed by purple mountains has served as a backdrop for films like Independence Day, countless car commercials, TV shows and photo shoots. The flats, composed almost entirely of common table salt, have also attracted racers for more than 100 years with the hope that the hard, smooth track will help them beat the clock. It's where David Abbott \"Ab\" Jenkins set an endurance record in 1940 with his vehicle, the Mormon Meteor. It's also where New Zealand racer Burt Munro set speed records on his modified bike, including a 1967 record of 183.58 mph, which still stands today. The feat was later depicted in the 2005 Anthony Hopkins movie, The World's Fastest Indian - also filmed at the flats. The annual Speed Week race in late northern summer is the largest annual racing event, drawing hundreds of teams and filling restaurants and hotel rooms in the nearby border cities of Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada, with spectators and pit crews. Wendover Mayor Mike Crawford, who owns an car-parts shop in town, said the decision by race organisers to cancel this year's event while it was still weeks away was a bigger economic blow than last year, when a monsoon storm left standing water on the track on the eve of the race. The event's organiser, the Southern California Timing Association, cancelled the event after racers and fans had already arrived at their hotels. \"Nobody's going to go out of business, nobody's going to lay off people,\" Crawford said. But \"it gives you a little bit of cushion to go through the winter, which is slow in Wendover\". Over six decades, organisers have cancelled the race periodically due to weather. Before 2014, the last time it was scuttled was in the 1990s. The US Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the flats, doesn't believe the flats are shrinking but is still requiring the mining company to pump brine onto the flats every winter and launch a detailed study of the salt crust later in 2015. Both are requirements of the company's permit issued in 2012, said Kevin Oliver, the manager of the BLM's west desert district.
