We still think the yuan has been overvalued and an adjustment in the yuan was necessary,\" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street Global Markets.\nA mixed batch of U.S. data on Friday provided little clarity on whether the Fed will raise interest rates in September.\nIn July, U.S. producer prices increased for a third straight month, and factory production rose at its strongest pace in eight months, the U.S. government said.\nThose figures were somewhat offset by a surprise deterioration in the University of Michigan's index on U.S. consumer sentiment.\nWith the dollar generally well bid, the euro traded at $1.1097, down slightly from late U.S. levels and off last week's one-month high of $1.1215.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was little changed at 124.31 yen , capped by strong resistance in the 125-126 area. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in June that he did not see reasons for the yen to weaken further from those levels.\n\"The dollar/yen has tested those levels many times and failed to break through... For the moment, I suspect the dollar will go back and forth between 123 and 125,\" said State Street's Wakabayashi said.\nData from the U.S. financial watchdog showed on Friday that speculators increased their yen short positions in the week to last Tuesday to more than 100,000 contracts, the highest level since eight-month high touched in June.\nThat suggests many speculators will likely need to buy back the yen in the future.\nThe Japanese currency was little moved after data showed Japan's GDP contracted an annualised 1.6 percent in the April-June quarter from January-March.\nThat was slightly better than economists' average forecast of a 1.9 percent fall.
