The new section will host manufactures showcasing the latest sustainable transportation technologies.\n\nNaji El Haddad, group event director, WFES 2016 shared: \"Revising fuel subsidies in the UAE is already leading to higher prices at the pump, boosting demand from motorists, educational institutions, organisations and mass transit authorities to rapidly adopt the latest fuel efficient hybrid vehicles.\"\n\nHe added: \"The UAE is set a regional trendsetter in reforming fuel subsidies and supporting national sustainability agendas. In turn, the UAE is primed to quickly become a fast-growing market for hybrid and electric vehicle manufacturers.\"\n\nAs of 1 August 201, ADNOC and ENOC, in close collaboration with the UAE Ministry of Energy, have revised transport fuel subsidies. The move has aligned both petrol and diesel prices to global price indices and operating costs.\n\nHosted by Masdar and part of Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week, WFES 2016 will be held at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre on 18 21 January 2016. It will run in parallel with the International Water Summit and EcoWaste conferences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:36:29.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
