RAK Ceramics also has a plant in India. \nFinanced by the World Bank, RAK Ceramics set up Iran operations in 2003, with a $40 million investment. The plant remained running even as sanctions tightened and the Iranian economy floundered. \nThe facility now has three production lines and an annual production capacity of 9 million square metres, RAK Ceramics said. \nThe statement did not disclose a value for the deal, which sees RAK Ceramics acquire the remaining 20 percent stake in RAK Iran that it does not currently own. A spokeswoman for RAK Ceramics declined to say how much it paid until the deal received regulatory approval.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T15:59:08.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
