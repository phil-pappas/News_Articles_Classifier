We have begun, and expect to complete in the month of August 2015, the initial $4.9 million repurchase, which was detailed on our third quarter earnings conference call. In addition, if current market conditions persist, we plan to purchase a considerably larger amount of shares in September 2015, prior to the commencement of our next quarterly blackout period on October 1, 2015. Share repurchases will be completed under the $100 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, which expires on November 20, 2015. \n\"Given current market conditions and the benefits from executing on our previously announced share repurchase program, FSC is pleased to announce that it will be substantially expanding its share repurchase activity during the September quarter.
