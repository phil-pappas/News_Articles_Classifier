It is expected to boost economic activities in the Region and to position it as the second choice of destination after the Greater Accra Region. \nAccording to the MCE, the mall would be located at the Koforidua Old-Estates, the premises of the Timber Market in line with Planning of the Municipality to become a well-planned area in terms doing business as well as to boost tourist attraction in the Region. \nHe said plans were advanced to relocate the Timber Market to Nyame-Krom, a suburb of Koforidua, to make way for the project. \nTouching on Revenue generation, he said the Assembly had contracted consultants to work on automation of revenue collection and expressed the hope that from year, all the Assembly's revenue collection would be done electronically. \nThat move, he explained, was to ensure that all monies collected by the Assembly were accounted for and also to meet their set target for Internally Generated Funds (IGF). \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T00:43:29.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
