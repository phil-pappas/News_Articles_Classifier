The vitamins maker's share price surged through $100 on Wednesday after a strong profit result driven by demand from China. Peter Braig by Simon Evans The 7800 shareholders in vitamins group Blackmores are rejoicing as the stock surges through the $100 mark for the first time, and chief executive Christine Holgate says there's no need for a share split either.\nThe Sydney-based vitamins maker has enjoyed a profit bonanza fuelled by an extraordinary rise in sales to people in China who've been un-nerved by contamination scandals in milk powder, frozen berries and infant formula. They have been buying the trusted Blackmores brand through Chinese online sites such as Alibaba, and in person in Australian supermarkets and large chemist warehouses when they visit as tourists.\nBuoyed by the bullish outlook for demand from consumers in Asia Blackmores shares pushed through the $100 mark during trade, hitting a high of $104, before closing the day at $100.\nBlackmores revealed on Tuesday that net profit after tax for 2014-15 had jumped 83 per cent to $46.6 million, and total sales had risen by 36 per cent to $471.6 million.\nMs Holgate says the board has from time to time talked about whether a share split might be required at some point because with such a high face value the shares might be perceived by some as less affordable.\n\"Granny can't afford it,\" was an argument put forward by some, she said, but that had been discounted around the boardroom table whenever it was discussed.\n\"We haven't seen a need to do it yet,\" she said.\nMs Holgate says the main focus is on delivering strong investment returns and maintaining very high quality across the range of 500 individual product lines, even though there were supply constraints in some areas because of a shortage of raw materials.\n The share price rise of Blackmores over the past 12 months has been extraordinary, with the shares having been at just $27 this time 12 months ago.\nIt has been untroubled by the global sharemarket correction over the past few days.\nBlackmores' 900 staff have also been handsomely rewarded by the profit surge through a profit-sharing scheme where they have each been paid the equivalent of an extra six weeks pay.\nBlood products giant CSL in early August charged through the $100 mark but has since fallen back on the sharemarket wobbles. It was the second time that CSL had hit that mark, having breached $100 prior to the Global Financial Crisis which prompted a three-for-one share split.\nChinese demand for Australia's \"clean and green\" vitamins has spilled over into other companies also, with Chinese private equity firm Hony Capital among the bidders for Swisse Wellness which is up for sale through Goldman Sachs and could fetch more than $1 billion.\nRetired tennis star Li Na is a brand ambassador for Blackmores in China, while Swisse has a range of sports stars and celebrities including actor Nicole Kidman, Master Chef judge George Calombaris, cricketers Ricky Ponting and Mitchell Johnson, and tennis player Lleyton Hewitt involved in their marketing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T17:07:58.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
