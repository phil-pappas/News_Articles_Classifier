The slowing growth in China, the slowing growth around the world, I think that's really going to keep a lid on the TSX for the next little while.\"\nAll 10 of the index's 10 main groups were on higher ground, with the three most influential sectors, energy, materials and financials climbing 6.4 percent, 2.1 percent, and 3.6 percent, respectively. The three groups make up roughly two-thirds of the index's weight.\nSuncor Energy Inc was the most influential gainer on the index, jumping 4.9 percent to C$36.22. It was closely followed by Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, which soared 7.5 percent to C$27.95.\nCanada's biggest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, jumped 2.4 percent to C$73.80.\nAt 11:31 a.m. EDT (1531 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index rose 338.97 points, or 2.53 percent, to 13,720.56.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the TSX by 234 to 12, for a 19.50-to-1 ratio on the upside.\nOn the earnings front, both Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce reported higher third-quarter profits that topped estimates. The results helped TD rise 1.1 percent to C$52.38, while CIBC rose 5.6 percent to C$95.40\nHeadland cautioned that the impact of cheap energy prices was starting to hit banks and said it will become tougher for Canadian banks to maintain their margins.
