Several countries have shown interest in the fund, he said.\nNIIF will have a dual role of equity capital infusion in projects as well as getting the due diligence done for investment in infrastructure projects and have investors available for them, Sinha said.\n“We have obviously discussed this with the New Development Bank and we see them as a very valuable partner in being able to invest in these kind of projects. The dual mission is to have a pipeline of projects and attract co-investor as well. We think the NDB could be a co-investor,” he said.\nThe New Development Bank, founded by the BRICS nations, is expected to roll out its operations by April 2016.\nSinha said smart cities would be an important area of investment for NIIF. The Fund will be regulated by market regulator Sebi.\nThe decision to set up the fund was taken at the meeting of the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier in the week.\nThe NIIF is being established with an aim to maximise “economic impact” mainly through infrastructure development in commercially viable projects.\nThe planned capital expenditure in the first quarter of current fiscal grew 38 per cent to Rs 31,051 crore from Rs 22,552 crore in the same period last fiscal.\n 31, 2015 8:31 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-01T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T04:24:22.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
