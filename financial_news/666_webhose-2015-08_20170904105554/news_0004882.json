Bonds? Gold? Most Americans Prefer Real Estate Written by: Chris Metinko 08/06/15 - 9:26 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — With mortgage rates still near historic lows and rising home prices in the news nearly daily, more Americans are willing to forgo the stock market and invest in real estate. \n“Real estate is very popular as an investment because it is very easy to understand,” said Arvin Sahakian, vice president of mortgage site BeSmartee. “It is tangible, and therefore even the novice investor feels safe with such investments.” \nMore than a quarter — 27% — of Americans who had money to invest for a decade said they would want to put the funds into real estate , according to the finance site Bankrate’s annual long-term investment study. Following close behind, 23% said they would invest in cash, and 17 percent picked the stock market. Interestingly, households headed by college graduates are the only group to prefer stocks.

The Bankrate study points out the S&P 500 has risen 27% through the past two years — but Americans are only three percentage points more likely to choose stocks now than they were in 2013. \n“Over the long-term, real estate has really not been a particularly good investment, at least compared to the stock market,” said Robert Johnson, president of The American College of Financial Services. “The ‘real’ return — that is, after adjusting for inflation — has been negligible and substantially less than the stock market.” \nJohnson pointed to economist and Noble laureate Robert Shiller, who noted that over a 100-year period, the real return on real estate was only about 0.2% annually. Contrast that with the real return on an index of large capitalization stocks being 7.2% from 1926 through 2014. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T17:31:19.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
