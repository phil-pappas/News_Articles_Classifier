That would equate to $50 on a $100,000 deposit.\nIf the Treasurer wants to apply a proper levy to the big four banks only, he has the Greens' full support.\nAdam Bandt, Greens' Treasury spokesman Asked for his response during an interview after reporting CBA's full-year cash profit of $9.14 billion on Wednesday, Mr Narev said: \"I certainly think an outcome which effectively puts a burden on part of the banking sector to support another part of the banking sector is not the way to go.\n\"There is a lot of speculation around this at the moment; we will have to see where it lands.\"\nAdvertisement CBA said in its submission to the financial system inquiry that it may pass on the cost to depositors. Currently, banks would only pay for the financial claims scheme when it was triggered by a failure and there were insufficient funds recovered through a bank's liquidation to recoup the government's costs.\nFinancial system inquiry chairman David Murray said this model is the right one, but Mr Hockey has argued there is little point in chasing banks for money after a collapse.\nThe deposit tax has been budgeted to raise about $500 million a year and revenue from the tax has already been factored into the budget from January 1 next year.\nExempting the smaller institutions would reduce that revenue by about 20 per cent, given the big four banks hold about 80 per cent of deposits.\nCBA said on Wednesday it grew its customer deposits by 9 per cent over the past year to $477 billion. Customer deposits, which are the most stable form of funding, account for 63 per cent of total funding. The rest of the bank is funded with wholesale debt.\nBanks are already being forced to raise more expensive equity to create bigger buffers against a crisis following the Murray inquiry, which highlighted this \"funding gap\" between deposits and wholesale funding as a key risk for Australia's financial system.\nCBA announced a $5 billion rights issue on Wednesday to bolster its regulatory capital. More equity makes it less likely that depositors and bondholders would sustain losses in a crisis – a reason that global ratings agencies hold positive views about the banks' recent capital raisings.\nIn its submission to Treasury on the final report of the financial system inquiry, CBA said Australia's depositor preference arrangements – which prioritise depositor funds ahead of other creditors should a bank collapse – \"significantly reduce the risk of a failed institution's assets being insufficient to meet insured deposits\".\nMoving to an upfront funding model \"would impose an ongoing cost on industry, which may be passed on to consumers through higher fees or lower interest rates for deposit accounts\", CBA said.\n\"The current ex-post arrangement represents a more efficient allocation of capital, provides an equivalent level of protection to customers and ensures taxpayers do not ultimately contribute to the cost of bank failure.\"\nMr Narev said on Wednesday: \"Our view remains the same as at the time of the submission. We understand the history of it, but we don't think it is necessary.\"\nRatification means easy passage If Mr Hockey's deposit tax proposal is ratified by cabinet and the Liberal backbench, it would go through Parliament, despite opposition from the Australian Bankers' Association.\nIts passage would be a win for the Customer Owned Banking Association, which represents credit unions, building societies and mutual banks, and has been fighting against the tax in Canberra and via a national advertising campaign entitled \"Save Your Savings\".\nThe Greens say they would support the tax if it only applied to the big four banks. Greens Treasury spokesman Adam Bandt said this week that if the big four try to pass the cost of the tax on to consumers, they could \"just walk down the road to a smaller bank\".\n\"The big four banks are making world-leading record profits off the back of implicit help from the taxpayer,\" Mr Bandt said. \"They have an advantage compared to their smaller rivals as they're able to borrow money at a cheap rate because everyone knows that the government will step in if they get into trouble.\n\"If the Treasurer wants to apply a proper levy to the big four banks only, he has the Greens' full support and we'll get this through the Parliament within the next sitting fortnight.\"\nThe money raised from the tax would be put into a Financial Stability Fund and used to protect depositors against the highly unlikely event of a bank collapse. In the meantime, the fund would be used to offset gross debt.\nThe government's intention is to announce the tax as part of its response to the financial system inquiry later this month.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/news/politics/hockey-wants-to-exempt-small-banks-building-societies-from-deposit-tax-20150809-givb6u", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/commonwealth-bank-of-australia-to-raise-5b-posts-record-profit-20150810-givpwe"], "published": "2015-08-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T05:45:19.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
