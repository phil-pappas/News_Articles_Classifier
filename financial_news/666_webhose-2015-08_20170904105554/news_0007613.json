We want to see the next Einstein coming from Africa. Students need to be mentored and we want to help guide them, so that they can better tap into their innovative ideas,” said Beckmann. \nIDZ is expected to offer Nigerian developers a place in the ecosystem of global technologies, tools, developers and partners. \nIt will also offer Nigerian developers the opportunity to explore Intel’s cross-platform productivity suites for creating applications targeting Android and Microsoft Windows devices with native performance and exposure to unique platform capabilities. \n– CAJ News \nShort URL : http://cajnewsafrica.com/?p=7227   5 2015.
