This largely reflects the progressive appreciation in the US$ underpinned by strong economic recovery in the US and accommodative monetary policy measures adopted in most Euro zone countries,\" he said. \n\"... the nominal appreciation of the US$ against major currencies has had concomitant effects on the real effective exchange rate, a development that has continued to undermine the country's export competitiveness.\" \nHe said under the fiscal devaluation, value added tax could be imposed on selected imports that had close local substitutes. Simultaneously, an equivalent reduction would be effected on payroll taxes such as employers' social contributions, Mangudya said. \n\"These two measures combine to effectively devalue the real effective exchange rate in order to promote competitiveness and narrow current account deficits in a revenue-neutral manner as has been the case in some Euro zone countries. In this respect, fiscal and internal devaluation measures should be seriously considered in Zimbabwe to improve the cost of doing business and export competitiveness,\" he said. \nMangudya said other than fiscal devaluation, complementary \"internal devaluation\" measures targeted at reducing the cost of doing business, boosting competitiveness, increasing productivity and fostering confidence in the economy could also be pursued. \nMajor cost drivers identified in Zimbabwe include labour, power, water, finance, transport and logistics, tariffs and trade taxes, taxation and information technology costs. \nIn a working paper, Fiscal Devaluation in the Euro Area -- a Model-Based Analysis, the European Central Bank (ECB) said a country belonging to a monetary union could not rely on nominal exchange rate devaluation to increase, in the presence of nominal price rigidities, its international relative price competitiveness and, hence, improve in the short run its trade balance. \nIt said an alternative way to increase the short-run international price competitiveness was through a temporary \"fiscal devaluation\" which is a combination of two measures: the decrease in social contributions paid by employers and the increase in consumption tax. \n\"The reduction in employers' social contributions reduces the unit labour costs. As long as the latter are passed-through into final prices, the improvement in price competitiveness favours exports and reduces imports,\" ECB said. \n\"The reduction in contributions is financed by increasing the consumption tax, which is also a destination-based tax. As such, it raises the after-tax price of domestic and imported goods uniformly, but not the price of exported goods.\" \nIt said the combination of lower unit labour costs and higher consumption tax decreases the price of exported goods and increases the after-tax relative price of the imported good.
