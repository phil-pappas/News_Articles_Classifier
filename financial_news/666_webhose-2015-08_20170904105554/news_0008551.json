Gaya S Turtle Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell Tired of your friends and family? Sick of your Facebook feed filling up with pictures of your co-workers' holidays and other people's offspring?\nAre you keen to meet new people? Then GetYou could be for you.\nSimilar to Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, each user on the rising social network sets up a personal profile. But instead of connecting with people they already know, users are encouraged to meet new people by looking at profile shots and guessing a stranger's age, interests and job.\nOrit Mossinson's profile picture had people assuming she was a beautician who was fond of salads. In fact, she's an Israeli entrepreneur and a serial technology investor with a PhD.\nShe's also the founder of GetYou, which went viral before it was even fully launched. Its early demonstration app garnered almost 2 million users, almost 10 times what Mossinson was targeting.\n\"Whenever I see somebody from Syria playing an Israeli or an Iraqi user playing an American user I am crazy excited,\" Mossinson tells AFR Weekend from Tel Aviv.\n\"Social networks today just do not exploit the crazy potential of the world's network,\" she says.\nFacebook, the current king of social media networks, has almost 1.5 billion active users and is worth $US267 billion ($366 billion) after reporting expectation-beating results this week. A long way behind but still formidable is Twitter, worth $US24 billion, after reporting disappointing results the day before Facebook.\n But size is not a guarantee of success. GetYou, which fully launched last month, is carving out its own niche in the world of social networking by cultivating a different experience that suits how some people prefer to hang out on the web - an experience that's more akin to a costume party where it's easier to strike up conversations with strangers, as opposed to keeping to your own crew on Facebook. The network effect – the idea that the more people use something, the more valuable it becomes – is not the be all and end all of social media networks. Or put another way, a comparatively small network of people can be enough to lure people away from giants such as Facebook.\nCultural differences behind success Indeed the social media landscape is shaping up as far more fluid than anyone expected as new sites proliferate catering to the many and varied ways people want to connect, diverse online emotional dynamics and different business models.\nBoth Facebook and Twitter's multibillion-dollar market capitalisations and hefty numbers of active users do not insulate them against disruption as social dynamics evolve. Just ask now vanquished social sites MySpace, Friendster or AOL.\n\"Yahoo was too big to disrupt. So was Microsoft. Look how well that turned out,\" technology futurist Mark Pesce tells AFR Weekend . Both companies, once the giants of software and technology, have become punchlines in jokes about disruption as they posted yet another set of disappointing earnings results earlier this month.\nOne reason why Facebook will not rule the world is cultural differences in how people want to meet.\n\"Social media networks live and die on the assumptions they make about human behaviour and culture,\" says Steven Goh, co-founder of social network Migme. \"What takes off among US users doesn't always work out for very different countries and people.\"\nMigme launched in Australia, spent three years in Silicon Valley and even shared an early investor or two with Facebook.\nBut the company only really took off after it relocated to Singapore and overhauled its platform to be social in more culturally appropriate ways for its emerging economy target market.\nIt listed on the Australian Securities Exchange via a back-door listing in 2014 with shares at 38¢. These shares have almost tripled since then to $1.05, bringing the company's market capitalisation to $268 million.\nCentral to Migme's success is a policy that stands in stark contrast to Facebook: whereas Facebook enforces a real name policy, Migme allows people to use whatever names or avatars they like.\n\"In Australia and the US, most of us grew up with a sense of comfort in who we are, but we're lucky that way,\" says Goh. \"In Indonesia, the Middle East, parts of Asia, it's not the same and they want to be able to play online without it having real world ramifications. So we let them create a virtual identity, which is very important for our users.\"\nVirtual identity essential Goh says this was essential in their target markets where people go online to escape from long work days, rigid class structures and religious expectations.\n\"We had a view that in emerging markets like Indonesia, the Philippines, India and south-east Asia, these assumptions needed to be subtly different. But we only truly got how after we relocated.\"\nFriendster, MySpace and Facebook were trailblazers in creating online communities. Their successes and failures provide plenty of study material for the emerging social media networks.\nEarly stage entrepreneurs can spend weeks reading the hundreds of articles for tips on how China's Tencent Holdings grew its WeChat messaging app so swiftly to 549 million active users or how Google+ failed to connect emotionally despite being powered and pushed by the world's most powerful internet company.\nFrom her base in Israel, Mossinson created GetYou by harvesting many of the most effective tactics and technology used by the incumbents, but for a radically different experience and social goal.\nOnce users have started making connections they can organise their contacts into different groups, similar to the \"circles\" of Google+. Her team is now working on an update that draws on one of the most powerful traits of social hook-up app Tinder: being able to interact specifically with people within a few miles.\nMossinson has raised $US1.1 million in funding from investors for GetYou and is now in the middle of raising millions more. With investors on board, both GetYou and Migme are under pressure to perform financially, eventually.\nWobbly share performance Twitter's wobbly share performance is proof numbers are nice but not enough if a company struggles to monetise them properly.\nGetYou is focusing on growth rather than profit for now, but its revenue strategies are likely to be similar to Facebook and Twitters: offering their users' eyeballs and insights to advertisers.\nThe challenge with this revenue strategy is the number of players chasing it. Facebook's ability to offer customised, targeted insights to advertisers helped cripple the news industry's online revenue strategies, and emerging sites such as Instagram and Snapchat have the internet giant investing incessantly in developing its technology to stay ahead.\nRelying on advertising has been further complicated by the rise of mobile technology, which is notoriously hard to monetise with Facebook only recently sorting out an effective strategy.\nBut another revenue strategy for mass engagement sites has emerged in the last few years, led most successfully by social networks that target emerging economies such as Weibo and WeChat, both of which are based in China.\nThis model instead derives money directly from users, through e-commerce and premium features such as sending other users digital stickers or gifts. It's the model that underpins Migme.\nMigme's 15 million active users buy digital stickers, gifts and games to give to each other. While many gifts cost less than $1, the volume transacted is enough for the site to continue to invest heavily in future growth. This has made the company profitable - a rare achievement in the world of apps. The company recorded a gross profit of $592,000 in 2014 and Migme is now exploring a range of partnerships in key markets such as the Philippines and Hong Kong.\nTackling different target markets also requires different technology priorities, as users in emerging markets will likely have lower incomes and differing access to internet networks.\nGoh says the devices used to access Migme are typically Android-powered mobile devices that can be bought for less than $100, rather than high-powered smartphones designed for the glossy, high-resolution image-sharing and automatic video-playing features that Facebook and Twitter polish with each update.\nBuilding software that can be used easily on any internet-connected phone could be key to a truly global social network. But even more important is the \"human software\" – coming up with a social media experience that suits the myriad ways in which people from different cultures like to meet each other. Until someone finds an answer to the conundrum, if that's even possible, there's plenty of space for more mini-Facebooks.\n\"It's amazing that Facebook has 1.5 billion users,\" says Goh. \"But there are 7 billion people in the world, and 5 billion of those have mobile phones, and many people have profiles across networks, so it's still anyone's market.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-31T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:11:20.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
