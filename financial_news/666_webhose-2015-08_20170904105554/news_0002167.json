Financing or leasing expensive 3D printers allows businesses and individuals to acquire better machines than they could normally afford while preserving capital.\"After evaluating the partners available in the market we are proud to have selected GreatAmerica Financial Services and Ascentium Capital. Both have sterling reputations and excel in providing affordable financing products, have rapid credit approvals, and are committed to long-term customer service. Our goal is to help speed the adoption of 3D printing into mainstream manufacturing markets and to the general public\", said Becoming 3D CEO Grant Sadowski.Historically, established companies lease equipment to keep bank credit lines open for other purposes. Young, start-up companies and home users lease primarily to conserve cash. While businesses requiring state of the art technology lease equipment to avoid technological obsolescence and to preserve the ability to upgrade.The Becoming 3D approval and leasing process can be completed in just a matter of hours after an applicant has initiated the process online at their website. Leasing gives Becoming 3D customers the ability to lease more sophisticated equipment or obtain multiple machines they otherwise would be unable to afford with a direct purchase.\"Industry experts estimate that up to 70% of traditional manufacturing companies lease their equipment. It only makes good business sense to bring that model to the world of 3D printing and additive manufacturing. Further, being able to offer the same finance options to home consumers as well is just good business sense\", said Sadowski.
