General Electric Co. GE, -0.92% and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.58% are among the other large companies that have adopted proxy-access measures.\nAbout 5% of companies in the S&P 500 index have adopted or are committed to proxy access, estimated Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises stockholders how to vote in corporate elections. Giving investors keys to the boardroom has proved popular at annual meetings so far this year. More than 58% of 84 proxy-access resolutions have won majority support, ISS said earlier this week.\nAn extended version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-makes-it-easier-for-shareholders-to-nominate-candidates-to-board-1438974884"], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T12:04:53.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
