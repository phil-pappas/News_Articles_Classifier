On Thursday, U.S. jobless claims rose from the previous week, but the trend was clearly positive.\n\"We think strong payroll gains should support the dollar, particularly after FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) officials have placed a much greater focus on the cumulative recovery in the labor market than on concerns emanating from abroad,\" said Brian Dangerfield, currency strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.\nMarket participants were also focused on the BoE message.\nThe Bank of England pointed to a possible increase in rates early next year after only one of its top policymakers backed an immediate move and the bank forecast any pickup in inflation from zero would be slow due to a strong pound.\nThe pound fell against the dollar and euro. Sterling fell 0.5 percent to $1.5520, while the euro rose 0.7 percent versus the pound to 70.43 pence.\nThe dollar, on the other hand, slipped 0.2 percent versus the yen, to 124.67 yen, while the euro rose against the greenback to $1.0934.\nThe Swiss franc hit its lowest against the euro since March 10 after a survey showed consumer sentiment fell in July to its lowest since autumn 2011.\nIn late trading, the euro rose 0.4 percent to 1.0714 francs , while the dollar gained 0.1 percent to 0.9800 franc .
