That is down 10pc on the same period of 2014 and compared with the first-time buyer peak of 190,900 in 2006. \nThere is still strong demand in the market - house prices rose 6pc over the past year to a UK average of £261,524 for those moving house. And prices are up 31pc over the past decade, as the average home cost £200,228 back in 2005. \nThe growing cost of moving home is one factor, Halifax analysts believe. As prices rise, more and more home buyers are pulled into paying stamp duty, a tax levied on the sale of properties worth over £125,000. \nThe tax costs buyers 2pc of the value of the home aove £125,000, and increases as the property becomes more valuable, up to a maximum of 12pc on prices above £1.5m. \nThis acts as a disincentive to move frequently, and even though the Chancellor reduced the burden on average-priced homes in the Autumn Statement ;ast year, the trend towards higher prices has hit buyers hard. \n\"The proportion of homemovers paying stamp duty nationally stands at 83pc in 2015 compared with 76pc in 2005, varying regionally from 100pc in London to 66pc in the North,\" said Halifax. \"Significantly higher proportions of homeowners in southern England pay stamp duty at the higher marginal rates with 89pc of homemovers in the capital and 61pc in the South East paying more than £250,000 for their property.\" \nA shortage of supply has also helped to drive up prices , as the population rises more quickly than houses are built and inward migration to areas like London means there are particular pressure points in parts of the country with low building levels. \n“Whilst the number of homemovers has risen significantly since 2009, it remains well below previous levels and has recovered less strongly than first-time buyer numbers,\" said Lloyds Bank's mortgage director Andrew Mason. \n\"This is likely to partly reflect the high costs associated with moving home, as well as highlighting the difficulties that homeowners can face in finding somewhere suitable to move to due to the shortage of properties available for sale.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T03:55:27.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
