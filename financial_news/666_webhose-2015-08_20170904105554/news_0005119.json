Though advocated by Acme’s leading creditors, an auction of the $98.6 million-asset bank may not occur on his watch. \n“Technically, I am the owner of Allied Bank,” Fulmer said of his caretaker role. “I have got to go out and find a buyer for the bank. I don’t plan on an auction, short of not finding a suitor. My plan is to dress that bank up like a sexy girl and put her on the deck of a ship for everyone to see.” \nAcme’s most significant asset by far is its stock ownership of Allied Bank, which remains under the operational control of the Lex Golden family of Little Rock. Those shares are in the physical possession of Acme’s lead creditor, Chambers Bank of Danville, and secure two delinquent loans totaling more than $4.5 million. \n“I’ve had success selling assets at auction, but selling a business is a different animal,” Fulmer said. “I’m going to do everything I can to maximize the one asset I have, which is the bank. I’m going to try to get some money for the unsecured creditors.” \nThe list includes C Holdings LLC, an affiliate of Chambers Bank that holds a $1.4 million delinquent loan claim against Acme. \nHildene Asset Management represents the holders of trust-preferred securities with a claim of more than $3 million. Walter Quinn, chairman, CEO and a leading investor in Rock Bancshares Inc. of Little Rock, owns a $2.2 million delinquent loan connected with Acme. Rock Bancshares is the parent company of $244 million-asset Heartland Bank of Bryant. \nBankruptcy court filings by Acme indicate the Quinn loan, held in the name of Axys Capital Management, is primarily secured by 10,000 shares of Community State Bank of Bradley (Lafayette County). \nCommunity State is owned by Allcorp Inc., a separate bank holding company also controlled by the Lex Golden family. The $17 million-asset bank, the smallest bank in Arkansas, recorded a $6,000 profit through the first six months of 2015. \nAfter reporting a tiny profit in the first quarter, Allied Bank lost more than $200,000 in the second. \nThe bank intended to begin liquidating real estate recovered from bad loans (OREO) in a big way during the second quarter, according to Lex Golden, chairman and CEO of Acme as well as special assets manager at Allied. \nGolden testified in bankruptcy court on April 2 that $4 million of OREO was under contract to sell by the end of the month. The bank’s financial report for the second quarter indicates those sales didn’t happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T11:43:53.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
