Perth's bargain suburbs. Source: Supplied\nMark Hay Realty Group director Mark Hay, who specialises in apartments, said “smarter money” was starting to move into the market.\n“Perth has had a history where we’ve always been 180 degrees to what the eastern states are doing,” he said.\n“The smart investors are reading the current cycle and believe that it’s close to bottom. There was a boost in buyers wanting to get in before the government cut the First Homeowners Grant in July. There’s also been a wave of first-homebuyers who suspect stamp duty exemption will also be cut.”\nAccording to CoreLogic RP Data figures, Boya is the top bargain suburb for houses with median prices coming down by 14.6 per cent. Helena Valley was number two at -14.3 per cent and Jarrahdale third at -12.6 per cent.\n“The thing is you’ll never be able to buy exactly at bottom, just like you’ll never be able to sell exactly at peak,” Mr Hay said.\n“But at the moment, prices will only go down a few more per cent, so long-term buyers are putting themselves at an advantage.”\nOne Realty South director Andrew Stone said softening prices in the North Fremantle area had been intensified by a seasonal shift.\n“We are starting to see more first-homebuyers on the ground,” he said.\n“They don’t have a pressing sense of urgency and are researching the market thoroughly before making a decision. They’re waiting for what they think is bottom, but I think the market is close to levelling out. We’ll soon receive the traditional spring boost.”\nProfessionals Armadale agent David Campbell said buyers needed to be careful to keep realistic expectations when bargain hunting.\n“Generation Y buyers need to realise if they want a bargain, they can’t expect everything to be bright and shiny,” Mr Campbell said.\n“A lot of the established units have come back in price, they might not look super-flash but buyers can now get into a good area near the city without breaking budget.”\nTsokos Property director Anthony Tsokos recently sold a two-bedroom apartment in Newcastle St, Perth for $62,000 less than what it was purchased for in 2008. In his opinion, the established apartment market was offering the best bargains.\n“Often buyers want something that’s new, but with so many apartments currently on the market they have the upper hand in the established market,” Mr Tsokos said.\nManaging director of buyer’s agents Property Wizards, Liz Sterzel said properties that had been on the market longer than two months provided a good opportunity for a discount.\nVictoria Ferdinands, 23, out the front of her second investment property in Shenton Park. Picture: Ross Swanborough Source: News Corp Australia\nYOUNG INVESTOR JUMPS AT PRICE CHANCE\nSHE might still be living with mum and dad, but that doesn’t mean investor Victoria Ferdinands can’t spot a bargain.\nThe 23-year-old nurse recently purchased a bargain two-bedroom apartment in Shenton Park in April — after the suburb’s median unit price dropped by 22 per cent in the past 12 months.\nMs Ferdinands, who purchased her first investment property at age 20 and used the equity she built on the first home to purchase the unit, said she was able to nab the apartment at a “very affordable price” because of the seller’s unique position.\n“The seller was selling 12 units at once as they owned the whole block, so I was able to get it for a really great price,” Ms Ferdinands said. “I’ve definitely noticed it’s moved from an even market to more of a buyers market from the start of the year. I compared the rental yields to West Leederville and other areas and found that Shenton Park would be the best.”\nFellow investor Alan Cormack also bought a two-bedroom unit in the same complex for $419,000 and said it was the first time he had seen that sort of affordability in Shenton Park.\n“I think you’re much better off buying after the price in that area has dropped, it’s not something to be scared of,” Mr Cormack said.\n“For me, the purchase was driven by price. I would say if you’re looking for a bargain in the current market, you can afford to shop around.”\nOriginally published as Where to bag a property bargain ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Where+to+bag+a+property+bargain&c=AS+Perth+prices+soften%2C+buyers+who+were+previously+pushed+out+of+the+real+estate+market+are+grabbing+the+opportunities.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678&title=Where+to+bag+a+property+bargain", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678&title=Where+to+bag+a+property+bargain", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678&h=Where+to+bag+a+property+bargain", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/realestate/news/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fnhlgriw-1227469471301", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/perth-real-estate-where-to-bag-a-property-bargain/story-fndbaln9-1227469471301?sv=9be5e5ba66b262d99a804cafb4908678"], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T23:04:56.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
