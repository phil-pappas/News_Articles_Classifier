Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith Volatility is the new normal in the banking sector as years of stable and consistent earnings growth is overshadowed by tough new capital requirements, a clampdown on investor home lending and the bigger economic picture.\nBank stocks have taken their biggest hit in years after ANZ raised $2.5 billion from institutions last week. Commonwealth Bank is next in line, confirming on Monday that it was working on a \"number of options\" for managing capital ahead of its full-year results in 48 hours.\nA jump in bad debts has also spooked investors after ANZ last week increased its provisions .\nNational Australia Bank partly eased fears about the deteriorating credit quality outlook on Monday when it reported a 15 per cent fall in bad and doubtful debt charges to $193 million in the third quarter.\nNAB reported a 9 per cent rise in third-quarter earnings to $1.75 billion. While the bad debt charges were better than expected, it confirmed increased competition for business lending is impacting its net interest margin which fell in the quarter.\nNational Australia Bank has reported a 4 per cent increase in revenue and a 4 per cent increase in expenses in the third quarter. But analysts say \"jaws\" were negative in the quarter after accounting for one-off gains. \"Jaws\" is banking jargon for the difference in growth between cost and revenues.\n\"Negative jaws\" is the thing that keeps bank executives awake at night.\nThe era of positive \"jaws\", where income grows quicker than costs, has been coming to a close for some time. Commonwealth Bank has been the only bank consistently reporting higher income growth than cost growth. Maintaining that record going forward will be challenging.\n National Australia Bank also provided more details around the provisions falling under the ₤1.7 billion ($3.55 billion) in capital it has put aside to cover for future misconduct charges against its UK business, Clydesdale and Yorkshire.\nNAB flagged total provisions of about $1 billion in the full-year. This includes a provision of ₤290 million-₤420 million in respect to payment protection insurance, and another additional provision of ₤60 million-₤80 million pounds in relation to interest rate hedging products.\nWhile these are new figures, the provisions have already been accounted for under the chief executive Andrew Thorburn's worse-case provision package previously announced in relation to the UK market misconduct issue.\nMeanwhile, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank's full-year earnings highlighted the challenges facing first-time home buyers struggling to get into the market. The bank's Homesafe product, which allows the bank to help a home buyer pay for a house by taking a discounted part share in it, contributed $63 million in revenue, up 26 per cent on last year.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-08-10T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:07:58.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
