Peter Braig Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow Indian energy giant Adani has suffered another blow to its ambitions to enter the Australian coal market after the Federal Court overturned part of its environmental approval for its $16.5 billion Carmichael mine in Central Queensland.\nThe environmental authority for the Carmichael Mine in the Galilee Basin, about 500 kilometres from the Queensland coast, has been set aside following the court action by the Mackay Conservation Group, which said the Environment Minister had not considered departmental advice about two threatened species.\nThe federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt will now be required to re-assess one aspect of the approval process under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\nEnvironmental groups hailed the decision as a major victory which will kill off the mega-mine for good, but Adani said it remained confident the re-assessed project would be given the green-light by the federal government.\n\"It is regrettable that a technical legal error from the Federal Environment Department has exposed the approval to an adverse decision,\" a spokesman for Adani said.\n\"We have been advised that because certain documents were not presented by the Department in finalising the approval, it created a technical legal vulnerability that is better to address now.\"\nAdani faces ongoing speculation it will abandon its plans for the mine given the plummeting coal price and inability to raise finance.\nThe Environment Department said the decision to set aside the approval was done with the consent of all parties, saying it will take six to eight weeks to provide update advice to the minister.\n \"Reconsidering the decision does not require revisiting the entire approval process,\" it said.\nQueensland Resources Council chief executive Michael Roche said the court ruling was another example of environmental activists trying to close down the coal industry.\n\"It is preposterous that a technical administrative hitch could hold up billions of dollars in investment and thousands of desperately needed jobs,\" Mr Roche said.\nGreenpeace said Mr Hunt should use the latest court decision to permanently ditch plans for the Carmichael Mine which would become Australia's largest coal mine if it is ever built.\n\"With the court over-ruling Carmichael's consent, Mr Hunt has a second chance to do his job properly and consign to history this massive mine, which would devastate the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef and be a climate catastrophe,\" Greenpeace climate and energy campaigner Nikola Casule said.\nComment was being sought from Mr Hunt.\nMore to come", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-08-05T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T10:11:28.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
