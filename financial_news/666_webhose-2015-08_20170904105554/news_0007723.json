Eighteen abstained. \n- European Parliament role? - \nGreek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was on Wednesday mulling whether to hold early elections after the austerity bailout split his radical left Syriza party, leaving him powerless to push further reform bills through parliament. \nA decision is expected next week. \nTsipras rode to power in January on a wave of popular anger against the tax hikes, spending cuts and reforms demanded by creditors in exchange for two previous bailouts costing 240 billion euros. \nHe has said that Greece's creditors -- the European Union, European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and the European Stability Mechanism - have agreed to discuss public debt relief measures when a first assessment of reform compliance is completed in November. \nThe Greek premier has also called for the European Parliament (EP) to join the quartet of creditors in overseeing the recently approved bailout deal. \nThe debt currently stands at 312.8 billion euros, the finance ministry said Wednesday. \nThursday's initial 23-billion-euro payment will see 10 billion euros placed in a fund to recapitalise Greek banks, while another 13 billion euros will be partly used to pay back both the ECB and to cover an EU bridging loan of 7.16 billion euros, which was given in July to allow Athens to honour previous commitments to the ECB and the IMF. \nThe bailout accord goes far beyond economic management to include an extensive overhaul of Greece's health and social welfare systems plus its business practices and public administration. \nSeemingly small details of daily life will also be affected by the new rules, from visits to the doctor to an extension of the expiry dates on pasteurised milk in supermarkets. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Shareholders win as Qantas profit soars AAP \nQantas is handing back more than $500 million to shareholders after pulling off one of the biggest turnarounds …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T10:51:39.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
