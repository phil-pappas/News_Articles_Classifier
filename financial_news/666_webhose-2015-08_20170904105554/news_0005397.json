Rob Homer Share on twitter by James Eyers For Commonwealth Bank of Australia, being the most strongly capitalised of the big banks has been worn as a badge of honour.\nDuring results presentations over many years, chief financial officer David Craig has displayed vertical bar graphs showing CBA's capital ratios towering above its peers. He has described a strong capital position as \"a pillar of CBA's strategy\".\nAt the half-year profit announcement in February , Craig said CBA was \"very comfortable\" with its common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of 9.2 per cent. \"I think we have the highest capital of any of the major banks in Australia, clearly and unquestionably strong capital on any global measure,\" he said.\nBut six months later, that situation has changed: CBA has been stripped of its \"best-capitalised\" badge. This is being worn now by National Australia Bank, whose $5.5 billion rights issue, announced in May , shot its CET1 up to 10 per cent.\nCBA's capital ratio has also fallen behind ANZ Banking Group, whose $3 billion equity raising last week will push its CET1 up to 9.3 per cent.\nAs the prudential regulator pressures banks to reduce leverage in the wake of the financial system inquiry, this capital build by its competitors will force CBA to announce a capital raising when it reveals its full-year financial results on Wednesday. CBA's shares have fallen in the past two trading days in anticipation.\nCBA is expected to bolster equity by issuing new shares through its dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) and by an accompanying rights issue or placement. This would be a historic moment for the nation's largest bank – its last big equity raising was a $2 billion institutional placement in 2008.\n\"Capital is the key issue that we see for this result, both the strength of the full-year 2015 equity tier 1 capital ratio reported and CBA's plans to accumulate capital to meet upcoming regulatory requirements,\" Credit Suisse analysts Jarrod Martin and James Ellis said in a preview of the result, in which CBA said report a full-year cash profit of $9.1 billion.\n So how much might CBA raise? The number will be driven by management's view on where future regulatory capital requirements might land and their timing.\nUncertainty remains Despite the two big announcements from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in July – the first that Australia's banks should hold enough capital to make them \"unquestionably strong\" compared to international peers, and the second that more capital should be carried against mortgages – significant uncertainty remains as to the ultimate level of CET1 that will be required.\nWhile APRA was clear that it wanted mortgage risk weightings to rise from an average of 16 per cent to 25 per cent by July 2016, it has not been specific about how much CET1 will make a bank \"unquestionably strong\". Rather, it has been deliberately vague about how this measure should be defined. This is because of the uncertainty about where international reforms of bank risk modelling being worked through by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision will land.\nThe dilemma for CBA is that if it raises too much equity too quickly this will slice into return on equity. But not raising enough capital risks antagonising the market, which might discount a bank stock for being under-capitalised in the current environment. It's a delicate balancing act.\n\"Depending upon CBA's own view as to its capital generation and the timeframes they project for future regulatory capital requirements, raisings of both smaller amounts of capital (through the DRP) and larger amounts of capital (through say, a placement) appear to be justifiable, and turn on bank management appetite to optimise capital as efficiently as possible,\" Martin and Ellis said. \"This is a judgment call, the correctness of which can only be fully assessed in hindsight.\"\nTo understand how CBA is thinking about capital management before Wednesday's result, it is helpful to distinguish between the two capital standards APRA is seeking to impose.\nFirst, risk-weighted assets. To lift mortgage risk weights to an average of 25 per cent by July 2016, CBA said it would need to lift CET1 by 0.95 percentage points. This would be $3.4 billion, based on its risk-weighted assets at the end of the first half.\nThis amount of equity could be generated by the dividend reinvestment plan, which offers shareholders new shares in lieu of a cash dividend, increasing shareholders' equity.\nMorgan Stanley said the partial underwriting of the CBA DRP in the second half of 2015 could raise about $2.5 billion. By July 2016, $4.8 billion could be raised by the DRP, Goldman Sachs said. So the DRP could get CBA all the way to raising enough capital to meet the higher mortgage risk weights by the July 2016 deadline.\nNew 'line in the sand' But second, there is the issue of \"unquestionably strong\". With NAB lifting its CET1 ratio to 10 per cent, UBS analyst Jonathan Mott said this level was the new \"line in the sand\" for capital strength. Unless a bank could point to a CET1 of 10 per cent or more, it would be arguable that it was \"unquestionably strong\", Mott suggested.\nIn a note last week, he said CBA might report a headline CET1 ratio of 9.3 per cent on Wednesday, but this was really 7.9 per cent on a pro forma basis once APRA's higher mortgage risk weights were taken into account and wealth management debt was deducted. (In a separate move forcing capital higher, the prudential regulator is requiring banks to refinance some of their wealth management subsidiary debt with equity, further depressing the ratio.)\nTo lift CET1 from 7.9 per cent to 10 per cent, CBA would need to raise about $10 billion of capital, UBS said.\nThe sale of assets, such as its Sovereign New Zealand life insurance unit (valued at $1.5 billion), could help it towards those figures. CBA could also cut or temporarily suspending its dividend, which has been a common way that banks around the world have lifted equity in the face of regulatory pressure. However, as Mott observed last week, CBA's very large retail base dependent on its dividends made reductions of the dividend unlikely.\nSo it seems a rights issue of about $5 billion is the most likely scenario. Combined with an underwritten DRP to raise about the same amount, this would allow CBA to resume it position at the top of the capital strength pile.\n\"Whatever the mechanism, we consider CBA to be in a privileged position of being able to raise equity at significant premium to book value. This would make the impact from raising capital significantly less dilutive,\" Mott said.\nA CBA capital raising would be well supported in the market, given the strength of its grossed-up dividend yield of 6.5 per cent and its sector-leading profit generation.\nIt would also put Westpac Banking Corp under more pressure. Westpac said in May it would raise $2 billion via a partially underwritten DRP, but last month the bank said it would require an additional $3 billion of capital to lift its pro-forma CET1 ratio towards the top end of the bank's preferred range of 8.75 per cent to 9.25 per cent. As Goldman noted last week, if CET1 ratios end up settling at 10 per cent, Westpac would need to raise a further $3.1 billion.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/eyersj"], "published": "2015-08-09T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T05:03:55.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
