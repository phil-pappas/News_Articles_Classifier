If the venture is renewed, CNP may pay about the same amount to Caixa Econômica for the right to distribute the Caixa Seguros Holding SA venture's products and services across the lender's branches through 2035, the sources said.\nNeither source gave an estimate of the size of the reworked offering.\nCNP has a 51.75 percent stake in the Caixa Seguros Holding venture, with Caixa Econômica owning a 48.21 percent stake.\n\"Such payment would ease the bank's necessity for cash at least for now,\" the first source said.\nAccording to a prospectus on the IPO that was published this week, Caixa Econômica filed to sell some of its stake in Caixa Seguridade through a so-called secondary offering - in which proceeds form the deal go to the shareholders, not the company's coffers.\nBrazil's federal government, Caixa Econômica's full owner, is pinning hopes on a successful Caixa Seguridade IPO to help narrow a swelling budget deficit.\nBrasilia-based Caixa declined to comment, citing the quiet period related to the IPO. Efforts to contact CNP representatives in São Paulo for comment were unsuccessful.\nState-controlled Banco do Brasil SA's investment banking unit is the deal's top underwriter, followed by UBS AG . Banco Bradesco BBI, Itaú BBA SA, Grupo BTG Pactual SA , Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Banco Brasil Plural, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are also working on the offering.\n($1 = 3.5638 Brazilian reais) (Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Additional reporting by Aluísio Alves in São Paulo Editing by W Simon)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T16:57:22.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
