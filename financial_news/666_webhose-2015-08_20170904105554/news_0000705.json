Lex \nContinue reading \nAt the same time, the aggregate deficits for FTSE 350 companies increased from £53.3bn to £64.7bn during the year, as falls in corporate bond yields pushed down so-called discount rates, which are used to calculate the present value of payments the scheme expects to make. \nMost companies have closed their defined benefit schemes to new employees, but some still face heavy liabilities from existing members, who number at least 7m in total. \nMarket conditions suggest deficits will probably continue widening, with falling bond yields counteracting strong investment performance within many schemes’ portfolios, said Barnett Waddingham. \nA code of practice introduced by the Pensions Regulator in 2014 allows employers more flexibility in paying down scheme deficits where this may affect the companies’ growth. BT, which faces a £7bn deficit, said in January it had agreed with scheme trustees a plan to reduce its annual payments. More Co-op Bank censured over failures \nHowever, Nick Griggs, head of corporate consulting at Barnett Waddingham, said: “The increase in deficits seen towards the end of 2014 will almost certainly translate into pressure from scheme trustees to reverse, or at very least address, this trend [of lower deficit contributions] in 2015 and beyond. \n“If you look at the levels of cash that a lot of companies are holding, there does seem to be potential for increased deficit contributions.” \nA small group of companies face the most severe pension deficit risks: 18 have deficits exceeding 10 per cent of the company’s market capitalisation, while seven hold equities within their pension schemes with more than 50 per cent of the company’s market capitalisation. \n“This is a recurring problem but it has been acute in recent years. The regulator has to balance the interests of members, employees and shareholders,” said Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown. \nAn interest rate rise may help by diminishing projected liabilities, he said. “But if those falling liabilities are offset by falling asset values, that could mean they are just running to stand still.” Special Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T01:10:32.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
