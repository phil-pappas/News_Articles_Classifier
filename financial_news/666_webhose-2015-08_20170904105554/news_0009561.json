The contract suffered a 5.2% slide on Monday pushing the global benchmark below $50 for the first time since January.\nSeptember West Texas Intermediate crude CLU5, +1.88% on the New York Mercantile Exchange added 94 cents, or 2.1%, to $46.11 a barrel. On Monday, the U.S. benchmark settled 4.1% lower at $45.17 a barrel, the lowest level for a most-active contract since March 19 and just slightly above a six-year low from mid-March.\n“One day after commodities started the month of August getting crushed, today it seems that at least someone is willing to catch a falling knife,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group, in a note.\nOil stabilized after the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +3.69% and other Chinese indexes gained ground, pushing higher after officials took further steps to inhibit short selling. A bounce by copper might also have helped sentiment amid a general sense that “maybe the selloff was overdone,” Flynn said.\nConcerns about supply, however, might continue to shadow the market, analysts said. Traders will pay close attention to weekly U.S. inventory data, including an estimate from the American Petroleum Institute trade group late Tuesday and the more closely watched report from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.\nElsewhere in the energy market, gasoline for September delivery RBU5, +1.30% added 2.7 cents, or 1.6%, to trade at $1.7015 a gallon.\nSeptember natural gas NGU15, +1.64% gained 4.2 cents, or 1.5%, to trade at $2.79 per million British thermal units.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T18:49:18.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
