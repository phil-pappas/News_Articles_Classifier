Yields are even lower. Mortgage rates are finally, as was inevitable, starting to climb. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , on top of this, comes the Government’s proposal to cut the tax relief that landlords can claim on their mortgage interest. \nAs I’ve argued before, the removal of this tax perk is wrong-headed. Businesses are allowed to deduct costs, including the costs of credit, from their taxable profits, and landlords should be allowed to do so too. \nIf the tax relief is curbed as proposed then many landlords will find themselves pushed into the red, yet still with tax to pay. \nImagine the very feasible scenario where a landlord’s mortgage costs drift upward to the point where rent no longer covered them. He’s making no monthly profit, or even a small loss. \nUnder the Government’s proposals, he could not offset all his mortgage costs for tax purposes, giving rise to a tax liability even where his balance is plunging further into overdraft every month. \n• Nine ways to increase your buy-to-let profits \nThe Government has given landlords several years to adjust to this new tax regime. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so, it casts an alarming shadow over a sector whose fundamentals already look ugly. Values are high, rents relative to prices are as low as they’ve ever been, credit costs are rising and a new tax is about to hit. Could the outlook for buy-to-let be worse? \nA part of the Government’s reasoning behind curbing landlords’ tax relief was to prevent the much-discussed “buy-to-let bubble”. \nBut as so often happens when the Government tries to intervene in any marketplace, the consequences could be unexpected, even disastrous. \nMost property investors are turning away from the market for all the reasons above. Mortgage lenders have also been prudent. \nThe danger now is that this new tax burden will land in a few years’ time when the market, having cooled, is already claiming victims among amateur landlords who cannot cover increased mortgage payments. \nAhead of the Summer Budget many commentators had called for a reduction in landlords’ tax perks, playing to a simplistic idea that buy-to-let is somehow to blame for Britain’s housing crisis. The Chancellor’s decision to increase landlord taxation was therefore an easy, even popular one. It needs to be rethought. \nrichard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-02T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-02T09:59:26.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
