But they also specified that the amounts were subject to change. \nNone of the banks responded immediately when contacted by AFP. \nSome of the banks in Thursday's announcement had already agreed to specific sums. \n• Barclays handed biggest bank fine in UK history over 'brazen' currency rigging \n• Banks brace for more foreign exchange rigging pain as civil lawsuits come forth \n• South Korea joins the global probe into foreign exchange rigging \n•Allianz chief: too many bankers treat market abuse like speeding \nUS banking giant JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news ) agreed to pay $99.5m in January, followed by Bank of America (Swiss: BAC.SW - news ) at $180m, Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) at $394m and Swiss UBS at $135m. \n\"In addition to the billions of dollars in compensation, these settling banks have agreed to cooperate with investors in their continuing litigation\" against other institutions, Hausfeld said. \nThursday's agreements are distinct from proceedings led by US and British regulators, which in May ordered $6bn in fines on six major banks - Barclays, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS and Bank of America - for rigging foreign exchange market and Libor interest rates. \nBarclays, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland all pleaded guilty to US Justice Department charges of conspiring to manipulate the massive currency market. \n\"While the recoveries here are tremendous, they are just the beginning,\" said Hausfeld chairman Michael Hausfeld. \n\"Investors around the world should take note of the significant recoveries secured in the United States and recognize that these settlements cover a fraction of the world's largest financial market,\" he said. \nThe firm also noted that it was considering \"concerted action\" in London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T11:03:25.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
