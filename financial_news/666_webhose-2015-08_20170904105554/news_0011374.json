In a nutshell, the environment has changed in a relatively few short years.Post recession, borrowed capital from the traditional sources the smallest small businesses relied on pre-recession have remained difficult to obtain, and a new breed of online lenders has been leveraging technology to streamline the process and potentially fill in the void left by bankers chasing bigger, and potentially more profitable, fish. In fairness to the bankers, there’s not much difference in how much it costs them to handle a $50,000 loan or a $500,000 loan—making the $500,000 loan far more profitable. Fortunately, in addition to innovative online lenders, two consecutive administrations at the SBA have recognized these market conditions and have been taking steps to make it easier for their participating lenders to be part of the solution: helping more business owners access capital.Earlier this year, the SBA introduced a new tool to help small business owners connect with active SBA lenders in their area who might be a good fit for their loan requests. The goal of LINC is to streamline the time it takes to find an SBA lender—and takes a cue from the online loan matchmakers who are connecting small business borrowers to both online and traditional lenders outside of the SBA. While Maria Contreras-Sweet, the current SBA Administrator, has taken a little heat from Congress for some of the innovative ideas she’s introducing to the SBA, I applaud the effort to bring the loan guarantee program into the 21 st Century.“Under the leadership of Maria Contreras-Sweet and her predecessor Karen Mills, the SBA has progressed with incredible speed over the last five years by embracing new technology that is making the SBA loan guarantee program more accessible and more relevant to small business owners,” said Charles Green, Managing Director of the Small Business Finance Institute (SBFI), in a recent interview . “For example, SBA.gov has added more resources to help users in the last five years than the rest of the government’s website properties combined. This is not your father’s SBA.”By giving borrowers visibility into which lenders are making SBA loans in their area, business owners can reduce the time it takes to find an SBA lender that might be a good fit. The Federal Reserve of New York, not too long ago, reported the average small business owner spends 33 hours looking for a loan—that’s nearly a week away from doing the important work of running his or her business. I believe anything that makes capital more accessible to qualified borrowers is a step in the right direction.LINC isn’t the only technological improvement the SBA is making either. They’re also partnering with third-party players to help streamline the SBA process. Last year I wrote about Evan Singer of SmartBiz and what they’re doing to make the SBA loan process easier for both lenders and borrowers. “Fast access to inexpensive capital is one of the biggest challenges facing small business owners,” he said. “Small business owners shy away from SBA loans because the conventional bank loan process can take weeks or months to close.”SmartBiz is taking that typical weeks-long process and helping lenders approve SBA loans in 30 minutes and have the loans funded in as quickly as five days in some cases. By encouraging this type of technology, the SBA is making the loan guarantee program more attractive to banks and more accessible to borrowers.“The SBA has taken a bad rap for forcing borrowers to wade through reams of paperwork to apply for a loan, but all that paperwork was really borne by the banks, not the borrower,” said Green. “Over the last five years the SBA has been consolidating the paperwork required for an SBA loan. Technology platforms like SmartBiz, are putting applications online and otherwise making it easier for banks to make SBA loans—and thus encouraging banks to make more of them.”In addition to the technology advancements at the SBA, they’ve eliminated the fees on their 7(a) loan program for loans under $150,000 to encourage more loans in that category and are seeing success. “It appears to be working,” said Green. “Bankers are writing more SBA loans of $150,000 or less. The SBA reported that these loans were up by 15 percent in the first six months of reducing the fee.” And, they continue to increase.Contreras-Sweet also spent the first few months of the year courting the two credit union trade associations as another way to encourage these smaller-dollar loan amounts. Because many of the businesses credit unions serve are smaller business, this feels like a good fit and should put more of these smaller-dollar loans into the hands of more business owners.The SBA is not the largest source of funds for small business. Nevertheless, by refusing to follow a business-as-usual policy and working to update and improve the way the SBA loan guarantee program works for both banks and small business owners, I’m convinced they will remain an important source of funds for the businesses their charter was designed to serve.While I don’t believe the bank is going away anytime soon, I can’t help but wonder if the oak paneled and marble floored world of traditional small business lending will eventually either have to embrace a new paradigm and approach to small business lending like the SBA, and many of these technology-driven small business lenders, or if they will become less relevant to a large number of small business owners seeking capital.Click HERE to read more about the SBA loan guarantee program.", "external_links": ["https://www.sba.gov/tools/linc", "https://www.businessloans.com/article/charles-green-sba-interview/", "https://www.businessloans.com/topic/sba-loans/"], "published": "2015-08-26T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-25T20:59:31.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
