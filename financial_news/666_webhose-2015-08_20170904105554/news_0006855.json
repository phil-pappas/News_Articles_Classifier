All the negative consequences for the country and its citizens bear the signatures of Mr Tsipras and Mr Kammenos,\" the party said in a statement. \"We have no confidence in the Tsipras-Kammenos government and of course will not give it if we are asked.\"\nPASOK, once the dominant force on the Greek left, now has just 13 members in the 300 seat parliament, but Tsipras may need all the support he can get. Crucially, it did not say whether it would vote against the government, or merely abstain.\nOn Friday (14 August), support for the government from within its own coalition parties fell below 120 votes, the minimum needed to survive a confidence vote if some others abstain.\nThe main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, has also said it would not back the government, which won power in January on promises to reverse austerity policies. Tsipras was forced to back down to secure the new deal.\n>>Read: Eurozone ministers to decide on third Greek bailout deal\nOpinion polls show Tsipras remains popular, even though he presided over the closure of banks for three weeks, the imposition of capital controls and a near brush with financial collapse. This has raised doubts about how much the opposition parties may want to force new elections.\nA government official said earlier on Sunday that until Greece had secured the new funding, it would focus solely on the technicalities which need to be wrapped up.\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tsipras would hold meetings with government officials after 20 August, when a 3.2 billion euro debt payment to the European Central Bank falls due, \"in order to determine further moves\".\nEurActiv.com with Reuters ,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T08:06:01.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
