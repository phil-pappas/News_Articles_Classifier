They were: Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOX ), Procter & Gamble ( PG ). Yacktman also added to his holdings in Raven Industries Inc. ( RAVN ), Sysco Corp. ( SYY ) and Avon Products ( AVP ). \nThe Yacktman Focused Fund (Trades, Portfolio) ended the quarter down 2.6%, lagging the S&P 500's gain. His approach of buying good companies at low prices in high markets has hurt his short-term returns only to pay off in spades in the long run before. In the late 1990s, for instance, he avoided the dot-com bubble and posted strong returns in its aftermath over the next three years while other funds suffered. \nThe same thing may be setting up to happen again, he said: \nIn the United States, we are now more than six years into a bull market. We think what has worked in the last few years may not work so well going forward. As market sentiment shifts, what has not been successful recently may significantly outperform in the future. \nYacktman added that going forward, as more stocks come off their highs, his managers were also identifying some new ideas and waiting for the right price to act. \nTwenty-First Century Fox ( FOX ) \nYacktman increased his position in Twenty-First Century Fox 6.6% to 28,311,645 shares. The position in the company's B-shares had a 4.87% portfolio weight in the portfolio, making it the eighth largest position. He also hold a position in A-shares of the company, which he reduced 1.52% in the quarter. It is his third largest holding at a 6.6% portfolio weight. \nYacktman said of the company: \nFox is in the \"penalty box\" because the company is trading potentially higher current profits for far greater value in the future. This is exactly the way we like to see our businesses managed. However, the stock market currently favors companies that are maximizing profits today and penalizing those willing to invest for the future. We think this will set Fox up for strong outperformance over time and believe our patience will be richly rewarded.
