He has introduced an initiative in parliament to kick-start the change, which also includes appointing the board by lawmakers instead of the government.\n“I don’t think a decision so important as abolishing the cap should be taken by three board members -- I would like to see a bigger decision-making body,” he said, sitting in his office at herbal toothpaste maker Trybol in Neuhausen, a small town on the German border one hour north of Zurich. “Moreover, I’d like the governing board members to be voted on by parliament.”\nSwiss prices are forecast to fall the most in six decades this year, exports are suffering and joblessness is set to rise in the wake of the SNB announcing on Jan. 15 that it would no longer enforce its cap of 1.20 per euro. While the step, which shook financial markets, has generally met with stoic acceptance among the Swiss public, it has also prompted calls for changes to the way the SNB does business.\nBroader Acceptance SNB President Thomas Jordan was taken to task for informing the seven members of the multi-party government just shortly before the move was made public. Critics also highlighted that a panel of three middle-aged men with lengthy academic pedigrees who have never held a corporate job were exclusively steering the country’s economic fortunes.\n“I don’t think it would necessarily change monetary policy, but it would lead to a broader acceptance of such a decision among the public,” said Minder, who’s been a vocal critic of the government in Bern. “I think practical economic experience would be good for a governing board member.”\nStill, Minder, 54 and a member of Switzerland’s upper house of parliament, fully supports the SNB being in charge of the franc and even wants to increase the central bank’s independence.\nIf Jordan meets with the government at regular intervals, “then that’s not independent,” he said. “He should never set foot in the parliament building and should never meet with parliamentary commissions.”\nJob Cuts While Minder says he doesn’t expect to be successful with his plan for SNB reform, it wouldn’t be the first time he’s countered expectations. He spent five years collecting signatures to start a March 2013 initiative requiring executives have their compensation decided upon by shareholders rather than by clubby corporate boards.\nThe measure initially was dismissed by high-profile corporate chief executive officers such as Nestle SA’s Paul Bulcke, the government and parliament in Bern as damaging to Switzerland’s ability to serve as a base for big companies. The Swiss public ignored these concerns and backed it with almost 68 percent of votes cast.\nAlthough his toothpaste business, which employs 25 people, doesn’t export its products and therefore hasn’t been hit by the appreciating currency, Minder sees small and medium-sized companies as being particularly vulnerable to the strong franc, as narrow profit margins quickly get eroded.\n“Companies don’t know where else to save,” he said, predicting job cuts at such businesses. “For decades they’ve been trying to compensate for the ever stronger franc.”", "external_links": ["http://www.parlament.ch/d/suche/Seiten/geschaefte.aspx?gesch_id=20150401\\", "http://www.trybol.ch/\\"], "published": "2015-08-06T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T08:16:38.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
