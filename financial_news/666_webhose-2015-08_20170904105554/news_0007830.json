Photo: John Gollings\nProperty developer and manager Charter Hall's unlisted fund has bought the former Fairfax Media print and distribution facility in Chullora, western Sydney, for $45 million.\nIt will sit in Charter Hall Core Plus Industrial Fund (CPIF) and comes as Fairfax Media, the publisher of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers, last week sold its plant at Tullamarine in Melbourne's north west for $16 million to Bobby Zagame, managing director of Zagame Group, which owns the Zagame Automotive car dealership.\nThe two plants served as the main printing presses for the Fairfax group for more than 10 years. The sites were offered to the market through Colliers International and CBRE late in 2014.\nThe production line at the former Fairfax Media printing presses at Chullora. Photo: Michele Mossop\nA range of buyers looked at the site from industrial companies looking for warehouse space to hotel operators and retailers.\nAdvertisement The largest facility is the site at Chullora in Sydney. It was bought in 1995 for about $340 million and Fairfax updated the facilities in the early 2000s.\nIt has an existing industrial complex of 37,600 square metres and sits on a land parcel of more than 10 hectares. Chullora is about 10 kilometres from the Sydney central business district.\nIn Melbourne, the Tullamarine plant, with its distinctive newspaper scroll, is not far from Melbourne airport. The 24,000 sq m site cost about $220 million to build. Fairfax Media bought the land for about $5.6 million in 1999.\nFairfax Media decommissioned the plants in mid 2014, with The Sydney Morning Herald , The Australian Financial Review and The Sun-Herald all printed in North Richmond and The Age in Ballarat, Victoria.\nCPIF fund Manager Paul Ford said: \"The Chullora acquisition presents a strategic site acquisition in which CPIF can increase the floor space and capture strong tenant demand that exists for space within prime Sydney industrial precincts. This acquisition increases the prime Sydney weighting of CPIF and extends the group's industrial platform beyond $3 billion.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:07:41.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
