But now, with the dairy price slump, Finance Minister Bill English is raising the alarm. \n\"Like any other farmer they will have a pretty tight situation to deal with,\" he says. \nWith $1.6 billion worth of assets Landcorp is the country's biggest farmer, but official figures show it made just $1 million in the past six months and that's before the full impact of the dairy price plunge. \nThe Government is concerned about its debt, saying a farm sell-off should be considered. \n\"If there's a need, one of the options would be to sell-down farms to reduce debt,\" says Mr English. \nLabour leader Andrew Little says the Government must be sure it's not selling to overseas buyers who can't add value to New Zealand farms. \nLandcorp has 140 farms and is locked into big dairy-related plans - like Wairakei, which is converting \n18,000 hectares into 39 farms with 42,000 cows. \nCurrently it is a third of the way through, but with a big investment in dairy amid the falling payout, Mr English is worried. So Landcorp is reviewing the project. \n\"There's more concern because the dairying payout is a lot lower and they're a fairly big dairy operator,\" Mr English says. \n\"If it's another failure like Solid Energy then that failure sits at the feet of this Government that shows how hopeless a manager they really are,\" Mr Little says. \nThe full extent of Landcorp's debt will be revealed in the coming weeks when its accounts are released. \n3 News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-17T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T18:52:57.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
