In this paper, it proposes to transfer more materials from the current Handbook format into the Rulebook, including replacing the: General Prudential sourcebook (GENPRU) rules on capital adequacy calculations for financial conglomerates with a new Rulebook Part called Financial Conglomerates; GENPRU rules on third country groups with a new Chapter in the Groups Part called Third Country Groups; SYSC on group risk systems and controls with a new Rulebook Part called Group Risk Systems; and Supervision Manual (SUP) rules on reporting and compliance reports with new rules in the Regulatory Reporting Part. \nNone of the changes represents a change in policy. PRA has moved the relevant parts of the Handbook into Rules, Policy or Supervisory Statements as appropriate and deleted those parts of the Handbook it feels are no longer necessary. PRA asks for responses by 13 November.
