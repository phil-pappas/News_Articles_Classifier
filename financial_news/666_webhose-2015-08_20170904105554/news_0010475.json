Lee Besford Originally a leisure company based at the country club, Quindell and its redoubtable founder, Rob Terry, soon outgrew the job of managing tee times and health spa appointments.\nBy the time Quindell listed on the UK's secondary AIM market in 2011 with a market value of £33 million, it still owned the golf course but had also acquired an improbable collection of businesses that included a call centre, a technology unit that worked with telecommunications firms, and a chauffer services division.\nLife as a public company did not put an end to the acquisition spree. Over the next three years Terry would hoover up close to 30 small companies, mostly in the legal, insurance and medical industries, as Quindell transformed itself into a \"one-stop shop\" for big insurers dealing with claims ranging from vehicle accidents to workplace hearing loss.\nInvestors could not get enough of the new strategy as Quindell trumpeted a series of big-contract wins and churned out accounts with eye-watering profit growth. \"This business is going to be a FTSE 100 [company],\" Terry declared in April 2013 .\n Slater & Gordon managing director Andrew Grech declared his firm's acquisition of Quindell's professional services business in the UK would be \"transformative\". He will be right one way or the other. Louie Douvis He was almost right. A year later, Quindell's market capitalisation eclipsed £2.5 billion.\nAnd then disaster struck in the form of little-known US short selling firm, Gotham City Research , which makes profits when a companies' share price tanks.\nIn a 74-page report entitled \"Quindell PLC: A country club built on quicksand\", Gotham claimed up to 80 per cent of Quindell's reported profits were \"suspect\" and questioned how the company could achieve \"Google-esque profit margins\" in just two years. Quindell shares tumbled 39 per cent in one day.\nGotham was promptly sued by Quindell, which claimed the report was \"highly defamatory\" and issued a 12,500-word rebuttal . Quindell won the case when Gotham failed to defend itself, but the damage had been done as investors began to question the company's finances.\n\"Quindell was completely trashed,\" says Augustin Eden, a research analyst at Accendo Markets. \"Its reputation went through the floor. That dramatic fall from grace is not something you see very often even on the AIM market, particularly for such a well-known company.\"\nInvestors finally lost patience with Terry, who resigned as chairman in November over a complicated loan arrangement that first appeared to have increased his stake in the company but upon closer inspection had actually reduced his holding.\nBut Quindell arguably hit rock-bottom in June, two months after the Slater & Gordon acquisition was completed, when UK corporate regulator the Financial Conduct Authority confirmed it was commencing an investigation into Quindell's books.\nAs a result, Quindell was forced to restate its 2014 accounts from an original £175 million profit to a £137 million loss. Of particular concern to Australian investors were the revised earnings of the businesses that were later bought by Slater & Gordon, which showed a £133.2 million loss in 2014.\nIn \"Quindell: A country club built on quicksand\" we claimed 42%-80% of profits suspect. Quindell finally confesses: http://t.co/SvBpz5HEkV\n— Gotham City Research (@GothamResearch) August 5, 2015 Quindell and former #QPP CEO Robert Terry's defamation lawsuit & statements against us were defamatory, malicious, & untrue. For the record.\n— Gotham City Research (@GothamResearch) August 5, 2015 At first blush, it would appear the Quindell acquisition was a mistake. That is certainly the view of Gotham, which described the deal as \"puzzling\" on its Twitter account before likening it to Hewlett-Packard's disastrous acquisition of British software maker Autonomy Corp in 2011. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Nadya Nilova was also dubious after investigating the \"underlying composition\" of the Quindell professional services division bought by Slater & Gordon.\nIn a research report, Nilova claims the division is the result of 20 different deals in 2011-14 and ascribed it as a \"sum of the parts valuation\" of just £265 million – well below the the £637 million acquisition price.\n\"We now fundamentally believe the underlying quality of the [Slater & Gordon] business has been eroded with the [Quindell] acquisition,\" Nilova concluded. Slater & Gordon strongly disagree with the findings of the report.\nBut others are not so sure. \"The professional services division is probably the one bit of Quindell that has probably stayed clean,\" says Eden, who adds it could turn out to be \"quite valuable\". Even some of Slater & Gordon's harshest critics in the investment community, who would not speak on the record, said it was too early to say if Quindell was a dud.\nThe chief problem with the professional services division's accounts is tied to a portfolio of 54,000 active hearing loss cases. Accumulating these industrial deafness claims became very fashionable among UK legal firms after rules around road traffic accident claims were tightened in 2013 through changes known as the Jackson reforms.\nHowever, the hearing loss claims proved to be more expensive and took longer to resolve than other claims such as motor vehicle accidents, where it easier to establish the cause of injury.\nPart of the reason Quindell had to restate its accounts was that it has been booking too much future revenue from hearing claims before they were resolved. Whether the Quindell board was overly aggressive with its accounting will also be the subject of a separate criminal investigation by the UK's Serious Fraud Office .\nEven though there are objective tests conducted by audiologists that can determine whether hearing loss has been caused by exposure to loud noises rather than other factors such as old age, there are doubts about the veracity of some claims. The dramatic rise in hearing loss claims – numbers have almost doubled since 2011 – has also led to accusations of fraudulent behaviour and ambulance chasing.\n\"Thousands of people who worked in noisy environments in the 1960s and '70s without the right protection were rightly compensated in the decades which followed,\" argues James Dalton, a director at the Association of British Insurer. \"These claims naturally tailed off following the introduction of better health and safety measures across British industry.\n\"The recent spike in claims can only be a result of claimant lawyers spotting the potential to earn sizeable fees from these cases after their sky-high earnings from whiplash claims were reduced.\"\nThe ABI is calling for hearing loss claims to be subject to similar reforms that curbed whiplash cases in the UK such as fixed legal fees and more rigorous accreditation for the medical professionals who test claimants. It is likely to get a sympathetic hearing from the Tory government, which last month asked the Civil Justice Council to consider the issue .\nThe good news for Slater & Gordon shareholders is that they are not directly exposed to Quindell's hearing loss business. After conducting what managing director Andrew Grech described as a \"very extensive\" due diligence on the portfolio of claims, it could not agree on a price with Quindell. As a result, it agreed to share with Quindell any profit generated from settling the claims over the next two years.\n\"Our existing business in the UK already handled hearing loss claims so we have experience in this area,\" says a source close to Slater & Gordon. \"We think it is a good portfolio of claims. They improved their processes and made them more robust.\"\nThe source also points out that Quindell has borne much of the upfront cost of building the portfolio, but concedes \"they probably made a strategic misstep in terms of the scale of the investment\". Slater & Gordon says it will concentrate on reducing the Quindell portfolio and has placed a moratorium on new cases. Nevertheless, it remains committed to hearing loss and will take part in the CJC process.\n﻿ For all the problems with hearing loss and despite Quindell's colourful past, Slater & Gordon executives remain confident the rationale for the deal still stacks up.\nGrech hopes his firm will be a leading player in a fragmented, post-Jackson UK legal landscape, with a 12 per cent share in the personal injury market – more than double the size of their nearest rival. More reliable motor accident claims will be a particular focus. But there is no doubt the Quindell soap opera has been – and will continue to be – an unwanted distraction.\nWhen the deal was announced, Grech described Quindell as \"by any measure a transformative transaction for Slater & Gordon\".\nIt seems he will be proved right whatever happens.", "external_links": ["http://www.quindell.com/press-releases/rns/detailed-response-gotham-city-research-speculation/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MCdl_EWoRw", "http://www.claimsmag.co.uk/2015/07/civil-justice-council-to-look-into-nihl-claims/4907", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/insurance/11676222/Insurers-raise-the-alarm-about-flood-of-noise-related-hearing-loss-claims.html", "http://gothamcityresearch.com/2014/04/22/quindell-plc-a-country-club-built-on-quicksand/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11785131/Quindell-slumps-to-238m-loss-as-it-restates-accounts.html", "https://twitter.com/GothamResearch/status/628893490441756672", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/quindell-shares-suspended-amid-accounting-probe-20150624-ghwyj6.html", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hewlett-packard-settles-autonomy-suit-1433850280", "http://t.co/SvBpz5HEkV", "http://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/articles/quindell-sets-sights-high#.Vd9hZNNVhHw", "http://gothamcityresearch.com/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/QPP?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/GothamResearch/status/628893109108240384", "https://twitter.com/GothamResearch/status/582455926315032576"], "published": "2015-08-28T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:08:46.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
