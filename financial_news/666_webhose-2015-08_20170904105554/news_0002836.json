We will see how it plays out...,” Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India, told HT. \n“It’s the prerogative of the customer what they do…but he (Singh) should know that how loyal we have been to him,” said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president, Boeing. \nKumar added that the non-availability of planes was a key reason why talks with Vistara could not proceed. “All slots are sold out, especially of the B737s. They wanted to start a new airline and were looking for availability in the time frame and we didn’t have,” he said. \nAs first reported by HT on July 29, SpiceJet is set to place an order for around 100 jets, worth about $11 billion at list prices. While the budget carrier operates a mixed fleet of Boeing 737s and Q400s, it has been a Boeing customer since its launch in 2005. SpiceJet has, however, stated that it is in talks with both Boeing and arch-rival Airbus for the mega aircraft order. \nWhile IndiGo and GoAir have an all-Airbus fleet, Jet Airways and Air India operate a mixed fleet. Both start-ups, Vistara and AirAsia India, have opted for Airbus. “This shows why SpiceJet is so important to Boeing,” said aviation expert Rajji Rai.
