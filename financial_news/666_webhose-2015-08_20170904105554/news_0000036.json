The longer payment terms results in consumers paying higher amounts of interest, delaying the payoff of the principal. \nThis nimble rollover method allows some consumers to make purchasing another car an easier reality, but the drawback is that someone who chooses a five-year loan, for example, is still paying on the first car for a total of eight to ten years or even more, Triggs said. \nTo boot, being upside down on the new car can trigger a requirement to purchase “gap insurance,” which could cost an additional $500 or more. \nIf you want to avoid this situation, one method is to negotiate aggressively with the dealer on the trade-in price for your car, Triggs said. \n“Let the dealer know that paying off your old loan at the total amount that you owe is a term of the new deal, or you will not buy the new car,” Triggs said. \nSelling the car privately yourself means you could net a higher price than just trading it in at a dealership, he advises. \n“As a last resort, if you have to get a new car, look for incentive deals like rebates which will offset the difference in what you owe versus what they will pay,” Triggs said.Rolling one installment loan such as an auto loan to another will most likely not impact your credit score “greatly,” he said, but there are potential implications. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T18:40:00.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
