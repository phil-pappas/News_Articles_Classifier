The songs are curated into playlists by mood or genre such as flirt, celebrate, sport, pop hits and seventies music. \nUsers can browse 2,000 curated song clips organised by category \nIt claims to be the first dedicated legal music messaging app. \n\"It's absolutely bonkers that this does not already exist,\" said founder and CEO Grant Bovey, who previously started and ran Imagine Homes , the prominent buy-to-let property company that went bust in 2009. \n\"People have always utilised music in a very powerful way, from film and television to advertising. Why can't you send that emotion in a message? It seems very obvious.\" \nA handful of similar messaging apps do exist – such as La-La (which sends whole songs, not clips with pictures and words) and Rithm (which charges users for certain functions) – but MSTY is one of the few that combines images and text with human-curated short music clips that are legally sourced directly from the record labels. \nThe app allows users to combine a 30-second song clip with an image and text \nMSTY – which signed licensing deals with Universal, Sony and Warner before launching, giving it legal access to 22m songs – is also integrated with Apple Music. Users can click through from a song clip they are sent in the app to the album on Apple Music, where they are able to stream or purchase the song. \nMr Bovey believes MSTY will create a new revenue stream for artists who have been struggling to monetise their music in the face of digital developments in the music industry such as piracy and streaming. \n\"We are revitalising the back catalogues of these record labels,\" because classic songs sent via the app will help users discover or rediscover older music. \"MSTY will be able to drive people's decision-making in what they listen to.\" \nBut Mr Bovey insists that MSTY is \"not Spotify\" and primarily competes in the messaging space, not the music space. \n\"WhatsApp is text, Instagram is pictures and MSTY allows the user to convey emotion in another way,\" he said. \nThose apps have around 800m and 300m users respectively, and are both owned by Facebook following $19bn and $1bn acquisitions . The social network also has 700m active users on Facebook Messenger and unsuccessfully tried to buy Snapchat , which has around 100m users, for $3bn in 2013. \nMSTY founder Grant Bovey, whose previous business Imagine Homes went into administration following the property crash Music messaging apps, most of which are primarily about sharing music rather than communicating using songs, are also picking up momentum with investors and industry insiders. \nMusic Messenger has raised $35m from Roman Abramovich, Abba's Benny Andersson, David Guetta, Nicki Minaj and Will.i.am, among others, and is reported to be gaining a million users a month. Rithm and Boomio have reportedly raised $1m each in seed funding. \nMr Bovey had a short-lived music career himself in 1988 under the name Grant Michael with a pop song called Don't Turn Your Back that peaked in the charts at number 99, and was until recently married to former Blue Peter presenter Anthea Turner. He self-funded his app with an initial investment of £200,000 before raising further capital from private individuals including music industry insiders. \nMr Bovey plans to monetise the app, which is free to users and does not have banner ads, by arranging sponsorship deals, such as a Mother's Day partnership with a florist that will allow users to send flowers through the app. MSTY also makes £5 for every user who signs up to Apple Music via the app and collects a commission is a song reached through the app is downloaded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T08:05:53.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
