Carlos Garcia Rawlins Share on twitter by Jonathan Shapiro From the folks who brought you the \"new normal\" and the \"new neutral\", welcome to the world of the \"three gluts\". That's the descriptive phrase of the global economy offered by global bond fund PIMCO and its newly appointed economic adviser Joachim Fels.\nIn his first missive since joining the US-based bond fund in February, Mr Fels said global macroeconomic forces would be defined by the \"the three gluts\" â€“ of money, savings and oil.\nCheap money and energy would spur an economic recovery but an abundance of savings would keep global interest rates in check, Mr Fels said in a note to clients.\n\"While the global savings glut is likely the main secular force behind the global environment of low growth, 'lowflation' and low interest rates, both the oil and the money glut should help lift demand growth, inflation and thus interest rates from their current depressed levels over the cyclical horizon,\" he said.\nMr Fels spent 19 years as chief economist at Morgan Stanley, where he built a large following, and was a key hire by PIMCO as senior management sought to steady the ship after the departure of \"bond king\" Bill Gross triggered hundreds of millions of dollars of out flow.\nUnder Mr Gross and Mohammed El-Erian, the fund coined ubiquitous phrases such as the \"new normal\" to describe a prolonged period of low growth after the global financial crisis and more recently \"a new neutral\", a shift lower in the interest rate setting, where conditions were neither loose nor tight.\nMr Fels said the \"savings glut\" was coined by former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to describe a desire globally to save more than the desire to invest, an imbalance that has increased over the past decade to force interest rates even lower.\nDemand to save There were several reasons why the demand to save was greater than the demand to invest, Mr Fels said. They were: history, with consumers still scarred by the financial crisis; demography, with savers living longer; inequality, with the rich saving more than the poor; technology, with new companies able to expand with little investment; and necessity, with emerging market companies dealing with capital flight risks.\nThe savings glut had led to weak demand, which \"for a long time slows potential growth and turns into permanent joblessness, while weak investment dents the growth of the capital stock\", Mr Fels wrote.\nHe said if governments failed to fill the demand and if central banks could not force rates down enough, or into negative territory, \"they have to resort to blowing pretty bubbles in the financial markets, in order to avoid worse outcomes\".\nBut there was good news in the form of an oil glut, which had helped \"mitigate the depressing impact of the savings glut on consumer demand\" by shifting income from rich oil producers to consumers, he said.\nThe initial negative impact from the falling oil price on US investment in the sector would be replaced by stronger demand as consumers reaped the benefits of lower gas prices on their budgets, he said.\nThe third glut, the \"money glut\", was a consequence of the savings and oil gluts, he said. An abundance of savings had encouraged central banks to lower interest rates to find the equilibrium level to spur investment. This had been reinforced by the oil glut, which had lowered inflationary pressure, resulting in \"a wave of central banks easing steps around the world since the start of the year\".\nThere would be more monetary easing in 2015 from China and other commodity-producing countries, which were expected to follow the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, he said.\nThe net impact of these three gluts would be for global growth, inflation and interest rates to remain lower than previously to reflect the savings glut, but for a cyclical pick-up in economic growth and inflation to occur as a result of cheap energy and stimulatory policy, he said.\nFor bonds investors, any rate rises resulting from a pick-up in growth would be tempered, leading the Federal Reserve on \"a long but shallow hiking path\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/johnnyshap"], "published": "2015-08-04T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T17:39:55.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
