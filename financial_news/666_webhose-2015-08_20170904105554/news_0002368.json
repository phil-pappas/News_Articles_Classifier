A 23 percent drop in Micron Technology Inc, another one of Greenlight's top long positions, also hurt as did a 4 percent drop in Apple Inc's stock price, Greenlight's biggest bet.\nOn Friday, gold was at $1,094.91 an ounce, down 16 percent since the middle of January and off from a record peak of $1,900 hit four years ago.\nUnlike mutual funds, hedge funds are not required to disclose their monthly returns and many managers do not disclose them, so any performance numbers, especially from big name managers, are scrutinized closely for industry trends.\nThe broader stock market Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 1.28 percent in July.\nMeanwhile Daniel Loeb's $17.5 billion Third Point fared much better this month, posting a 1 percent gain its main fund, extending the year-to-date gains to 6.8 percent, an investor in the fund said.\nTraditionally Einhorn and Loeb are among the first managers to inform clients of their returns every month. Other managers may take several days to finalize their numbers.
