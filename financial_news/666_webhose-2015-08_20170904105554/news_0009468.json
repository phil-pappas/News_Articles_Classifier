If some salaries are increased, those whose pay cannot be reduced due to labour laws that discourage such, a move, might be under pressure to leave,\" said Mr Japheth Ongoma, a civil servant. \nHe insists that this exercise is meant to manage the soaring public wage bill as much as it would promote fair employment and remuneration practices. \nBefore the inception of SRC, he pointed out, the public sector remuneration and benefits were arrived at through ad hoc committees and commissions resulting to huge disparities in the payments that affected morale among some staff. \nMs Kiuluku said the affected employees also include those working in county governments, research institutions and universities, constitutional commissions and independent offices. \nThe commissioner, who is also the team leader for the Service and Regulatory State Corporations, spoke on Friday during a meeting with CEOs of state corporations at the Intercontinental Hotel, Nairobi. \nShe observed that the country's public sector productivity is currently low compared to other countries and emphasised on the importance of investing in improving performance. \nMs Kiuluku, who was accompanied by the Commissioner in-charge of the Strategic and Commercial State Corporations Anne Owuor, added that employees from various government ministries are also being trained about job evaluation to build capacity for future engagements. \nMs Owuor downplayed claims that job evaluation would lead to sacking of workers and urged those still in doubt to support the consulting firms to fast-track the process. \n\"Job evaluation will assist in negotiations for better terms based on the real value of the jobs. It is not an exercise in vain. It promotes fairness at the place of work and enhances productivity,\" she said. \nThere were concerns that the exercise is not all inclusive. Joseph Magoma, a teacher, claims that SRC is biased and would not touch on the executive and politicians who take home a fortune monthly in salaries and allowances.
