Baizat, a UAE financial awareness organisation, will facilitate the three-month training and mentoring of Shabaab Club members.“Empowering youths with the tools to become financially self-sufficient cannot be underestimated,” said Maytha Al Habsi, the chief programmes officer at Emirates Foundation. \nAbout 70 per cent of young Emiratis are in debt, according to statistics from the Emirates Foundation. \nThe organisation said that youths spent three times more on fashion than their expatriate Arab and Asian peers.For every Dh100 that they spent, about 40 per cent was spent on clothes and 35 per cent on mobile phones. \nThe workshops and educational events will be conducted in workplaces, schools and universities. They aim to promote discussion and educate Emiratis about the fundamentals of personal finance. \nThe first trial workshops are set to take place in Abu Dhabi in November. \n“This initiative will tackle a major challenge we have when financially empowering the UAE population, which is communicating the message to a large audience in an effective, personal and sustainable manner,” said Salah Al Halyan, the founder of Baizat. \n“With a major focus on reaching youth in educational institutions, we can guide the next generation to be financially secure.”​ \nFollow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T22:39:24.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
