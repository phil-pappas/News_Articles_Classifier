ATM and debit cards were more common, with 34% of the banked population owning a South African Social Security MasterCard.

It also received the highest score for formal account penetration, including among rural, low-income and female groups. \nStrong mobile capacity \nSouth Africa's mobile capacity was strong, the report showed, with the percentage of unique subscribers comprising about 70% of the population and about 96% 3G mobile network coverage by population. \n\"South Africa also has a number of mobile money deployments offering P2P domestic transfers, bill payment, and international remittances,\" it said. \"This has allowed it to reach more people and engage them in financial services.\" \nInitiatives to digitise government transfers, along with the country's quite extensive banking infrastructure, supported financial inclusion. \"Efforts to diversify the digital financial services market and encourage digital transactions could propel further advancements in financial inclusion.\" \nAccording to estimates from a recent Imperial College and Citi report, \"a 10% increase in the digital money readiness and commensurate increase in adoption for the countries included in the index, can help up to an estimated 220 million individuals enter the formal financial sector. This translates to an additional $1- trillion (R13.15-trillion) moving from the informal economy to the formal economy\". \nFinancial inclusion \nThe report said financial inclusion had become a crucial aspect of economic development. \n\"Developing economies need consumers who can pay bills or send remittances in an affordable and convenient manner. Digital services are an increasingly important component of the nexus between development and financial inclusion. \n\"Having greater access to financial services promotes entrepreneurship, lifts people out of poverty, and gives them greater hope for a brighter economic future. This is especially the case in regard to women and marginalised groups.\" \nSource: News24Wire", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T21:20:49.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
