The partnership will integrate E-Complish’s DirectPay Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, HostPay consumer-facing Payment Portal, and E-Complish Text2Pay with Bill Reminder and Payment into Dominion Dental’s current health service systems. The Direct Pay IVR is currently operational with HostPay and Text2Pay, with new features expected to launch in late 2015. “We’re excited to enter into this partnership with Dominion Dental. Dominion Dental is proud to be 1 of 10 Dental Insurance providers selected by the U.S. Government for their workers. The steps taken by the company demonstrates their commitment to call center PCI Compliance, increased security, and additional convenience to their customers,” said Stephen Price, CEO of E-Complish. “Organizations within the healthcare industry will see the benefit in using phone payment systems because of the security rules associated with PCI Compliance. Hostpay, Text2Pay, and DirectPay are the perfect mix to streamline Dominion Dental’s current practices and create a strong cost savings for the organization.”\nDirectPay IVR is a HIPPA and Level 1 PCI compliant process that ensures all transaction information is encrypted, secure and private. PCI Rules require that a call recording, including verbal credit card numbers, must be encrypted, transported, and stored securely, which tends to be an extremely costly and cumbersome process to insurance providers. The DirectPay IVR system eliminates expenses associated with PCI Compliance encryption, transportation and storage of call recordings while freeing up valuable resources for Dominion Dental.\nIn addition to the Direct Pay IVR system Dominion Dental plans to utilize the E-Complish Text2Pay system that allows for both Bill Reminder and Payment via SMS Text. E-Complish Text2Pay is HIPPA, PCI and FCC compliant with adherence to Mobile Marketing Association’s Best Practices guidelines. In the future a Dominion Dental customer will be able to elect for a Bill Reminder or even make a payment using a secure PIN, all via their mobile phone through SMS Text messaging.\nLastly, the E-Complish HostPay solution is a consumer facing payment portal that is also HIPPA and Level 1 PCI compliant to accept all major credit cards or ACH among other cost-effective benefits and features. HostPay is designed to look and feel exactly like the Dominion Dental website to provide a seamless process to the customer that is secure and private.\nTo learn more about E-Complish DirectPay, Text2Pay, and HostPay, visit https://www.e-complish.com/solutions/ .\n###\nE-Complish, Inc.: Since 1998, E-Complish has helped businesses increase profit and communicate more efficiently with customers through its unique financial services, quickly becoming one of the nation’s most reliable and secure payment partners.
