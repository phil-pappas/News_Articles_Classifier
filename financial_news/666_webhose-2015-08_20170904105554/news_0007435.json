Unfortunately, when it comes to dividends, UK investors don’t have that many baskets to consider. \nThe vast majority of UK dividends come from a handful of companies. In the second quarter of this year, just five businesses were responsible for a third of all the dividends paid by companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. These businesses HSBC, Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , British American Tobacco, BP and GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) paid out £9.7bn. \nThe top 15 dividend payers distributed 60pc of the total, or £17.4bn, according to data from Capita Registrars. This means investing for income pushes people into many of the same shares. \nA dividend cut at any of these companies will have a major impact on the income of UK savers, since many have been forced to put their money in the stock market to find yield when interest rates are at historic lows. We have already seen dividends slashed in the supermarket sector as it grapples with a price war and competition. Standard Chartered (BSE: 580001.BO - news ) and Centrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) have also taken an axe to their payouts. \nSome in the City are concerned that distributions to shareholders at some major dividend payers are too high. This is particularly true for the oil sector. \n• Opec is being eaten alive and needs to meet to heal its wounds • Low oil prices bite as Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) waits to tap Shetland field \nBased on current forecasts, the prospective yield in 2016 for BP is about 6.9pc and for Shell (LSE: RDSB.L - news ) it stands at 6.7pc. These unusually high yields are often an indicator of an impending cut in the payout. \nThe last time the sector’s ability to pay dividends was under threat was in 2009, when the financial crisis sent the price of a barrel of oil down into the low $30s. Management of BP and Shell promised to borrow to pay the dividend until prices revived. Luckily, the oil price staged a rapid recovery. \nExecutives at both BP and Shell are essentially hostages to the dividend because any cut would result in a sharp fall in the share price. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the oil price will remain at a low level for some time with cash flows staying subdued. Management has tried to reassure that the dividend is safe and it probably is in the short term. But if crude prices fall further and stay low, then the boards may be forced to trim payments. \nShell said it’s preparing for a “prolonged downturn” by cutting jobs and slashing billions of dollars in investments. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is also selling assets, which should help support cash flow. Providing the good times return, this could be enough to prevent a catastrophic reduction in its dividend. \nThere are also concerns about the payment from GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) . Both have been struggling with the end of patents on major drugs and lacklustre launches of new products. Both are losing dominance in the drug market. This has prompted a number of fund managers to declare these investments “dividend traps”. \nIndeed, Glaxo has slashed by a quarter its plan to pay a £4bn special dividend alongside its fourth-quarter payment in December following the completion of a complex deal to swap assets with Swiss rival Novartis (Xetra: 904278 - news ) . It has also publicly stated that its dividend will be 80p a share for the next three years, so fears could be overcooked. AstraZeneca also has a promising pipeline of new products, especially in relation to drugs that boost the body’s immune response to fight cancer. This should also reassure. \nThe mining sector is certainly showing signs of distress as commodity prices continue to slump. The rout in the commodities complex has accelerated on a series of bad economic data from China. Sector dividend yields are also at distressed levels: Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (7pc), BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (6.9pc), Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) (5.9pc) and Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) (6.8pc). A reduction in the payout for the basic resources sector is looking more likely, despite the fact that BHP has not cut its dividend in 100 years. \nBut it’s not all doom and gloom for income seekers. The housebuilding sector is returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders through special payments and Lloyds Banking Group (Other OTC: LLOBF - news ) recently returned to the dividend list. \nThe financial sector could be one sector showing good dividend growth over the next few years, with RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) expected to restart payments in 2017. Insurer Aviva has already rebased its dividend and RSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) restarted payments in February. \nThere is some concern about the quality of earnings at motor insurer Admiral, which has been releasing money from reserves set aside to boost profits. This is obviously unsustainable and the current prospective yield of 6.2pc also looks distressed. \nAlthough income seekers are traditionally looking to invest in the larger, steadier blue-chip companies, it may be better to look beyond the blue-chip index and into the FTSE 250 for income plays. Globally, the payment of dividends is also on the increase and the number of funds that invest in companies worldwide with rising dividend payments is likely to grow over the next few years. This would be a good way to diversify income streams. \nShould any of the major UK payers be forced to cut their payments, this could be a good time to buy the shares on a long-term view just as everybody else is selling. \nHowever, getting more diversification in your income investments is quite important right now. \nGarry White is chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley (LSE: CAY.L - news ) .
