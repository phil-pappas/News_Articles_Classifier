So today we only walk!\" \nMany workers were expected to work from home, and others tried to see the positive side. \n\"Making the most of the tube strike by running into work today!\" blogger Hannah Cox said on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) . \nAt the Victoria railway terminus, where huge lines of commuters formed waiting for buses, one enterprising company handed out free skateboards. \n- Delayed Night Tube launch? - \nThe latest round of negotiations broke down on Monday, when union leaders rejected an offer of a two percent salary increase and bonus payments for night shift workers. \nRMT union leader Mick Cash said it was \"just a rehash of an earlier package and does nothing to tackle the fundamental issue of our members being called into work at the beck and call of management to plug staffing gaps in the mayor's botched Night Tube plans.\" \nThe unions have called for the launch of the service to be delayed pending further talks. \nJohnson, a member of Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative party, said he is \"not fussed\" about exactly when the Night Tube starts, but said there would be no more money on the table. \n\"I want it starting in the autumn,\" the mayor said, adding: \"I am not going to authorise any more money. Most people would recognise that this is a very generous deal.\" \nLondon Underground says it is hiring 137 more train drivers and 245 new station staff to work on the Night Tube, and says that no existing employees will be working more hours than they do at the moment. \nSteve Griffiths, the company's chief operating officer, said: \"We have made every effort to reach agreement with the unions and avoid this unnecessary strike action.\" \nThe mayor says that the new service will benefit not just revellers but also many night shift workers, insisting: \"They are the working people of London.\" \nCurrently trains depart the outer edges of London some time after 5:00am and the last services leave the centre about half past midnight. \nThe new 24-hour service on five lines would bring London in line with other cities such as New York, Berlin and Sydney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T20:08:19.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
