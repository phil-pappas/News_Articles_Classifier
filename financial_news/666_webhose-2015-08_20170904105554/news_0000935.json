Although using cash or a debit card can help consumers to avoid going over their budget, these two options carry serious consequences.

It might take days or even weeks for your bank to replace the money that was stolen from your account, which could be an issue if your bills are automatically deducted from your checking account. \n“While many banks and credit unions have improved security options for debit cards, the fact remains that lost or stolen cards can give thieves access to drain checking and savings accounts quickly,” said Bruce McClary, vice president of public relations and external affairs for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling . \nTraveling with cash is an even “riskier proposition,” but consumers can mitigate it by not withdrawing large sums and not carrying a large amount, he said. \nOne option is to travel only with the credit cards you need and lock up the other cards or passports in a hotel safety deposit box or room safe, said Marie White, CEO of Security Mentor, a Pacific Grove, Calif. security awareness training provider. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-14T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T15:06:36.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
