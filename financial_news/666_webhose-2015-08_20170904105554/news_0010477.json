Though the restrictions reduced the maximum draft by only a few inches, it would have forced some big ships to lighten their loads by leaving some cargo behind. At the time, the canal authority said up to 18.5% of ships could be affected.\ntop logistics news\nGet the latest logistics and supply chain news and analysis via an email newsletter. Sign up here. However, recent rains and water conservation measures made it possible for the restrictions to be suspended, the canal authority said in a statement Friday. Officials said they will continue to monitor water levels in two large lakes that feed into the canal, and provide updates should draft restrictions need to be implemented. Any restrictions would be announced with at least four weeks of notice, the canal authority said.\nThousands of ships traverse the 100-year-old Panama Canal each year. A decade-long project to widen the canal, making it possible for larger oil tankers and container ships to travel the 50-mile stretch between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, is slated to be completed early next year.\nWrite to Erica E.
