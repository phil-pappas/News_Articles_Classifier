Photo: Michele Mossop\nOnline furniture and homeware merchant Temple & Webster will unveil a new brand in September after buying the Australian arm of listed United States online decor and home furnishing retailer Wayfair.\nMore than 1.1 million people have signed up to Temple & Webster's member-only website since it launched in 2011, and chief executive Brian Shanahan said the acquisition of Wayfair doubled the operation's total customer base to about 300,000.\nMr Shanahan would not reveal Wayfair's price tag, and Temple & Webster won't be earnings positive for some years yet, but that's not the focus.\nThe former eBay executive said it was about turning Temple & Webster into the \"Realestate.com of homewares\".\nAdvertisement \"We could be profitable tomorrow if we wanted to be but the board has asked us to continue to invest,\" Mr Shanahan said.\n\"What we need to do is grow quickly, early on and get that brand awareness.\"\nTemple & Webster expects to achieve sales of about $50 million this calendar year and more than $100 million in the next few years, but competition in $15 billion homewares and furniture market is fierce across all channels.\nDominant global fashion brands such as H&M and Zara are aggressively expanding their homewares operations as Ikea rolls out smaller-format stores and sells online for the first time.\nThe Wayfair acquisition provides Temple & Webster with an \"open e-commerce\" model to capture online shoppers and browsers who don't want to sign up to a Temple & Webster membership.\nMr Shanahan said it recognised there were people who were looking for a more traditional online retail experience.\n\"We had plans to build out our own open e-commerce concept and at the same time we were approached by Wayfair US,\" he said.\nThese shoppers are different to the traditional Temple & Webster member, which Mr Shanahan described as a \"consumer who wanted to explore and discover new product\".\nTemple & Webster's own data shows that about 25 per cent of its members become customers within three years.\n\"These are people who love homewares magazines, it's their moment of escapism and when the time is right they will make the transition to customers,\" Mr Shanahan said.\nWith the support of ­co-founders and major shareholders including Conrad Yiu, Mark Coulter of investment company ArdenPoint​, former News Ltd digital director Adam McWhinney​ and Macquarie Capital, Temple & Webster is also also exploring how it could leverage technology to provide new services and ultimately a bricks-and-mortar operation.\n\"Our focus at the moment is on being a pure play-online retailer,\" Mr Shanahan said.\n\"But we also recognise that there will be a time and a place to explore bricks and mortar, we need to be where the consumer is and that's not always online.\"\n\"I want this business to be $100 million plus in the next few years and for our brand to be where Australians turn to first when they think about homewares.\"\nWayfair, which has a market cap of more than $US3 billion ($4.1 billion) said the sale of its Australian business reflected its focus on its major markets in the US and Northern Europe.\nChief executive and founder Niraj Shah said Temple & Webster shared its commitment to technology and outstanding customer experience in retail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T09:10:13.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
