TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate ZILLOW GROUP INC (Z) a HOLD. The primary factors that have impacted our rating are mixed ? some indicating strength, some showing weaknesses, with little evidence to justify the expectation of either a positive or negative performance for this stock relative to most other stocks. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its robust revenue growth, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and weak operating cash flow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-05T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-05T18:53:26.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
