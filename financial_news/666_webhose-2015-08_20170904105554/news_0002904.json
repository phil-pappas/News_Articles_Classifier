Analysts expect the data from the Office for National Statistics to show UK jobless claims rose 1,000 in July, compared to 7,000 a month earlier. The unemployment rate in the three months through June is forecast to hold at 5.6%. \nAverage weekly earnings are predicted to reveal a 2.3% year-on-year increase during the quarter while the employment change is expected to have fallen by 55,000 jobs. \nThe BoE last week decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. BoE Governor Mark Carney said the timing of a first interest rate hike was drawing closer but the exact time could not be predicted and will be \"data dependent\". \nDavid Miles said on Monday he was close to voting for higher interest rates at the policy meeting last week as he saw a reasonable case but did not find the arguments conclusive. \n\"Sterling had gone up a bit, oil prices had fallen a bit, there were somewhat ambiguous signals from the labour market, but on balance it was a set of economic news that probably reduced at least the near-term inflation profile by a non-trivial amount,\" he told Bloomberg . \nWednesday 12 August INTERIMS Balfour Beatty (Other OTC: BAFBF - news ) , Capital & Regional (LSE: CAL.L - news ) , G4S (Copenhagen: G4S.CO - news ) , Interserve (LSE: IRV.L - news ) , Lookers (LSE: LOOK.L - news ) , New Europe Property Investments, OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works GDR (Reg S), Sampo OYJ (Helsinki: SAMAS.HE - news ) , TBC Bank Joint Stock Company GDR (REGS) TRADING ANNOUNCEMENTS Volution Group (WI) Q2 OJSC Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works GDR (Reg S), TBC Bank Joint Stock Company GDR (REGS) INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Crude Oil Inventories (US) (15:30) Industrial Production (EU) (10:00) MBA Mortgage Applications (US) (12:00) Treasury Budget Statement (US) (15:00) UK ECONOMIC ANNOUNCEMENTS Claimant Count Rate (09:30) Unemployment Rate (09:30) GMS (Taiwan OTC: 6481.TWO - news ) LMS Capital (Other OTC: LMSZF - news ) , Oilex Ltd (LSE: OEX.L - news ) .
