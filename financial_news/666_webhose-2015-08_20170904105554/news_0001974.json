The US dollar was also boosted by data showing the pace of growth in the US service sector surged in July to its strongest level in a decade. A stronger US dollar makes commodities priced in the US currency more expensive to buyers using other currencies. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange closed down 1.1 per cent at $US1,595 a tonne, the weakest since July 2009. The metal, used in transport and packaging, is down by a fifth since early August. Speculators increased short positions in LME aluminium last week to the highest levels since mid-January, according to estimates by broker Marex Spectron. \"This ... means that ali has overtaken tin as the largest spec short of the complex,\" it said in a report. Copper closed down 1.1 per cent at $US5,180 a tonne after ending little changed in the previous session but still within reach of Monday's six-year lows of $US5,142 a tonne. Copper, which has shed about a fifth of its value over the past three months, is trading lower than supply/demand fundamentals would warrant, analyst Vivienne Lloyd at Macquarie in London, said. \"With the willingness that people have to throw money at the market to see if they can push it lower, you can imagine it would go lower. But I don't think it deserves to on the basis of fundamentals,\" she said. \"If you look at the supply side, the market looks a bit tighter, but prices don't reflect that.\" One of several recent supply issues is a strike at a Codelco mine in Chile, which has prompted the world's top copper producer to stop offering spot refined copper to China for two weeks, sources said. Some traders said supply remained adequate despite the strike, highlighted by a rise in LME copper stocks by 14 per cent since June 26. Nickel bucked the weaker trend, rising 0.3 per cent on bargain hunting to finish at $US10,860 a tonne. Tin was the biggest mover, closing 1.8 per cent lower at $US15,500 a tonne despite news that shipments of refined tin from top exporter Indonesia fell 24 per cent in July. Zinc shed 1.3 per cent to $US1,893 a tonne and lead fell 0.6 per cent to $US1,726.
