Sharing stage at this international exhibition on indoor & outdoor advertising and signage solutions were 166 key players, manufacturers, technology experts and product designers of advertising, printing and signage industries from India and five countries. A visual treat for visitors with high-quality prints, signage, point-of-purchase and attractive merchandise, the exhibition proved that while traditional media continues to hold a strong position, the industry is making way for the integration of new digital, 3D and eco-friendly mediums. Mr Naveen Gupta, Director, Prakash Offset Machinery pointed out: “At Media Expo, we received good response for our offset and laser cutting machines. When it comes to 3D printing technology, the interactions proved that there is high interest in the Indian market but commercially, the market is not completely prepared to invest. More research and development of components will drive up adoption, and to bring these to the market, Media Expo is an apt platform.” The company was showcasing its one-of-its-kind 3D printing machinery at the show which unlike the conventional printers is not subtractive, but additive and therefore provides zero wastage. Japanese exhibitor, Mr Tomohiro Ikeda, Managing Director, Mimaki India Pvt Ltd said: “We introduced our eco-friendly solvent machines- JV-150 & JV-300 at Media Expo and the response to these machines have been phenomenal with over 500 visitors approaching the booth in the first two days itself. We believe the future is inkjet and India is a growing market for this industry. Messe Frankfurt has pulled off one of the biggest exhibitions in this segment drawing in quality crowd.” Distributers for LG, ITMS India Pvt Ltd who introduced a new range of visual merchandising for customers from interiors & architectural sides and Esko Graphics showcasing their range of technologies for sign and graphics segments were both positive about closing deals at the show. Mr Pradeep Ram, Marketing Manager - Southern Asia, Esko Graphics said: “We brought new softwares - suite 14.1 and icut and a lot of customers showed interest in purchasing it. We might close few deals at the show before we leave. With the industry moving fast, Media Expo is a great place to exchange know-how and grasp market insight, pushing us to the next challenging phase of developing products according to market requirements.” With Indian consumer spending expected to grow fourfold by 2017, the growth potential of Indian consumers is attracting huge interest from domestic and international brands across industries who are looking at redefining marketing strategies that can attract and reach out to a larger audience. Mr Parag Pimple, General Manager, Technova Imaging Systems who closed deals worth crores at the show said: Media Expo showcased good involvement of international and local brands, just what we require to be creative and competitive in this business. Some of the applications were absolutely new here and it was good to understand the developments of 3D, UV printers. I came from Bombay especially for the show, met my old suppliers here, ended up closing deals and I can say I am leaving with a better understanding of the industry.\" Mr Raju Deepchand, Proprietor, Deepchaand & Sons Nx said: “Since I’m into the jewelry business, I was looking for attractive packaging solutions and I found some very interesting products at Metocraft. I have also decided to buy the etching machine from Idea Factory. It’s commendable how Media Expo always makes efforts to bring the latest in the market on one platform, making it easier for us to search for new branding solutions.” Impressed with the range of exhibits by manufacturers from India and abroad, Mr Raghav, Proprietor, Bharti Creations said: “We usually visit international exhibitions as the solutions there are quite advanced. Media Expo made it easy by bringing international suppliers for us to buy here and ease import procedures. I was looking for few machines including laser cutting routers and have finalised two to three companies for it. We should close deals soon.” With discussions maturing into deals and the progressive mindset of the Indian industry in adopting new concepts and technologies, many of this year’s exhibitors are already keen to participate in the next edition in 2016. Mr SM Ramprasad, Assistant VP - Graphic Arts Division, Fujifilm India said: “We had a thematic showcasing of the future of sign and graph and the response to these as well as our 3D applications have been very optimistic. We had several prospective customers walking in and saw a positive shift in the customer outlook towards accepting and investing in new, cleaner technologies. We will definitely not miss the upcoming show.” The 38th edition targeting new product categories of 3D printing and point-of-purchase (PoP) in the commercial capital will take place from 15 - 17 January 2016 at the Bombay Exhibition Centre, Goregaon, Mumbai.
