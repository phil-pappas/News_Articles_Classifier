Share on twitter by Misa Han Unhappy couples around Australia will be stuck with a higher divorce fee after the Federal Court dismissed a case against the Attorney-General over his attempt to raise divorce fees.\nLabor MP Graham Perrett and Labor senator Claire Moore and three people going through divorce challenged George Brandis' decision, arguing he unlawfully raised the fee after the Parliament voted down a similar regulation.\nGeorge Brandis first introduced regulation to increase the cost of divorce from $845 to $1195. The regulation was voted down on the Parliament's last sitting day before the recess.\nHe then raised the divorce fee by another $5 to $1200 during the winter break, which came into effect on July 13.\nMaurice Blackburn, which mounted the challenge against Senator Brandis, argued the extra $5 was not substantially different and breached the legislation which prevents the executive from enacting laws that have been voted down by the Parliament if they are the \"same in substance\".\nBut Senator Brandis' counsel argued the $5 difference was significant as it would raise $66 million over the next four years, as opposed to $64 million if the first regulation was passed.\nIn a decision handed down on Thursday, Federal Court judge John Dowsett found the $5 difference meant the first and second attempts were not the \"same in substance\".\n\"The word 'same' requires virtual identity (or sameness) between the objects of the comparison,\" Justice Dowsett said.\n Disputes about whether a $5 increase in fee is substantial may lead to political judgment, which courts generally sought to avoid involvement in, he said.\n\"Disputes about whether a $5 increase in a fee is an essential characteristic or an immaterial feature, or as to whether the result of such increase is substantial or otherwise, may lead to such involvement,\" he said.\nJustice Dowsett also said individual politicians without personal grievance generally did not have standing to bring a case before the court.\n\"One can imagine many difficulties emerging if individual members of Parliament were generally permitted to seek to enforce the law,\" he said.\nThe increase in divorce fee has drawn criticism from Labor and the Greens as a blow to domestic violence victims .\nMaurice Blackburn lawyer Matthew Littlejohn said the applicants were considering the outcome and may appeal the decision.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/senate-moves-to-strike-out-new-divorce-tax-20150619-ghsavn.html"], "published": "2015-08-13T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-13T11:01:07.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
