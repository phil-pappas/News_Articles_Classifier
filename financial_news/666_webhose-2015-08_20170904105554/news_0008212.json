Luis Ascui by Sarah Thompson Anthony Macdonald Jake Mitchell REA Group may not be the only gorilla in the Asian property zoo for much longer.\nIt's believed United Kingdom digital real estate giant Rightmove has also been scanning for opportunities throughout Asia and Australia.\nThe news comes after Street Talk Online revealed iProperty Group had appointed Goldman Sachs as its defence adviser, while REA creeps up its register.\nREA boosted its stake in the Asian-focused iProperty to 22.7 per cent from 21.3 per cent last week, after taking an initial 19.9 per cent holding in July 2014.\niProperty, worth around $580 million, is a real estate portal with operations in Malaysia, Hong Kong Indonesia and Thailand. The company's second-largest shareholder is Catcha Group, which is the largest shareholder in digital automotive classifieds group iCar Asia and shopping website Ensogo.\n​REA, controlled by News Corporation, said last week it would focus on growing its overseas operations.\nREA would be unlikely to boost its 20 per cent stake in US real estate group Move, given News Corp owns the other 80 per cent, so Asia appears to be logical hunting ground.\nBut it's understood REA has no current plans to launch a full takeover for iProperty.\n ​REA is, however, heavily involved in the company, recently adding its chief operating officer Arthur Charlaftis as its second director on the iProperty board.\nThe Australian giant also dedicated some attention to iProperty at its full-year result last week.\niProperty chief executive Georg Chemil is a former REA chief financial officer and general manager of its international operations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T00:07:39.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
