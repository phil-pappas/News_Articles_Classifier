Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle It has been a noisy, out-of-control week in Canberra: the Liberal Party has imploded over same-sex marriage, the government has announced a farcical climate change policy, the credibility of its trade union royal commission has been shredded. But in the hallowed space of the cabinet room, and even in the Parliament, it's been much quieter.\nMinisters reflect on the painfully thin agenda before the cabinet: thin in subject matter as well as substantive submissions. Parliament has not been overwhelmed by major legislation to debate.\nA meeting of the National Security Committee of the cabinet has, however, recently asked for a list of national-security-related things that could be announced weekly between now and the election.\nHow much scrutiny has gone in to these \"announceables\" is unclear.\nNational security being the new religion, it's a bit rude to ask any questions, to the point where senior ministers insisted during a bid for funds by a national intelligence agency some months ago that the \"bean counters\" from Treasury and Finance be kept out of the room.\nPerhaps this new environment helps explain why a lone government backbencher, Dan Tehan, has decided all by himself that we should bomb Syria. One might have just imagined the small but significant pause before Tehan said 'No' on radio on Thursday when he was asked whether he had discussed the bombing idea with the Prime Minister before he launched into print with it in that journal of defence strategy record, the Herald Sun in Melbourne.\nImplicit in the subsequent discussion has been the idea that, once again, the US has been asking us behind closed doors to join the bombing raids in Syria.\nBut very senior sources say that Defence has been telling the Prime Minister's office to stop saying the Americans have been asking for help on this because it is not true.\n Bombing Syria. Messing with the constitution to get a political outcome on same sex-marriage. These are now the playthings of a prime minister so desperate, so out of control that he is overseeing the complete surrender of proper governance to day-to-day tactics.\nThe problem is that it isn't even working for him. Every issue that is running in politics at present is highlighting the bitter divisions, or policy confusion, or both, within the government.\nCabinet ministers are publicly brawling over the appropriate legal vehicle, and timing, for deciding the question of same-sex marriage. Attorney-General George Brandis dismissed Scott Morrison's suggestion that there should be a referendum, and was publicly backed by two other senior ministers. Six MPs indicated they would cross the floor to vote in favour of same-sex marriage.\nCoalition MPs recognise that Tony Abbott's suggestion this week that the issue of same-sex marriage issue should go to \"the people\" was a purely political gambit to get it off the agenda short-term, shore up his support with conservatives in the party room, and bury it all together long-term.\nBut the glaring tactical flaws in this idea – the belief it would both stop the debate and could somehow stop same-sex marriage being an election issue – are so spectacular that even some of those close to Abbott are scathing.\nThen again, the Prime Minister is now at war with his own party. His tactics are as much directed at his colleagues as his political opponents. He was quite happy to allow a party room debate to take place that saw 16 of his ministers argue against his position on same-sex marriage.\nIt's not just on issues of social policy, however, where things have gone off the rails.\nThe government continues to announce policies that are long on columns of smoke, large in cost and short in detail.\nLast week, the government announced it was spending \"$89 billion\" on \"a strong and sustainable naval shipbuilding industry\". It was often reported that this was what it was spending in South Australia, even though that $89 billion includes $50 billion on submarines (which the government has generally suggested would be built in Japan) and is an estimate based on contracts that have not even got to tender yet, let alone have a start date. Defence analysts argue that all this spending is within the existing envelope of the defence budget so isn't a huge issue. But they also concede that projects are now being furiously reshuffled because on the current trajectory, the spending will blow the supposed return to surplus.\nThis week, the government announced a climate change target that overwhelmingly relies on policies that have not yet been announced but which the government says can reduce our carbon emissions by 26 per cent by 2030 at a cost of $60 billion, compared to its claim that Labor's policies (also not announced) to cut carbon by 40 to 60 per cent would cost $600 billion.\nThe reckless nature of the political calls being made within the Coalition at the moment must be based on the view that, whatever happens, voters will ultimately never be able to cop Bill Shorten and Labor. But that view is based on the idea that voters still rate the two political parties' competence – and that of its leaders – differently.\nIf you hang around in Canberra long enough, you start to recognise the point where a government has become terminal, where the death spiral is irretrievable. It's got nothing to do with the polls, or leadership rumblings.\nIt's the point where the sheer stupidity of its decisions is so obvious, so craven, so contradictory, that everyone involved – ministers, backbenchers, the opposition, the media, voters – just know it can't go on like this.\nSome would argue that most of the Whitlam government's time in office was like that. But the days when Malcolm Fraser warned voters their money was safer under the bed than it would be under a Labor government, the days of forged faxes under the Keating government, the days when John Howard pledged $9 billion of spending in just one campaign speech, when Kevin Rudd announced the moving of the Sydney naval base to Queensland, all smacked of that time when everyone knew all was lost.\nBut with the exception of Whitlam, all these things happened with just days or weeks to go before polling day.\nWe are as much as 12 months from the next election. Abbott's conservative supporters might not want to abandon him. Scott Morrison is clearly positioning as an alternative conservative candidate.\nBut at some point the conservatives – and the Coalition more broadly – will have to decide not just whether they are prepared to lose an election, but whether they are prepared to have the Coalition's reputation for good government become likened in history to that of Whitlam's.\nLaura Tingle is the political editor of The Australian Financial Review", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559", "https://twitter.com/latingle"], "published": "2015-08-13T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-14T06:11:18.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
