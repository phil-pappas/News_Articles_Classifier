As things stand, the FPB's attempts to broaden its powers of censorship have been flagrantly at odds with our constitution, as a legal submission written by the Legal Resource Centre shows. \nAccording to a government statement, the bill seeks to \"[strengthen] the duties imposed on mobile networks and Internet service providers to protect the public and children during usage of their services. The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa will not issue licences or renewals without confirmation from the Film and Publication Board of full compliance with its legislation.\" This is a brazen attempt to give the FPB powers that it currently is not and should not be entrusted with. \nThe government statement also says that the amendment is intended to deal with \"technological advances, especially online and social-media platforms.\" This flies in the face of contradictory claims by the FPB that it is not interested in classifying social media content. \nThe FPB and Cabinet would do well to remember that that Draft Policy is unpopular in the extreme and there have been widespread calls for it to be scrapped. Tens of thousands of people have signed petitions by R2K and Avaaz calling on the FPB to do just that. \nWe stand by our demand that the FPB and Cabinet heed the public's response and desist from further attempts to push through its highly unpopular and backwards-looking Draft Policy. \n#HandsOffOurInternet", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-21T09:22:06.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
