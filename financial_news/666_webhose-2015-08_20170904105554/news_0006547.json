There were three decliners for every advancing stock.\nCanadian Natural Resources Ltd, the country's largest independent petroleum producer, lost 5.6 percent to C$28.30 and Suncor Energy Inc, Canada's largest oil and gas company, fell 3.2 percent to C$35.16.\nTen smaller operators gave up between 7 and 15 percent of their market value.\nZohny said that for investors with a three-to-five-year horizon, some names could be considered buying opportunities at these levels.\n\"There's quite a bit of bad news priced into the sector and there could still be some short-term pain, but it's definitely starting to look more attractive,\" he said.\nA slip in the influential financials group also contributed to the index's slide, its eighth in 10 sessions.\nThe financials are being tested by a combination of factors, said Philip Petursson from the portfolio advisory group at Manulife Asset Management, including banks' ties to commodities-related companies and the low interest-rate environment.\nThe group fell 0.7 percent, with Bank of Nova Scotia down 1.2 percent to C$59.88 and Toronto-Dominion Bank giving up 0.7 percent to C$51.93.\nInvestors will be closely watching bank earnings next week, Richardson GMP's Zohny said, and negative reports could push the index below 14,000.\nGold miners featured heavily among the most influential gainers, propped up by higher prices for the safe-haven precious metal.\nGoldcorp Inc rose 2.9 percent to C$19.85 and Barrick Gold Corp added 3.7 percent to C$10.34.\n($1=$1.32 Canadian) (Reporting by Alastair Sharp; Editing by Peter Galloway and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-20T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T00:51:42.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
