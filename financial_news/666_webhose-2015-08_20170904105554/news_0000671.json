Samsung cut the retail price of S6 edge smartphones in South Korea by around 100,000 won ($85.46) during July.\nThe company also plans to launch more price-competitive products in the mid-to-low end of the market.\nNomura analyst C.W. Chung says Samsung still has the economies of scale to outlast rivals, adding the smartphone industry will face a consolidation similar to the one in the memory chip industry that the South Korean firm now dominates.\n“The ones that ultimately survive will then have plenty to be happy about,” said Chung.\nNomura forecasts the smartphone market will grow from $276 billion last year to $315 billion by 2017, far larger than the DRAM and NAND memory chip markets where Samsung competes.\nFurther, the mobile division will remain an important client for Samsung’s components businesses. Use of its own Exynos mobile processors and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays in premium devices like the Galaxy S6 boosts its chip and display sales and serves as an advertising billboard for potential customers.\n“When everybody comes out to dig for gold, jeans and pickaxes are what make money; that’s what Samsung’s semiconductor business is doing through the smartphone market,” said Nomura’s Chung.\n($1 = 1,170.1300 won)\n 04, 2015 8:23 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:21:28.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
