Peter Rae Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith IOOF Group has announced a 43 per cent increase in underlying profit, boosted by the acquisition during the year of listed wealth management company Shadforth.\n​The company said its annual dividend was 12 per cent higher than the prior year after announcing a final dividend of 28 cents per share, fully franked.\nIOOF reported a record $1.7 billion net fund inflow to its flagship platforms, up 19 per cent on the prior year.\n​The wealth management firm, still in the grips of whistleblower allegations that senior staff at the firm engaged in front-running stocks , insider trading and the production of faulty research reports, also announced a 13.3 per cent increase in earnings-per-share growth despite its stock being battered amid the controversy.\nThe full -year results revealed the company had made a $7.3 million contingency for \"defending complaints and claims brought against it in its capacity as a wealth management advisor\".\nThe contingency came with a note to shareholders which explained directors of the company are of the opinion that further provisions will not be required. It also said that the company's insurance policy would ensure the company's financial liability relating to the matter would be reduced.\nIn August, senior executives from the financial services firm f aced a Senate committee grilling amid allegations IOOF tried to cover up the scandal at the company.\nThe acquisition of Shadforth was principally responsible for the material jump in profits, having contributed $44.8 million to the overall group underlying net profit after tax (UPAT), with no amount attributable to Shadforth during the previous corresponding period, the company said.\n \"The acquisition of Shadforth during the year has been immediately accretive. Shadforth has added scale, further diversified our business and contributed positively to earnings. The integration has delivered $13 million of pre-tax synergies in the current year, and is on track to deliver recurring synergies of $20 million from [financial year] 2016,\" said Christopher Kelaher, IOOF managing director.\nThe increase of the final dividend to 28 cents per share pushed the company to be \"marginally in excess\" of its payout ratio of 60 to 90 per cent of its underlying profit. The company said its decision to increase its dividend above the payout ratio reflected the fact that extra cash was available and its shareholders were entitled to it after the Shadforth acquisition.\nAlso included in the result were the proceeds of the company's sale of its stake in Perennial Fixed Interest and Perennial Growth Management to Henderson Group in June. The company said it would receive for $71.6 million upfront and deferred payments after two and four years based on performance.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@Matt_JS", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts"], "published": "2015-08-28T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-28T06:05:24.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
