However, several leading candidates have provided glimpses of their stances through their previous actions, and the critiques of the policies outlined by the Democratic candidates.This second article on the presidential candidates’ positions on student loan reform outlines the points of view from the most outspoken candidates in the Republican race: former Governor Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump. Former Governor Jeb Bush: reform higher education and grow the economy Much of Bush’s legacy was built on the educational reforms he instituted during his term in office as the Governor of Florida. Consequently, he is seen by many as “the education candidate.”In response to Hillary Clinton’s recently rolled out “ New College Compact ”, Bush laid out several initiatives that will presumably be the premise of a potentially forthcoming plan\nChanging incentives for colleges to promote an increase of individualization and choice for students; t Decreasing the cost of college; and t Improving the value of a college degree. Bush has repeatedly tied reforming higher education with growing the national economy. He has said that his proposed reforms would lead to strong growth in the economy, and that there is also a need for additional policies that would expand the economy and increase participation in the workforce.

Senator Marco Rubio: change repayment plans and make colleges accountable When speaking about student loan reform, Rubio is always quick to discuss his personal story. When he was first sworn in as a senator in 2011, he still had over $100,000 in student loans outstanding, and has publicly stated that student loan repayments were once “the single-highest expenditure in our personal budget.” Recently, Rubio introduced three student loan bills in the Senate, focused on reforming repayments based on the borrower’s income, supporting private financing options to pay for tuition and fees, and allowing students to know the key statistics of their education provider, such as the average graduation rates and the average student loan debt of graduates.You can expect that any student loan reform policies pursued in Rubio’s presidential campaign will prioritize similar initiatives.

Donald Trump: the government shouldn’t make money on student loans While Trump has yet to give specifics on his policy for student loan reform, he’s made several of his opinions on the topic clear. One of his main points of contention with the current state of student loans is the immense amount of money that the government is making on its federal student loan program.Focusing more on the economy, Trump has promised to create more American jobs if elected President.

Republicans seeking less intervention In contrast to the Democratic presidential candidates, the field of Republican candidates largely refute the idea of the government financially supporting public colleges and universities via new taxes or fees.", "external_links": ["https://marcorubio.com/issues/you-deserve-the-facts-before-taking-out-student-loans/", "https://medium.com/@HillaryClinton/the-new-college-compact-73652df9543c", "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/248913-trump-why-is-federal-government-making-money-on-student-loans", "https://jeb2016.com/jeb-bush-on-hillary-clintons-fiscally-irresponsible-higher-education-proposal/?lang=en", "http://mic.com/articles/123327/marco-rubio-where-2016-candidate-stands-on-abortion-immigration-and-student-debt", "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/09/for-rubio-student-loan-bill-is-personal.html"], "published": "2015-08-22T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-22T04:11:12.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
