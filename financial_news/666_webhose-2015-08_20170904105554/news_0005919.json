Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Patrick Commins Next time you hear a stock is \"priced for perfection\", think \"priced for a fall\".\nIt might save you some heartache, and maybe make you some money, in a reporting season that has already turned some ASX roosters into feather dusters.\nAnsell was among a number of market darlings to cop a plucking from edgy investors in the past week. Despite delivering a 20 per cent surge in underlying profit, the stock lost 15 per cent of its market value as investors rushed for the exit. The problem? Chief executive Magnus Nicolin said the strong greenback was increasingly hurting the company's US dollar-denominated revenue.\n\"But the underlying development of the company is quite strong. We have just reported record profitability in total and record profit percentages,\" Nicolin protested feebly. He also recognised, though, that it was always going to be hard sell amid sky-high shareholder expectations. \"The challenge is [the foreign exchange impact] and some of the surprise that I think that implied for some investors.\"\nAFR graphic The hearing implant maker Cochlear revealed on Tuesday an annual profit of $145.8 million, or 56 per cent more than the previous year. Good, but not good enough – the figure fell well short of the consensus forecast from the analyst community, where estimates went as high as $189 million.\nEven worse, in an effort to ease the way for his successor, outgoing boss Chris Roberts and his board then took the unusual step (for them) of providing earnings guidance for the year ahead, which was well below what the market was expecting. Cochlear's share price plunged up to 15 per cent – wiping out the year's gains in a matter of minutes – before the stock settled 7 per cent lower for the day.\nThey say three makes a trend, and Domino's Pizza is our third example. The fast-food chain reported a 56 per cent leap in profit to $64 million – its eighth consecutive year of higher earnings. Management said it expected earnings to grow by 20 per cent in the year ahead. The market was looking for 25 per cent forecast growth and that slight undershoot immediately sunk the stock 9 per cent.\nNothing new Over-the-top reactions to what are perceived as less-than-perfect results are not new, but nor is there any sign of this trend slowing. With Australian economic activity subdued, companies that look capable of increasing profit in a subdued earnings environment are prized.\nHence the headlong plunge into listed names capable of tapping into any kind of growth. Often that means a global angle – add a depreciating currency and it's a slam-dunk. Many healthcare stocks, for example, tick all the boxes.\nBut as you can see from this week's action, investors might be expecting – and paying – too much.\nOne top fund manager said recently the market darlings are trading now at the kind of multiples that have never presaged gains for investors. That said, there is little option for investors – it's hard to see an end to the downward pressure on commodity prices, which means the risk/reward trade-off on resources stocks still looks unattractive. Even the banks have been on the nose. Retail stocks (hello JB Hi-Fi) are beating low expectations, but how much earnings momentum can they really gain when the economy is slowing and wages are increasing at historically low levels?\nReflecting this reality, Macquarie's strategy team said this week it was \"questioning\" market darlings, while also recognising that growth – and particularly global growth – \"is still gold\". They added funds management firm Henderson Group and fertiliser and explosives business Incitec Pivot (both \"global cyclicals\") to their model portfolio. Ansell, however, got the boot.\nWhich leads us to the obvious question: in the remaining reporting season, which high-flying stocks will be brought low by overly demanding investors?\nYou get a clue to Macquarie's thinking by looking at the market darlings in which they are reducing exposure. Such companies include medical diagnostics company Sonic Healthcare and hospital operator Ramsay Health Care. Sonic reports on Tuesday, while Ramsay is due to front investors on Thursday, August 27. That's not to say that these stocks are destined to disappoint – only to suggest that expectations for them are running high. Both are up about 10 per cent in 2015 in a backwards market. The Macquarie analysts are also trimming their exposure to packaging business Amcor, which reports full-year profits on August 25.\nRiding high A perusal of a list of the ASX 200's most expensive names finds more healthcare businesses, including aged-care operator Regis Healthcare. It is trading about 30 times forecast earnings over the coming 12 months. The roll-up business reports on August 28. Pharmaceuticals business Mayne Pharma, which reports earning on August 27, is up 80 per cent in 2015 and trading on a forward P/E of 22, on Bloomberg data. Again, this is not to say they are about to shock investors but merely to point out they are riding high.\nOnline classifieds business Seek is trading on a P/E of 22 and has form when it comes to failing to meet inflated expectations. It suffered a shellacking at the hands of disappointed investors about six months ago, after it reported earnings that came in just shy of the market consensus. Its shares plunged almost 12 per cent. The company will reveal its full-year numbers on Wednesday.\nAnother reason to keep an eye on the market darlings this reporting season is that unreasonable expectations, once punctured, can lead to more reasonable valuations. Investors were quick to recognise the value in Domino's following its 9 per cent slump – the stock finished broadly flat for the day. CSL has been incredibly volatile for a massive global business. The stock dropped as much as 10 per cent on its profit update on February 11, and the canny investor who managed to pick it up then at $81.50 would be laughing now.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ComminsP"], "published": "2015-08-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-15T02:48:10.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
