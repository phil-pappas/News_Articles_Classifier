The 8-1 result prompted markets to push out their bets on a first rate hike into mid-2016.\nMcCafferty, a non-staff member of the MPC, backed rate hikes last year along with his colleague Martin Weale. They both rejoined the fold in January as oil prices tumbled.\nAs Carney spoke on Thursday, bets on a June 2016 rate hike were reined in. Jason Simpson, a Societe Generale rate strategist, said: \"The message is clear: rates need to rise. Not yet, but they need to go up and every inflation report is one step closer to that.\"\nFew economists think the BoE is likely to move before the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise rates this year, in large part because it would further push up the value of sterling. On Wednesday the pound hit its highest level against a basket of currencies in more than seven years.\nThree weeks ago, Carney said the decision when to hike interest rates would likely come into \"sharper relief\" around the end of the year. He emphasised on Thursday that this was his own view and that it had not changed since.\nThe Bank stressed how a recent strengthening of the pound and a renewed fall in oil prices would push down inflation until at least the middle of next year and said the impact of the rise in sterling could persist even longer.\nCarney made it clear, however, that a strong currency was no replacement for eventual rate hikes.\nIn a sign of how the debate on the MPC may develop, some of its members saw a risk that inflation could pick up more strongly than the central forecast, the BoE said.\nBut the Bank's array of forecasts and policy debate details suggested it was largely focused on how the stronger pound could keep a lid on inflation.\nThe BoE also noted that Britain's weak productivity growth was finally on the rise, which would help mute inflation even after wages grew surprisingly strongly in recent months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T03:13:28.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
