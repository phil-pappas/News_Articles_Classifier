Is signing up for a smart meter such a bright idea? IF you want to save money on your energy and water bills, it pays to get smart. At least, that is what politicians and big utility companies want us to believe. PUBLISHED: 09:32, Sun, Aug 2, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:54, Sun, Aug 2, 2015 PH More than eight out of ten metered houses never use the water-efficient eco setting \nMillions of Britons have smart meters installed in their homes to measure their gas, electricity and water usage and millions more are set to follow. \nWith the average household spending £1,344 on gas and electricity last year, as well as £394 on water, it sounds like a smart move. \nBut installing a smart meter could prove a stupid move unless you use it to change your habits. Water leaks \nMany homes with water meters are still pouring money down the drain. \nAlmost half of all UK households now have water meters and the Government is looking to roll out the scheme across the country. \nYet one in three says they do not feel the financial benefit, even though most installed a meter in an attempt to reduce their household bills, according to new research from AppliancesDirect.co.uk . \nThis follows research last year by personal finance site Moey.co.uk that showed one in three families saw their bills rise with a meter. \nMeters may save money for larger houses with low usage, but smaller homes with higher consumption typically lose out. \nMark Kelly, marketing manager at Appliances Direct, says a water meter counts every drop of water you use and adds it to your bill but most users do not make any effort to be more water efficient. \nMore than eight out of 10 metered households never use the water-efficient eco setting on new washing machines and dishwashers. \nKelly says: “Households could make staggering savings by upgrading their appliances as modern dishwashers, shower heads, washing machines and taps are built to be more economical.” \nIf you do not want to splash out on upgrading your appliances, there are cheaper, simpler ways to slash your bills. \nKelly says: “Cutting down the time spent in the shower by one minute every day could save a family of four up to 180,000 litres per year.” \nIf you leave the tap running while brushing your teeth, you squander six litres of water every minute. \nOnly using your dishwasher when fully loaded and using energy efficient washing machine cycles can also help evaporate your water bills, Kelly says. High energy Smart meters are not enough on their own. You need to be more mindful of how you use energy \nMore than one million homes have smart energy meters and we should all have them by 2020, under controversial Government plans costing almost £11 billion. \nBut hard-pressed energy customers face a £215 bill each to install them, which will be added to their already sky-high fuel bills. \nRunning costs will add another £11 a year, according to spending watchdog, the House of Commons Public Accounts Select Committee. \nIn return, it calculated that households could save just £30 or £40 on bills as a result, and then only if they are savvy about cutting energy usage. \nSacha Deshmukh, chief executive of smart meter provider, Smart Energy GB, argues that smart gas and electricity meters will save you money by putting you in control of your energy. \n“They finally show energy usage in a language we understand: pounds and pence.” \nInstead of relying on estimated bills, you pay only for the energy you actually use. \nDeshmukh says: “This allows you to monitor your usage, look at how you can lower your bills, and compare tariffs from different energy suppliers to secure the best deal.” \nAnn Robinson, director of consumer policy at comparison site uSwitch.com, says if you are keen to try a smart meter now, contact your supplier. \n“The cost of the meter and maintenance will be paid as part of your energy bill.” \nBut homeowners are unlikely to rush to get one installed until there is clear evidence it will save them money. \nSimon Hill, a vice president at energy supplier Opower, says smart meters are not enough on their own to bring energy bills down. \n“You also have to be a lot more mindful of how you consume energy.” \nHe says energy firms are creating new tools to help homeowners work out which household items guzzle the most energy and you should contact yours to see what it offers. \nSmart meter pioneer First Utility is offering customers who sign up to its three-year tariff iControl Fixed May 2018 a free Cosy smart thermostat worth £279, which comes with a mobile app that allows you to control your heating wherever you are in the world. \nThere may be other ways to get smart about your energy bills rather than installing a meter. Prepay \nEnergy bills have gone through the roof in recent years but low-income households on prepayment tariffs have really felt the heat. \nSuppliers typically offer prepay tariffs to hard-up customers on low incomes, of whom 80 per cent are already in debt. \nNew research from Citizens Advice shows they pay an average £226 per year more than on the cheapest online direct debit deals. \nChief executive Gillian Guy says prepay energy consumers get a raw deal. \n“This unfairness leaves some of the poorest people struggling to heat their homes and keep the lights on.” \nA recent review from regulator Ofgem into the prepay market revealed poor customer service, high costs and lack of choice. \nSome suppliers have made a commitment to reduce prepay prices when they roll out smart meters. \nBut greedy utility suppliers have a cheek asking customers to get smart while they are failing to wise up to their most vulnerable customers’ needs.
