Co-Founder of Promotions Resource LLC and co-author of the best-selling book Transform recently posted a new blog on her website entitled “Show Your Thanks By Giving at Thanksgiving.”  Summer has not yet come to an end and thoughts of holiday gift giving have already come to mind. At least to Danette Gossett who helps corporations and businesses promote themselves through the gifts they give.\nAs Ms. Gossett writes “If you really want to be perceived as an exceptional forward thinking company get a jump on your holiday gift giving.” She continues adding “After all Thanksgiving is a more appropriate time to express your thanks to clients employees prospects and anyone else you want to impress.”\nGossett offers examples advising “Think about sharing food. That’s what Thanksgiving is all about. Think about the individuals and groups you are giving to as well.” She offers the following suggestions “From fine chocolates to popular popcorn filled tins gourmet cookies to locally sourced or International goodie baskets there’s something to please everyone. For something more personal you might consider giving nice journals pen sets power banks speakers gift sets of business accessories and more.”\nAccording to Gossett “Giving gifts at an off time catches people off guard. It makes your gift stand out more memorably in the minds of the recipients.”  She adds “August is a great time to start planning ahead so you’ll be certain of getting what you want when you want it. Also keep in mind that factories get busier as the holidays get closer and production times increase.”\nThe entire blog can be read at \nAbout Danette Gossett \nDanette brings more than 30 years of experience developing advertising campaigns direct marketing programs and sales promotions to her clients.
