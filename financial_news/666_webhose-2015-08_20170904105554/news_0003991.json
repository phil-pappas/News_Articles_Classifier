Elliott not only had eclectic tastes but a \"consuming passion\" for collecting, he says. \"Peter always liked to start on the ground floor. He never paid a lot of money for anything. He bought early and extensively.\"\nFine art leads the sale and key lots include Brett Whiteley's The Arrival – a Glimpse in the Botanical Gardens , a vividly coloured painting of a Moreton Bay fig. It has been exhibited at museums including the Art Gallery of New South Wales and S.H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, but has not appeared on the market since Elliott purchased it from the artist in 1984. It is expected to fetch between $400,000 and $600,000.\nDr Peter Elliott AM took art collecting very seriously indeed. Supplied There are six other Whiteleys including the 1984-85 painting At the Bottom of the Park Lavender Bay is a Jacaranda Gardenia Tree , which is estimated from $350,000 to $450,000.\nMossgreen chief executive Paul Sumner is also expecting strong interest in two Fred Williams landscapes which he believes are from the best period of his career. The largest, Lysterfield Landscape from 1966, carries a $350,000 to $450,000 estimate.\nWhile the iconic Australian painters make up the top end of the sale – there are also works by Jeffrey Smart, John Brack, Arthur Boyd and Charles Blackman – over 90 per cent of the lots carry estimates under $5000. This includes lower-priced works by contemporary artists including Neridah Stockley and Peter Powditch.\nPulling out the stops Two Fred Williams landscapes will be auctioned, the largest, Lysterfield Landscape from 1966, carries a $350,000 to $450,000 estimate. Supplied Sumner says the massive sale could make over $3.5 million. Mossgreen has pulled out all the stops to market it, creating a stand-alone website and touring a selection of the Australian paintings, tribal and Chinese artworks to London gallery Messum's as well as around Australia. He says the London showing was successful and also drew interest from tribal art collectors in France and Germany.\nBut whether there is an appetite for the quantity on offer remains to be seen. Elliott liked to collect in depth and there are many sections of the sale where there are runs of similar objects, particularly of Asian art and Oceanic tribal pieces. Sumner says this isn't a disadvantage and has helped to create buzz around the sale. He points to a group of 11 rare Bulul figurines, made in the Philippines in the early 19th and 20th centuries, which he describes as \"almost a museum holding\". Estimates for these pieces range between $3000 and $18,000.\nElliott was born in 1927 and followed his father in his choice of career and as a collector of art. He bought his first piece in 1952 while still at the University of Sydney, and went on to become a highly respected and decorated physician and surgeon, specialising in obstetrics and gynaecology in Australia and Asia. He died in April last year.\nSumner says single-owner sales can generate more reliable results than multi-vendor sales, especially when they bring works that are \"fresh to the market and have been estimated conservatively – and that's what we've done here\". The low estimates and extensive choice could mean bargains for canny collectors.\nA Pair of Standing Bululs Kababuyan Village, Ifugao, Philippines (circa 1900). Peter Elliot was a keen collector of Oceanic art and 11 rare Bulul figurines are estimated to sell for between $3000 and $18,000.\nThere are seven Brett Whiteleys including the 1984-85 painting At the Bottom of the Park Lavender Bay is a Jacaranda Gardenia Tree, which is estimated from $350,000 to $450,000.
