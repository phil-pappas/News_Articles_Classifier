AP by Zhang Shidong China's stocks went up in late trade to reverse an earlier plunge as investors weighed the level of government support for the equity market.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.23 per cent to 3794.1 at the close of trading, erasing a loss of as much as 5.1 per cent earlier in the day. The market dropped a 6.2 per cent on Tuesday, with most of that fall coming late in the day.\nWednesday's market started to recover ground from midday onwards.\n\"The market expects the government will step in if the Shanghai Composite falls towards 3,500, but more and more people in the mainland sees that the bull market is over,\" said Mari Oshidari, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Okasan Securities Group Inc. \"With weak sentiment we will continue to see unstable moves in the market.\"\nStocks tumbled earlier this week after the securities regulator said late Friday that China Securities Finance Corp., the state agency tasked with supporting share prices, will reduce buying as volatility falls. China's richest traders are cashing out of stocks, while a record drop in yuan positions at the central bank and financial institutions last month signaled investors are moving money out of the country.\nSeparately, in interest rate markets, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties, controlled by China's richest man Wang Jianlin, is seeking to sell as much as 15 billion yuan ($US2.3 billion) of local bonds as the weakening currency boosts borrowing costs overseas.\nThe nation's biggest commercial developer is applying to sell the exchange-traded notes, according to people familiar with the matter. Wanda plans to offer the first batch of 5 billion yuan with a maturity of five years as early as this month, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the details haven't been announced.\nChina's developers are stepping up onshore fundraising as the government accelerates approvals to help reverse a real estate slump. The yuan's 3 per cent drop this month has burnished the appeal of financing at home, as it threatens to add $US1.7 billion to debt servicing costs on $US55.3 billion of builders' outstanding dollar-denominated bonds.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T10:55:49.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
