Photo: Philip Gostelow\nThe winner of the 2015 standout performance for a Wesfarmers business must go to discount department store brand, Kmart. Amid a relatively benign retail environment Kmart improved its earnings before interest and tax by an impressive an 18 per cent and delivered a return on capital of almost 33 per cent.\nThe prize for the most improved would have to go to Target which after four years of losses appears to be showing early signs of profit growth under a new management team and a focus on better pricing.\nThis would certainly come as a relief for Wesfarmers' chief executive Richard Goyder who has sounded like a broken record as he has needed to regularly defend the decision to retain Target and turn it around rather than cave into pressure to sell it or close it down.\nGoyder says that as a conglomerate operating many businesses it has the luxury to cocoon some of the strugglers until they retain financial health.\nAdvertisement Indeed all the Wesfarmers retail brands are continuing to improve with the mothership food and liquor division, Coles, posting a 6.6 per cent improvement in earnings before interest and tax, having increased market share at the expense of independent stores and Woolworths.\nThe supermarkets division has been reinvesting operational savings into further reducing the shelf prices in part to meet the challenge of growing competition from Aldi.\nBut market share is a touchy subject for the big supermarket chains that are under intense scrutiny from the government and regulators in relation to their market power.\nGoyder, instead points to the fact that since Wesfarmers acquired Coles the annual cost of a family's grocery shop has fallen $600.\nHowever, investors are more focused on the fact that Coles has again managed to improve its performance and widen the growth gap between itself and Woolworths.\nColes is still showing no meaningful evidence that its liquor division is improving its historically poor performance but it is clearly the recipient of plenty of intense management attention.\nOnce again the traditional darling in the Wesfarmers brand family, Bunnings, demonstrated that even cycling strong 2014 earnings it was able to post a boost in revenue and earnings by double digits. The competition from Woolworths' Masters business has again made virtually no dent in Bunnings' performance.\nAnd Officeworks, which got a bit of help from small business tax incentives in this year's federal budget, also carried its weight – contributing a 14.6 per cent improvement in earnings before interest and tax.\nThe generally buoyant results from Wesfarmers retail operations led Goyder to declare that the 'consumer is OK' as long as they are given an attractive offer at a good price.\nThis value proposition weaves through all the Wesfarmers brands – and in particular Kmart, Bunnings and the supermarkets.\nIn a week the market will get to see how Woolworths supermarkets and its discount department chain, Big W are faring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-20T22:25:20.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
