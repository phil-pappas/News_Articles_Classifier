Diversified South African financial group Old Mutual (Other OTC: ODMTY - news ) was the standout gainer after posting a 20% rise in first-half adjusted operating profit and lifting its dividend by 8% on the back of a strong performance in the UK and at home. \nSatellite telecoms group Inmarsat (Other OTC: IMASF - news ) followed close behind as investors welcomed the company's new full-year revenue guidance and news that the launch of its third Global Xpress satellite has been rescheduled for this month, as it posted a fall in first-half pre-tax profit amid declining revenues. \nInsurance company Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) was also on the front foot as it continued to benefit from upbeat results released earlier in the week, which showed pre-tax profit rose 6% in the first half of the year, while operating profit grew 18%. Results elsewhere in the financials sector included Aviva (Amsterdam: AW8.AS - news ) , which was up just over 1% as it lifted its dividend 15% and informed that April acquisition Friends Life (Other OTC: RSLLF - news ) was bedding in 'ahead of schedule'. However some analysts, such as those at Shore Capital , recommended switching from Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) into LGEN, which is believed to offer \"better income prospects over the next three years and beyond with much reduced execution risk\". \nHousebuilders were another sector on the up, with analysts highlighting the fact that the Bank of England was less hawkish than expected, pushing back expectations of an interest-rate rise. Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) and Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) were back in favour, having traded weaker ahead of the BoE releases. \nAtif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers, said housebuilders \"still represent good value.\" \"With yields and market demand continuing to stay strong and on the top end of expectations we see this sector as a key play on the long side. Concerns regarding rate rises and the likely impact on this space are overplayed,\" said Latif. \nOn the downside, RSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) shares fell. Although the insurer posted a large jump in first-half profits and reinstated its dividend, investors were more focused on reports that Zurich Insurance (Xetra: ZFI1.DE - news ) is considering a lower bid for the company at around 525p per share, versus the 600p RSA and the market is said to be looking for. \nMining stocks were under the cosh, with Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) , Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) , BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) and Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) all firmly lower as metals prices fell across the board, with the exception of tin and nickel. \nOil giant BP was under pressure as the stock went ex-dividend, with energy stocks in general feeling the pinch as a result of the recent decline in oil prices. \nRisers Old Mutual (OML) 229.30p +4.94% Inmarsat (LSE: ISAT.L - news ) (ISAT) 939.00p +4.74% GlaxoSmithKline (Amsterdam: GO8.AS - news ) (GSK) 1,465.50p +3.28% Legal & General Group (LGEN) 276.90p +2.29% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 200.30p +2.09% Barratt Developments (BDEV) 651.00p +1.56% Tesco (TSCO) 218.70p +1.53% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (LSE: HIK.L - news ) (HIK) 2,398.00p +1.52% Aviva (AV.) 535.00p +1.42% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 186.20p +1.25% Fallers Anglo American (AAL) 769.70p -3.56% BP (BP.) 381.55p -3.42% Glencore (GLEN) 197.10p -3.05% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,165.00p -2.96% Standard Chartered (HKSE: 2888.HK - news ) (STAN) 927.10p -2.89% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 574.00p -2.88% RSA Insurance Group (RSA) 509.00p -2.86% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 348.60p -2.76% Mondi (MNDI) 1,571.00p -1.44% Sky (Amsterdam: BK8.AS - news ) (SKY (LSE: BSY.L - news ) ) 1,117.00p -1.24%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T18:56:23.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
