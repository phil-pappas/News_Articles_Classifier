However, the firm has also offered hedge fund investments to retail customers in 2012 through a deal with Fidelity. This was followed two years later with a second mutual fund allowing savers with as little as $1,000 exposure to Wall Street hedge funds including York Capital Management and CQS. \nAberdeen had repeatedly signalled its intention to offer more hedge fund strategies, having bought fund divisions from Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) , Bramdean and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) in the years after the financial crisis. \n“Institutional investors are looking to hedge fund solutions to offer risk/return profiles not available via mainstream strategies and traditional asset classes,” said Martin Gilbert, Aberdeen’s chief executive. “The acquisition of Arden emphasises further Aberdeen’s commitment to diversifying its overall business and to growing its alternatives platform.” \nRBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) analyst Peter Lenardos said the transaction was likely to have only a small effect on Aberdeen’s performance. Last month, Aberdeen reported that its overall assets under management had fallen £23bn in the second quarter of the year to £307.3bn, hurt by falling appetite for emerging market investments. \nThis same volatility has affected a number of hedge funds in the past three months, particularly those with exposure to commodities and Asian markets. \nAberdeen, a FTSE 100 company, has recently prepared the ground for a share buyback, expected to begin later this year, following the £100m sale of a preference share to Mitsubishi in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T19:33:12.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
