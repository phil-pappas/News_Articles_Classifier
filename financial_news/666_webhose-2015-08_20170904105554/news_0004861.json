U.S. stock index futures indicated a lower open on Friday with investors eyeing the latest release of U.S. jobs data. \nU.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Friday with investors eyeing the latest release of U.S. jobs data, which are due at 8:30 a.m. ET. \nThe economy is expected to have added 223,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, enough to allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to pull the trigger on its first rate hike in nine years. \nThe Fed will consider a possible first rate hike at its September 16 and 17 meeting, but economists say that even with a strong jobs report, it is far from clear cut when the central will move off of the zero fed funds target rate it has had in place since late 2008. \nAround the world, central banks appear slow to want to cut their monetary stimulus. On Friday the Bank of Japan maintained the current level of its massive monetary stimulus program steady and stuck to its upbeat assessment of the economy, as expected. \nOn Thursday the Bank of England's monetary policy committee proved something of a damp squib for those hoping to see signs of a U.K. rate hike soon. \nOn the earnings front, Brookfield Asset Mgmt. (Toronto Stock Exchange: BAM.A-CA) , Hershey ( HSY ) and Telus (Toronto Stock Exchange: T-CA) are all expected before the bell. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK-A ) will report after the bell. \nIn oil markets, Brent crude traded close to one percent higher, just below $50 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 0.8 percent at $45 a barrel, ahead of jobs data and Chinese trade data over the weekend. \nIn Europe, markets opened lower ahead of U.S. jobs data, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 trading down at 0.4 percent, Britain's FTSE 100 down by 0.1 percent and Germany's Dax down by 0.4 percent. \nCNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report More From CNBC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-07T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-07T15:27:39.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
