The market then rebounded over the next two days.\nFinancial stocks were among the biggest decliners in early trading Thursday. U.S. oil prices edged lower.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 53 points, or 0.3 percent, to 16,601 as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time Friday.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped three points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,984. The Nasdaq composite slid 10 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,801.\nStocks ended sharply higher on Thursday, as investors took advantage of this month's heavy sell-off to add to their holdings. The market got a boost from a strong rebound in China's main stock market index and a report indicating that U.S. second-quarter economic growth was much stronger than initially estimated.\nMarkets have been volatile since China decided to weaken its currency earlier this month. Investors interpreted the move as an attempt to bolster a sagging economy.\nTraders are also jittery about the outlook for interest rates. The Federal Reserve has signaled it could raise its key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade later this year.\nThe recent market turmoil has thrown into doubt expectations for a rate hike next month, with most economists now saying it's off the table for now. Fed officials hold their annual meeting at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this weekend, which will be heavily scrutinized for clues on the rate hike timing.\nAnalysts say investors should expect further stock market volatility ahead.\n\"Uncertainties regarding China and the emerging world are likely to linger and uncertainty still remains around the Fed,\" said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.\nHowever, he added that he believes markets have bottomed out and a \"cyclical bull market\" is likely to resume. \"Despite the recent setback, share markets are likely to remain in a broad rising trend,\" he said.\nSECTOR VIEW: Seven of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 fell, with financial stocks sliding the most. The sector fell 0.6 percent. GameStop was down the most among stocks in the S&P 500, losing $4.63, or 10 percent, to $41.55.\nCONSUMER SPENDING: The Commerce Department said U.S. consumers increased their spending 0.3 percent in July, as wages and salaries made their biggest jump in eight months. Incomes increased 0.4 percent in July. The key category of wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent, the biggest advance since last November.\nEUROPEAN MARKETS: Germany's DAX fell 0.8 percent, while France's CAC-40 slipped 0.3 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was flat.\nASIA'S DAY: Most Asian benchmarks ended strongly as the U.S. growth data, which also helped oil prices stage an impressive rebound, gave added encouragement to investors seeking bargains in beaten-down shares.\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 3 percent, while South Korea's Kospi rose 1.6 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng swung into a loss in the final hour of trading, losing 1 percent. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.6 percent to 5,263.60. The Shanghai Composite Index in mainland China rose 4.8, adding to its 5.3 percent gain Thursday, its first increase in six days. During the previous five days, it had shed nearly 23 percent.\nTHE Quote: : \"It's just the state-owned funds that jumped in. I don't know which ones, but definitely from the state,\" said Dickie Wong, executive director at Kingston Financial Group.\nBONDS AND CURRENCIES: U.S. government bonds rose, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2.14 percent from 2.18 percent on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 120.98 yen from 121.12 in late trading Thursday. The euro climbed to $1.1234 from $1.1242.\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 4 cents to $42.60 a barrel in New York.
