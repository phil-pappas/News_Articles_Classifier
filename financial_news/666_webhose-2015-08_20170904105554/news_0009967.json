Phase one, from Mombasa to Jomvu, jointly funded by the government and African Development Bank. \nKenha has also purposed to erect two new weighbridge stations on each side of the road at Mariakani and dedicated lanes for trucks approaching the weighbridge, thus eliminating the traffic snarl-ups sometimes associated with the weighbridge. The World Bank funds this project. \nRehabilitation of Bachuma Gate and Maji ya Chumvi, a distance of 53.4km on the Mombasa-Nairobi highway, is ongoing. The World Bank under the International Development Association underwrites the project. Other planned mooted projects include the Mombasa Northern Bypass, which will run from Miritini to Mtwapa. Funded by the World Bank, the designs for these projects are in the pipeline. \nThe projects enumerated above aims at facilitating faster transportation of goods and services along the Northern Corridor; enhance economic growth for both Kenyan economy and for her neighboring countries. \nKenha is executing a massive project, which will change the economic fortunes of Mombasa residents, under the Mombasa Port Area Development Project, popularly known as the Dongo Kundu Bypass. The project will connect Mombasa Mainland (South and West) without entering Mombasa Island. \nCurrently, the only available permanent crossing channel from Mombasa Island to the South Coast is via ferry. \nOn average, the daily traffic using the ferry sees approximately 300,000 passengers at no cost with a vehicular traffic of more than 6,000 cross from Mombasa Island to the South Coast, which comes at a cost for the service. \nThe Mombasa Port Area Road Development Project, which will be implemented through a loan granted by the Japan International Co-operation Agency, will be undertaken in three phases: \nPhase I of the project will entail construction works of a 10.1km dual carriageway from Miritini Junction to Kipevu. It will also comprise construction of an Interchange at Miritini and at the entry of Kipevu, Rail-over-road bridge at Miritini, a weighbridge along the Kipevu link road, and an access road to the airport that will be 1.3km long. The key purpose of this segment is to ensure a quicker turn-around time for freight logistics companies delivering and collecting cargo at the port. Kenha has commenced construction of this road, and has contracted China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation to undertake the works. The construction period is estimated at 36 months though efforts will be made to reduce this turn-around time. \nPhase II will entail the construction of the 8.96km Mwache-Dongo Kundu stretch. On this route, Mwache and Mteza Bridges will also be set up. The 6.86km Dongo Kundu-Kibundani stretch be constructed as part of the Phase III package. It will entail construction of a site seeing bay at the start of the project as well as an interchange at Kibundani, junction with Likoni-Ukunda-Lunga Lunga road. Upon completion of the three phases, the Dongo Kundu Bypass is expected to bring far-reaching benefits and a very positive impact to traffic flow management at the Coast. \nThe road will reduce travel turn-around time and catalyse industrial development, and minimise on transportation costs by mitigating the loss of man-hours \nEnormous economic opportunities will be generated once the road is built, a move that will further enhance social economic development, create wealth and improve the living standards of residents. \nThe road will also enhance the development of tourism in the South Coast, which has always been curtailed as a result of congestion and other complications related to ferry crossing. \nExponential growth is expected to be discerned in other sectors of the economy including the blossoming of the real estate industry in South Coast. This will in turn boost niche tourism with the attendant benefits of employments and improved per capita income. \nThe new growth impetus will spill over Kwale county whose economy is dependent on the free movement of goods and services from Mombasa Island and surrounding areas. \nThe bypass will facilitate movement of goods and people between the Island and South Coast, this will also reduce conflict between docking ships and ferries establishing an alternative route to the Likoni channel. \nAs expected the completion of the ambitious project will decongest the Island by ensuring unlimited flow of traffic, enhance the capacity of the Port of Mombasa by providing an alternative access and spur socioeconomic development in the region. \nTo ensure that the benefits of this project accrue within the shortest time possible, will hasten implementation of the project. \nThis is in line with the Authority's stated goal of completing projects within the contract period in a bid to cut down on costs through the enhancement of efficiency. \nThe writer is chairman of the Kenya National Highways Authority.
