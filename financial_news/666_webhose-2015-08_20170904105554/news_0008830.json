Powers", "Sean Nichols"], "text": "By Sean Nichols Aug 30, 2015 BNP Partners says it is impressed with investor resilience that has shown little sign of waning despite the steep declines on the two Chinese mainland stock indices late last quarter. The Shanghai, China-based wealth manager and broker says it commissioned a client survey to gauge investor sentiment after more than 30% of the value of Chinese companies vanished in frenzied selling over a six week period.\"We were concerned that intense media focus on the scale of the selling and the associated losses would dampen sentiment even though many of those whose portfolios we manage emerged relatively unscathed,\" explained Gerald E. Powers, Chief Investment Officer at BNP Partners. \"Clearly, we needn't have been worried because the poll revealed that sentiment remains surprisingly buoyant,\" he added.The BNP Partners survey polled 500 institutional and corporate clients on a variety of subjects. According to the results, 72% said they expected stock values to rebound sharply over the next 12 months against 18% who felt stocks would trend lower. 10% said they didn't know.Questioned on their opinion on what would provide direction for stocks going forward, 69% said that monetary stimulus would play a key role while 22% believed an uptick in the Chinese economy would support prices.\"Clearly, there is considerable bullishness despite the fact that the Shanghai and the Shenzhen technically fell into bear market territory after those selloffs but, personally, I think the sentiments echoed in our poll are very accurate; monetary stimulus will make a big comeback both here in China and in the advanced economies,\" concluded Powers.
