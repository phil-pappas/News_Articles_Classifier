MUMBAI: Non-banking finance companies are increasingly lending to sellers on major ecommerce marketplaces even as some of their traditional businesses such as equipment financing and truck funding face a slowdown. Ecommerce companies such as Snapdeal and Flipkart are tying up with these nimble financial institutions to provide funding — mainly working capital — to sellers on their platforms. Bajaj Finance, for example, has rolled out a scheme to provide loans of up to Rs 2 crore for sellers of Flipkart and has processed 100 applications in just over a month. Similarly, Tata Capital has entered into a tie-up with Snapdeal for financing its sellers and online merchants through unsecured loans in the range of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 2 crore at competitive rates and with flexible tenures. Snapdeal has arranged finance for around 300 sellers on its platform. Online marketplaces have huge databases that finance companies use to arrive at the pricing and the quantum of loans for each seller, based on factors such as for how long they have been on the marketplace, size of business they do on the site, return percentage and customer review. Rate of interest offered ranges from 11-15 per cent depending on the sellers' track record and loans are offered in two-three working days. \"A good-to-excellent review by customers can lower interest rate by 50 basis points,\" said Devang Modi, president, consumer finance, at Bajaj Finance. \"The amount of loan is determined by consistent business done in the last six months and average standard deviation in business.\" Pradeep Bandivadekar, COO for corporate finance division at Tata Capital, said its partnership with Snapdeal reflects its recognition \"that ecommerce has tremendous potential\". Snapdeal has over 150,000 sellers from 5,000 locations. The ecommerce sector in India has grown an average 34 per cent a year since 2009 to touch $16.4 billion in 2014. The sector is expected to be in the range of $22 billion in 2015, a PwC report said. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!
