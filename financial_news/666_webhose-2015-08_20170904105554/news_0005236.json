AP by Brett Molina and Elizabeth Weise Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos says an article originally published by The New York Times portraying the difficult work environment at the online retailer \"doesn't describe the Amazon I know.\"\nThe article reported that Amazon employees must work long hours and are encouraged to openly criticise co-workers' ideas. As one former employee Quote: d in the article notes, \"Amazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves.\"\nThe report also detailed a seeming lack of empathy for employees' health-related issues. One excerpt described a female employee with breast cancer who was placed on a \"performance improvement plan\" because personal issues were affecting her work.\nIn a memo to employees sent late Sunday and obtained by USA TODAY, Bezos defended the culture at Amazon and encouraged employees who heard of similar stories to contact him as well as human resources.\nZero tolerance \"Even if it's rare or isolated, our tolerance for any such lack of empathy needs to be zero,\" Bezos writes in the memo.\nBezos also questioned the article's suggestion that Amazon has created a \"soulless, dystopian\" work environment, citing the competition among tech companies to hire employees.\n\"The people we hire here are the best of the best,\" he writes. \"You are recruited every day by other world-class companies, and you can work anywhere you want.\"\n \"Many of the allegations sound consistent with things that former employees have told me about the company,\" said Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali, an Amazon analyst with Forrester Research. But that's not surprising, she noted, as Amazon's expectations aren't that different from those of investment banks, which was where Bezos worked before he launched his company.\nAmazon, which turned 20 this year, has extensive networks of former employees.\nSteep learning curve \"As you can imagine, all of us alumni were passing the story around this weekend,\" said Eric Heller, CEO and founder of Marketplace Ignition, a strategy and branding consulting firm based in Atlanta.\nFor Heller, his seven-year stint at Amazon in the 1990s was like being in an extremely rigorous MBA program.\n\"You can complain that the tests are hard, the workload hard, but in the end you wouldn't change it. It's very challenging but you learn a ton and it launches you on to your next position,\" Heller said.\nIn his experience, Amazon is a great fit for a certain type of person who thrives on intensity and being around \"incredibly smart, driven people ... No one is forced to be there.\"\nBut he admits many eventually move on to get a better work/life balance. \"Maybe now they've got two or three kids and they want a different life style,\" he said. In that way he added, it's like working for a consulting firm.\nMany go on to start companies and end up hiring former Amazonians.\n\"You find these great people that you want to work with again and you start building a company around it,\" said Heller, who has multiple Amazon alumni on his staff.\nAmazon's success in hiring people despite what seems to be a less than nurturing culture is actually good news in a time when tech companies complain about the difficulty of finding qualified workers, said Mulpuru-Kodali.\n\"There's obviously a lot of great talent out there in the world if you look hard enough to find those people,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T14:16:59.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
