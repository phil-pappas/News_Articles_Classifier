Photo: Reuters\nOil jumped almost 4 per cent on Monday after a rally in US gasoline and diesel due to a refinery outage helped crude futures advance from multi-month lows.\nThe dollar's drop to a near two-week low also made oil and other commodities denominated in the greenback more affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.\nBrent, the global benchmark for oil, rose 3.7 per cent, posting its largest gain since end-May. US crude rose 2.5 per cent, its most in two months.\nThe rally came after a malfunction at the 240,000-barrels-per-day crude distillation unit at BP's Whiting, Indiana refinery sent gasoline prices soaring more than 4 per cent.\nUltra low sulfur diesel gained more than 3 per cent, rebounding from last week's six-year lows.\n\"A reduction in refinery activity should logically decrease the demand for crude, all things being equal,\" said David Thompson, executive vice-president at Powerhouse, an energy-specialized commodities broker in Washington.\n\"But the strong link between refined products and crude in the instance of a refinery issue creates the dynamic where the increased demand for the now, temporarily scarce gasoline outweighs the lessened demand for crude.\"\nBrent crude settled up $US1.80 at $US50.41 a barrel. It hit a six-month low of $US48.24 earlier in the session.\nUS crude settled $US1.09 up at $US44.96 a barrel. It plumbed a 4-1/2 month of $US43.35 in Asian trading.\nBrent lost 23 per cent of its value in the past six weeks and US crude 26 per cent, pushed down by an oil glut.\nDespite such oversupply, hedge funds and other big speculators raised their bullish exposure to US crude last week for the first time in seven weeks, trade data showed.\nWhile US crude settled higher on Monday, its front-month contract was at the largest discount to the second-month since mid-July due to a higher oil surplus expected from the refinery outage in Whiting and elsewhere.\nUS crude's discount to Brent was also back above the $US5-per-barrel mark in the widest gap in two weeks.\nRefined oil products usually rally during the summer in the United States, when driving activity peaks. This year's run-up in gasoline came as early as April but lost steam by July as some traders and investors deemed the market had gotten ahead of itself.\nOn Monday, the gasoline \"crack\" , or refining margin, hit a one-week high above $US26 a barrel. The diesel crack rose to a 2-1/2 month peak above $US22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T11:39:56.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
