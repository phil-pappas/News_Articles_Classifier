Over time, the foreign investment limit in several sectors has been relaxed but still the inflows from overseas have not reached its helm. Currently, our foreign direct investment (FDI) policy prescribes different caps and sub-limits under those caps for investment in several sectors. These sub-limits distinguish foreign investments as those made under foreign portfolio investment (FPI) route and FDI route and specify a maximum cap for these. The Finance Minister in his Union Budget Speech 2015 ( http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/bs/bs.pdf ) also expressed these concerns, while proposing to do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments and replace them with composite caps. On 16 July 2015, the Union Cabinet has approved the introduction of composite cap as proposed in the Budget and on 30 July 2015 the Department Of Industrial Policy & Promotion (DIPP) released a press note no.8 through which amendments have been made in Consolidated FDI policy 2015 (FDI policy), which are effective from 12 May 2015. These amendments will be effective with immediate effect. Composite Cap Till now, in several sectors there were sub-limits for FPI/ foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and FDI within the overall cap of foreign investment permitted. For example, in the commodity exchange, where overall FDI cap allowed was 49%, investment permitted by FPI was up to 23% and rest 26% through FDI. Subsequent to the issuance of press note 8 of 2015, FPIs/FIIs can also invest up to the maximum permissible cap allowed in the relevant sector. All other conditions as stipulated under Consolidated FDI policy 2015 for each sector to remain effective. In the following sectors composite cap has been allowed: Exceptions The sub-limits for FPI, FIIs, non-resident Indians (NRIs) and qualified foreign investor (QFI) have been merged with the composite caps in all sectors except banking and defense, which are kept outside the purview of the composite caps. In the banking sector, foreign investment is allowed up to 74%, but portfolio investment by FII, FPI and QFI is allowed only up to 49%. While in the defense sector, where foreign investment is allowed up to 49%, portfolio investment by FPI, FIIs, NRIs, QFI and foreign venture capital investors (FVCIs) is allowed only up to 24%. Existing Modes of Foreign Investment: Impact of Composite Cap Needless to say, the introduction of composite FDI caps will not only increase FDI inflows into the country but will promote ease of doing business. Companies in such sectors will now have the flexibility to raise equity from overseas in any form up to the sectoral cap. Further, where the government is inching its way to boost manufacturing within the country through its Make in India initiative, simplification and liberalisation in the Foreign Investment Policy was the need of the hour. In essence, introduction of composite caps are a much welcomed move for increasing the flow of FDI into the country.
