Even smaller stations will have such outlets now, a metro official said.\n“It gives sustainable additional revenue to the corporation while facilitating commuters by providing one stop solution for their needs and also provides incentive for private sector participant developers,” the official added.\nCurrently, such shops are seen only in major stations such as Rajiv Chowk, Central Secretariat, Mandi House, MG Road among others.\nDelhi Metro’s busiest corridors, Line 2 (Yellow Line)–that connects Jahangirpuri to Huda City Centre–will have 23 new kiosks while Line 3/4 (Blue Line connecting Dwarka to Noida) has 38 in its share.\nThe 193-km DMRC network has been looking for newer avenues to rev up its coffers even as it expands deeper into the NCR region.\nIts fares were last revised in 2009, when the minimum fare was raised from Rs 6 to Rs 8 with the maximum fare going up to Rs 30 from Rs 22.\n 17, 2015 7:08 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T18:21:30.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
