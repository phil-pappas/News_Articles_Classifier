It is noted that due to over dependence on employers, EPFO subscribers are not able to avail quick and easy services of the organisation, the statement said.\nEPFO has a subscriber base of around six crore. It manages a huge corpus of over Rs 6.5 lakh crore with an incremental annual deposits of Rs one lakh crore.\n 14, 2015 6:53 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-15T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-17T09:19:59.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
