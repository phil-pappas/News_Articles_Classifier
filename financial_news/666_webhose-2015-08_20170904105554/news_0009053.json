More than 700 people were injured and thousands have been evacuated because of the risk posed by chemicals stored at the site.\nState authorities have confirmed that more than 700 tonnes of the deadly chemical sodium cyanide were stored at the Tianjin warehouse that blew up.\nInspectors found that security personnel at the Beijing branch of Sinopec Corp were unfamiliar with how to handle an oil tank fire, Xinhua said. Employees were also found smoking in dormitories near the facility, it said.\n\"Companies that fail our inspections will be ordered to suspend operations, and their warehouses will be put under 24-hour surveillance,\" Qian Shan, vice-head of the Beijing work safety bureau, was Quote: d as saying by Xinhua.\nDespite the infractions found at the Sinopec branch, Xinhua did not say that the facility would be shut.\nBeijing has also suspended operations at firms that make or deal in highly toxic chemicals and explosives from Aug. 17 to Sept. 6 in preparation for a military parade and athletics event, Xinhua said.\nThe blasts at Tianjin, the world's 10th-busiest port and the gateway to China's industrial northeast, prompted a nationwide review of China's industrial safety record, which has struggled to keep pace with the breakneck speed of economic growth.\nChina has struggled in recent years with incidents ranging from mining disasters to factory fires, and President Xi Jinping has vowed that authorities should learn the lessons paid for with blood.\nExecutives of Tianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics, the firm whose warehouse exploded, have said they used connections to obtain safety approvals. The site was found to be too close to nearby homes. {ID:nL3N10U37W]\nA nationwide inspection of facilities handling dangerous chemicals and explosives was ordered by the State Council a week ago. It said in a statement on Thursday that advanced equipment and the best expertise needed to be used to prevent major environmental incidents in the future.\nXinhua said more than 300 inspection teams in southwestern Sichuan province had checked 1,258 chemical-related firms and had ordered one company to stop production.\nNorthwestern Gansu province had also ordered chemical companies with fire or explosion risks to suspend operations. Marine authorities in the coastal city of Shanghai, China's financial hub, are reviewing ships that transport dangerous goods, it said.\nOn Wednesday, three oil and gas firms close to residences were told by authorities in the cities of Hangzhou and Shenzhen to halt operations.
