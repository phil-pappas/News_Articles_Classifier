Jessica Hromas Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Qantas chief executive Alan \"Transformation\" Joyce had the biggest grin of anyone announcing annual results on Super Thursday. Wesfarmers' Richard Goyder looked his usual relaxed, low-key self as the company declared an underlying profit increase of 8.3 per cent to $2.4 billion. At Origin Energy, Grant King was determined to express optimism about the future despite a statutory loss of $658 million and a collapsed oil price that shows no sign of improving.\nThe company reporting season has had plenty of disappointments given a sluggish domestic economy and the carnage in much of the resources industry. But the results showed solid performances as well, reflecting what is possible with combination of smart management and an ability to either take advantage of economic trends – or to protect the business as much as possible from them.\nSo these three very different large businesses reporting Thursday provide a useful measure of the pressures and the potential facing Australian corporates in a world where continued volatility is the only certainty.\nThey also give some reason for hope Australian business opportunities need not be crippled by the political chaos in Canberra, by the relentless market focus on only short-term returns or even by the need to expand internationally.\nAlan \"Transformation\" Joyce, of Qantas, was all smiles. Jessica Hromas That doesn't make growth easy or assured, of course. There's still a lamentable lack of risk taking, innovation or investment by Australian boards and managements in general, particularly offshore. It is always more difficult to build momentum from a faltering base, whether it's a weak domestic economy or totally uncompetitive corporate tax rates or radically reduced commodity prices. And there's a definite limit to the payback from just continuing to cut costs without also creating new areas of profitable growth or much-improved services.\nBig strategic decisions Qantas, Wesfarmers and Origin Energy cover a broad range of industries but they all have in common the willingness to take big strategic decisions while continuing to grind away at improving services and efficiency every day.\nThe Qantas return to fighting shape – with an underlying pre-tax profit of $975 million, orders (finally!) for more new planes, and $505 million for shareholders – is the most dramatic. That's partly, of course, because the airspace looked so turbulent a few years ago. Remember Joyce's loud calls to the Abbott government for special assistance – only to have its plea rejected when Joe Hockey was still talking about the end of corporate welfare. Even last year Qantas, reported an underlying loss of $646 million.\n Joyce says happily, the speed of the turnaround has surprised everyone. Clearly, that has been assisted by a lower fuel price, lower depreciation charges, the end of the carbon tax and the decision by Virgin to stop the financially expensive capacity war domestically leading to lower margins.\nBut the key is the continuing impact of the $2 billion transformation program Joyce announced two years ago in order to have a legacy airline that could survive against new lower-cost airlines and greatly increased competition. The result is even Qantas International, against the odds, is back to being profitable and Qantas is generating a return on capital of 16 per cent.\nWesfarmers, by contrast, made its biggest bet during the global financial crisis. Under Goyder as a relatively new chief executive, the Wesfarmers conglomerate turned itself into largely a retail dominated business thanks to its acquisition of the Coles Group.\nCriticism of decision There was criticism of that decision too, especially given the strength of Coles' main competitor, Woolworths, and Coles' supposed inability to catch up.\nGoyder can never be guaranteed the last laugh, particularly when international chains such as Aldi are increasing market share. But Woolworths is now the operator under pressure compared with the steady growth and improved margins in businesses such as Coles, Bunnings, Kmart, Office Works and signs of stabilisation in Target. This also counterbalances the weaknesses in other parts of the Wesfarmers conglomerate mix such as coal and industrials.\n\"One of the things we try to do is look through cycles,\" Goyder says. \"We don't try to overreact to what we think are cyclical things or businesses that are not performing well because of management issues. We try to work those out … to deliver value for shareholders.\"\nThat won't stop the demand for Wesfarmers to do more offshore – rather than just improve its supply chain efficiency from whatever source. Goyder says Wesfarmers is always on the lookout for opportunities and would like to expand offshore. But he points out hurdle rates are higher given the greater risks and that Wesfarmers is not \"sitting there wringing our hands\" given the many opportunities for a conglomerate to also expand domestically. That is harder, he suggests, for a single industry business.\nDomestic investment Origin Energy might not agree with that given the massive size of its domestic investment into new areas such as coal seam gas and the LNG export market in Queensland, as well as its ambitions in renewable energy, especially utility scale solar.\nBut the company has limited balance-sheet flexibility when oil prices are so low, decimating expected returns on its big LNG play. According to King, its $5.8 billion worth of liquidity will be more than enough to fund its remaining $1.8 billion share needed to finish the $25 billion Australia Pacific LNG plant at Gladstone. Even at current low prices, he argues LNG export prices are much higher than would have been available for gas sold domestically. That didn't reassure a sharemarket, which sent Origin shares tumbling 13 per cent to seven-year lows. King will see that as part of the short-term cost of doing business for the long term. But in tough times, verdicts in the business world can be even more brutal than in the maelstrom of politics.
