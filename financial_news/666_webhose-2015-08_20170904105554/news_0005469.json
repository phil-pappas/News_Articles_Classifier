Unfortunately, the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond is barely yielding 2%. Pagnato said there are better opportunities to find relatively safe yield in private investments\n\"You can find private investments like private real estate , agricultural financing, farmland, senior mezzanine debt where you are earning 7% to 9%,\" said Pagnato. \"There's a risk. There's risks with everything and everybody always needs to consult with their advisor. But it's not like you are invested in junk bonds.\"\nMeanwhile, Pagnato is far more cautious about the stock market due to a quarterly decline in earnings and suggests investors hedge their holdings.\n\"You want to be in the United States because the dollar is strong and it will continue to be strong. And you want to stick with importers not exporters.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13258062/1/business-sellers-should-seek-private-investments-not-stocks-bonds-for-their-windfall.html", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13258062/1/business-sellers-should-seek-private-investments-not-stocks-bonds-for-their-windfall.html&title=Business", "http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Industries/Real-Estate/EY-Trends-in-real-estate-private-equity", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-17/goldman-sachs-four-reasons-the-stock-market-will-move-sideways-until-the-end-of-the-year", "http://www.hightoweradvisors.com/who-we-are/advisors/pagnato-karp-group", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13258062/1/business-sellers-should-seek-private-investments-not-stocks-bonds-for-their-windfall.html", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13258062/1/business-sellers-should-seek-private-investments-not-stocks-bonds-for-their-windfall.html&text=Business", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.thestreet.com/story/13258062/1/business-sellers-should-seek-private-investments-not-stocks-bonds-for-their-windfall.html", "http://www.pionline.com/article/20150817/ONLINE/150819898/dol-moving-forward-on-fiduciary-rule"], "published": "2015-08-18T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T05:19:39.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
