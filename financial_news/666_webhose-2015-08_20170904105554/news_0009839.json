Lo and behold, Wednesday was one for the books for the U.S. markets. The Dow closed up 619 points, or 4%; the S&P 500 was up 3.9%; and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 4.2%. The markets followed up a tour de force Wednesday performance with another huge rally on Thursday. Friday was a flat day of trading. \nMany of the stocks we picked made huge gains as well. If you had bought one share of each of the companies below, you would have made a 7.38% gain in just two days -- and you'd own a portfolio of high-quality dividend stocks . Read on to see which stocks appreciated the most. \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- The S&P 500 was down by just under 10% last week on Wednesday, which created opportunities to buy excellent businesses for bargain prices (the S&P 500 finished the week up slightly, but still down 6.6% from its all-time high). It was helpful to remember what legendary investor Warren Buffett once said: \"Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy.\" \nMust Read: Warren Buffett's Top 10 Dividend Stocks \nThis past Wednesday was the time to be greedy and load up on high-quality businesses. The 10 businesses below all have paid steady or increasing dividends for 25 or more years, and all of their stocks declined more than the S&P 500 as of the opening of trading Wednesday morning. \nThey have since recovered. Below, our analysis of the companies with updated prices and dividend yields. This was one great buying opportunity that was too good to pass up. \n1. Deere \nDeere ( DE - Get Report ) , the world's largest manufacturer of farming equipment, has paid steady or rising dividends for 27 consecutive years, proving over the last several decades that it can maintain or increase its dividend payments even through recessions. \nThe stock has declined over 15% as of Wednesday morning. It recovered 1.82% from that low as of Friday's close. It was undervalued even before the selloff, largely because its earnings are highly cyclical. When crop prices fall, farmers tend to put off purchases of new equipment, hurting Deere's earnings, which are near lows not seen since 2011. \nThe stock now has a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.66 and a 2.9% dividend yield. The world's wealthiest investor -- Warren Buffett -- bought into Deere this year , and the stock is trading at its lowest price of the last 12 months. \nWhen Buffett gives a stock his seal of approval, long-term investors should take note. When you can buy the stock at a better price than Buffett himself, you are setting yourself up for potential high total returns. 1 of 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-30T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-31T01:23:31.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
