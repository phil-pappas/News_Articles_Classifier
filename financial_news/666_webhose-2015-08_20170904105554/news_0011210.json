Asian shares gain in choppy trade after China rate cut AFP â€“ 22 minutes ago View Photo \n\nAsian shares rose in choppy trading on Wednesday, after an interest rate cut in China began to soothe fears about stalling growth in the world's number two economy and arrest the crisis that has rattled global markets. \nChina's central bank reduced interest rates and slashed the amount of money banks need to hold in reserve on Tuesday -- its second such double move in two months -- in a bid to bolster slowing growth. \nThe measures are not only expected to help boost cash flow in China, but also revive confidence that Beijing can steer the world's second-largest economy away from a hard landing and keep global growth on course. \nThe cuts initially fuelled a rebound in global equities, with European shares surging after their heaviest losses since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday as panic about China gripped world markets. \nOptimism fizzled by the end of US trading, with Wall Street finishing in negative territory after strong early gains as investors questioned whether it would be enough to keep China on track. \nBut after heavy swings in early deals Asian investors propelled shares higher, with Tokyo shares jumping more than three percent just ahead of the close after six straight sessions of losses. \n\"The Chinese central bank has belatedly made a move,\" said Hiroichi Nishi, a manager at SMBC Nikko Securities. \n\"One of the reasons behind the steep falls so far was the fact that the Chinese authorities hadn't done anything. The fact that they have now shows that they're determined not to let the economy worsen.\" \nDespite volatile early trading that saw China's benchmark index fall as much as 3.85 percent and rise as much as 1.24 percent, Shanghai jumped 4.25 percent, or 125.94 points, to 3,090.91. \nOther Asian share markets also gained, with Sydney, Seoul and Hong Kong all pushing higher. \nZhang Yanbing, an analyst from Zheshang Securities, said the central bank's cuts had tamed the \"panic sentiment\" that had gripped Shanghai, but warned: \"There will still be fluctuations as views towards the market's prospects are divided.\" \n- 'Full-blown crash' - \nChinese stocks have lost more than 40 percent of their value since a year-long, debt-fuelled rally collapsed in June, prompting Beijing to unleash unprecedented measures to support the market -- including using state-backed vehicles to buy up shares. \nWhile the slump in Shanghai may have a limited impact on the broader economy, it reflects dissipating confidence among investors that the sky-high valuations of quoted companies are warranted. \nSome analysts see Beijing's handling of the market slump as a further litmus test of the government's ability to guide the economy to a more market-oriented model after the shock devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago. \n\"If problems on China's financial markets and real economy deepen, and the authorities fail to contain the situation, a full-blown financial and economic crash in China could ensue,\" said Christophe Donay, chief strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. \n\"This is currently the biggest risk for the global economy and financial markets.\" \nChina's central bank on Tuesday warned that \"economic growth rate remains under pressure\", adding the cuts were meant in part to \"support the real economy to continue to develop healthily\". \nThe People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988-OL.HK - news ) (PBoC) cut its benchmark lending and deposit interest rates by 0.25 percentage points each and its reserve requirement ratio by 0.50 percentage points. \nThe bank has now cut interest rates five times since November in a bid to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year. \nBut international investors said more would need to be done to fully reassure markets, especially as the US is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade by the end of the year. \nThe head of the PBOC's research unit said expectations for a rate rise in September had been the \"trigger\" for the wild swings in world markets and warned the US central bank to wait, Xinhua reported. \n\"A circuit-breaker is needed to dispel excessive pessimism and restore confidence,\" Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg News. \n\"Further support measures in the coming weeks and months will be needed.\" \n-- Bloomberg News contributed to this report --", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-26T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-26T09:32:14.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
