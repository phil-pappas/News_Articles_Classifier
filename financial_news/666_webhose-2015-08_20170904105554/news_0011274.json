But will it last? Kaja Whitehouse with Americaâ€™s Markets. USA TODAY This April 8, 2009 file photo shows the General Motors logo is displayed at the New York International Auto Show in New York.

But this pain is opens the door for potential gains. Each of the stocks are expected to be worth 20% or more in 18 months, rated \"outperform\" or \"buy\" by Wall Street analysts, get a perfect 5-star stock rating from S&P Capital and are rated \"neutral\" or better by market research firm New Constructs . Just 45 stocks in the S&P 500 currently get S&P Capital IQ's top rating. \nWith the market in full-fledged rally mode, investors are picking through the carnage looking to profit from other investors' collective freak out moment. The S&P 500 had lost 12.4% of its value at the closing low this week on Tuesday - but has since staged an impressive 5.9% rally from those lows. Investors on Wednesday alone profited $682 billion in a single day - which has been the most powerful yet in the rebound. Stock rebound gains speed: Dow rallies 300+ \nThe biggest potential winner in the eyes of investors is airline American Airlines. American, along with the other airlines, has seen its shares get absolutely demolished since peaking in March. Shares are down 31% from from their 52-week high of $56.20 a share and trading at $38.55 Thursday. \nStocks in the airline industry were first to suffer even before the market as a whole cracked. American's shares are down 8.4% from the broad S&P 500's peak on May 21. But given low energy prices and constrained capacity, analysts still think American is a winner. Analysts are calling for American to be worth $56.20 a share in 18 months, if correct, would be a 41% gain - or the biggest upside among these beat-up stocks. Shares also get \"attractive\" rating by New Constructs, which compares stock prices to the present value of expected future cash flows. \nAn American Airlines jet makes its landing approach at Los Angeles International Airport.

The company that sells gear to energy companies has lost a quarter of its value since the market's top in May - more than any another of these stocks that analysts see upside in. It's also about down a bruising 50% down from its high over the past 52-weeks, trading Thursday at $32 a share. Yet, analysts think this stock should be worth 24% higher in 18 months with a price target of $39.76 a share. \nBoth the big U.S. automakers are also big opportunities for investors, according to analysts. General Motors and Ford (F) shares are down 27% and 25% respectively from their highest points over the past year - putting them both well within bear market territory. But analysts see 40% potential upside in GM shares and 31% upside in Ford. New Constructs rates GM \"attractive\" and Ford \"neutral.\" Wall Street analysts rate both stocks \"outperform.\" Shares of GM are up 2% today to $28.70 and Ford shares are up 3% to $13.57. \nThe recent recovery in stock prices could prove to just be a fleeting bounce. That remains to be seen. But investors buying stocks that are already down 20% - but still highly rated - can at least feel good about taking advantage of the pain - rather than being one of the investors who panicked. \nS&P 500 stocks down 20% or more from their 52-week highs with 20% or greater upside to 18-month price targets, 5 star equity ratings from S&P Capital IQ and \"neutral\" or better ratings from New Constructs (Photo: S&P Capital IQ, New Constructs, USA TODAY) \nAn American Airlines jet makes its landing approach at Los Angeles International Airport.
