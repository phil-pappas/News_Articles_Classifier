German 10-year bond yields were 4 basis points higher at 0.64 percent . \nYields on the comparable 10-year U.S. Treasury were last up 4 basis points at 2.1677 percent, reflecting a price gain of 9/32. \nThe 30-year Treasury was off 11/32 in price and yielding 2.8374 percent ahead of government auction of $16 billion of 30-year bonds later on Thursday. \nTreasury yields also got a lift from a government report that retail sales rose 0.6 percent in July. The data suggested solid U.S economic momentum and should fuel expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike as early as next month. \nTrading in Treasuries was moderate, in part because of Thursday's long bond auction, the last leg of this week's sale by the U.S. Treasury of $64 billion of debt, according to Guy Haselmann, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at Scotiabank in New York. \nThe Treasury Department on Wednesday sold $24 billion in 10-year notes to weak demand, resulting in it paying a higher yield to investors than the market expected, according to Treasury data. \n\"I think the auction will go just fine,\" said Haselmann, who sees sputtering global growth and inflation trends as making long maturity bonds more attractive than shorter ones.
