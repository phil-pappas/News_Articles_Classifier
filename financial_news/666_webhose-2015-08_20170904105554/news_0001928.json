There is also the ever-familiar Alpha-Bits breakfast cereal.\nREAD ALSO:\nGoogle to become Alphabet Inc in shakeup\nIn fact, even the domain name alphabet.com will not be easily available to the company. A who.is search reveals that it is owned by auto-company BMW and is the name of the fleet management division of the group. Google will have to steer clear of the 'alphabet' name when it christens its self-driving cars division.\nThe Twitter handle @alphabet is also controlled by Chris Andrikanich. One can read between the lines of his last tweet:\nWell, that was an interesting way to end a Monday...\n— Chris Andrikanich (@alphabet) August 10, 2015 Interestingly, Alphabet's homepage is located at a rather unconventional URL - abc.xyz. The page features Larry Page's announcement letter, at the moment. The creation of the page has brought some good news to Daniel Negari who is the founder and CEO of XYZ.com, an internet domain registry that owns the suffix .xyz.\nSpeaking with CNBC, Negari reported that following Google's announcement he was witnessing all kinds of names being registered and got 250 registrations in just 60 seconds. Typically, about 3,000 .xyz domain names are registered in one day. He did not reveal how much Goggle spent on the domain citing a confidentiality agreement.\nIt appears that Microsoft has already started trolling Google/Alphabet as the domain name xyz.wtf redirects to the Redmond giant's search engine Bing. While the domain listing is private the IP address of the registrant points to the Microsoft headquarters as per Search Engine Land.\nWith inputs from Reuters http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Google Alphabet,abc.xyz,abc.wtf ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/alphabet/status/630851210665439233", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-08-11T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-12T00:14:57.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
