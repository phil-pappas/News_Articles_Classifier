The suspect was detained two days later, it said. \nHe was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of robbery and \"forcible molestation of a woman\", it said. \nSuch incidents elsewhere have damaged Uber's reputation and sparked both public and regulatory backlashes against online car-hailing services. \nThe New Delhi government banned Uber in December after a woman passenger accused one of its drivers there of rape. A court later rejected the ban, saying the state could strictly regulate app-based taxi companies but that it did not favor an outright ban. \nThe main players in China's ride-hailing app market include Didi Kuaidi, backed by Internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, as well as a range of smaller players including Yidao Yongche. \nIn addition to stiff competition, Uber has faced regulatory challenges in China with occasional office raids and crackdowns on drivers. \nNews of the Chengdu attack raised some alarm online. \n\"I don't dare take those cars!!!! And fortunately I'd never take a car at night,\" one user posted on China's Twitter-like Weibo microblog. \nAnother said: \"You can never know who's behind the mask in hire cars.\" \n($1 = 6.4090 yuan)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T12:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T12:29:04.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
