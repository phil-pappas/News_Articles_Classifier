Chancellor George Osborne has kicked off Britain's biggest ever privatisation by selling £2 billion of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland at a loss to the taxpayer seven years after the bank was rescued with a record £45 billion state bailout.\nThe sale marks a watershed moment for the UK banking system and a step back to normality for what was once the world's biggest bank by assets but later became the UK's most spectacular victim of the financial crisis. (Tweet This)\nIt forms part of a major privatisation programme that Mr Osborne hopes will eclipse the Thatcherite boom of the 1980s and 1990s and underlines a recent thawing of relations between the government and the City of London .\nMore from The Financial Times:\nA look at 3 chief executives of Royal Bank of Scotland\nRBS warns of 'tough issues' ahead as profits rise\nLandlords demand clarity on migrants crackdown\nFor RBS the move is a welcome step on the long road towards the government's final exit from its £32 billion shareholding. The scandal-plagued bank has suffered seven consecutive annual losses as a series of dramatic restructurings transformed it from a global colossus to a much smaller domestically-focused lender.\nSir Philip Hampton, who took over as chairman after the crisis in 2009 and is stepping down this month, told the Financial Times on Monday: \"I think it is the right step as the government is a reluctant shareholder. The process of normalisation has been a long time coming.\"\nHowever, the overnight placement of a 5.2 per cent stake on Monday night has sparked criticism that the chancellor is inflicting a loss on taxpayers. RBS shares closed at 337.6p, far below the 502p at which the government bailed it out. They traded above 400p as recently as February.\nRead More These are the changes HSBC must make\n\"Labour has always supported the eventual return of RBS to the private sector, but taxpayers who bailed out the bank will want their money back and will be suspicious of any fire sale,\" said Chris Leslie, shadow chancellor.\nHowever, Mark Garnier, a Conservative MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: \"I'm in full support of doing it now . . .  it's long overdue.\" He added that selling now would boost liquidity and demand for the shares.\nIn June, Mr Osborne prepared the ground for selling at a loss by saying that both the governor of the Bank of England and the financial advisory group Rothschild had told him that any delay in privatising RBS would be bad for the economy, the taxpayer and the bank itself.\nRead More There's money to be made in energy: Pro\nThe Edinburgh-based bank's privatisation contrasts sharply with that of its rival Lloyds . The government started to privatise Lloyds two years ago and has since earned a healthy profit as it reduced its stake by two-thirds to below 14 per cent.\nThe Dutch and Irish governments have also recently launched the process of selling shares in ABN Amro and Allied Irish Banks respectively — two of the other big victims of the financial crisis.\nRBS still faces other major obstacles in its path to recovery. It is expected to be slapped with the biggest-ever fine imposed on a UK bank by US regulators for alleged mis-selling of subprime mortgages before the crisis. The bill could be as high as $13 billion, according to a US government agency in a recent court filing.\nRead More Bankruptcy fears as interest rates are set to rise\nThe bookrunners on the stake sale were Goldman Sachs , UBS , Morgan Stanley and Citigroup . Rothschild acted as financial adviser. One banker said he expected the shares to be sold at less than a 3 per cent discount, indicating strong appetite from investors, including hedge funds.\nJames Leigh-Pemberton, executive chairman of UK Financial Investments, which manages the government's banking stakes, said in a letter to Mr Osborne that it was feasible to realise a total of at least £25 billion from the sale of RBS shares over the course of this parliament.\nMatthew Beesley, head of global equities at Henderson Global Investors, said: \"Clearly, there's more of a journey left for RBS than Lloyds in terms of restructuring and transforming into a UK-focused bank. The challenge is the [RBS] share price already discounts quite a bit of that.\"\nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Rigby", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1b8b1792-3a02-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152.html#axzz3hmOePOXp", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ff14052e-39cf-11e5-bbd1-b37bc06f590c.html#axzz3hmOePOXp", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/67724f52-35fe-11e5-b05b-b01debd57852.html#axzz3hmOePOXp", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://cnbc.com/2015/08/03/sale-of-rbs-stake-marks-start-of-the-uks-biggest-privatisation&text=RBS"], "published": "2015-08-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-03T23:37:20.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
