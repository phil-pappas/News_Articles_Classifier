These products, it said, are sold as “Apple Certified-PreOwned” after repair by its original equipment manufacturer.\nIts proposal was formally turned down by the Technical Review Committee on July 2 on grounds that it would add to the country’s e-waste. The other reason was that India did not allow import of old consumer electronic items like mobile, laptops, televisions etc for trading.\nOthers like IBM India, HP India and Honeywell Technology had applied for import of used servers, storage equipment, networking products and other electronic goods for testing and providing worldwide support with some offering to re-export within three years.\n“The monitoring with respect to re-export after one year is not feasible in the present context. Further, it is noted that manufacturing date (of the import) is not being considered as an essential criteria for such cases for re-export,” argued the ministry. “Accordingly, all such cases are rejected,” it ruled in May. Nokia Solutions and Networks was declined permission to import 62 electronic and electrical accessories and later Alcatel and Ericsson were not allowed to import 1,703 telecom networking and 1,000 functional fan control units, respectively. NEC Technologies were also disallowed to import five “second-hand” servers and standard accessories from the US.\nThe ministry’s green stance comes after years of unrestricted imports such as permission to HP last October to import 311,398 units of refurbished parts for warranty replacement with the condition that defective component in equal number would be exported prior to import.\nFlextronics Technologies was allowed last February to import 146,954 refurbished hard disk drives for warranty replacement with similar re-export condition.\nFirst Published on July 31, 2015 8:30 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T14:28:18.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
