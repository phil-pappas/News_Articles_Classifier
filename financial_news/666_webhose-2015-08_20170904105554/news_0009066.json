However, the premium has since fallen to around 27pc as a result of Shire’s sagging share price since making the biggest acquisition offer in its history. \nMr Hantson also scorned the deal’s rationale and said that he did not believe that a combination of the two rare disease companies would generate substantial operation or revenue synergies. \nShire’s chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, said last week that a takeover of Shire’s “copy-cat” would double the company’s revenues to $20bn by 2020 and said a combination would also reduce the US group’s tax bill. \nShire’s chief executive Flemming Ornskov \nHowever, Mr Hantson has hit back and said that “with continued debate in Washington about taxes, we do not believe tax synergies should be the primary driver of any long-term strategic transaction”. \nShire was last year jilted by US drug group AbbVie (Xetra: 4AB.DE - news ) , which abandoned its $54bn takeover after changes to US tax rules made its inversion deal unworkable. \n“We are not entrenched or intransigent, but given Shire’s proposal, our board made a considered and correct decision to not engage based on it”, Mr Hantson said. \nBaxalta was spun-off from Baxter International (NYSE: BAX - news ) on July 1 and nine days later Shire approached. \nMr Hantson said: \"At this point, our stock has not yet achieved a price level that appropriately reflects our company’s value and prospects\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-11T02:06:18.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
