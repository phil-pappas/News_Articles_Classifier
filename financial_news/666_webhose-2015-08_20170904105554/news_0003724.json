The offering is for participation interests in a $1.4 million mezzanine loan in the Racquet Club Apartments in Lancaster, California. This class of investment is traditionally only available to institutional investors, but Pillar is opening the deal to all accredited investors for a $25,000 minimum investment. The Racquet Club Apartments is a 200-unit apartment community is in Los Angeles County. Pillar is offering investors a 9.00% return on the interest-only mezzanine loan, which has a maturity date of December 6, 2019.\nAt closing, $1,138,000 ($5,690/unit) was escrowed to fund capital improvements, including $500,000 ($2,500/unit) for interior upgrades. Rent levels at the property were at the lower end of the competitive set identified by the appraiser, providing for upside rent potential.\nAccredited investors who are interested in learning more should click here and request access to the investment offering.\n“Our team at Pillar is very excited to be crowdfunding this mezzanine loan on EarlyShares,” said Anand N. Gajjar, Principal and CEO of Pillar. “We have deep experience in this type of commercial real estate asset, but we’ve typically only worked with institutional investors on these kinds of deals. Hosting this offering on EarlyShares will help us broaden our reach to new investors who have traditionally been unable to access institutional-quality investments.”\n“EarlyShares is committed to working only with highly respected real estate developers, lenders, and investment firms – and Pillar is a sterling example,” said Joanna Schwartz, co-founder and CEO of EarlyShares. “Accredited investors can rarely participate in deals underwritten by lenders of Pillar’s caliber. We’re thrilled to be working with this Guggenheim Partners affiliate and we hope a wide array of investors will take advantage of this opportunity.”\nTo browse all current investment opportunities on the EarlyShares platform, click here .\nUnder current SEC regulations, only accredited investors who are registered users of EarlyShares are able to invest in the Racquet Club Apartments deal and other opportunities on EarlyShares.
