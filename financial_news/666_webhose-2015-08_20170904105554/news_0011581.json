They’ve been coming to us partly because of the innovation we have there, allowing them to open and fund an account within 15 minutes.” \nThe bank’s operating income grew by 42pc, but its costs only rose by 19pc, pushing its cost to income ratio down from 64pc to 53pc. \nMr Monks said the bank is targeting a ratio of less than 40pc by the end of 2017, which would make it far more efficient than the biggest banks in the sector . \nAldermore’s stock market flotation initially struggled, as tough market conditions forced it to cancel the initial public offering in October 2014. \nBut the float succeeded in March 2015, and the share price has risen 57pc since then. \nThe stock increased by 8pc on the publication of the results, which beat analysts’ forecasts by around 8pc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T20:19:33.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
