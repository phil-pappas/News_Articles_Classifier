Of 300 commercial airlines in the world, only 30 covered their cost of capital and only seven had an investment grade rating. Air New Zealand is among the top-three airlines in the world,\" was Luxon's warrior reply.\nMaybe Luxon just needed to pick on another Aussie airline after Air NZ's local partner, Borghetti's Virgin, promised to make a profit his year.\nJoyce, for his part, did not spend the day wimping​ out.\nHe was addressing a national delegates meeting of his other bete noir, the Australian Services Union.\nHaven't they had some lovely things to say about the Qantas boss, and his immediate underlings, over the years.\nNagging doubts Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett is not backing Mark Latham , OK? In his latest scribble for the Murdoch press, he just defends Latham's right to be Mark Latham.\n\"If you don't like Latham – indeed, if you don't like me, or anyone else – switch off, turn the page. That is your right,\" Kennett said.\n\"I simply defend his right to express his views. And in our increasingly bland society, he is never boring.\"\nLatham's inability to be boring has cost him jobs outside of the media sector even before the latest implosion.\nThis time last year, the boards of Thoroughbred Breeders Australia and Aushorse​ Marketing, overlooked our former Labor leader as the chief executive of both bodies in favour of CBD colleague Tom Reilly .\nWaugh's pitch While the Australian cricket team was getting cremated on English soil, Steve Waugh was busy with a different pitch.\nThe cricketing legend and former Australian of the Year is an investor in nTouch​, a Melbourne-based \"proximity marketing\" startup, which has agreed to be acquired by ASX-listed anti-counterfeiting group YPB for $4.5 million worth of shares.\nnTouch​ were a little shy about revealing just how much of an interest Waugh has in the operation.\nNew Jobs Former Telstra boss David Thodey really knows how to pick the plum roles.\nHe has now signed on as the man charged by NSW Premier Mike Baird with helping to create 150,000 new jobs over the next four years as the chair of Jobs for NSW.\nGiven the skill with which he shed employees at Telstra, they must figure it's as easy as reversing gears.\nThodey didn't seem phased either.\n\"I'm excited to lead the Jobs for NSW board and for the opportunity to work with the NSW government to deliver jobs across the state,\" he said.\nThe press release did not make it clear whether his new job will count towards the 150,000 target.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-27T05:34:51.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
