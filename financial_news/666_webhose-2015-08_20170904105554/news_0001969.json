Higher U.S. interest rates would increase the opportunity cost of holding gold, an asset that does not earn interest\n“The impression of uncertainty reflects on the prices of gold,” Khosla added. “Right now everybody seems to think the problems of the world have been sorted out. So there is no risk (to drive up gold prices).”\nGold is typically regarded as a good investment in times of financial and economic uncertainty.\nIn volume terms, the country’s imports in 2015/16 are likely to be between 900 and 1,000 tonnes as lower prices will boost demand during the festive season at the end of the year, Khosla said.\nDemand for gold jewellery is usually robust in India in the last quarter as it celebrate festivals such as Diwali and Dussehra when buying gold is considered auspicious.\nIndia’s July imports are expected to be between 70 and 75 tonnes, up from 57 tonnes in June, Khosla said.\n“Imports in August would be higher than July. Jewellers are stocking up for the festive season,” he said.\n 05, 2015 7:28 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-06T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-06T05:17:42.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
