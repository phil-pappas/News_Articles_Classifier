He then transports the milk to Gaborone where most of his loyal customers are. He advises his customers to refrigerate the milk after buying it so that it stays for 15 days without going bad. \nMr Vasagie currently has 15 female donkeys and 11 employees. \nHis dream is to have over 2 000 donkeys so that he can supply the country with donkey milk and have enough surplus for export. \nHe has two stalls in the main mall in Gaborone, one in front of the labour office, another in Tlokweng at Zamalek Shopping Complex and one at the Gaborone Bus Rank. He says demand is steadily increasing. Mr Vasagie has two employees who milk the donkeys, which are given a special diet. He then packages the milk into 250ml bottles. \nHe says besides moisturizing the skin, the milk provides relief from asthma, hypertension and diabetes. \nHe says his family and his customers can testify about the goodness of donkey milk. \nHe hopes to diversify his product with donkey meat sales on a large scale in the future. \nMs Christina Stegling, a resident of Kanye who has been drinking donkey milk almost every day since December 2014, says it helps her stay energetic throughout the day. \n\"The milk is also generally good and tastes great,\" she chuckles. \nShe says it also gives her relief from hypertension. \nSource : BOPA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-10T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-10T14:57:43.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
