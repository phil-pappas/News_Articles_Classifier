The bank currently has a loan book of 582bn/- out of which 291bn/- is financed to the SME sector. \nMr Ponda said that the bank sees an enormous potential for credit assistance to this segment on the backdrop of sustained high economic growth in the Country. \nHe said that Exim Bank has for more than a decade, maintained strong relations with other leading International Development financing institutions (DFIs) like IFC, PROPARCO, NORFUND and FMO. \n\"Signing this loan agreement with DEG asserts the confidence of these International DFIs on this 'largest Local Tanzanian bank', said Mr Ponda. DEG is a subsidiary of KfW, a German government-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt. \nDEG finances investments of private companies in developing and transitioning countries. It has been active in East Africa since 1962, and runs its own representative office in Nairobi. \nThe current portfolio in East Africa covers a financing volume of over EUR 220 Million. \"DEG is proud to be financing the EXIM BANK SME portfolio. \nThe loan facility will support the further development of the small and medium-size business segment across Tanzania and help to address a major constraint to economic growth\", said Ms Gudrun Busch, Director of Financial Institutions Africa and Latin America at DEG. \nMs Busch added that \"In doing so, we contribute to strengthening the Tanzanian financial sector and to creating and safeguarding jobs.\" \nMr Ponda said Exim Bank is continuously improving its services and operational efficiency to meet its customer's needs, while following market trends very closely to remain competitive and meet ever changing diversified financial needs of its customers. \n\"We have expanded our branch network to 30 outlets in Tanzania with a strategic plan to add 3 more during this year. \nThis will help us to further improving upon serving the under-banked bankable target segment in the country. The bank has set an ambitious medium term vision to be the 'Leader in Payments'.
