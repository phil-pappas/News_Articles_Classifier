The low inflation environment is expected to continue for some time yet, with wages likely to remain fairly suppressed as US companies do whatever it takes to compete with their foreign peers,\" he added. \nOn Greece, lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house have approved the 86 billion euro rescue by 454 votes to 113. \nAs Europe's biggest economy and contributor to Greek aid, Germany plays a key role in the emergency package approved also by eurozone finance ministers (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-19T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-19T15:51:55.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
