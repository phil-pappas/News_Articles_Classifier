AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb issued a last-ditch appeal for international economic leadership from the Obama administration, warning that unless the United States unshackles barriers protecting its dairy and sugar sectors, a planned Pacific Rim trade and investment accord may be tossed on the back burner for years.\nTrade negotiators from 12 Trans-Pacific Partnership countries meeting in Hawaii were set to meet late into the night to try to break an impasse ahead of Friday's scheduled deadline to seal a deal.\nPressure was mounting on the US from Australia, New Zealand and other TPP members to provide genuine market access for agriculture, instead of small token offers. US multi-nationals Coca-Cola and Kellogs via the US Sweetener Users Association backed Australia's push to export more sugar to the US.\nDairy tariffs and quotas were shaping as the key domino required to fall for the TPP to reach a conclusion, with the four key players, the US, Canada, Japan and Mexico, engaged in a standoff over dairy that Mr Robb described as the \"elephant in the room\".\n\"I think the US can and should provide the leadership and that will push the others,\" Mr Robb told The Australian Financial Review from Hawaii on Thursday.\nAn industry representative on the sidelines of the meeting described the situation as \"downbeat but not hopeless\". Mr Robb estimated there was an 80 per cent chance of a deal before the weekend.\nTime was running out for the politically-sensitive trade deal to be signed because of an October election in Canada and US congressional and presidential elections next year. Political leaders in both North American countries are facing growing pressure from anti free trade opponents, including trade unions, environmental activists, dairy farmers and sugar growers.\n\"If we all leave here without a deal it doesn't augur well with the politics,\" Mr Robb said.\n \"To say we will come back in two years...if you don't grab a deal while it's there, it's amazing how many of them don't come back.\"\nThe US on Thursday tabled two low-ball propositions on improved market access for Queensland sugar growers that Mr Robb and the local industry deemed as \"not satisfactory\".\nTalks between the 12 countries were continuing after AFR Weekend's Friday evening deadline.\nThe 12 TPP countries representing 40 per cent of the global economy are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the US and Vietnam.\nThe US is spearheading the TPP as part of its \"rebalance\" to Asia, to tap into the fast growing economic region and to counteract China's rising influence.\nMinisters are trying to resolve dozens of other technical issues on a diverse range of issues, including intellectual property rights for US drug and technology firms, market access for farmers and car makers, investment protection clauses and rules for state-owned enterprises, labour conditions and environmental standards.\nThe US continues to pressure Australia to extend the patent length on medicines known as biologics for up to 12 years, in a bid to boost the profits of big US pharmaceutical firms. Australia has a \"red line\" of five years and would not jeopardise the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Mr Robb said.\nMr Robb is also holding firm against demands to relent on footnotes Australia wants included in the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) chapter, to safeguard the environment and public healthcare.\nAn ISDS is an international arbitration procedure giving a foreign investor the right to sue a foreign government over a law, regulation or court ruling.\nAt the heart of the dairy market access fight is a standoff between the US and Canada. The US rejected Canada's initial offer to allow more US butter, cheese and milk to be sold across the northern border, regarding it as inadequate market access. The US is unlikely to open up its dairy market to Australia and New Zealand unless it is compensated by a better deal in Canada.\nThe US blindsided Australia and New Zealand on Wednesday, withdrew a long-standing offer to Australian and New Zealand dairy farmers to sell more cheese in the US.\n\"We're quite concerned that we might be left out of a deal,\" said Australian Dairy Farmers president Noel Campbell, who is on the island of Maui on the sidelines of the talks.\nThe Obama administration's trade representative, Mike Froman, is constrained from conditions set by members of Congress.\nSugar is again a bugbear for Australia, after the 2004 free trade agreement with the US infamously missed out on boosting the quota above 87,000 tonnes.\nLowball offers US negotiators had tabled two propositions to allow more Australian sugar to be sold in the US, but Mr Robb has deemed both as inadequate.\n\"It wasn't satisfactory, but there's movement,\" Mr Robb said. He is under pressure from Queensland National Party members to strike a better deal.\nPolitically connected US sugar growers, particularly in Florida, are running a concerted campaign to prevent any more sugar from Australia entering the US.\nAustralia has an ally in the form of the US Sweetener Users Association, which sent a letter to Mr Froman on Thursday urging him to push for commercially meaningful liberalisation of sugar trade between TPP member countries.\n\"The United States needs to grant Australia commercially meaningful access for sugar, in the same way that American negotiators are – properly – insisting that other TPP countries give market access for our exports,\" the SUA said.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial on Thursday labelled the US subsidy program as the \"Sugar Scandal\".\nThe US consumes about 11 million tonnes a year of sugar, and produces only about 8 million tonnes. The 3 million tonne gap is largely filled by Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Australia is pushing for the right to help meet the shortfall. The US was offering a much lower amount.\n\"I understand there's a large gap between the two numbers,\" said Warren Males, head of economics for CaneGrowers. He is in Maui on the sidelines of the talks.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/tpp_trade_hype/index.html", "http://www.wsj.com/article_email/the-sugar-scandal-1438212128-lMyQjAxMTE1NDM4MDYzMDAyWj", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-31T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-01T06:57:47.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
