Coupled with the six-month grace period, this means a start date of November 2. \nFailure to pay salaries on time, especially for blue collar workers, has been one of the biggest complaints voiced by rights groups against companies in the energy-rich Gulf state. \nA 2013 academic study, \"Portrait of Low-Income Migrants in Contemporary Qatar\", found that around a fifth of migrant workers were \"sometimes, rarely or never\" paid on time. \nThe WPS has been used by the government as proof of its commitment to reform, in response to furious criticism of Qatar's labour practices since the controversial decision to allow it to host football's biggest tournament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-18T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-18T20:17:23.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
