Here are five takeaways from Monday’s GDP data: \n#1: Slowdown in China Takes a Toll \nExports fell at an annualized rate of 16.5% in the April-June quarter, and businesses have cited slowing demand from China. According to the Japan External Trade Organization, a government affiliate, Japan’s exports to China fell 11% on year on a dollar basis in the first half of the year. The main drag was autos. Exports of passenger cars fell more than 30%, and those for auto parts fell over 20%, according to Jetro. \n#2: Consumers in Japan Aren’t Spending \nConsumption of households in Japan fell 3.1% on an annualized basis in the quarter. Consumer spending has yet to stage a sustained recovery since the national sales tax rose to 8% in April 2014 from 5%, in part because wages have yet to rise as quickly as prices. \n#3: One Step Forward, One Step Back \nGrowth in the first quarter of 2015 was revised upward to 4.5% on an annualized basis, following 1.4% annualized growth in the fourth quarter of 2014. But those two quarters of growth followed two quarters of contraction. In short, Japan has had trouble getting onto a consistent growth path. \n#4: A Positive Sign: Workers Are Getting More \nThe GDP data showed an upturn in employee compensation, the first in six quarters. Employee compensation, or the sum of wages paid to both regular and nonregular workers during the quarter, increased 0.7%. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pressing businesses to share with labor the fruits of their improved earnings, which are at all-time high levels. \n#5: Up Next: Talk of More Stimulus for Economy \nMonday’s figures weren’t a surprise, but they are likely to prompt more talk about what Mr. Abe’s government can do to prop up the economy. Among the ideas are an economic stimulus package worth $20 billion or more. The rise in corporate profits has pushed up tax revenue, but Japan still has a giant public debt that worries credit-rating agencies.
