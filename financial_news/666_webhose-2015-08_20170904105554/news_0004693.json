As discussed above, Madhu Chanda has used/passed information of the orders placed by clients of Sharekhan.

Further, Sharekhan Ltd is also liable for the undue gains made in its Proprietary Account through trades carried out through dealer, Anandilal.\" In addition, Sharekhan is asked to deposit Rs50.94 lakh in an escrow account within seven days.
