That figure was more than double the number scheduled for the same weekend last year when the Saturday fell on August 9.\nThe Carlingford apartment on 152sq m sold under the hammer for $740,000.\nSix parties registered to compete for the home with bidding starting at $650,000,\nAgent David Kim from Century 21 Total Real Estate Eastwood said the reserve was adjusted to $735,000 during the auction.\nThe buyer was a local Chinese who intended to use the property as an investment.\nMr Kim said the vendor wasn’t Chinese but had deliberately chosen today to sell their property.\n“Eight is a lucky number and has a very good meaning,” Mr Kim said.\nLucky August 8 auctions\n8 Shackel Ave, Kingsgrove Source: Supplied\nWhere: 8 Shackel Ave, Kingsgrove What: Four-bedroom house\nHow much: $1.19 million\nMedian suburb: $1,069,500\nAgent: Con Klironomos, Ray White Kingsgrove and Bexley North\n82 Thompson St, Drummoyne Source: Supplied\nWhere: 82 Thompson St, Drummoyne\nWhat: Five-bedroom house\nHow much: $2.0005 million\nMedian suburb: $1.58 million\nAgent: Chris Wilkins & Jessica Carbone, Ray White Drummoyne\n39 Terry Rd, Eastwood Source: Supplied\nWhere: 39 Terry Rd, Eastwood\nWhat: Three-bedroom house\nHow much: $1.88 million\nMedian suburb: $1.39 million\nAgent: Wayne Vaughan and Teena Vaughan, McGrath Epping\nIncrease ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece&h=Sellers+wins+on+lucky+%26%238216%3B8%26%238217%3B+day", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Sellers+wins+on+lucky+%26%238216%3B8%26%238217%3B+day&c=Seller+struck+gold+on+what+was+considered+to+be+a+lucky+day+for+Chinese+property+hunters.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece&title=Sellers+wins+on+lucky+%26%238216%3B8%26%238217%3B+day", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece&title=Sellers+wins+on+lucky+%26%238216%3B8%26%238217%3B+day", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/sellers-strike-gold-as-august-8-proves-to-be-a-lucky-day-for-sydney-property-market/story-fncq3era-1227475465953?sv=a4080c8caaf4a64cf511fb90d5aa8ece"], "published": "2015-08-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-09T13:39:53.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
