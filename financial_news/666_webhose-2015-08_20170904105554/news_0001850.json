The central bank last month limited importers' access to dollars on the official interbank market to buy a wide range of goods, in order to save its reserves. \nAfter the restrictions, importers bought dollars on the unofficial market and deposited them in their bank accounts for transfers abroad, Gwadabe said. \nThe restrictions have frustrated companies that need dollars for imports. The central bank has rejected the idea of loosening the curbs, saying it could not adopt an \"indeterminate policy\" of currency depreciation and that the naira was \"appropriately priced\" on the interbank market. \nGwadabe said there was excess liquidity of around $1 billion on the parallel market. \nWith Agency Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-08-04T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-08-04T16:18:59.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
